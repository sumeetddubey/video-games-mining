:::Review:::
The small-screen version of The Incredible Hulk won't make you feel like the world's angriest superhero, 
 but clever level design and tight controls make this the best Hulk game this year. 

  Trying to translate the unrelenting might of the Hulk on a portable system, even one with two screens, 
 is not an enviable task. So it comes as no surprise that The Incredible Hulk on the Nintendo DS 
 is a far different game than the console versions. The open-world chaos has been shrunk down to 
 a series of 30 confined levels, and Hulk's terrifying rage has been bottled up, turning his exploits 
 into a 2D platformer with only the occasional glimpse of the angry beast buried under that green 
 skin. Though the game fails to impress as a Hulk-smashing simulator, it is actually the strongest, 
 most imaginative game to bear his likeness this year. A variety of cleverly designed levels and 
 some challenging (though never cheap) obstacles make this title stand out on its own merits.  

 
  The story seems to exist merely as a way to emphasize that Hulk doesn't need motivation to smash 
 things. You're quickly whisked from Alaska to Brazil and, finally, America, with only a thin plot 
 linking these locations together. All you really need to know is that guys with guns and flamethrowers 
 are evil. It's never explained why Hulk is able to gracefully swim through coral reefs or why he 
 momentarily satiates his rage by destroying a downed satellite, but the baffling nature of each 
 encounter doesn't hinder the fun in the slightest. Do you really need an elaborate tale explaining 
 why you have to defeat the abominable snowman?  

           Who knew Hulk was such a talented swimmer?      

  Level design is the real star of 
 the show. Though the levels can usually be beaten in less than 10 minutes, they offer a lot of 
 variety during the course of the game. Some are linear, where you'll simply have to walk in one 
 direction until you find that elusive satellite dish. Other times you'll have to trek through a 
 labyrinth that spreads as far vertically as it does horizontally. There are levels that take place 
 underwater, forcing you to destroy coral to clear a path to the end, and others that take place 
 in a city, making you smash through buildings along the way. Other times you'll have to use vaults 
 to hurl yourself forward. It's an odd technique, but it spices up the action a lot. Flinging yourself 
 into a group of enemies or a well-constructed building is one of the few times in this game that 
 you'll truly feel like Hulk.  

  Your limited move set makes combat predictable, but smooth animation and sharp controls make sure 
 it never gets in the way. The primary method of dispatching enemies is with a simple punch. You 
 can charge this up by unleashing your anger, but that's not really necessary since most enemies 
 can be killed with one or two blows anyway. Jumping on enemies' heads is another -- much sillier -- method 
 of taking down foes. The only thing stranger than making Hulk swim is seeing him pull off his best 
 impersonation of Mario. The final method you can use to kill those who oppose you is to toss something 
 at them. Unfortunately, there aren't many objects scattered around, so you won't have many opportunities 
 to actually pull this off.  

  The Incredible Hulk also packs a surprising amount of challenge. Your expandable life bar allows 
 you to be hit up to seven times before you're forced to restart the level. Though the game starts 
 out with plenty of health packs to ensure you won't meet an untimely end, the later stages ask 
 you to go long stretches without healing yourself. Because the enemies are placed in an intelligent 
 manner, you will have to exert a lot of patience and precise jumping to make your way through to 
 the end. Thankfully, the game never feels cheap. Every time you're caught in a bomb blast or are 
 peppered by a chaingun, it's your fault. Sure, it isn't very Hulk-like to slowly creep through 
 a heavily populated area, but it makes for some satisfying platforming.  

           It's a shame there aren't more giant metal cubes to toss around.      

  The Incredible 
 Hulk can be finished in about five hours, but you can replay levels to find all the hidden unlockable 
 skins. After you see all the different versions of Hulk, though, there isn't any reason to go back. 
 The boss fights are simple and repetitive, needing only the vaguest hint of skill to conquer. Most 
 bosses have an attack/move/repeat pattern, making them extremely predictable and fairly boring. 
 The two-player mode is mildly fun, but because it requires two cartridges, most people won't be 
 able to take part. It's you versus a friend in a race to cause the most damage, but your limited 
 tools of destruction make this fun only in very small bursts.  

  Even though The Incredible Hulk doesn't let you really experience what it's like to be this supposed 
 superhero, its level design is enough to make you forget about your limited move set and stymied 
 rage. Unfortunately, the game isn't very long, there's little reason to play through a second time, 
 and the two-player mode is pretty forgettable. Still, even with its problems, this is the best 
 Hulk game coming out this year.

Review:  The Hulk has a game play that is addictive for about 20 minutes, then its just the same old stuff 
 over and over again!!!
  With some cool, but osme weirdly odd unlockables, and some repetitive stages, The Hulk is a great 
 game for short breaks or short trios, but when you start getting bored of the annoying, repetitive 
 game play, make sure you have some other game in you pocket to play!

  The Incredible Hulk is interesting for about 20-40 minutes, and after that (if you're not already 
 done most of the game) , then you play only to finish the game, not for the entertainment part. 
 It is definitely a game worth renting or checking out, but I would think twice before buying it!!!
