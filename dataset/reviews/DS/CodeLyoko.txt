:::Review:::
Code Lyoko for the DS is a straightforward trek aimed at the show's younger fans. 

   Code Lyoko  is a French-made animated series that has gained some popularity in North America 
 thanks to a stint on the Cartoon Network. The show hasn't exploded like  Digimon  or  Ben 10 , 
 but it has amassed enough of a following for Game Factory to produce a video game based on the 
 series for the Nintendo DS. It employs a mixture of 2D point-and-click adventure levels and 3D 
 action levels to guide players through a hands-on retelling of the show's first three seasons. 
 Younger fans of the show will likely enjoy watching the story gradually unfold as they constantly 
 use the characters' superpowers to fight monsters in Lyoko's virtual world. However, the game's 
 sluggish pace, repetitive combat, and straightforward puzzles guarantee that older or experienced 
 players will lose interest long before the story reaches its conclusion.  

          Hand-drawn artwork aside, you'll feel like you're being dragged from one spot to the next 
 by the story's leash.     

  If you're not familiar with the show, all you really need to know is that it follows the exploits 
 of four boarding-school students who make frequent trips into a virtual world called Lyoko to battle 
 monsters unleashed by an evil digital entity known as X. A. N. A. In the real world, the kids go to 
 class, hang out, and get into the typical sort of mischief that kids do. In the virtual world, 
 they use their enhanced strength and special abilities to blast monsters or navigate the high-tech 
 obstacle courses that lead to X. A. N. A's towers. Just like the show, some events in the game take 
 place in the real world and some take place in the virtual world. Each of the 15 chapters is split 
 into two portions. One portion is a PC-style 2D point-and-click adventure, where you take control 
 of one of the characters to visit different locations, talk to people, gather items, and generally 
 watch the story unfold. The other portion is a 3D action level where you swap among characters 
 and use their abilities to fight monsters, hop between platforms, or climb up hillsides in search 
 of the tower that'll put and end to whatever problem is currently pestering the real world.  

 
  Aesthetically, the game is a treat. The hand-drawn artwork in the real-world levels provides a 
 nice contrast to the 3D structures and monsters in the virtual-world levels. From a technical perspective, 
 the 3D worlds are large, while the engine has no trouble pushing all of the textured polygons for 
 the characters, enemies, and terrain without a hint of slowdown. There aren't many sound effects 
 to accompany the action -- just a few laser blasts -- but that's not a huge deal because there's a 
 smorgasbord of music that varies from soothing to upbeat to match the situation. The controls are 
 also friendly; they jibe with the dualism that the game and the show are trying to convey. In the 
 real-world levels, you use the D pad to move the active character around and tap the touch screen 
 to interact with people or pick up objects. In the virtual world, you'll find yourself primarily 
 tapping the buttons to attack enemies and activate your shields, only using the touch screen to 
 occasionally change characters or activate special abilities.  

  After you've gone back and forth between the real world and Lyoko a couple times, the allure of 
 the different art styles wears off. You'll also start to realize that the game is constantly holding 
 your hand and asking you to repeatedly do the same things. The pace in the real-world portions 
 is slow with zero mystery because the map always shows you exactly where to go and what areas to 
 search. Going from point A to point B and various points in between just to see a couple lines 
 of dialogue gets old fast, especially when every subsequent story segment takes longer to play 
 out than the one before. But in the 3D action levels, it's nice that each character has a unique 
 set of attacks. For example, Ulrich and Odd feel like two very different characters because one 
 uses swords, while the other uses a laser crossbow. There are also some tricky sections involving 
 moving platforms.  

          The 3D levels look sharp. It's too bad the combat is repetitive button mashing.     

 
  Unfortunately, those tricky platforms are the only lively aspect of the 3D levels. Enemies spawn 
 at predictable intervals and generally just sit there while you carve them up. Occasionally, you'll 
 find yourself blocked by an obstacle that necessitates the use of a specific character's ability. 
 That's a nice gimmick, but going back to a checkpoint for no reason other than to change characters 
 just so you can run fast, lift a tree stump, or climb up a hill seems like a big waste of time. 
 The developer tried to mix things up with touch-screen puzzles and a few vehicle-based levels. 
 However, they're way too easy and also come across as a waste of time.  

  It takes about 10 hours to get through roughly 40 levels and 15 chapters while the game holds your 
 hand the whole way through. Younger players probably won't mind the repetition and hand-holding, 
 but if you're old enough to be surfing the Internet to read this review, you're probably too old 
 to enjoy what the Nintendo DS's rendition of Code Lyoko has to offer.

Review:  Code Lyoko: Quest For Infinity - Review
  -------------------------------------------------------
  -------------------------------------------------------
 
  
  The game has a very interesting storyline, apart from just being a game it is sort of like a helper 
 to anyone who wants to start following Code Lyoko because it follows the exact storyline of the 
 muchly popular television show.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  The graphics in the game are extremely good for a Nintendo DS game, since some DS game graphics 
 can be fuzzy or some DS games that follow T. V. shows don't look anything like the characters there 
 supposed to be.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  
  The game has 2 different styles of gameplay the '2D' world and the '3D' world of Lyoko, although 
 the '3D' levels are fun and interesting the '2D' levels can become a little boring at times.
  
  Overall i would give:
  
  Grapcics: 8.5/10
  
  Actual Gameplay: 8.8/10
  
  Fun To 
 Play: 9/10

Review:  The story revolves around a group of students who split their time between school and the virtual 
 world of Lyoko. This digital world is now being threatened by X. A. N. A, an evil program of sorts 
 who not only wants to take over Lyoko, but also the real world, so it's up to the four friends 
 to stop it. It's like The Matrix, for kids!
  
  The gameplay can't be really classified into a single genre. Code Lyoko is very diverse and offers 
 different styles that integrate well with one another. In the real world, you have a 2D adventure 
 where you explore, find items and talk to people to learn more about the story. The action happens 
 on the touch screen, while your top screen shows you the area map and where you need to be going 
 by tapping the trigger buttons.
  
  In the Lyoko world, gameplay switches to a 3D platformer. To navigate these stages you switch between 
 characters as needed at the given checkpoints, since each has their own special ability. 
  
  Ulrich can attack with a sword and dash, Aelita can levitate but can't attack at all, Yumi 
 fights with fans and can move objects with telekinesis, and Odd specializes in ranged attacks and 
 climbing. Your characters abilities can also be improved by purchasing upgrades and combo attacks 
 with the blue data bits that you find all over. 
  
  
  In some areas, you will be locked in between firewalls (red barriers) and will need to destroy 
 all the enemies that appear before you can continue. Combat is simple enough, one button to attack, 
 one to block, and another to do a special charge attack. Enemies will drop healing, energy and 
 currency bits when defeated. You will also find moving platforms and switches in your way, and 
 the level designs get more complex as you progress.
  
  The goal of each of these stages is to reach a tower, and inside you must solve a puzzle to hack 
 into it. This mini-game is fairly simple. You are given a grid and a series of pieces. You don't 
 have to use all the pieces available, but fill the entire grid with simple touch and drag controls.
 
  
  So we've covered adventure, platform and puzzle, but there is still another genre in the game: 
 racing. A different type of racing though, since the objective is to survive and not arrive in 
 first place. If you hit an obstacle, you are taken to the last checkpoint you passed and go on 
 from there.
  
  Graphically, the game looks good, from the 2D drawn backgrounds in soft colors to the colorful 
 3D environments and cutscenes in Lyoko. The sound effects are ok, and the music varies according 
 to tdifferent gameplay styles he stages, setting the mood for the different occasions.
  
  The great thing about Code Lyoko is that none of the levels is too long that you end up getting 
 tired of it. The different gameplay styles and ability to play as different characters with different 
 abilities ensure the experience stays fresh throughout the adventure. 
  
  With plenty of different elements, Code Lyoko surely has enough to attract all sorts of gamers.

Review:  got code lyoko on august 11th and just like gamespot or some other site said it only last about 
 ten hours. i beat the story in about 2-4 sit downs. no real cheats and story is a little bit fudged. 
 levels don't seem like a real game and since u can't save at a spot or anywhere of ur choice in 
 ur game it seems like u either have to go on or u just turn it off knowing that u'll be have to 
 start at the begining of the level. it seemed stupid to put in videos of the 3-d world when the 
 3d world cutscences have better graphics then the graphics during lyoko gameplay. if u look at 
 a gamespot image of the game u'll think wow! that looks really good. but gamespot has some weird 
 camera that makes games look better or worse. in code lyoko the 3d graphics seemed a bit odd to 
 be honest. to me it would have done better on the gba since touchscreen is used for such simplistic 
 controls. in the real world u use the tocuhscreen to click and move to clicked destination. map 
 rlly is screwed up to tell u. u really can't trust it as u might have to go right in ur quest when 
 the map says go left. in the 3d world of lyoko there r few moments when u use the touchscreen. 
 u use it when clicking to restore life to urself, or power to use special a special move. while 
 traveling lyoko u will see icons like a single hand, paw, feet, or two hands. when this happpens 
 the character will gain area to acces by flyinf above ground, running at a super speed, climbing, 
 or lifting objects with ur mind. seems cool but really most of the time when u move objects with 
 ur mind u think instead of going past this log and putting it back down maybe i can throw it out 
 of the way. news is u can't. with super speed u wonder
  
  can i use this in battle scenario? which is another no. with climbing u wonder?
  
  can't super 
 speed or telekinis move me up or let me run to the top? 
  
  basic attacks r done with a or x. shield move is used with b. and a special attack that forces 
 you to stay in place and take a bit of time to exectue while ur opponent is given the opprutunity 
 to run. battle scenario was fun and all. yet only rela fun part was the evil sowrdsman and that 
 last boss. unfortunatley camera view is usually a 180
  
  also combos r fun to tinker with yet really they make destroy the enemy too easy which in some 
 points r a good thing but destroy the challenge. sometimes combos can't be executed because a simple 
 shot that doesn't paralize u or knock u off place. some combos don't seem very useful and some 
 just r difficult to control or aim. doing them is a breeze.
  
  only like two or three bosses. other than that it is just monster that can be destroy in one-3 
 combos. yet bosses take at least 30-40 yet it's not really hard to live. in fact if u get destroyed 
 all u need to do to restarted at a good checkpoint is paying a hundred lyoko points (money) . also 
 music can get annoying at some points when u r fighting or traveling. the desert had a stupid alladin 
 song. dividing the game into chapters and dividing chapters into levels makes it seem like a mario 
 game on the nes. some monsters r too easy and some monsters r just to damn annoying like those 
 bees that can avoid hit too easily.
  
  only real unlockable was hacking mode (puzzles with computer nerd theme) . puzzles actually do take 
 some brain power and can be done in 4-10 sitdowns. i am not a pro gamer but tell u this. if u just 
 want a short game that doesn't make u preoccupied for a few months, weeks, days, and for pro, hours 
 this is the crappy game.

Review:  This game was a BIG dissapointment!
  As a fan of the tv show I had been waiting for what seemed like decades for this game to come out!
 
  But when I finaly got my hands on a copy of the game!
  It was NOTHING like I had excepted!
  The game goes along with the 1st and 2nd seasons of Code 
 Lyoko!
  And can be a drag because we already know what happens in it!
  before we win it!
  But on the other hand it lets you play out the parts of the season and to some people it can be 
 enjoyable!
  The game does belive it or not acculty skips around on some parts!
  The game be preaty challenging on most of it!
  And you barly get to spend any time in the real 
 world on the game!
  Your manly always on Lyoko!
  Bottom line~ this game is not all that bad
  if your a die hard fan of the show then I recommend 
 geting it,
  but if your not then don't even bother with this game!

Review:  Now, I'm a fan of the show mind you, and when I stumbled around and saw that this was released, 
 I jumped at the chance to get my paws on it. I was impressed, but not as impressed as I had hoped.
 
  
  2-D World:
  
  Ok, so basiclly in the real world, you go around triggering certain events or going to a certain 
 place in a fetch-quest. The usual. The first few minutes of the game, particually in the tutorial, 
 I found myself lost on the campus. The map was rather hard to understand at first, but after getting 
 into the game further (and restarting the level) I managed to find my way around. Just like a freshman...*cough* 
 The thing I enjoyed about this part of the gameplay was that it almost mimicked that of a PC game 
 graphic wise. That just made me smirk. :D
  
  3-D World:
  
  XANA launches an attack, so we're whisked away to Lyoko. Lyoko had a lot of challenges, and I generally 
 welcomed them. The battles were fun, and I did enjoy having the ability to choose any of the 4 
 Lyoko Warriors (when they were available) , but that didn't really make up for the camera angles. 
 Often I found myself falling off a cliff while backtracking because I couldn't see what I was walking 
 into, and that caused me to get a bit annoyed. Aside from that, Lyoko was a fun place to walk around, 
 and the graphics were just incredible. Sure, they were DS graphics, but compared to some other 
 3-D games (That's right. I'm looking at you, Spectrobes) they were spot on.
  
  Other:
  
  Other things that fit into both categories, such as the hacking part of the game, are being 
 discussed now. Hacking at the terminals or from Jeremie's computer was a fun and challenging mind-game. 
 They are in the form of puzzles, and you fit each piece together in a grid to complete it. Some 
 were just common sense, while others had you stumped. I found myself trying numerous combinations, 
 only to smack myself in the head when I move a piece into a place that reveals the rest of the 
 puzzle, rendering the 2 minutes I spent a waste of time. (Not saying that was a bad thing...) The 
 themes from the show were also present, which made me smile, and I often paused the game during 
 battle just to listen to a re-mixed track. The inclusion if videos helped move the plot along, 
 but since they were directly from the show, and their terrain didn't exactly match the game, it 
 creates a bit of an inconsistency...
  
  Alrighty, so the verdict is in: The DS version of 3 and a quarter seasons of CL in my opinion was 
 a success. Sure, it can be completed in a day or so, but it has a good amount of toughness to back 
 it up. So, avid fans or anyone who is new to the series can enjoy this.

Review:  Code Lyoko is not a bad game by any means. The basic story is ripped directly from the cartoon. 
 Your a group of high school students that find a super computer. The super computer has a virtual 
 world on it called Lyoko. But the computer has an evil program called XANA that keeps trying to 
 end the world. Only the girl in the virtual world can stop it.... with the help of the students 
 of course.
  
  Their are 5 playable characters and you have to switch them pretty regularly.
  The controls are 
 fairly simple and the tutorial does a good job explaining them .
  
  The camera is fixed but it is, for the most, part very well done. I found going back on a path 
 in Lyoko to be rather tedious but you can get over of it. The level desine is pretty good. The 
 school grounds are big and I got lost during chapters 1-3 but I eventualy memorized them. Lyoko 
 has 5 sectors desert, forest, ice, mountain and sector 5 (digital) . Lyoko levels are HUGE taking 
 about 15 mineuts to finish.
  The game takes about 6 hours to beat, good for a hand-held I think.
  
  the graphics are decent 
 nothing really to complain about.
  
  overall I found the game to be enjoyable but not worth a pickup until it's $20 unless you are a 
 fan of the show.

Review:  I've always been a big fan of the show so of course I was extremely pumped to know that a Code 
 Lyoko game would be released. The game play is nothing extraordinary. In the real world, simple 
 tasks are issued to go here on the map. Most of the characters do not talk to you in the real world. 
 After you get to your destination an attack occurs by XANA in which you are plunged into the super 
 computer. There you battle your way through monsters on a very linear path towards the tower to 
 deactivate XANA. On the way you may only use one character at a time, and switch the characters 
 only at selected points. Each character possess a special ability that allows access to areas further 
 in the game and also has a block and 2 attack moves. There are a few RPG elements to the game. 
 After killing the enemies (you have to kill them to move on) points are awarded. These points can 
 be spent on download upgrades that upgrade defense, strength or add skills or new moves. The game 
 progress through 15 chapters. If you quit in the middle of a chapter it does not save your progress. 
 The graphics are well done and mimic the show quite well. The sound has a few too many repeats 
 but did not distract from the game play. The story is descent but that is because it's based off 
 the TV show. Hardcore fans will be disappointed by the lack of chapters and skips in the story. 
 If you enjoy the show, you may like this game.
