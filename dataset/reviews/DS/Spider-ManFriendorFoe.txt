:::Review:::
Slick production values and cooperative play distinguish this beat-'em-up from the rest of the pack. 
 

  In Spider-Man: Friend or Foe, a mysterious villain is terrorizing the world with robots infused 
 with symbiote goo taken from the meteor that brought Venom to Earth. To make matters worse, he's 
 also slipped some of Spidey's most dangerous adversaries a mickey, transforming them into his loyal 
 henchmen. So, in this 3D beat-'em-up for the Nintendo DS, your job is to knock some sense into 
 the zombified bad guys, locate this new villain, and thrash hundreds of robots along the way.  
 

  The game itself is your typical beat-'em-up. Good old Nick Fury, the bossy commander of S. H. I. E. L. D., 
 sends Spidey from one level to the next. In those levels, you have to free hostages, deactivate 
 bombs, and beat the living daylights out of the groups of robots that appear at regular intervals. 
 A few security minigames involving the touch screen serve to break up the monotony, as do boss 
 battles featuring such familiar adversaries as Doctor Octopus and Sandman. Spidey can swing through 
 the air, climb up walls, and use his webbing to snare or swat enemies. But you'll mainly find yourself 
 mashing the punch and kick buttons to unleash the combinations that will get those pesky robots 
 out of your face. A handy collection of power-up items, such as damage doublers and health kits, 
 also help you out along the way.  

           In many stages, rooftops are shown on the upper screen while street level is displayed 
 on the lower screen.      

  One way the game distinguishes itself from all of the other comic-based beat-'em-ups we've seen 
 on the DS is with its cooperative nature. When you play solo, there's a computer-controlled sidekick 
 helping you out. Early on, it's Black Cat. Once you wake the bosses out of their stupors, though, 
 you'll be trading blows alongside the likes of Doc Ock, Green Goblin, Blade, Sandman, and Venom. 
 There's even a multiplayer option that lets you play through individual levels or the entire story 
 with any of your friends who happen to own the game. One of you controls Spider-Man, while the 
 other controls the sidekick of your choice.  

  It also doesn't hurt that the presentation is solid. The 3D environments depict buildings and streets 
 located in such places as New York, Tokyo, and Paris. They exhibit a good amount of detail, including 
 boxes and trashcans that you can break, as well as give you plenty of space to wander. Often, doorways 
 and rooftops lead to secret areas containing stashes of coins or items. A particularly sweet aspect 
 is the way the environment is split logically between the two screens. When you're at street level 
 or underground, the characters occupy the lower screen. However, if you walk up some stairs or 
 crawl up a wall, the view will switch to the upper screen. As for the characters, they're modeled 
 on their Marvel Ultimate designs and pack enough texture-mapped polygons to be easily recognizable. 
 A few attacks play out choppily, but, for the most part, the animation is smooth. The audio is 
 a generic mix of dramatic music and fisticuff sound effects, though there are a few voice comments. 
 Furthermore, the story scenes that appear between levels employ lengthy spans of recorded dialogue. 

  Besides the main story mode, which takes about five hours to complete, you have the option of enjoying 
 your favorite red wallcrawler in small doses through the free play, survival, and boss battle modes. 
 The repetitive nature of combat may not entice you to spend a ton of time playing these modes, 
 but it's nice to have a choice, especially because you can opt to play as whichever character you 
 like. It's worth mentioning that playing cooperatively with another player is much more involving 
 than playing with a CPU sidekick that's not programmed to tag team the bad guys. For that reason, 
 if you can manage to link up with a friend, you'll both have more fun and get more out of your 
 purchases.  

  Although Spider-Man: Friend or Foe doesn't offer anything above and beyond what you've seen in 
 similar games, it does present all of the usual beat-'em-up staples in satisfying fashion. Comic 
 book fans that simply want to kick some butt and admire their favorite spandex-clad superhero in 
 the process will enjoy this one.

Review:  spider-man friend or foe is a good game where you play as spider-man and try to stop the villains 
 and save the city. There are three modes in this game. there is story mode, free play mode and multiplayer 
 mode. In story mode, the story starts off with spider-man looking down at people. Then soon Doc 
 Ock, Green Goblin, Sandman and Venom start attacking spider-man. Soon after new creatures start 
 not only attacking spider-man but also the villains! Soon everybody is teleported, but we only 
 know that spider-man is teleported inside the S. H. I. E. L. D. Helicarrier. S. H. I. E. L. D. needs spider-man 
 help to retrieve meteorites that are scattered everywhere on the planet and may be they hold secrets 
 to these new creatures. While searching for them he'll be working with friends and foes! In free 
 play mode you can redo a level that you've already done with any sidekick. You can unlock sidekicks 
 in the web shop. In multiplayer mode you can link up with a friend and play either story mode or 
 free play mode. Spider-man fans are going to like this game for sure!

Review:  I bought this game for the cheap price of $20 and i want my money back. This game sucks balls!!!!!!!!! 
 I mean when i first played story mode and saw that 3D cutscene at the start, i thought wow, the 
 games cutscene graphics are amazing, but it was just that cutscene, it was gay, and then in some 
 of the dialogue scenes they try to be all like Metal Gear Solid by putting the character sprites, 
 the dialogue the same and AHHHHHHHHHH this game is just so frustrating!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean really, 
 the game shows New Goblin in the cut scene but you cant even play as him, thats crap. and when 
 did Venom, Green Goblin, Doc Ock, and Sandman ever become Spider Man's little playmates??????? 
 There suppossed to be mortal enemies!!!! The only character i find cool to play as is Blade. Now, 
 dont get me wrong, the other DS Spider Man games i found quite enjoyable and addicting, all this 
 game is beating the crap out of one enemy after another for 2 hours, thats how short the game is. 
 You even have to buy the villains to play them in "Free Play mode" OMG. They just give you an excuse 
 to play the short 10 levels over and over and over and over and over again. I mean, you only use 
 Black Suite spider man in one level, and you cant even unlock it in free play mode. Also the minigames 
 are really gay. Now, they try to be all cool by putting a survival mode and boss battle mode in, 
 CRAP CRAP CRAP, thats all this game is. The only thing good i can say about this game is the voice 
 acting. Also, Spider Man can only do a web swing once at a time in midair. Thats the thing i loved 
 so much from Spider Man 3, swinging through the city was so fun and enjoyable, this place takes 
 you around the world, its gay!!!!!!!!!!! You cant even die!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All i have to say is this 
 game sucks so dont waste your

Review:  I know that this game is for younger kids, but it has the hero which everyone loves, the amazing 
 SPIDER-MAN. The graphics are fine, excellent for a DS, I was expecting to be crap. The sound it 
 is MARVELous. I love games which have great sounds. The controls are easy to manage them, maybe 
 to easy. The plot is a little bit strange. I mean the thing when your enemies become your allies. The 
 difficulty is pretty easy, I was expecting a little bit difficult, because I like the games which 
 are difficult. This game impressed me, I am so happy that I bought it. Thanks to my friend who 
 told me about this game. The conclusion is that this game is ace, 9 out of 10. (first time I was 
 thinking at 8/10) . If you are wondering why I gave 9 to this game, even that it has some problems, 
 is that they are minor problems.

Review:  Yesterday, I eagerly went to Best Buy and picked up my own copy of Spider-Man: Friend or Foe. When 
 I got home and ripped open the package, I knew I was going to enjoy it. I did.
  
  PROS:
  You get to be 6 bad and good guys besides Spider-Man**The first Spider-Man game to not have too 
 much side-scrolling**Pretty good combat system**Amazingly good dialogue**Very nice graphics**Great 
 co-op**A change from past Spidey games as it focuses more on the action instead of everything else**You 
 go to exotic locations**Having an allie with you and being able to switch with them on the fly 
 is useful and fun
  
  CONS:
  Some of the characters, like Iron Fist and the New Goblin, aren't playable here**Frame rate slightly 
 slow**A few more minigames would've been nice**Other characters just aren't as fun to play as Spider-Man**Not 
 as lengthly as Spider-Man 3**You can't use DS Download Play to play with someone who dosn't have 
 a copy**CPU controlled aliies don't always pitch in
  
  Ok, now you may be wondering, How can a game get an 8 if it has so many problems? The answer to 
 that is that most of its problems are so minor you can't notice them when you beating the heck 
 out of Sandman.
  
  So, anyone who is an action-games fan will get a giagantic kick out of this. I know I did.

Review:  The all over game was alright, despite good gameplay, it is short and i completed it in three hours. 
 The graphics are very good for the ds and i enjoyed playing the game. The music was alright it 
 was diverse and somewhat not annoying. The thought of the web store, I think, was a good thing 
 to drive gamers to get all the upgrades and sidekick characters. If they would have given it a 
 little longer and possibly better story line it would have been an a plus game. If you are into 
 spiderman then it is to be at least considered to be added to your collection.

Review:  This is game is good but if it was longer it would of been great. In this game you get to play 
 as a range of super heroes and super villians. Which i find is really good because you don't have 
 to be all the normal super heroes
  instead you get to play as super heroes and super villians. This game is extremelly short in fact 
 this game took me 4 hours to finish. All the charactrs in this game can kick punch and do some 
 different special moves.
  
  Gameplay: 8
  This games gameplay is great. This game has some great puzzles and some great fighting.
  
  
 Graphics: 8
  The graphics in this game are great for the DS. They are nice and clear.
  
  Sound: 9
  This games sound is superb. The music is superb and every other sound is superb.
 
  
  Value: 4
  The value in this game lets down every other aspect of the game. Like i said before this game only 
 took me 4 hours but once you finish the game you can do any level you like with any character.
 
  
  Overall: 7.2
  Overall this is a good game that has great gameplay great graphics superb sound but poor value.

Review:  The display name pretty much says it all. I mean the game is short, crappy, boring, and it doesn't 
 have variety..... The gameplay is bad I mean there are like only 4 different special attacks and 
 there isnt even a lock-on feature which sucks because attacks do miss alot which also means when 
 your helplessly attacking the air your enemies are attacking you but it really doesn't matter because 
 if your hp runs out your just going to recover in like in 3 seconds. When it comes to your partner 
 they are a little bit useful but in the level they'll only beat like 3 or 4 enemies out of like 
 15-20. The sound is ok but some of the sounds are not traditional Spider-man games sounds but the 
 incredible voice acting makes up for it. The voice acting is like a mix of Ultimate Spider-man 
 and Ultimate Alliance which is a very good thing. The graphics are pretty good I mean the opening 
 cinematic looks like if it's from gamecube or something. The enviroments are alright as well as 
 the character models and items but I personally feel that it could've been a little better but 
 I'm not going to compare graphics since I don't like doing that.
  
  The replay value depends if you want to continue getting coins to buy the unlockable things which 
 I recomend you do since the game is awfully short. It's probably like 4 or 5 hours long but maybe 
 it's shorter but that's just at my pace. There are a few other modes that are a little bit interesting 
 such as survival, mini games, boss battles, and free play. I personally think only survival is good 
 but it can also be sort of tiring because all you do is verse many enemies until your hp runs out. 
 The other things are just the same things you do in the missions just that these are going in the 
 record book. So in conclusion the game was boring, short, and whatever else I said on the top of 
 the review. Yoou might like it but it's a little hard to atleast to me because as soon as the first 
 mission was done I had 29% of the game beat already. From there on I started hating it and maybe 
 you will too but the keyword is maybe.
