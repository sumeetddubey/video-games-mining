Touchmaster is packed with a wide variety of good, casual games. 

  It's a safe bet that most Nintendo DS owners are probably too young to have ever played Midway's 
 popular touch-screen games that are found atop bars across the country. But that hasn't stopped 
 Midway from releasing Touchmaster, a nice compilation of 23 of its best touch-screen games. Most 
 of the games are quite good, work well on the DS, and are simple yet fun enough to be enjoyed by 
 players of all ages.  

  Since they were designed as touch-screen games from the get-go, each one of the 23 games works 
 fine on the DS, even if the screen sometimes feels a bit cramped. Touchmaster won't wow you with 
 its presentation, but the simple menu screens are easy to navigate with the stylus. The in-game 
 visuals and sound effects are adequate, though hardly stunning. The games are organized into three 
 categories: cards, skill, and puzzle. Most of the seven puzzle games are knockoffs or slight variations 
 of well-known puzzle games, but at least they're all good knockoffs. Two of the better games are 
 Crystal Balls, a Bejeweled-like game where you try to match three or more balls in a row by color 
 or number, and Mahki, a puzzle game that tasks you with matching like-colored tiles as fast as 
 possible, with the goal of erasing all of the tiles from the screen. There's also a fun  Wheel 
 of Fortune  clone called Wordz, an addictive game called Times Square, and the classic Mah Jongg 
 Pairs.  

           Your parents' love of big band music is finally good for something.      

  There are 
 nine card games in all. One of the better games is Target 21, a sort of hybrid of blackjack and 
 solitaire in which you're dealt five hands and the objective is to get 21 in each hand. Another 
 fun game that's also similar to solitaire is 3 Peak Deluxe. Here the cards are arranged in three 
 pyramids, and you erase those cards by playing cards that are one higher or lower than the deck 
 card. Triple Elevens, Uplift, Solitaire Classic, Go Wild, Double Take, Phoenix 13, and Power Cell 
 round out the list of card games.  

  Everything that doesn't quite fit into the card or puzzle genre is lumped together into the skill 
 section. There's a little bit of everything here; a few of the games are good, but it's probably 
 the weakest category. One of the more recognizable games is Hot Hoops, where you tap one of five 
 basketball players lined up across the screen to shoot at a hoop that moves back and forth across 
 the screen. Trivia is, shockingly, a trivia game that covers a wide variety of subjects including 
 sports, music, television, history, and general knowledge. In Trivia you can play all categories 
 at once or pick and choose the ones you want to play. There's even a "kids" category, which is 
 nice. Kids will also enjoy using the stylus to circle words in Word Search and Pond King Checkers, 
 where the checkers are replaced with frogs and the board is replaced with a pond and floating lily 
 pads.  

           Many of the games are simple, but you'll still find yourself playing them over and over. 

  Each game can be enjoyed single-player, and most of them allow two people to play either by taking 
 turns or wirelessly, if each person has a cartridge. If you don't have anyone to play against, 
 you can still scratch the competitive itch by uploading high scores and entering tournaments. These 
 are both great additions in theory, but they're poorly executed. Instead of automatically uploading 
 your score after a game ends, you must go through the several screens to upload it manually. If 
 you actually want to see how your score stacks up, you'll have to finish uploading, back out of 
 that menu, and go through another series of menus. Entering a tournament is even more tedious. 
 Midway decides when there will be a tournament and what game will be used. There's no option for 
 creating your own tournament; nor is there an option to search all games for ones that have tournaments -- you 
 have to go to each individual game and search. Using a PC it's possible to go to Midway's Web site 
 and check your high scores as well as see what tournaments are being run, but when the fastest 
 way to find out if there's a Pond Kings tournament is to put down the DS and get on the computer, 
 you know things aren't easy.  

  Touchmaster is strictly no-frills, but it's a great value, and nearly all of its games are challenging 
 and fun enough to keep you coming back for more.

Review:  Stats:
  Graphics: 9/10
  Mini-games (all) : 9.5/10
  Graphics: 9//10
  Fun: 10/10
  Overall: 9.375/10 (I rounded it up to 9.5)
  
  This game will keep you satisfied for hours, 
 whether you are on a long car ride, you are bored, or you just feel like playing Nintendo DS. The 
 game has many great mini-games that can keep your eyes on this game for very long periods of time. 
 Touchmaster is Excellent for gifts, No matter your age. This is a game that actually deserved a 
 higher rating than the actual 7.5/10. The game is worth more than renting, it is worth buying first. 
 The game also has variety from Solitare to Hot Hoops ( A Basketball mini-game) . If you buy this 
 game, hours spent playing will become countless eventually. Not just some toss-up of old arcade 
 games, most are original plus card games. Final Statement: Just plain addicting and fun. :)

Review:  The name "TouchMaster" isn't very descriptive, and kind of misleading, if you're not familiar with 
 the barroom and arcade games. If you're browsing through game titles on the store shelf, it doesn't 
 give you any idea what it's all about. The '23 games' might give you a clue, but until you actually 
 pick it up and play it, you don't realize what a gem this is. There are one and two player modes 
 for most games. All controls are done through the lower DS touch screen (I guess it fits the title) . 
 With the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection, you can post your scores on line.
  
  Some of the games are familiar. Examples: The 2 dice games, "5 Star Generals" and "Pick Up Six" 
 resemble Yahtzee, the only difference between the 2 here is that one used traditional die (spots) 
 and the other uses pictures. The "Wordz" game resembles a Wheel of Fortune board, without the spinning 
 wheel-part (more like an advanced hang-man game) . The "Pond Kings" game is just checkers using 
 frogs as pieces. There are 9 card games. Traditional Solitaire with 1 and 3 card draws, and 8 others 
 involving matching pairs, suits, or trying to total a specific number (11, 13, 21) . No poker or 
 blackjack.
  
  The trivia game boasts over 20,000 questions, with multiple categories to choose from. The word 
 search game and the Wordz game also have multiple categories. Don't know if there are plans to 
 be able to download new questions through the wi-fi feature.
  
  There are other "matching" games including 2 difficulty levels of Mah Jongg. A Tetris-like "Crystal 
 Balls" where numbered and colored balls drop, match number or color to clear a level. "Pairs" is 
 matching pool balls, clear the table by matching pairs. Mahki involves clearing a grid of colored 
 blocks, clicking on one color, all touching same color blocks disappear, remaining blocks drop, 
 and or move left. Gem-Slide, just that, slide gems across the board to match, at least 3 in a row 
 to clear.
  
  The "Hoops" game is basketball, 5 players facing the hoop, hoop slides back and forth, touch each 
 player to shoot. Get 3 or more shots in a row to be 'on fire' and shoot flaming b-balls, and score 
 high enough, the balls turn into frogs (haven't seen any flaming frogs though) . "Artifacts" I'm 
 still trying to figure out, touching circles lights a circuit, each circle has 2, 3, or 4 circuits, 
 complete a circles circuit, it explodes changing all touching circles to the opposite color.
  
  All in all, these games are addictive. "Just one more quick game" turns into several. This 
 would have been a great game to include with the DS console, the way Tetris was included withy 
 the first GameBoys. I've been so busy playing the 1 player games, I haven't even tried out the 
 on-line tournaments, yet. I can see a TouchMaster 2 coming out, maybe they'll include an actual 
 pool / billiards game, poker, blackjack, chess, Tetris, bejewled, etc. (Ya, they're availablenow, 
 separately, but getting them all in one package would be nice.)

Review:  This is basically one of your everyday minigames. There are 21 mini games in all, wich are all 
 split up into three categories: Cards, Puzzle and skill. There are a variety of different fun games 
 like solitaire, hot hoops, mahki and word search, and its fun to play games like pond kings (checkers) 
 online or even two players on the same ds. The only bad thing about it is that for each game, theres 
 a time limit, that goes pretty fast. The time limit can be really irretating, especially for games 
 like solitaire, cuz your too busy looking at the timer to actually think and stratagize. Other 
 than that, this is a pretty fun game to get just for the heck of it!

Review:  All your favorite time killers are here - a bejeweled type, a wheel-of-fortune, a trivia, a word 
 cross, several card games, including good old solitare - 23 in all, all cleverly packaged and easy 
 to play. Most of these games you've played before (or variations of them) . So there's nothing new 
 here. BUT it's entertaining and well worth getting, especially if you enjoy exercising your mind 
 and your fingers.
  
  There are tips on how to play each game, but no extensive online instructions. But even the ones 
 I've never played I picked up on easily. All in all, a very pleasant way to pass the time.

Review:  Very surprised with how good this game is, it has over 20 games to play including card and word 
 games, a word search game, mahjong, puzzle games and more. Most of the games will be familiar to 
 you, though there are instructions for each game if you get stuck. It has enough different games 
 to merit buying it if you already have 42 all time classics, plus I personally think the cards 
 are easier to read. With tournaments set up by the makers of Touchmaster DS and worldwide leader 
 boards you have lots of competition to play against. A worthwhile addition to your collection.

Review:  I would give this game a 10 if it cost $20. As a $30 game, though, it does provide a good amount 
 of value. All of the games it has are fun, addictive, and quick to get into and enjoy. The high 
 score tables make it easy to share the cart and compete against the rest of the family or against 
 friends. The variety of games means there is something for everyone.
  
  I am completely sold on the casual games on the Nintendo DS and this is yet another great set of 
 casual games that makes me glad I own this particular console. If more publishers would produce 
 top notch releases like Touchmaster, life would be quite good indeed.
