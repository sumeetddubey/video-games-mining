:::Review:::
A $30 game about winning fake money by picking random numbers is awful to begin with, but a completely 
 broken version of said game is another story altogether. 

  By all accounts, making a game based on NBC's hit game show  Deal or No Deal  should be the most 
 idiot-proof concept in the world. The premise is pathetically simple: You are presented with 26 
 briefcases, each of which contains one of 26 different dollar amounts in random order. You pick 
 a case for yourself and then start eliminating other cases to try to narrow down what amount you've 
 picked out for yourself. All the while, you also entertain offers from a mysterious banker who 
 tries to buy you out before you can find out how much your case contains. All that babble aside, 
 it's basically a game that boils down to randomly picking numbers and hoping for the best. It might 
 not make for an especially interesting video game (it certainly didn't in the PC version released 
 earlier this year) , but if the template is followed correctly, it should be, if nothing else, functional. 
 However, Deal or No Deal for the DS somehow manages to screw it up, turning in a completely broken 
 translation of the game.  

  How do you break Deal or No Deal? It's quite simple, really: just fail to randomize the dollar 
 amounts. Instead of distributing the dollar amounts randomly at the start of each game, the game 
 only uses a series of predetermined templates. This means that you will get specific distributions 
 of amounts multiple times as you continue to play through the game. If you happen upon one you've 
 already played and happen to remember where stuff was, you can pretty much get the best deal every 
 single time.  

           By being entirely busted and retailing for a full $30, Deal or No Deal for the DS wins 
 the award for evilest retail product of the year so far.      

  It gets worse. Every time you boot up the game, the same pattern loads. This means that no matter 
 what, every single time you start the game up, you'll be forced to play through a game you've already 
 memorized. Want the million bucks? Pick case 13. After you play that first game, you will get a 
 random selection from the predetermined patterns. So basically, the developers had the forethought 
 to randomize the predetermined patterns (minus the first game that boots up every time) , but not 
 the numbers themselves? Conceptually, the game is pointless enough, given that it is purely based 
 on picking random numbers and lacks any manner of skill-based gameplay. Removing the random factor 
 from the proceedings puts the game in the rankings for hell's most tedious and pointless possible 
 punishment; somewhere between having to push a rock up the same hill for eternity and finding a 
 specific piece of hay in the world's largest haystack.  

  One could prattle on about how there are some lame bonus games to play, like a high-low game where 
 you have to guess if the amount in an upcoming case will be higher or lower than the one currently 
 displayed. There's also a multiplayer mode where two players can either compete to try to get the 
 best deal or one player can play the banker and try to make offers to push the other player out 
 of the game (which is perhaps even more pointless than the broken standard game) . There are the 
 cheesy voice samples from Howie Mandel and the crowd, which are periodically broken, exclaiming 
 disappointment when you remove a low number from the board. Then there are the crummy, pixelated 
 graphics that make Mandel look like some kind of dwarf mutant and do not give the various stage 
 models faces of any kind. But these complaints are completely irrelevant given the fact that the 
 primary game is broken beyond repair. It's a game about picking random numbers, but the numbers 
 aren't random. It's hard to screw up much worse than that.

Review:  It is a breathtaking experience into the amazing world of T. V. It is so good I had an orgasm when 
 I saw it, and multiple orgasms when I played it. Forget women, Deal or no Deal is the sexual experience 
 you want and you can have it. Anywhere.
  
  Well It is the best online multiplayer game i have ever played with great ways to spend your xp 
 points on stats like enhanced numbers selection or great pick up lines for those attractive women 
 who hold the cases that make you wanna have sex so bad you grab one of the women and perform an 
 illegal act.
  
  RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! RAR! 
 RAR! RAR! RAR!
  
  IF U HEAR THIS NOISE IT IS ALREADY TO LATE FOR YOU TO ESCAPE! MASSIVE CHOCOLATE BAR IS COMING FOR 
 YOU HAHAHA! The girls in this game have triangle nipples a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s 
 t u v w x y z now u have read this review you better run very quickly!

 semi addictive..... one look scared me and i almost cried the graphics SUCK and the game is not 
 random at all to easy to know where money is. It scared me that deal or no deal would accept it 
 but............... this game sucked..... i would rather play barbie yes barbie then this crap so 
 basically this game sucked and i probably would never want to play or look at it again. they should 
 have just kept it a show and left it there but no they had to make a game that's just plain stupid 
 if i ask me and plz no comments on this plz ssssssoooooooo yeah. Raven960 oh and i feel like making 
 monkey noises to make this review sound funnier............. OHOHOHO HAHAHAHAHAHAHAO HOHOHOHOOHO

Review:  For the people that gave 10/10 to this game, they've probably just played TV mode for this game 
 just once.
  
  Pros
  -Gameplay is almost identical as how they play on TV
  -Sound effects are nice (the phone)
  -There are ladies
  
  Cons
  -The ladies seem to have 
 no faces :)
  -Low variety of words from Howie
  -No replay value after you find the "flaw"
  -The board behind Howie isn't interactive. (The money 
 you've knocked down doesn't turn pale)
  
  FOR THE FLAW...
  
  After playing TV mode five times, i've noticed that the million dollar case is almost always in 
 the same case. For me it's case number 4. There's also the same problem with the penny. It's almost 
 always in case number 8.
  
  OVERALL: A fun game when you first buy it. For about $15, the game won't rip you off... completely. 
 It's a Game show, you really don't expect a lot from it do you. [you may want to rent it first]

Review:  That game does not worth it, its worth like 1 penny
  and you can play for free on the internet so why i spend money on a game that is free on the web.
 
  That game is even at the theater you can play everywhere like free or for 1 dollars so WHYYYYYYYYY 
 I BUY THAT.
  its not important if you read this you will understand..................
  that game is ******* *****!!!
  That game could be great for 5 or 6 times but after that is boring 
 or like you cant lose so where is it hard or really hard XD
  
  So i apologize everybody that buy that piece of *******!!!! because I say it again its like using 
 a ds for nothing...... eveerybody should know that trivia game s***!
  it's always like that but its not important. the producer should lose money for that game because 
 its really boring
  
  Thank You Guys!

Review:  Absolutely fantastic. If I could choose between the tastiest piece of cake I'd ever eat in my life, 
 or playing Deal or No Deal, I'd choose the latter. Outstanding graphics (beats Smarter than a 5th 
 Grader any day) fantastic design choice, and revolutionary gameplay adds up to possibly the most 
 fantasmic game of yesteryear. Instant classic. The polyhydrated carbonic acids featured in the 
  helps redefine the gaming world's visual design. I mean, really, 
 where the hell am I going to find gold briefcases with money inside them? 
  
  And the gameplay, I mean, WOW. No I mean, really, it feels like I'm playing World of Warcraft. 
 Everytime I start up a new game I imagine in my mind, "YES! Level 42 Dark Elf Mage, here I come!". 
 And I mean, the choices are endless. Sort of. Up to 26 cases, anyway. But you'll have so much fun 
 roleplaying in the magical world of NBC's demon lovechild you'd forget all about the multiplayer!
 
  
  Nothing beats pwning n00bs at Deal or No Deal. Crushing the hopes of new players in Deal or No 
 Deal is like nothing before! Instead of typing into a clunky old keyboard, I merely yell at them 
 through my DS and throw it onto the floor! Occasionally I even stamp on it a bit and headbutt my 
 cat, but hey; I have a competitive nature! And I'm sure you will too after playing at least 70 
 hours a day!

Review:  Where to start? The game is busted and broken. The people are ugly, nothing works right, and it 
 is too easy. I have hardly played it thank god because it never works correctly. I'm so ed that 
 I'll say it again.

Review:  To start out with, this game is simply amazing. You start out by having to choose a briefcase with 
 a random amount of money in it. Each time I do it I feel a happy feeling go through me. Then you 
 get to pick a case from super models that look ugly because of the graphics. Every time I see them 
 I cry with happiness. The game also has a preset pattern. So you may get the same combination of 
 cases 5 times in a row. It's amazing how the game is able to cause such enjoyment. It's incredibly 
 hard though. You must press buttons for things to happen. I've found this to be incredibly straining, 
 but worth the effort. Another hardship is the reading skill required. You see such letters as "1" 
 or "2" which many people don't understand. I spent 5 hours comprehending "2" before I fully understood 
 the wisdom in it. All in all, this is a must-have game for the holidays!

Review:  Basically just by typing this review, I've spent more time on the review than I did playing the 
 game.
  
  I don't want to go into much detail but this is the worst game ever made. There is nothing good 
 about it. Bad graphics, bad gameplay, bad sound, bad everything. I really like the show. It's good 
 stuff. The fact that a game developer can put out a game they put 15 minutes of work into and still 
 make a little coin is a disgrace to the gaming industry.
  
  I'd give this thing a 0 if I could but unfortunately the scale doesn't go that low. Thank god the 
 pawn shop gave me half my money back. I was considering giving this away as a Christmas present 
 it was so bad but I figured I wouldn't want to be hated by the person who received it.
  
  If the pawn shop didn't buy it, I would have given it to them free of charge. It's really that 
 awful.

Review:  You really only need one word to describe this game.... BAD. In every sense of the word. Graphics 
 hurt, game play hurts, sound hurts. Heck paying the few dollars that I did for this game hurts. 
 I do like the show and thought to myself that this game would be good but I was wrong... really 
 wrong.
  
  If there was ever a TV game show that should not be a game it's this one. Repetitive game play 
 and voice work annoy and bore you at a really fast pace. Graphics are about as bland as you can 
 get on the DS, you would think that after all this time devs would know to add a little effort 
 into a game. The extra modes are also just as bad, pretty much the main game with some lame twists. 
 Most likely the hardcore fans will get something outta this game and thats why the user score is 
 so high but don't be fooled, if you are a fan of game show games avoid this one, it's enough to 
 make you hate the TV show and Howie as well.
