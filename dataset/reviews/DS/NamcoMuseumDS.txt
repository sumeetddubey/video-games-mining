:::Review:::
Namco Museum DS is a decent collection of arcade classics, but you'll have to turn your DS on its 
 side to see them properly. 

  Namco was one of the first out of the gate with what we now see as the modern retro compilation. 
 The Namco Museum series dates all the way back to the original PlayStation. It continues today 
 with games like Namco Museum DS, which collects a handful of arcade games, slaps them onto a DS 
 cartridge, and ships them out to stores. It's a fairly straightforward compilation with some interesting 
 options and features.  

           The bottom screen isn't of much use when you're emulating old arcade games.      

 
  Right off the bat, you're given a cool intro sequence that cleverly combines the graphics from 
 all of the Namco classics. Then you're dropped off into a menu where you've got seven arcade games 
 to choose from: Pac-Man, Galaxian, Galaga, Mappy, Xevious, Dig Dug II, and The Tower of Druaga. 
 These all appear to be emulated versions of the original games and run on the top screen of the 
 DS. The bottom screen is devoted to options. You can rotate the view and play vertically by holding 
 the DS sideways, which makes the games fill up the whole screen without stretching them too much. 
 If you want to play horizontally, the graphics get squished in weird ways and generally looks pretty 
 bad. For example, text is practically unreadable on the default settings. You can also make adjustments 
 to the game's difficulty and go to a "hardcore options" mode, which shows you a picture of an arcade 
 circuit board, complete with the tiny little switches that were used to make those adjustments 
 on the real machine. It's not a major feature, but it's a neat inclusion. The games all play just 
 like the arcade originals, which means that Dig Dug II and The Tower of Druaga still aren't a whole 
 lot of fun. But it also means that Galaga, Mappy, Xevious, and Pac-Man are still just fine.  

 
  In addition to playing the classics, there's a version of Pac-Man Vs. on the cartridge. This was 
 a multiplayer version of Pac-Man originally released on the GameCube. The multiplayer ghosts vs. 
 Pac-Man gameplay has been well duplicated on the DS, and you only need one copy of the cart to 
 play it, which is nice. You'll also find a library section with some historical info about each 
 game and a sound test mode where you can listen to all the music, as well as sound effects, from 
 each arcade game.  

  Of course, all of this is meaningless if you aren't already interested in new releases of old games. 
 And if you are, there's a fairly good chance that you have at least some of these games in other 
 formats. With that in mind, there's nothing too special about this package that makes it stand 
 out from the pack, save for its portability. If you're in need of an arcade-quality Xevious on 
 the road, this will do the trick.

Review:  While many compilation games have been released in recent years, ranging from card to board games, 
 Namco Museum is arguably the biggest of them all, taking dozens of our favorite arcade classics 
 and serving them up in droves. Having been released on basically every major platform, it only 
 makes sense that the franchise would make its way onto the DS as well.
  
  This time around, gamers are treated to eight individual games: Pac-Man, Galaga, Dig Dug II, Xevious, 
 The Tower of Druaga, Mappy, Galaxian, and Pac-Man Vs. As soon as the game loaded, I was immediately 
 taken back to the days of playing on my grandmother's Intellivision during summer vacation. Instinctively, 
 I went straight to Pac-Man first, and was greeted with a few new settings to change things up, 
 the best of these settings being the number of lives option. While I may love Pac-Man, I'm absolutely 
 terrible at it, so being able to change my number of lives from three to five was a true blessing. 
 Other settings include changing the point level at which you receive an extra life, and more technical 
 aspects like changing the screen position and layout from horizontal to vertical.
  
  Aside from these superficial changes, the gameplay has not been touched, a fact that is in itself 
 both a negative and a positive. On the positive side of things, Pac-Man and Galaga are still as 
 fun as I remember them being so many years ago, with fast action and addictive gameplay, but on 
 the negative side, Dig Dug II still comes up short in terms of fun.
  
  That being said, the graphics can't be expected to impress. Apart from the menus, which are placed 
 on the touch screen, the graphics are as you would have seen in previous versions of the games. 
 The menus, however, are very streamlined and easy to navigate, which helps give the game a real 
 pick up and play aspect that makes it great for quick bouts between classes or whenever you might 
 have a few minutes to kill.
  
  Likewise, the music and sound effects are exactly what you expect them to be  basic. And while 
 you can play with the sound down easy enough, I actually found myself playing at 100%, especially 
 on Pac-Man, enjoying the sounds that can take me back.
  
  One of the main aspects of the game that sets it apart from past installments is the multiplayer 
 feature. Up to four people can play wirelessly in Pac-Man Vs, which is great for those who have 
 wanted a multiplayer game without spending the average $34.99 price tag for a DS game. Even better 
 is the fact that you have a choice between multi-card play and demo-ing the game off of a single 
 card.
  
  In terms of other extras, the cartridge tracks your high score on each game, and there is also 
 a fun music box feature that allows you to listen to the music and sound effects from each of the 
 games. While this may be considered filler material by most, it is a nice touch.
  
  In the end, compilations will continue to be one of the hardest things to review, and this game 
 changes nothing about that fact. With eight games, there is bound to be something here that everyone 
 can enjoy, but in that same respect, if someone only likes one of the eight, the game's price might 
 seem too steep, even if it is only twenty bucks. However, if you're a newbie to the video game 
 world and want to see how most games began, this is definitely a good place to start.
