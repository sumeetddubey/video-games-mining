Looney Tunes: Cartoon Conductor is light on challenge and heavy on cartoon mayhem. 

  When you think about rhythm games, you generally envision something that's set to rock or techno 
 with a good, driving beat. Beethoven and Bach probably aren't high on the list, nor is the "William 
 Tell Overture" or Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries." Looney Tunes: Cartoon Conductor brings out 
 these classics and more for some stylus-waving musical action that serves up more childhood nostalgia 
 than real challenge.  

           I wonder if Richard Wagner ever dreamed his work would be this closely associated with 
 a cross-dressing cartoon rabbit.      

  The premise is that the Tasmanian Devil has slipped his leash and gotten into the Looney Tunes 
 vault, shredding cartoons left and right. Bugs Bunny has gathered together the cartoon crew to 
 restore the scenes, but you're the one who has to conduct the music. The cartoons themselves run 
 the gamut and include Wile E. Coyote chasing the Roadrunner, Sylvester the cat going after Speedy 
 Gonzales, and Marvin the Martian and Daffy Duck carrying out their elaborate schemes. A number 
 of these are lifted directly from old Warner Bros. material, so you'll get to reenact things like 
 Elmer Fudd in a Viking helmet swinging a spear around singing "Kill da wabbit!" and Daffy's brief 
 stint as Robin Hood. The gang's all here, and they'll issue a number of voice clips as you move 
 around the game's menus, though the stages themselves are usually all about the music and a few 
 sound effects.  

  If you're familiar at all with Elite Beat Agents (or even its Japanese progenitor, Ouendan) , you'll 
 find that the gameplay here is almost identical. While the animated sequences play out on the top 
 screen, you'll be watching the bottom screen for numbered circles that you need to hit with the 
 stylus at the right time. However, instead of tapping single circles in sequence, most of the time 
 you'll be dragging the stylus around the screen in a way that's probably meant to evoke conducting 
 an orchestra. Certain sections of a song will trigger a "tap note" sequence, where notes will fall 
 from the top of the screen and you'll have to strike them when they're centered in a frame at the 
 bottom of the screen.  

  The focus on conducting and dragging the stylus around is what sets this game apart, and it works 
 better in some songs than others. Since much of the time you're dragging along the screen instead 
 of tapping to the beat, you lose some of the rhythmic feel that music-based games tend to excel 
 at, and the stylus motions seem imprecise. When learning new stages you can often rely on some 
 degree of scribbling the stylus around, which divorces you from the music in a way that's distracting. 
 It also makes the game light on difficulty, though by the time you move up the ranks from apprentice, 
 to conductor, to maestro, to Looney, you'll have to work a little more. Depending on how accurately 
 you strike your marks, you're awarded an orange, silver, or golden carrot, and your points at the 
 end determine your ranking. A C rating or higher will open up new cartoons for you to tackle.  
 

  There are 18 stages per difficulty level, with 12 normal stages and six "remix" stages. The remix 
 stages are a repeat of the earlier songs and cartoons, but with an added techno backbeat. Even 
 though the remixes fall at the very end (you have to unlock them by playing through the normal 
 songs) , they're often easier than previous music since you have a solid beat to work with. While 
 Bugs gives you a short grounding in the story during the tutorial stage, playing through the cartoons 
 carries no sense of progression or buildup, nor is there any real ending since completing your 
 last song takes you straight to the credits. You'll unlock some extras as you go, mainly character 
 bios of the Looney Tunes cast and access to their voice clips, but liking the Looney Tunes a whole 
 lot will still be the main reason for you to keep playing.  

           Follow the golden carrots to victory.      

  The character models are built out in 
 3D, which looks a little rough and blocky around the edges. Despite that, the characters are molded 
 and animated perfectly for each classic toon, from Tweety's frantic fluttering to Bugs' studied 
 nonchalance. Backgrounds have a smooth, cel-painted look to them that accentuates the scenes with 
 color and visual interest. The music is solid for many songs, but the DS speakers were not meant 
 to issue forth orchestral symphonies. Some of the majesty is lost when there's a tinny edge to 
 something as rousing as Gustav Holst's "Mars, the Bringer of War." The remix versions sound silly 
 but catchy, and they're perfectly suited to a game starring cartoon characters.  

  Looney Tunes: Cartoon Conductor seems like it's best suited for the younger set, but if you love 
 Bugs Bunny and don't mind a lower level of difficulty, this is a decent handheld music game that 
 can be enjoyed by anyone. If nothing else, it's a different experience if you've never before cursed 
 Georg Philipp Telemann for his "Concerto for 2 Horns."

Review:  I've played Elite Beat Agents, and it's one of the best DS games out there in my opinion. Sadly, 
 there are a few ripoffs out there that claim to hold that fun factor of EBA. This is one of them. 
 However, there are one or two major changes. Instead of lifting the stylus between notes, you drag 
 it to the next and so on without lifting the stylus. This sounds interesting, but it's really disorientating 
 if you're trying to keep a steady beat. Another change is the Guitar Hero-like note sequences that 
 you must tap out to continue the song. It's okay, but really nothing fun or entertaining added 
 to the formula. The songs? Those are the highlight of this game. The tracks are all classical tunes 
 found in old episodes of the Looney Tunes series. Another highlight is the reenactments of classic 
 Looney Tunes clips. "Duck Season" looks great in 3D. After a section of the song, you are rewarded 
 with a few seconds of the reenactment. One last problem would have to be the difficulty. I completed 
 the game without missing a song. You can miss 3/4ths of the notes and still pass the song, even 
 on the harder difficulties. So, to review, it's a decent game. Good graphics, music choice, and 
 fun factor. You'll get bored of it fast, and it's so easy you'll never miss. It also loses points 
 because it's an obvious ripoff of EBA.
