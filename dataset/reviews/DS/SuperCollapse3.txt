:::Review:::
Super Collapse 3 is a solid puzzler with seven unique game types and a lengthy quest mode. 

 
  Super Collapse 3 is the latest installment of a popular puzzle franchise that got its start on 
 the Web. The basic design shares similarities with click-based puzzlers, such as Bejeweled and 
 Panel De Pon. Lines of multicolored squares constantly push up from the bottom of the screen. Using 
 the stylus, you have to touch clusters of three or more squares to make them disappear. The rest 
 of the pile then falls into place. You get more points for popping large clusters, so it's generally 
 a good idea to let squares of the same color collect to maximize your payoff. Helpful items -- bombs, 
 time stoppers, and shuffle blocks -- also appear at regular intervals to keep the excitement going. 

  The controls couldn't be any easier. On the PC, you'd use the mouse and onscreen pointer to select 
 then pop bricks. In the DS version, you simply touch the bricks with the stylus and they magically 
 disappear. Response is quick and accurate, even when the pile is rising full-speed toward the top 
 of the screen. The graphics and audio in the DS version aren't as polished as in the PC or PSP 
 versions of the game, but the excellent touch-screen controls totally make up for the downgrades 
 to those superficial aspects.  

           Click on a cluster of three or more bricks, and it'll disappear, causing the rest of the 
 stack to fall.      

  It's not like the utilitarian presentation hurts the experience. This is a puzzle game, which means 
 what matters most is that you can see everything clearly. To that end, Super Collapse 3 succeeds. 
 The lower screen contains the puzzle field while the upper screen contains status information, 
 such as score and lines remaining. The bricks are painted in primary colors that are easy to make 
 out against the puzzle field's solid black backdrop. Outside of the puzzle field, cheesy rendered 
 landscapes fill the remaining screen area. The audio consists of pop-heavy sound effects and pleasant 
 mood music.  

  Multiple game types give you numerous ways to enjoy the basic design. You can play continuously, 
 try to clear X number of lines, or see how many points you can amass in two minutes. There's a 
 strategy mode, in which every click raises the pile by a line, as well as a puzzle type, in which 
 you have to figure out how to clear a massive pile without having any blocks left over. Then, there 
 are two goofy game types called slider and relapse. In slider, the lines of blocks are constantly 
 sliding sideways. In relapse, there are two piles of blocks erupting from the top and bottom of 
 the screen. Your goal is to clear a certain number of lines without letting the piles collide. 

  The developers alsoimplemented a quest mode that ties together all of the basic game types. There 
 are 10 lands to travel through, each of which contains roughly a dozen increasingly difficult challenges. 
 For every challenge you complete, you'll earn some coins that you can use to buy items from the 
 shop. These items include bombs that you can detonate whenever you want, hints for puzzles, and 
 keys that unlock game types in the quickplay mode. The nice thing about the quest mode is that 
 it provides a good way to gradually figure out the nuances of each game type. The not-so-nice thing 
 is that you absolutely must play through the quest mode to unlock all of the game types for play 
 in the quickplay mode. That's a meaty 10-to-15-hour time investment for people who just want to 
 get their groove on in a specific game type.  

  If your friends buy their own copies of the game, as many as four of you can link up wirelessly 
 to compete in countdown, survival, and relapse matches. Players can also team up and work together 
 to complete a preset number of lines before time runs out. Wireless linkups work like they're supposed 
 to, but it's just a shame that multiplayer is restricted to face-to-face connections because online 
 play through Nintendo's Wi-Fi Connect service would've been icing on the cake.  

  As far as click-based puzzle games go, Super Collapse 3 is one of the better games. The design 
 itself serves up a satisfying mix of strategy and chain reactions. Also, the seven different game 
 types give you seven unique ways to enjoy clicking away at those pesky colorful squares. An online 
 matchmaking mode would've been nice, considering the $30 price tag, but there's still enough content 
 here to justify the asking price.

Review:  This game is very fun for people who enjoy puzzles. This game has many features, such as the play 
 quest and unlocking certain game plays and etc. The types of games available in Super Collapse 
 3 are very fun, and will leave you stuck to your ds for hours! This game is just like the classic 
 on the internet, but portable. The use of the touchscreen is fantastic and very smart. No one likes 
 to beat the clock by getting rid of a row of blue blocks with the D-pad now do they? Overall, this 
 game is fun, but the play quest can be repetitive. Other than that, there wasn't many problems 
 with the game. I enjoyed the game. I haven't finished the play quest, and the difficulty of the 
 levels just make me want to play even more. If you like playing tetris then Super Collapse 3 is 
 right for you. Although there is no online play, it is still fun to blow up rows of blocks with 
 a bomb or two. Especially if you're in a tight situation. I give this game 3 thumbs up. (Don't 
 ask where the other thumb came from)
