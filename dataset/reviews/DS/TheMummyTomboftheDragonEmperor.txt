:::Review:::
Only slightly less painful than getting your brain removed through your nose. 

  The film  Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor , with its tomb-raiding, treasure-hunting action, seems 
 ripe for adaptation into a video game. Unfortunately, the Nintendo DS game based on the latest 
 in the series of adventure films starring Brendan Fraser fails to capture any of the movie's spirit. 
 You are cast as Rick and Alex O'Connell, father and son adventurers who must stop the evil Emperor 
 Han from raising his Terracotta Army and conquering the world. That sounds like potentially thrilling 
 stuff, but the storytelling is so thin that the tale it tells is barely even coherent, much less 
 interesting. The game seems to assume that anyone playing it has seen the movie and therefore can 
 fill in the gaps in the narrative. But even if you've seen the movie a dozen times, you're better 
 off staying away from this game.  

           The first level involves pushing things as well as shooting things.      

   

  
 The action is presented from a three-quarter view and has you navigate your way through ancient 
 tombs and across hillsides, fighting terra-cotta soldiers and avoiding shots from idiotic snipers. 
 The first level maintains a decent balance between light puzzle-solving, trap-evading, and combat. 
 The puzzle-solving is all very easy, consisting of simple block-pushing and using the touch screen 
 to write ancient runes, but despite its basic nature, it does lend a modicum of variety to the 
 action. Unfortunately, after the first level, the traps and puzzles fall by the wayside and the 
 focus shifts largely toward combat, which is much less enjoyable.  

  The combat consists of fisticuffs and firearms. Brawling is done by tapping the Y button to make 
 your character pull off simple combos and hitting B to dodge your enemies' attacks. More often 
 than not, though, shooting is going to be your best option. That's because the game has a tendency 
 to surround you with enemies. The action sometimes forces you into these situations by making your 
 character stand still while the bad guys make their entrance and circle you, which feels downright 
 cheap. And once surrounded, if you stop to punch one dude in the face, another is likely to shoot 
 you in the back.  

  So the best tactic then becomes to run around in circles like a crazy person, cutting down enemies 
 with your weapon while trying to avoid enemy attacks. Gun combat is handled in an unusual way that 
 doesn't always work well. There's a crosshair on the touch screen, and by touching the screen in 
 relation to the crosshair, you control the direction in which your character shoots. Rick's pistols 
 lend themselves to this control scheme. They fire and reload quickly, and they have a nice, long 
 range, conveniently leaving trace lines in the air so that you can easily determine if you need 
 to adjust your aim to hit your target. Mowing down onslaughts of terra-cotta soldiers with Rick's 
 pistols can actually be fun for a little while. Alex's shotgun is a different story. The gun fires 
 slowly, and you'll spend about as much time reloading it as you will firing it. Your aim needs 
 to be as precise with the shotgun as it does with the pistols, and considering that all you get 
 when you fire the shotgun is a burst of smoke, it can be more difficult to determine if you need 
 to adjust a little to the left or a little to the right to hit your mark. It's frustrating to seemingly 
 unload a shotgun blast right in an enemy's face and see it stand there unaffected.  

  Tomb of the Dragon Emperor also can't make up its mind about difficulty. For the overwhelming majority 
 of the time, it's very generous with checkpoints. However, a few timed levels need to be completed 
 in one go, without the benefit of any checkpoints, and these can be maddening. A lengthy level 
 near the end is particularly obnoxious, given that the first few sections are quite easy. It's 
 not until a ways into the level that it really starts to throw the bad guys at you en masse, and 
 having to play the easy sections over again each time you fail, just to get back to the part that's 
 giving you trouble, feels overly punishing.  

  Visually speaking, the game is plain. Your characters animate well, but all of your enemies are 
 featureless, and the environments, with a few minor exceptions, are drab and monotonous. The music 
 and sound effects are somewhat better. The occasionally rousing score sounds like the stuff of 
 cinematic adventure, and the over-the-top sounds that accompany the flying of fisticuffs sell the 
 action pretty well. Nevertheless, the verbal cues are annoying. The voice actors don't sound like 
 their movie counterparts, and hearing Alex's petulant voice whine "No" or "I can't do that here" 
 each time you hit the climb button but aren't standing in precisely the right spot is enough to 
 make you want to reach into the game and throttle him.  

           The real terra-cotta soldiers have painstakingly crafted individual features, but you'd 
 never know that from playing this game.      

  The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor will take most players about five hours or so to complete. 
 There's a harder difficulty level, but no built-in incentives to play through again. Certainly 
 the gameplay isn't strong enough to make it worthwhile to play even once. If the game had continued 
 to follow the more varied design formula demonstrated in the first level, the result might have 
 been mildly engaging, but the poorly implemented gun combat quickly gets tiresome. Ultimately, 
 its inconsistency and the plainness of its visuals make Tomb of the Dragon Emperor feel like a 
 poorly thought-out, hastily thrown-together attempt to capitalize on a movie license, and that's 
 probably exactly what it is.
