:::The Good:::
 Original game still holds up really well despite being more than 20 years old.
 New graphics liven up the flat look of the Commodore 64 original.
 Old-timers will love hearing &quot;Stay awhilestay forever!&quot; again after all these years.
-------------------------------------------------
:::The Bad:::
 New game options are pretty underwhelming.
 Though not impossible, your mission is extremely difficult.

:::Review:::
Another pop-culture museum piece gets the time-warp treatment, this time the apparently ageless 
 Impossible Mission. 

  Impossible Mission was as big as Huey Lewis back in 1984. But just like the "I Want A New Drug" 
 singer, the Epyx platformer vanished without a trace by the end of the decade. Today, you'd be 
 hard-pressed to find anyone outside of old Commodore 64 diehards who would even remember the electrifying 
 action and trademark taunts from evil Elvin such as "Destroy him, my robots!" Now developer System 
 3 is trying to revive this forgotten great with a revamped new version for the Nintendo DS. Yet 
 as usual with rereleases of these pop-culture museum pieces, you need to have the nostalgia gene 
 to really appreciate a game this old. Anyone who played the original way back in the day will likely 
 get a kick out of all the leaping around and code-breaking, whereas those who aren't old enough 
 to remember the Cold War will wonder what all the fuss was about.  

           Getting ready to take on more of Elvin's electrical robots.      

  In case you're 
 a member of the younger set, in the original Impossible Mission you played as a secret agent trying 
 to infiltrate the underground lair of mad scientist Elvin Atombender. Your goal was to shut him 
 down before he secured the launch codes to America's nuclear weapons and made everything go  ka-boom 
 . And just in case you think that such an escapade sounds too easy, you needed to do this by somersaulting 
 over dozens of electric robots and scrounging up pieces of a secret code before a real-time six-hour 
 deadline expired. The formula was pretty basic. You took elevators to different floors and searched 
 the furniture in 36 rooms for the codes. All you had to help you were your wits, a freakish leaping 
 skill that let you vault deadly robots and sail over yawning holes in the floor, and computer access 
 codes that let you temporarily shut down robot guards and reset room lifts.  

  Today's game is virtually identical. The only difference is that it now includes three different 
 versions: classic, merged, and new. Classic is the original with a few minor, welcome changes such 
 as manipulating computers and codes with the DS touch screen. It features all of the rough-yet-creepy 
 modulated voice samples from Elvin, such as the classic "Stay awhile... stay forever!" introduction. 
 Merged is exactly like classic but with new graphics that add an industrial-green color and more 
 background details such as gouts of steam in Elvin's subterranean lair. And new simply takes merged 
 and throws in amenities that include a goofy techno soundtrack and the ability to pick between 
 three different agents at the start of the game.  

  None of the extra features really make much difference to the core of the game. The visual enhancements 
 of merged mode make it the preferred option, given that it's certainly an improvement over the 
 plain walls of the original. But the graphics go too far in spots, with background scenery that 
 mimics searchable furniture like desks and candy machines. Even worse, robots often blend in with 
 the backdrops like chameleons. It's too easy to miss a robot until you run right into it. Most 
 of the added features in new mode are OK enhancements, but still rather unnecessary. Being able 
 to choose between a man, a woman, and a robot agent is a complete waste of time because they're 
 identical save for appearance and death screams. However, the map has been augmented to change 
 the color of rooms that have been fully explored, which is a really helpful touch. And adding two 
 hours to the game clock in this mode is much appreciated. This makes the game a lot more playable 
 for a modern audience, although you have to wonder why the developers didn't go farther by throwing 
 in the option of saving progress, or giving you the ability to add time to the game clock through 
 in-game achievements. Likewise, an in-game tutorial about how to use the code pieces would have 
 been a big help.  

           Cracking codes with some musical tones.      

  Still, gameplay isn't as dated as you might think for a game well past its 20th birthday. The action 
 here is more simple and repetitive than that found in a contemporary 2D platformer; the single 
 jump move seems awfully limited in this day and age. Impossible Mission is pretty unforgiving in 
 comparison to most modern platformers. But this isn't an old-school frustration festival like Ghosts 
 'n Goblins. The toughness factor here is just about right, and just enough of a presence to keep 
 you focused on what you're doing. Rooms are laid out like devious puzzles, with intricate patterns 
 of lifts and tiny platforms in midair that force you to plan your moves and make what seem to be 
 impossible jumps. The slightest touch of a robot kills you, as does falling through a hole. Many 
 robots zap you with insta-death bolts of electricity, and a black ball that floats through some 
 of the rooms also kills with a single touch. Every death takes 10 minutes off of the clock, too, 
 so don't expect to beat the game on your first try.  

  As one of the Commodore 64 classics up there with the likes of Beach-Head, Karateka, and Paradroid, 
 Impossible Mission deserves a modern-day update. Its gameplay has held up pretty well despite the 
 passage of more than two decades, so it's a worthy buy if you're an old-timer up for a trip back 
 in time or a kid who wants to get a look at what pop used to play.

Review:  I originally played this game on the Commodore 64 and for an 8-bit machine the graphics and sounds 
 were surprisingly very good. It was a bit like Saboteur (1984) (VG) in a way as you would control 
 your little secret agent guy as he ran around in a massive industrial complex going up and down 
 elevators, doing huge somersaults and dodging the evil robots while trying to solve a cryptic puzzle 
 on a huge musical chess board and searching for clues.
  
  The baddie, who you never actually see during the game, was the outrageously named Elvin Atombender. 
 Every now and again he was start talking to you or ordering his robots to zap you. It was mental. 
 And the funniest part was definitely when you fell down an airshaft and the character would do 
 that hilarious scream.
  
  As a kid I never actually finished the game as it was just too difficult (it really did live up 
 to it's name) but this new Nintendo DS version is easier to control and get to grips with. Impossible 
 Mission is perfect for the handheld console and the new graphics and sound only improve the classic 
 gameplay.
  
  Despite the Gamespot review, there IS a save function.
