:::Review:::
Hmm, a punch to the groin or one more round of this DS boxing game? Hang on, we're still thinking... 
 

  Boxing games typically come in two flavors: the cartoon punchfests  la Ready to Rumble and the 
 more realistic Fight Night-esque simulation games. With the release of Showtime Championship Boxing, 
 you can add a new flavor to that list: an ugly mixture of both approaches that results in a fetid 
 stew, heavy on the clunky animations and shoddy gameplay, and light on longevity and fun.  

           The Thrilla in Manilla this ain't.      

  The list of things Championship Boxing 
 gets wrong is a long one, so let's start with the good news. That would be the game's control scheme, 
 specifically the moves that use the directional pad as well as the face and shoulder buttons. Yes, 
 you can punch and block by drawing on the touch screen with your stylus, but the implementation 
 is so imprecise that, as soon as you figure out that you can punch with the shoulder buttons, you'll 
 set aside the stylus once and for all. With the button controls, you can sway left or right with 
 the Y and A buttons, respectively, and block high and low with the X and B buttons. Your punches 
 are regulated by a stamina bar that drains with each punch.  

  Okay, so the mechanics aren't  that  bad. However, once you put those controls to use in the ring, 
 it's clear that Championship Boxing falls far short of the mark. You fight from a third-person 
 over-the-shoulder perspective, and the vast majority of the boxing in this game is just you standing 
 in the center of the ring and slugging it out with your opponent, while occasionally swaying left 
 or right just to mix things up. Only in the final fights of a tournament do you need to really 
 move at all, given that the game's artificial intelligence in the early and middle fights is simply 
 brain-dead. The game's manual boasts of a sort of rock-paper-scissors approach to punches, body 
 positioning, and blocking, but for the vast majority of the game, all you really need to do is 
 punch. And punch. And punch.  

  Here's a fight sequence from a typical round: You and your opponent trade punches in the center 
 of the ring, until one of you eventually backs off and the AI continues its vigorous punching routine, 
 delivering a sound drubbing to whatever air molecules get in the way of his gloves. While your 
 opponent continues to beat empty space senseless, you rear back with a hook (holding down the punch 
 button will give it more impact) . Eventually the AI decides to give up its vicious assault on nothing 
 and ambles within your reach, which gives you the perfect opportunity to let loose with your fully 
 loaded hook shot. If you back up a few steps, you can repeat this over and over until your opponent 
 goes down for good.  

  Though the AI's chin is seemingly magnetically attracted to your boxing gloves, there are few knockouts. 
 In fact, throughout the entirety of the game's miniscule single-player mode, we won every single 
 fight by a TKO. We never cleanly knocked out an opponent, and we also never won (or lost) in a 
 decision. On the other hand, you are not immune from getting laid out occasionally, especially 
 when facing the later opponents in the game. These fellows can seemingly knock you out with a couple 
 of well-placed punches, even if you've already put them on the canvas a few times. To make matters 
 worse, should you lose in the later fights of a tournament, there's no rematch option. Instead, 
 you have to start the entire tournament over again, which is a frustrating design choice to say 
 the least.  

  None of this feels like boxing, and it certainly doesn't  look  like boxing, either. The characters 
 themselves aren't so bad when they stand perfectly still; there's some variety to the character 
 design (the Mohawked Psycho Sarge, the glass-jawed Lazy Lorenzo, and so on) . However, once the 
 boxers go into motion, things go to pot. Apart from a dreadfully slow pace, each punch, whether 
 delivered to the body or the face, causes your opponent's head to shake as if he were a bobblehead 
 doll. Furthermore, many of the punches you throw aren't even animated; instead, you'll watch as 
 your opponent's head vigorously shakes from the impact of your phantom strike. When a player goes 
 down, it's as if he were hit by an 18-wheeler, even if you sent him to the mat with a jab. Likewise, 
 Championship Boxing doesn't sound like boxing. Even during the King of the Ring mode -- the final 
 tournament found in the game -- the tame, listless audience makes it sound as if you're punching 
 it out in a moderately crowded Applebee's.  

           His parents never wanted him to be a boxer -- hence the name -- but Punchbag Pat always felt 
 that the best conversations involved punching. And he was quite well-spoken.      

  There's no career mode in Championship Boxing. Instead, you make your way through a handful of 
 single-player tournaments with one of the premade boxers in the game. You can't create a boxer 
 from scratch, and there are no training options to improve your boxer as he moves up the ranks. 
 In all, the single-player game -- which has both heavyweight and welterweight divisions -- won't take 
 you more than around two hours to zip through. There's also wireless multiplayer for two players, 
 both of whom must have a cart of the game to play. Honestly, though, why would you want to subject 
 a friend to this kind of thing?  

  A fun and frantic boxing game for the Nintendo DS certainly isn't out of the realm of possibility; 
 it just isn't to be found in Showtime Championship Boxing. There are very few things in this game 
 that are worth more than a casual glance, and only then for a chuckle. It just might be the worst 
 boxing game ever made.
