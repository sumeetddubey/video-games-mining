:::Review:::
Due to shoddy collision detection and a dearth of content, this Labyrinth just isn't worth solving. 
 

  All the mall goths of the world can just go ahead and settle down: This  isn't  a new video game 
 based on that goofy David Bowie movie from 1986. It's just a generic and crummy puzzle game that's 
 heavily based on a wicked obscure Taito arcade game called Cameltry. In the game, you navigate 
 a perpetually falling ball through one of several mazelike worlds by rotating the scenery. A few 
 of the puzzles are legitimately interesting, and there's four-player single-card multiplayer. But 
 you can breeze through this game if you're dedicated enough, and frequent collision issues make 
 that sort of dedication nearly impossible.  

  Gameplay is very straightforward. You can use either the D pad or the DS's shoulder buttons to 
 rotate a given stage in either direction. The idea is to keep your ball moving through the level 
 and get it to the goal at the end before time runs out. Along the way, a variety of obstacles aim 
 to screw you up, including blocks that cost you time when you touch them, blocks that hang you 
 up, arrows that start pushing you in the wrong direction, and the like. You can push past some 
 of these obstacles using a spin button that breaks certain blocks and lets you move through the 
 arrows. But beyond that, the game is all about tilting, tilting, tilting until you figure out the 
 various mazes.  

           Ball customization isn't nearly as exciting as it sounds.      

  Figuring out the 
 mazes isn't usually the tough part. The level designs are all reasonably straightforward, and while 
 a few provide a bit of brain twisting, it's rare to get hung up for more than a couple of tries 
 on any individual level. The only thing that makes the game legitimately frustrating at all is 
 an issue with the game's collision detection. There are times when your ball will simply get hung 
 up on a block or section of the scenery, and no matter how much you tilt, you just can't seem to 
 get it off there without turning the whole thing upside down... only to get it stuck again the next 
 time you try to pass through that section. Because you're on a timer, these lengthy hang-ups are 
 a real pain. There are also sections where you'll be banging away on the spin button to bust through 
 some blocks, but they just won't break for whatever reason -- even when you spin around to try to 
 get some momentum on the hit.  

  In some capacity, those moments of frustration are almost welcome because they pad out the experience 
 a bit. As long as you don't run into any serious issues, you can beat the single-player in perhaps 
 an hour or two at most. There's some motivation to go back to certain stages to unlock new ball 
 designs, but that's about it. Given the frustrations of the collision detection, that motivation 
 is slight -- at best.  

  At least there's a multiplayer mode, albeit a somewhat uneventful one. Up to four players can play 
 on a single card, and the mode itself is simply a race to get your ball to the finish line first. 
 The game randomly selects levels, and there's no real score tracking in the mode. Someone wins, 
 you start up another race, someone wins that one, and so on and so forth. It's nice that the mode 
 is there, but it's unlikely that anyone will enjoy it for especially long.  

  Presentation is another point of contention. The graphics are bland as bland can be, with stages 
 that are primarily gray, brown, or a combination of the two. There's almost nothing in the way 
 of visual effects or tricks to try to spice things up as you spin around. Sure, there are some 
 different ball designs and colors, but that hardly makes up for the dull level designs. Audio is 
 merely some overly cheery music combined with clicks and clacks of balls hitting stuff, while the 
 occasional voice sample of some infuriatingly enthusiastic Japanese girl shrieks at you to let 
 you know if you won or failed.  

  Again, Labyrinth's tilt-based gameplay is sort of interesting, but the collision issues and the 
 fact that you'll basically be done with it after an hour or so suck away whatever appeal existed 
 in the game design. The DS is rich beyond imagination with far better and more interesting puzzle 
 games than this one. Stick with those.
