:::Review:::
Digimon fans will find the multiplayer worthwhile, but the dull story mode is basically just a rehashing 
 of the previous Digimon World. 

  There's an old saying that goes, "second verse, same as the first." That just about sums up Digimon 
 World: Dawn and Digimon World: Dusk, both for the Nintendo DS. Apart from a few trivial enhancements 
 that make it easier to train your virtual monsters and challenge your friends to wireless duels, 
 the two versions of this so-called new game really don't offer much above the previous Digimon 
 World that was released the year before. Once again, diehard Digimon fans will probably be able 
 to forgive the game's phoned-in nature, while those not totally enamored with the franchise will 
 probably shake their head at this plodding, half-hearted take on the monster battle genre.  

  Like Pokmon, as well as all the other games of its ilk, Digimon World is a story-driven dungeon 
 crawler where you set out to capture and raise as many digital monsters, or Digimon, as possible. 
 There's nothing particularly inspiring about the story. It's merely a hackneyed tale that involves 
 two rival factions joining forces to stop a mysterious villain from taking over the world. Visiting 
 the quest counter in the main city will send you out on a fetch quest, which, in turn, will reward 
 you with another ridiculously small piece of the story. Being an errand boy for 15 to 20 hours 
 is terribly boring, as you can imagine. Thankfully, the story is just a means to an end -- the excuse 
 to send you to all of the game's different virtual environments so you can skirmish with wild Digimon 
 and add them to your collection of fighting monsters.  

           First, you collect, train, and breed Digimon. Then, you control them in turn-based three-on-three 
 battles.      

  Each version of the game tells the same basic story, but they each have their own dungeons and 
 a couple dozen Digimon that the other version lacks. If your favorite Digimon fall into the dragon, 
 aqua, bird, or holy categories, you'll want to pick up the Dawn version. The Dusk version, meanwhile, 
 is geared more toward gathering the beast, machine, organic, and dark species. In total, there 
 are roughly 400 Digimon to collect. To get all 400 into your save data, you'll have to trade and 
 breed your Digimon with other players that own the other version.  

  Going out on silly quests, fighting the same low-level monsters, and watching the story play out 
 in trickling fashion is all terribly, terribly tedious. However, the reward for your tenacity is 
 the ability to customize and create some truly killer Digimon. The Digimon you collect in the wild 
 will learn new attacks as they gain experience and can be evolved or devolved into other Digimon 
 at certain points. Your Digimon gain different types of experience based on the kinds of monsters 
 you have them fight. When one of your monsters gains enough levels to evolve into a later form, 
 you usually have two or three potential forms to pick from depending on how many different types 
 of wild monsters you've made it a point to fight. Another way to create new Digimon is to mate 
 two Digimon together, which will yield an egg that will eventually hatch a monster sharing the 
 traits of both parents. On top of all that, you can outfit your monsters with swords, armor, and 
 other items that further boost their abilities.  

  If you played the previous Digimon World, you'll notice a few minor improvements in this new game 
 that are meant to make the process of gaining levels and evolving your Digimon easier. Each area 
 seems specifically set up to help certain types gain experience. Also, when you devolve a monster, 
 it now drops all the way back to level one. That may sound like a negative, but it actually gives 
 you more levels with which to build stats. The biggest change has to do with the Digifarm system. 
 Instead of leaving your Digimon to train at a prebuilt farm, you now get to design your own unique 
 farm by selecting the music you prefer, as well as placing the individual terrain and equipment 
 pieces wherever you like. As before, each piece of terrain and equipment has a specific kind of 
 experience associated with it. For example, by placing a bunch of fire-boosting pieces on your 
 farm, you can turn your Agumon into a Greymon in no time. The overall selection of terrain and 
 equipment has tripled since the first Digimon World. So, even though watching your farm-raised 
 Digimon slowly gain levels on the upper screen while you go about your business on the lower screen 
 still feels very much like watching paint dry, at least you now have greater control over the way 
 your farm looks and how it's set up.  

  The battle system is pretty fun, even if it hasn't changed one bit from the previous game. Battles 
 are still turn-based and involve three Digimon on each side. When it's your turn to attack, you 
 pick one of your monster's attacks from a list, select the target, and then watch the attack happen. 
 Turns go back and forth until one side's team is defeated. Traits, such as dragon, beast, dark, 
 and holy, come into play as strengths or weaknesses. You also have to take formation into account. 
 On offense, some attacks affect certain positions on the field but not others. On defense, you 
 have to decide whether to situate your monsters side by side to gain support bonuses or to split 
 them up to prevent your opponent from smacking you with group attacks.  

           You can design your own Digifarm now. That's just about the only thing, other than online 
 play, that this game does differently from the previous one.      

  Later dungeons and CPU opponents put up a strong challenge. But between the plodding story and 
 the overall predictability of the CPU, you really need to set up battles against other human beings 
 to enjoy the game. For the first Digimon World, that meant local "same room" matchups only. Dawn 
 and Dusk up the ante by allowing players to duel online through Nintendo's Wi-Fi Connect service. 
 You can't just seek out random opponents, which is kind of weak, but it's not too difficult to 
 swap friend codes and arrange battles over e-mail or your favorite online forum. Because the battles 
 are turn-based, you won't notice any problems with lag or stalling. In fact, fighting a real person 
 feels just like facing off against the CPU, except without the mind-numbing predictability. You 
 can also breed your Digimon with your friends or random people that happen to be online. That will 
 help you acquire the majority of Digimon that aren't in the specific version you're playing. Some 
 of them, though, need to be acquired through straight-up trades, which, for some crazy reason, 
 still can't be consummated online.  

  The quality of the presentation lacks any kind of heart or soul, but it gets the job done. The 
 isometric 2D environments and tiny characters in the quest view look generic. They're also about 
 as detailed and colorful as the stuff you'd see in every role-playing-game put out for the Game 
 Boy Advance a few years ago. The monsters in the battle view are pretty huge, at least, while their 
 attacks exhibit a wide variety of nifty visual effects for such things as flames, poison clouds, 
 ice crystals, and so on. It's also nice that the game makes use of the upper screen to display 
 helpful status information during the fight. The sound effects are just a bunch of generic slashes, 
 elemental sounds, and growls. However, the music is actually very dramatic and beautifully orchestrated. 

  Because of the plodding story and modest presentation, this probably isn't a game you should buy 
 if you're not a diehard Digimon fan or won't be able to take advantage of the game's multiplayer 
 features. Conversely, if you are a Digimon fan, as well as know you'll be able to play and trade 
 with other people, you should be able to overlook the game's weaker aspects to get your money's 
 worth.

Review:  Not as graphicy as DW Data Squad, but Dusk is a must for all Digi-fans and newcomers. What is good 
 about Dusk, then? Well, you are a tamer who tames digimon and an evil virus has taken over DigitalCITY. 
 Darkmoon and Sunshine have been seperated, your Digimon become rookies and you fight off the virus! 
 All of the Digimon have been turned into In-Training's and the chief is counting on you to save 
 the Digi-World. The rest of the story is amazing and you have to get this game for your DS! Forget 
 Pokemon, it's so rubbish! Digimon is so better - this game is a must-have and will keep you busy 
 for hours! The Digimon can talk, unlike Pokemon. Hooray Digimon!
  
  I should'nt be here all day reviewing, but I must be carried away with myself! In DWD you can own 
 up to 4 Digifarms where you raise digimon by using Farm Goods. Is this game appealing? Of course.....

Review:  people think of this game as a Pokemon knock-off yea it is but it has a few different controls. 
 this game will have you probably saying in the end i cant believe i actually played Pokemon the 
 story is more suspenseful and more fun rather than your usual i want to be the very best don't 
 think wrong that i hate Pokemon to gosh and i love digimon to well a lot i like both of them i 
 am a die hard fan of both Pokemon and digimon for digimon anime is better. although this is a pokemon 
 knock-off this is better by miles
  
  
  
  gameplay:10, really good fun to get the stats all to the max but can be repetitive but just hangs 
 on to a 10
  
  graphics:8, great digimon graphics but not stage or anything else.
  better than big head small body {pokemon diamond}
  
  story:8, good story but not as good as 
 like Zelda twilight princess but better than Pokemon.
  
  sound:9, music is pretty great but elemental noises get old.
  
  challenge:10 this game has 
 challenging level eveloutions i mean come on lvl71 ex of 44444 and got apocalymon {apocalymon reference} 
 the main quests are very hard considering your in a maze full of digimon.
  
  repetitive gameplay: 10, you can get your stats at a huge max which can be very very tedious yet 
 fun.

Review:  Sure all video games get boring after a couple of days but not this one! Its a semi action packed 
 game that you are the big head honcho in! Sorta. The action comes for at least 200 hours or less! After 
 you beat the game you will probably start to get bored unless your a collecter like me. There are 
 more than 400 digimon in this game including new never seen before digimon. So when you buy it, Its 
 worth it, Dont waste youre time Buy now buy now buy now,. a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a

Review:  Digimon World Dusk is the second digimon world game that I have played. The first, I cannot remember. 
 What surprises me most is that it had the charms I found in my favorite Pokemon version, Gold. 
 It was extremely easy to start out and go through but in the end, it's a much more challenging 
 game when you start gathering a Mega Level party of digimon that can compete against other players 
 and the extremely long and difficult Gaia Origin and Legendary Tamer Quest. I hope to find more 
 digimon games with the same kind of charm as this game yet a more interesting side quest story 
 line which I found to be lacking in this game. The lack of interesting side quests lost the ten. 
 
  
  Some of you may be wondering what I mean by a lack of interesting side quests. Well in order to 
 get to the main quests that follow the story, you have to complete side quests from various digimon. 
 What I personally found lacking was the fact that almost all of the side quests had NOTHING to 
 do with the story at all. The digimon never mentioned anything in story. The newer quests imply 
 took place in the new areas you go to.

Review:  Well then, Digimon has always had bad reviews. I myself (although a HUGE fan) have alway been disapointed 
 with the games. Other than Digimon World 2 & 3 I didn't like the rest even then 2 & 3 were so-so.
 
  Now I never had the pleasure of playing Digimon World DS, so I have no bias toward this game.
 
  When I played this game, I was suprised by it.
  It's digimon raising capabilities make it limitless to how powerful a digimon can be.
  The storyline 
 could be better.
  Yet, it's not so much the storyline pays attention to but raising the digimon.
  Digimon are able 
 to be customized so they have completely different move sets.
  Wi-fi in general just makes this game amazing.
  Digi-match making makes it easier to obtain some 
 digimon and the battling...
  Battling online is literally so competitive. That it's fun. Unlike other games, this truly makes 
 it completely up to the gamer to how good the digimon is.
  In honesty, I love it. First digimon game I actually love. Rent it, and trust me you will want 
 to buy it :)

Review:  Good game but fairly hard manly because of the fact that it does not explain how to do much but 
 is all right if you have nothing other to do and just have 60 to 1000 min to be bored and annoyed 
 at the game because you cant find your way around or do much of anything because the developers 
 decided not to let you use a map in any of the towns or dungeons. But all in all it is a fairly 
 good game that has its faults (like no tutorial or maps) Hardy worth the 20.00 price tag although 
 most games art worth there original prices but this one is hardy worth messing with and has really 
 ruff patches of game play that have to be really hard or else no one would be willing to play it 
 (but like I said you probably would be better off not adding this game to your list of games that 
 you have played) thanks for reading this review

Review:  This is a great game. I love the DNA digivolving. The levels are fun. I love the wireless capabilities 
 like digi-eggs and trading and training. It is a very addicting game. You end up spending more 
 time then you realize playing it. I like that each game has different quests, places and digimon. 
 It is one of my favorite games and I enjoyed it far more that the pokemon diamond and pearl games. 
 It is highly recommended. I loved this game very much. Anyone who loves digimon or just wants a 
 RPG that allows for a highly customizable gameplay. It is one of those games you can play time 
 and time again. The only disappointment is that it does not take advantage of the touch screen. 
 It plays just like a GBA game. While the graphics are better I wish they would have somehow taken 
 advantage of the touch screen technology. Overall it is a very good game. Battling wirelessly with 
 your friends is lots of fun. Also making digi-eggs by combining both the Dusk and Dawn games makes 
 the extras even more exciting.

Review:  The Good:
  
  More Digimon then ever, plus very complicated Digivolution routes. =D
  +50 points
  You start out with Ultimate, Rookie, and Ultimate Digimon.
  +25 points
  You can 
 give boss Digimon heavy attacks by nailing them with 3 zone attacks! +50 points
  
  The bad:
  
  The Digimon get too overpowered early. -15 points
  
  A virus degenerates your 
 Digimon to the Rookie form which means everything's harder. -10 points
  
  Bosses raise 11 levels each time making it harder every time. -5 points
  
  Total: 95
  Grade: 
 A
  Comments: The best game I've ever played even if I rated others a 10 out of
  10. When I was writing this review, I was playing it! It's that good, Gamespot.
  It DOESN'T get 
 boring.
  
  Well, I hope you save some of your allowance/ask your mom to buy this for you. If you think it's 
 boring, I don't so just resell it. 9.5 is a very good score, well I got to go now to review another 
 game.

Review:  Tired of that old Pokemon premise? Catch, train, battle? If so, try out Digimon World: Dusk for 
 the Nintendo DS. This much under appreciated game has a solid system and is just a plain old good 
 time. It has the catch, train, and battle, but does it much better and more smoothly. The story 
 is the usual "Save the world from impending destruction", so don't expect much there. The game 
 play is what shines though. You take a team of six "digimon", three fighting and three in reserve, 
 and complete quests to advance the plot. Besides fighting to train there is another way, farm islands. 
 The islands offer a deep way to customize the training benefits to suit the digimon you're training. 
 Once you start playing you find that there are endless possibilities and combinations in customizing 
 your team. You can easily go past 50 hours playing the game if you don't pay attention. There is 
 also matching and battling done over the internet with and against people from around the country 
 and world. Overall this is an excellent game that is a must buy, though I'd only recommend it to 
 fans of the series and people who are tired of the Pokemon games who want something new and fun 
 to play.

Review:  This game is simply amazing , yes it may be similar to the first digimon game on the DS but this 
 is more challenging than it and has a wider range of digimon available. Once you pick up this game 
 and play it you will be unable to put it down for weeks on end . The graphics on this game are 
 very good for the Nintendo DS and are propberly some of the best that will come out on this console 
 . The sound is also very good because it is never the same in each location it changes and the 
 music when you digivolve is also very nice . The most important thing about any good game is the 
 Gameplay , and this game has perfect gameplay . There is always something to do in this game which 
 range from collecting scan data and completing quests so this game will keep you playin even after 
 the main storyline is completed . All in all this game got a 9.5 / 10 from me because it is a game 
 that stands out from the crowd and offers everyone of the ages 3 - 16 a great past time which is 
 incrediably fun

Review:  The game has a long storyline, quests to keep you busy and interested, and they have almost all 
 the digimon from all the series up until the digimon from the digimon X movie. There is In-Training-Mega 
 digivolving (you get to totaling hose the path that the digimon takes, DNA fusion, and even armor 
 digivolving, so you can get digimon like the ones is the first movie. All in all, it is the all-time 
 best digimon game ever. Its been hard for me to stop playing it, and I haven't even looked at any 
 of my other game sence I bought it. Great Game!

Review:  If you have played Digimon World DS, this game is practically the same. However Dusk (or Dawn) 
 escapes the Ive played this before factor with many implementations and/or improvements. There 
 are around 400 digimon in the game. The farm system has been streamlined, no more having to worry 
 about buying potties, but farms are more expensive.
  Battles are the same as the first game and just as intense. Equipment is useful but not necessarily 
 needed, as it's possible to go through the game without buying any, since digivolving a digimon 
 will make it just as strong or stronger that what you had beforehand., despite taking it back down 
 to level 1.
  Perhaps the only major complaint I have about Dusk is that in order to progress the storyline you 
 have to do fetch quests, a lot of them.
  
  Gameplay 9- Fun battles combined with monster raising and collecting. Story is predictable, yet 
 good.
  Graphics 9- Digimon anime style 2D sprites
  Sound 8- Most of the sound effects are recycled from DMW DS, and the tracks are nothing too spectacular
 
  Replay Value - 9 High- Even after finishing the main quest there are lots of things to do.
  Fun Factor- 10 Very high. Despite being more or less the same game as its predecessor, Dusk is 
 as every bit as fun to play. A must-buy for Digi-fans.

Review:  Hands down the best Digimon Game to date, but is it worth your time if you dislike Digimon as a 
 whole? Probably not, still, you may want to give it a look see if you don't like Pokemon.
  
  The scope of the game is much larger then the original. You can obtain more digimon and you 
 now also have the ability to DNA digivolve them.
  Still, unless you know a fusion it is sort of difficult to actually get a new digimon this way. 
 Good thing it tells you what the outcome is before you make it irreversable. :)
  
  Farms I believe are more or less the same, Digimon of the proper species and personality may give 
 you Quest Missions when on the farm. You can outfit a farm with Food, Defense, Species Exp, and 
 Attribute equipment along with a BGM and a layout. The latter two, BGMs and layouts, are specific 
 to the farm you buy them for unlike farm goods which can be placed and taken out of one farm or 
 another. Ech farm has a capacity to how many digimon and goods it can hold with higher ranking 
 goods taking up more space.
  
  Battles are carried out EXACTLY like in Digimon World DS, There are Five Zones and you can only 
 have three digimon in your active party. I believe now though you can also bring three digimon 
 with you for back-up. These digimon can be switched out in or out of battle and get full experience 
 also.
  
  Overall, this is a very colorful game yet it is hard not to say it does not feel familiar to last 
 years Digimon World DS. In the end, play what you like and have fun.
  
  I hope this is suffiecent information for the would be buyer, if you need more, you need only contact 
 me. If you also wish for my code.. ask.

Review:  Dont have the time or playing experience to do a full review. Just want to let people know about 
 some of the changes. Digifarms probably are the biggest change. In DW. DS you had digifarms where 
 you can stick extra digimon and use training gadgets on them and they would earn experience while 
 you were out fighting with another group of digimon. In this one your farms are Islands. In DS 
 you got food every time you killed wild digimon but not in Dawn/Dusk. Now you have to install a 
 field specifically to grow food or else your digimon starve and it affects their training. If your 
 digimon grow lots of food they get an extra 30% growth rate, if they only grow a little you ge 
 10-20%. If you run out it will drop their growth rate y 20%. (heh learned that the hard way) .
 
  
  Islands start out blank and can hold 4 digimon and can have 2 gadgets and give you 0 XP in each 
 species type and have 100% growth rate (how much the species XP gets multiplied) . In Dawn/Dusk you 
 get to buy a terrain board for your island which will control what it looks like and BGM Music. 
 Terrain boards are very important. They not only seriously increase what type of Species XP your 
 island produces but also allow you to expand on your islands memory which controls how many gadgets 
 and digimon you can place.
  
  You better choose wisely though because installing terrain boards is permanent. BGM boards or back 
 ground music boards I havent touched. They increase the growth rate of some species XP but DECREASE 
 another species xp by the same amount. That is great if you want an island specifically for helping 
 digimon get a certain kind of XP but not so great for an all purpose island. Terrain boards didnt 
 have any negative effects.
  
  Digivolving got a slight tweak (probably to get rid of the stat roll back bug found in Dw. DS) . In 
 the previous game to evolve to the next form you would have to reach a certain level like 12. Then 
 after you evolved you were lv12 or even higher. The XP it takes to go from lv12 to 13 is alot more 
 than it takes to go from 1 to 2 which made it hard to improve your digimon as you climbed the ranks. 
 Well now when you evolve or devolve you start out at level 1. So even if you evolve into a higher 
 form its still easy to level up. There are still all kinds of requirements in place to level up 
 though like stat and species XP, and friendship levels. But those arent really a problem.
  
  You can still make your digimon powerful by evolving and devolving but because stuff always 
 start out at level 1 your stats improvements wont be as readily visable as before. Its not until 
 you actually level up and evolve back up to a higher form that you will see the difference but 
 you do improve.
  
  They also brought in DNA digivolving that lets you squish two digimon together to get new digimon 
 or digimon that are changed in some way. I havent messed it yet so i dont really know what you 
 can do with it. You can also armor digivolve.
  
  Oh unlike DS where you got missions from the digimon on your farm you now goto a place in town 
 to accept them. After you do a couple of quests for individual digimon then you usually get a mission 
 from your tamer team. Doing quests gets you tamer points, a fat wad of cash and equipment and items. 
 In the beginning you should definately try to do them first so you have the cash to make some great 
 improvements to your island.
  
  If you have a DS you have to own these games man. They are just awesome. MUCH more satisfying than 
 digimon. You can make your digimon into gods if you work on them enough.
