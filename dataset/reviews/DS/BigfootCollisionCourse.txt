:::Review:::
After beating 17 races in less than two hours, you'll have seen everything that this miserable excuse 
 for a racing game has to offer. 

  When Bob Chandler started work on the first Bigfoot monster truck in the mid '70s, he surely had 
 no idea that his creation would spawn a popular new motorsport. He also couldn't have guessed that 
 Bigfoot would be headlining a handheld racing game more than 30 years later. That's just as well, 
 because if he'd known about Bigfoot Collision Course for the Nintendo DS back then, he might have 
 abandoned the whole monster-truck idea to save us from it. Bigfoot Collision Course isn't just 
 a racing game that lacks any real sense of speed -- it's also a racing game with less than two hours' 
 worth of uninspired content and which lacks any multiplayer component whatsoever. In short, it's 
 almost impossible to recommend.  

           After two hours of this, you'll have no reason not to put it down forever.      

  
 Gameplay options are limited to practice sessions, quick races, and a bare-bones Career mode. Practice 
 sessions afford you an opportunity to drive around tracks without any opposition, but none of the 
 course designs are even close to being challenging enough to warrant you learning your way around 
 them. The Quick Race mode is literally pointless because the only difference between it and the 
 Career mode is that you can't unlock any additional trucks or tracks in quick races. At the outset 
 of your career, you have access to only two monster trucks, there are only four tracks to race, 
 and you can compete only at an amateur level. Eight easy three-lap races later, you're done with 
 the amateurs and can race in "Pro Stock" competitions. Winning races doesn't get any harder when 
 you step up to the Pro Stock class, but the trucks are faster and some of the courses are a little 
 longer. After winning another eight three-lap races, you get to go head-to-head against a truck 
 named Bigwheels on the only remotely interesting course in the game, and after winning that, there's 
 nothing else to do unless you feel compelled to go back and beat your best times.  

  Bigfoot Collision Course's only distinguishing feature is that you're encouraged to drive through 
 obstacles rather than around them. Tracks are littered with oil drums, crushed cars, caravans, 
 and even wooden shacks that you can crash through to replenish a power-boost meter that, when full, 
 can be used to significantly increase your speed for a few seconds. There are also a lot of tree 
 stumps, logs, and rocks on some of the tracks that, for the most part, you can just race over the 
 top of. Occasionally, though, and seemingly at random these innocuous objects will bring your truck 
 to a grinding halt and, if you're really unlucky, you might have to reverse and go around them 
 because you no longer have the momentum to get over them.  

  There are 13 different monster trucks in Bigfoot Collision Course, with varying ratings in just 
 two areas: speed and handling. Early on, your choices are limited to either fast trucks with appalling 
 handling or slower trucks that are much easier to get around corners. You're generally better off 
 with the latter, but you're in for a frustrating ride either way. Every truck that you unlock is 
 better than the rest that are available, so you rarely use the same one for more than one or two 
 races. Toward the end of the amateur and pro seasons, you gain access to trucks that can both drive 
 fast  and  turn around corners with a minimum effort. Unsurprisingly, these are the licensed Bigfoot 
 ("First Bigfoot" and "Bigfoot") and Snake Bite ("Snake Bite 1" and "Snake Bite 2") trucks, the 
 latter of which, in real life, are actually Bigfoot trucks competing with different paint jobs. 

           The sensation of speed is only slightly better in-game than it is in this screenshot. 

  Different track surfaces, which include sand, mud, and ice, have no effect on vehicle handling 
 at all, and that holds true if you stray off of the track onto grass or snow. Walls that are either 
 invisible or plastered with forest textures prevent you from straying too far, but they're overly 
 punishing because contact with them invariably results in your truck getting stuck in them until 
 you either reverse back out or manage to turn out of them while stuttering forward. Oddly, your 
 truck stutters in a similar way for no discernable reason on the requisite ice track; the effect 
 is that you appear to be making small jumps forward in much the same way that opponents with slow 
 Internet connections do in some online racing games.  

  Stuttering aside, Bigfoot Collision Course runs smoothly, though that's no great feat given the 
 simplistic visuals and lack of speed. Unfortunately, the quality of the audio is entirely in keeping 
 with the quality of every other aspect of the game. Whereas you might expect a throaty roar of 
 engines, you get what sounds like a troublesome lawnmower, and though all of the locations in the 
 game could conceivably be in the United States, the soundtrack seems designed to give the impression 
 that you're touring the world or something. Rock, tribal, and Indian restaurant are among the music 
 genres poorly represented here, but given the quality of the engine noise, the optional music is 
 the lesser of two evils.  

  Even with its budget price tag, Bigfoot Collision Course is a game that you should steer clear 
 of. There's barely two hours of content here even if you manage to lose a few races along the way, 
 and the very idea of a racing game with no multiplayer at all is laughable. Spend your money on 
 a VHS copy of the  Bigfoot and the Muscle Machines  cartoon series before you spend it on this.
