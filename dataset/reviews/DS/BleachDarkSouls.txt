:::Review:::
Bleach: Dark Souls improves upon what was already a fantastic game, and belongs in your fighting 
 game collection. 

  Last year, Bleach: The Blade of Fate brought a top-notch, 2D fighting game experience to the Nintendo 
 DS. Bleach: Dark Souls, its sequel, sports the same great fighting engine, graphics, and combat 
 features as the original, with the core improvements being little else than "more" of everything, 
 as well as better balance. This doesn't take away from the fact that publisher Sega and developer 
 Treasure have set the standard for fighting games on Nintendo's popular handheld.  

  Dark Souls includes a storyline specially made for the game that takes place in between the first 
 two seasons of the anime series on which it's based. It may leave those unfamiliar with the show 
 or the first game a little confused, but on the flip side, it offers a great way for new players 
 to learn and master its many mechanics. The Story mode includes tutorials, as well as one-on-one, 
 two-on-two, and one-versus-many fighting. It also includes item collection missions, hazard evasion 
 missions, and even "quiz show" missions that require you to stand on a certain area of the arena 
 to answer a question flashing on the screen -- all played within the 2D fighting engine. This odd 
 combination of mechanics leads to some amusing moments, such as knocking a fellow quiz show contestant 
 out of his desired area just before the answer timer sounds. Progressing through the story grants 
 you special unlockables or money with which to buy art, character colors, and more from the game's 
 shop.  

           Bright, colorful effects do a great job in conveying heavy hits.      

  The core action is so good, though, that you might find yourself rushing through the missions -- or 
 skipping the Story mode entirely -- to get to the meaty, traditional fighting within. The experience 
 will feel similar to the controlled chaos found in the Guilty Gear series. For those of you unfamiliar 
 with that formula, each of the game's 40-plus characters (many of whom must be unlocked) has a 
 plethora of standard abilities and unique attacks. They will have you dodging, double-jumping, 
 air-dashing, or hopping back and forth between two movement planes. You'll also chain normal moves 
 and cancel special moves into supermoves on your way to learning devastating multihit combos. The 
 only problem with all of the techniques afforded to you is that it can be a little daunting to 
 learn it all. Even the opening tutorial -- which uses walls of text to explain the three separate 
 meters along with the game's spirit card system -- might initially leave you befuddled.  

  The sprit card system is arguably what sets the Bleach fighting games apart from others, however, 
 so you'd do well to learn its ins and outs. Once you get past trying to read about the system and 
 put it into practice, it's actually simple. You construct decks of spirit cards -- activated in battle 
 via the touch screen -- according to the limitations set by "frames," which govern how many cards 
 of each type you can carry. Cards span all types of powers, from mundane ones (slow down your opponent 
 or lower his defense) to odd ones (force your opponent into a crouching stance) . They can also 
 be unlocked during Story mode and purchased from the shop. What's good about this system is that 
 it adds a random and potentially tide-changing element to the gameplay without making the core 
 fighting too chaotic or simplified. It's also rebalanced from the first game, not allowing players 
 to rapidly play card after card in succession.  

  The rebalancing is a godsend, particularly when you get to the heavy competition you'll find online. 
 Dark Souls lets you pit your skills in two- to four-player battles both locally and online, giving 
 you a bunch of battle customization options to boot. Don't like spirit cards? Want to keep the 
 fighting on one plane of movement? Feel like seeing who can cause more damage in five minutes? 
 All of those options and more are available to you. Ranked matches are there, too, so you can brag 
 about your national spirit power ranking and tag strangers you enjoy fighting against as rivals 
 with the click of a button after a fight. While much of the online fighting works better than the 
 first game, occasional lag can render some matches only half playable -- even with a strong connection 
 during four-player extravaganzas to start crawling at random points. On the bright side, the lag 
 is noticeably less apparent than in the previous game.  

           That hole was there before you ever met him, but he's still mad at you. Couldn't you tell? 

  Online variances aside, Dark Souls moves at a brisk pace supported by its fluid visuals. The game 
 zooms out to widen the playing field when appropriate and handles the technique beautifully. There's 
 never any slowdown or random, disorienting zooming. Up close, every character is (appropriately) 
 large, animates smoothly, and faithfully re-creates details found in the anime. The more grandiose 
 special attacks look fantastic, with screen-filling special effects and sprite manipulation abounding. 
 Treasure paid attention to the more subtle points of the visuals as well, making sure that Chad's 
 shoulder armor stays on the correct shoulder regardless of which direction he faces. The sound 
 holds up its end of the bargain nicely, with all of the characters being voiced by their anime 
 counterpart (though purists will probably wish for a Japanese dub option) .  

  Bleach: Dark Souls may not completely innovate on its predecessor. However, more finely-tuned balance, 
 along with a ton of new cards, abilities, and characters make this game a worthy purchase for veterans, 
 as well as neophytes. Even taking into account imported fighters and Gameboy Advance compatibility, 
 this is arguably the pinnacle of Nintendo DS fighting games.

Review:  Gameplay 9/10
  Bleach mixes cards and normal fighting mechanics for a very interesting gameplay experience. The 
 cards are used as in battle aids, some cards boost, lower and give abilities, though at first it 
 may seem like the cards would make things to complicated, the truth is they make bleach not only 
 unique but lot more fun then you normal fighter. Thats not to say that the tight responsive controls 
 don't compliment the card system, Bleach is a fast paced and kenetic game that any fan of fighters 
 or anime will enjoy.
  
  Graphics 10/10
  Fantastic animations and even better colors make everything pop. There is also a gallery of artwork 
 that looks great as well. I really haven't seen a better looking 2D fighter on a handheld system.
 
  
  Sound 9/10
  Character voices from the show and tons of sound effects plus good music. This game really covers 
 all the bases when it come to sound.
  
  Value 10/10
  44 characters, Online play, story mode, survival mode and the basic arcade mode are all here and give 
 you plenty of reasons to keep playing far after finishing the story mode.
  
  The good
  One of, if not the best 2D fighter on a handheld system, Superb sprite animation and color, Tight 
 controls and unique card system, Tons of value for only 29.99$.
  
  The bad
  Online matches can suffer from severe lag, you might have a few sleepless nights.

Review:  I'm sure some of you will scream at me for this, but this is my first venture into the world of 
 Bleach. Don't start, come on, I know my anime. It's just one of these shows that has just never 
 appealed to me, along with Naruto, Dragon Ball Z and Samurai X and other fighting heavy shows. 
 It's the incessantly thin excuses for slow-mo charges, super charged fireballs and over the top 
 voice acting. I'm sure it's great, but I'll stick to my Ergo Proxy and Guardian of the Spirit thanks. 
 You bunch of candy coloured action junkies!
  
  *No hate mail please, thanks.*
  
  So, when this one turned up in my hallway (Chris, you need to stop teleporting in titles, its unsettling) 
 I I almost slipped a nasty turn of phrase that normally ensues when people ask if I like My Chemical 
 Romance. However to my surprise, I've found that this particular instance of licensing is particularly 
 tasty, much like a bag of jalapeo flavoured crisps. You know you shouldn't eat them but you before 
 you know it, you're licking the packet out.
  
  Maybe that's just me.
  
  Considering Bleach Dark Souls was developed by the creators of action classics such as Gunstar 
 Heroes, Alien Soldier and Radiant Silvergun you'd expect a level of fluidity to proceedings. This 
 is indeed the case. The characters dash across the screen with precision and deliver devastating 
 moves with ease through the smooth as honey controls. It includes an excellent array of touchscreen 
 buttons to activate your chosen fighter's super moves, greatly levelling the playing field and 
 granting access to beginners. All the while it treats your eyeballs to a gorgeous haemorrhage of 
 colours and fantastic 2D animation, zooming and in and out with finesse. The engine is responsive 
 and solid feeling in contrast to the barely contained chaos of the gameplay, which is in a very 
 similar vein to the Guilty Gear series. It will have you dodging, double-jumping, air-dashing, 
 and hopping back and forth between two movement planes as you fight like a hyperactive anime catgirl. 
 It may seem like some kind of frantic button mash, but it's anything but. Tactics can be applied 
 through arguably the most interesting aspect of Bleach, the spirit cards (Reifu cards if you want 
 to get snooty) which act as power-ups and nerfs to your opponents. The spirit card system is arguably 
 what sets the Bleach fighting games apart from others, and rewards you well for your perseverance. 
 Once you get past the, "lets make this seem really complex" tutorial, it's actually very straight 
 forward to use. Much like a game of Magic, you construct decks of spirit cards before play and 
 "activate" them in battle using the touch screen. Cards can act as power-ups for yourself, nerfs 
 to your enemy (lower defence, attack damage etc) to odd ones (force your opponent into a crouching 
 stance) . A well played card can swing the battle without being overpowered or making light of the 
 actual fighting. It has also been rebalanced from the first game to stop players from rapidly playing 
 card after card in succession, thank the anime gods, Hayao Miyazaki I guess.
  
  The core of the gameplay has also been rebalanced from Bleach: Blade of Fates and includes almost 
 as many characters as there are episodes of Naruto. The learning curve is balanced just right throughout 
 the story mode providing the opportunity to pick up the basics and be worked up to move advanced 
 play. It serves up the meat of the single player experience with a reasonably long campaign (about 
 6 hours) complete with plenty of dialogue on the side. The story never really feels like anything 
 more than a linking platform for the fights but there are some notable moments that make it worth 
 while. Some of the interaction between characters is laugh out loud, in particular Hisayo Mochizuki 
 (wee pink haired girl) calling Orihime Inoue (big breasted ginger) "Jiggles", repeatedly. Jokes 
 about breasts are funny, right? Well, the Japanese certainly seem to think so. There is also incentive 
 to progress as you can unlock art, character colours, and more from the game's shop if that tickles 
 your buttons. It also offers in-engine challenges (no mini-games here!) such as collecting bananas 
 within a time-limit, fighting multiple opponents, avoiding damage, healing characters and even 
 a quiz on Bleach trivia to name but a few. Needless to say for the latter I required a lot of guess 
 work and a helping hand from Wikipedia, which was teeth grindingly irritating to say the least. 
 However, the single player is generally a satisfying experience and even includes some very large 
 boss monsters, or Hollows as they are otherwise known.
  
  The core fun of the game however is it's multiplayer. This is Guilty Gear meets Smash Brothers 
 if you can get your head around that. Enter 4 people on a small screen, set for pure deathmatch 
 or teams in a visual explosion of crazy moves and ridiculous sound effects from game and player 
 alike. Boars running across the screen smashing all in their path, mighty ice dragoons twisting 
 through the air, gods looming in from the foreground and girls hurling alarmed teddy bears while 
 pillars of light comb the screen. It's a hilarious spectacle of over the top anime entertainment 
 and I love it. However despite the obvious bonus of single cart play the truncated download menu 
 only displays characters by their name, confusing to Bleach newbie's such as myself. Also, the 
 download times are quite severe, we're talking several minutes every time you change character/level 
 severally damping the flow of action. Some of the animated levels also can trip up the framerate 
 during heated 4 player mash ups, however, with 2 carts or more these issues are rectified. It can 
 also be played online complete with a friend/rival system and a range of battle options just like 
 the local. This is DS multiplayer at it's finest.
  
  I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with Bleach: Dark Souls. The constantly delivering gameplay and 
 extremely attractive presentation make it a fantastic fighting game, despite my unfamiliarity with 
 the licence. The multiplayer is fantastic regardless of the small technical issues and has much 
 to offer as both a fun brawler and an all out competitive fighter. I still stand by my dislike 
 of the series but this is an excellent fighting game nonetheless like no other on the DS. If you're 
 looking for the ultimate fighting game on the DS or need to get your Bleach hit, look no further, 
 this is it.
  Now, I think I have just enough time for a quick gameoh great here we go, who is the captain 
 of Squad 11?!?
  
  Anyone?!? Argh!

Review:  Ok... first thing is first. I said that the difficulty was easy because I had played Bleach Blade 
 of Fate a while before so I already knew how to play. But to most people... it is easy.
  The gameplay was not quite as good as Blade of Fate. There is a slight pause between the attacks. 
 Also, they no longer have Challenge Mode. And those are really the only reason it's rated 9.5/10 
 instead of 10/10.
  ====================================================== 
  Goods
  ========================================================
  1.) Decent story.
  2.) Good Wifi 
 community. 
  3.) Over 40 characters to choose from.
  4.) New Spirit Cards.
  5.) You can make an emblem that shows up on wifi (32x32 Grid)
  6.) Online Ranking mode with scoreboard
 
  ========================================================
  Bads
  ========================================================
  1.) People on wifi Disconnect all the 
 time and the wifi lags sometimes (you should have 2 or more bars or it will lag) .
  2.) The gameplay is not as smooth as it could be.
  3.) Yachiru trips when she dashes.
  4.) 
 There is a glitch in survival mode where something that says *No Entry* will come up and your game 
 will freeze so you must turn your DS off.
  ========================================================
  ========================================================
 
  
  Gameplay
  ========================================================
  The gameplay is not as smooth as it could be. You can still do most of the beloved combos you could 
 in Blade of Fate but there is a slight pause between your attacks. It could be smoother. It takes 
 a while to get used to but once you get used to it, it's fine.
  ========================================================
  Characters
  ========================================================
 
  There is a large selection of characters. There are over 40 characters to fight with. Some are 
 joke characters though and are insanely hard to use. Plus they take a lot of damage. Yachiru trips 
 when you dash and sometimes when you jump. The good nes is that you can hurt them when you trip 
 into them. But despite Yachiru tripping, she is still playable.
  ========================================================
  Wifi
  ========================================================
 
  The wifi community is quite large. Sometimes there is lag. The main problem with wifi is the fact 
 that people disconnect a lot. Some people are really high on the ranking lists and quite undeserving 
 of it. So when you look at the ranking list, don't believe the rankings. People cheat their way 
 up there. But wifi is fun and there are some pretty good people on there.
  ========================================================
  
  That's all for now. 9.5/10. That's 
 a great score. I'm just completely addicted to this game. It's worth buying if you ask me.

Review:  At first i thought that this is another crappy game but it pretty good ds fighting.. of course it's 
 no match to the great Heat the Soul series but if you own only ds and love fightings this game 
 the best choice.. for the fans of anime i think character rooster is pretty old.. But if you don't 
 know wtf is bleach about and just love good fighting i recommend it to you.. Graphics and effects 
 fantastic... minuses.. well. i think old system "complete story mode many many times" then i really 
 don't like this (and in all fightins) is that that i must unlock characters.. well and they can 
 add Japanese voices.. English voice of ichigo makes me ill... what about multiplayer.. i don't have 
 a chance to try this but I heard that it's pretty good

Review:  I went to Eb games right and I'm thinking Wow their is a lot of characters in this game.... The 
 amount of characters doesn't change the fact that its a button smasher. I also thought the minigames 
 didn't fit into it. I wish they had actually tried not to make it so pixelated. If I had a choice 
 I'd take it back right know and get LEgend of Zelda Phantom hour glass or final fantasy III. If 
 you can stay away from this unless you are a hard core fan boy/girl. Then go for it because I know 
 you anime and manga fans have ( Bad Pokemon Joke ahead) Gotta catch em all! The props that I will 
 give for this game is how you can play online and have a large roster of characters but in my opinion 
 Get assasins creed altairs chronicles. ( It is really fun and 3Dish !) . But yah its kinda a big 
 disapointment. But some of the characters do have sweet specails I mean its all like HI

Review:  This game isn't that bad... it just lacks some of the important things here and there.
  
  One thing that this Bleach installation lacks is graphics. Compared to the PSP counterparts, this 
 game is really lacking behind by light-years. 
  
  You won't get to see all that nicely animated 3-D Bankai.
  
  Another is the game-play.
  
 
  The card system is just redundant and makes things too complicated.
  
  you won't get to use your stylus and you wont know if using too much of your fingers on the touch 
 screen will cause any problems (not proven, just a feedback for paranoid users) .
  
  One advice is to try "Jump! Ultimate Stars" if you've tried this and felt that you like it. 
 
  
  You won't regret trying it out, cause it is much much better. 
  
  If not, try playing Bleach on someone else's PSP.
  
  Overall, good game, but there are better 
 alternatives out there.

Review:  I did not know a thing about Bleach when I first got this game, however I quickly found myself 
 looking up back story on Wikipedia and getting drawn in to the Bleach universe.
  
  Bleach: Dark Souls is a bit tricky to control at first but once you have got the hang of it the 
 game really starts being enjoyable. The roster of characters is quite large and there is lots of 
 mini-games too.
  The Dialogue might be a bit weak but thats because they're trying to stretch the story out to give 
 you more battes.
  
  There are many things that set this fighting game apart from the others like the cards that boost 
 certain stats, give you abilities and take away your opponent's.
  
  There are several different difficulties to select so no matter how co-ordinated you are you can 
 still get a challenge out of it. If your not a Bleach fan I would still recommend this game to 
 you. 9.5/10

Review:  Bleach Dark Souls is the sequel to Bleach Blade of Fate which was a great game. Like most games 
 most games Dark Souls has its problems. Some of these problems to name a few are unbalanced characters, 
 terrible sound quality and minor gameplay problems. Once you can get past this Dark Souls is a 
 fun and highly addictive fighting game with deph. Unlike Blade of Fate, Dark Souls offers a roster 
 of 44 characters, unfortunately about 6 of these characters are insanely to broken. Dark Soul's 
 gameplay is the same as Blade of Fate in which you can attack with a light, medium or heavy attack 
 depending on the button pressed (X, Y or A) . Unlike most fighting games the B button allows the player 
 to become invinicible from most attacks for about a hafe of a second and gain a short distance 
 quickly, this is very helpful in most evading attacks and expanding combos. Dark Souls very true 
 to the story of Bleach and most attacks you will see in this game come right from the anime and 
 manga. But the best thing about Dark Souls (and even Blade of Fate) is the online play. Anyone who 
 has played Blade of Fate will find this a great sequel despite its issues and even gamers who have 
 not played Blade Blade of Fate will find Bleach Dark Souls an enjoyable game for the DS.

Review:  Great game, but nothing new, best for multi player and online gaming. The lag in it hasn't really 
 been resolved and some of the new characters r stupid to put in. This game is best for true bleach 
 fans, which will see the true potential of the game. Its combat system still works, some of the 
 returning characters get an upgrade (some i thought were dumb) and Bankai animations have changed 
 which is one of my most favorite parts in the game. Story mode i hoped to actually follow the series 
 one and two according to the show, but that disappointed me. If u don't have wireless online then 
 the game will have limited appeal to it. Characters like the nurse, shibata, don kanoji were pointless 
 additions when they could've done better. The new reiju system works, hardly, but noticeable and some 
 of the new spirit cards r excellent additions. Awesome that you are able to play as a hollow. The 
 online options are still the same besides now you can ask a person to become your rival, host your 
 own battles and have two kinds of ranking battles. Game could've been better, but nicely done.

Review:  I can't read Japanese, nor could I find a good translation guide, but Bleach DS 2nd: Kokui Hirameku 
 Requiem outdoes Bleach: The Blade of Fate at every turn. Even the most minor flaws in Bleach: TBOF 
 have been fixed - not just improved a little, but FIXED. 
  
  The missions in the game are simple to figure out on your own without a guide, but I can't wait 
 until it comes out in America so I can read the cut scenes and have the English voices.
  
  The game keeps all of the original characters from Blade of Fate, but changes some of the moves, 
 and to the boring characters such as Kon and Nemu they've added enough moves to to make them fun 
 to play as from time to time, even if they don't become your favorite characters in the game. On 
 top of all the old characters, they added:
  
  Kisuke Urahara
  Ururu Tsumugiya
  Kukaku Shiba
  Yuichi Shibata
  Don Kanonji
  Ririn
  Shuhei Hisagi
  Izuru Kira
  Ikkaku 
 Madarame
  Rangiku Matsumoto
  Hanataro Yamada
  Goteitaishi
  Kyugohanin
  
  One of my biggest complaints about the first one was that you couldn't play as hallows. But in 
 this one you can play as:
  
  Menos Grande
  Grand Fisher
  Shrieker
  Tsukaima
  
  So with all these characters, they've bumped it up to a grand total of 41 characters, all completely 
 unique with character specific special and super attacks.
  
  Along with more characters, they also made the story mode a good bit longer, as well as added quite 
 a challenge to several of the levels.
  
  As far as I can tell so far, the game has all the modes as the original. When completing fights 
 in each mode, you earn money, which you may use in the Urahara Shop to buy Spirit Cards, costumes, 
 event graphics, character graphics, bonus graphics, background music, sound effects, and character 
 voices.
  
  
  Spirit Cards you buy can be put into your deck, which you use during a fight to give you advantages 
 or put other players at a disadvantage for a certain amount of time. You may have 5 decks.
  
  The one thing I couldn't stand in the first one that they didn't change in this one is the 
 fact that each characters special and super attacks can be preformed either with the right button 
 combinations (quite a lot like Street Fighter) OR by simply taping Sp. A, Sp. B, Sp. C, Sp. D, Sp. E, 
 SuperA, SuperB, SuperC on the touch screen ~ NOTE: this is the most Special and Super attacks any 
 one character can have, most characters have less attacks.
  
  So for some this may come as a disappointment, because the point of a fighting game is learning 
 the moves - but for others this may be a great feature, and it's certainly great for younger gamers.
 
  
  Sadly, I can't say much about the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Or the single card play. But the multicard 
 play is really fun, me and my brother still play it at least an hour or two a day. This game IS 
 a 'Must Own', no doubt about it. This is the perfect Bleach game, as well as the perfect fighter 
 on the Nintendo DS. Go get it.

Review:  This game is just OWNAGE. The graphics compared to the first are godly, the sounds are amazing, 
 everything IS amazing.
  
  So, instead of going by the original storyline, it has parts. They are missions to complete. Some 
 of them are collect this number of items before the time runs out. Those can be boring, like the 
 ikkaku one. Other ones are protect hanatarou, and just plain fighting. My favorite mission would 
 be kill three Menos grande. Also, there is more then forty characters in this game that all almost 
 all even. Believe me, this game owns. I played about 20 DS games, and only the bleach games let 
 me play for a long time not caring.
  There is also wifi, so it doesn't matter if you have friends who have the game. I know two people 
 @ my school who have the first, and none with the second. So, if I feel like fighting someone, 
 I will go on a forum and ask.
  
  The learning curve is about 9 hours, which is the time I've been playing it. I barely play the 
 first, cuz this one is overall better.

Review:  I had got this from a friend and got more addicted to it ever since i played it. It is packed with 
 a complete story mode and 44 characters. The story mode is fairly lengthed and you have to go through 
 it a few times to get everything. The controls are intuitve, the extra buttons are fun and the 
 card deck adds a little twist to the game. All of the characters have their own specialty and variety 
 of moves. THIS IS THE MOST AWESOME GAME TO GET, EVER! There is even ds download play with all of 
 the characters and stages.

Review:  BLEACH DS 2nd is the fighter-sequel that all gamers would like to take part in. Sticking true to 
 its original roots, updating the roster, adding stronger move lists, and a variety of enhancing 
 cards make this the best portable BLEACH game on the market. Although the graphics are nothing 
 in comparison to its competitor on the PSP (Heat the Soul 1-4) , the DS sticks strong to its 2D 
 fighting style and steps it up a couple notches. The story mode is much more complex, original, 
 and a blast to go through! As a matter of fact, you cannot fully accomplish the story mode in one 
 run, so the game almost forces you to have to play it again. Which, trust me, is not a bad thing. 
 The new, updated roster is much more fun, especially with characters like Matsumoto, Ikkaku, and 
 Urahara, and the addition of such characters like Grand Fisher, Shrieker, Menos Grande, and Ririn 
 make for some funny matches against friends. The online. Lets talk about the online. BLEACH DS 
 2nd did exactly what it needed to do to make this game better than the first, and that was add 
 more servers for a stronger internet connection. The difference between the two games is beyond 
 comparison, with the 2nd being far superior to its predecessor in connection speed, logging in, 
 and being able to fight randomly over the server. However, with all the good, there is bound to 
 be some negativity. The graphics, for a system that can do better, could have been much more detailed. 
 Some characters looked poorly made and added very last minute. Some characters that were added 
 almost seemed to be a waste of roster-space. Huge fans of the series would be disappointed with 
 the lack of playable Arrancar and Vizards, since the PSP series featured playable characters much 
 earlier than the DS. But all around, BLEACH DS 2nd is by far the best fighter-game out for the 
 DS at the moment. It holds tons of playtime and a whole lot of replay value due to its online abilities. 
 Fans of the series will be thoroughly please with what this game has to offer.

Review:  When i first heard of bleach i thought of the house hold cleaning product, now when i say bleach 
 i talk about not only the anime series but also the game. Its gameplay has significantly improved 
 over the last one, now you can actually understand what exactly is going on and the terms to clear 
 the stages are clearly expressed though it is in japanese. There aren't many problems understanding 
 how to play, but it would still be better if it were in english as plot might be lost in translation. 
 Here's the breakdown:
  Gameplay- The gameplay is very simple, use the control pad to move, the a, x, y buttons to attack 
 and dash is b, then there's block with R and moving between sections with L, the incorporation 
 of the touch pad as a power-up card stack is very ingenious, most if not all fighting games on 
 the DS don't have that. Understanding how to play is very easy, taking more or less 30 minutes 
 to know how to fight.
  Sound- The sound qualities on the DS is surprisingly good, more or less as good as the previous 
 games, the voice acting of the characters is also great even if you don't understand what they 
 are saying.
  Graphics- The quality of the graphics is surprisingly good especially for the DS, it feels like 
 you are playing on a High-def TV more than it does on a hand-held console. The movies in between 
 Bankais or specials is very impressive.
  All in all, this is a great game and everyone who loves bleach or is just getting into the craze 
 should get this game, if you don't have a DS, Buy one then get this game!

Review:  Bleach DS 2nd is an excellent fighter for the DS. I can't say its the best because I have not tried 
 any other fighters on the DS (Jump Super and Ultimate Stars) . However, I can say is that you do 
 not need to be a fan of the anime series to enjoy this addictive game. Each fighter is unique so 
 try out everyone and see which one suits your playing style the best. The multiplayer is awesome 
 but, the wifi lags a little bit. Also, get use to getting destroyed by the Japanese players but, 
 trust me when you do beat them its such a sweet victory. The game is very import friendly, you 
 will be scrolling through the menus like a pro in no time. The sounds is a little rough but you 
 only notice it when you have headphones on. Overall this game is excellent and a must buy for any 
 2d fighter fan!!!

Review:  I've learned to hate anime over the years of growing up and I do not understand why people love 
 this series so much, but I do however, understand why people love the game. For those who think 
 a company like Sega can not make decent games anymore, just remember that they have Treasure. Yes, 
 the developers of Gunstar Heroes made this game. Because of this, players can immerse in fast paced 
 fighting action that replicates the action found in the show fairly accurately. Not to mention, 
 the usage of cards allows players to discover new levels of strategy not found in many current 
 fighting games.
  
  This also allows players to fight opponents and finish them off much quicker than they would by 
 just using pure brawn and combos. Due to this game alone, one could actually wonder if other 2D 
 fighting games can exist on the DS. The game is executed flawlessly from start to finish. The fighting 
 is FAST with either no or little lag time. Watching your characters fly across the screen and unleash 
 a devastating combo allows gamers to really get hooked on the game.
  
  Not to mention, this game also adds other great things than their licensed characters. The constant 
 unlocking of cards allows players to continue and change their card variations to see which cards 
 benefit them the most. Not to mention, the game incorporates the Nintendo Wi-Fi service, allowing 
 players to unleash their fury with others around the world.
  
  If players love the quick action of games such as Marvel Vs Capcom, then players will definitely 
 immerse themselves in a wonderful gem such as Bleach 2nd. Unlike other franchises that just slap 
 characters into one game just to appeal to fans, Bleach is one of those games that proves us otherwise. 
 Good job Treasure, you live up to your name.

Review:  Bleach DS 2nd is a very well done game. How so?
  
  Graphics: For a 2d fighter on the ds, this beats Jump Ultimate Stars. The graphics are smooth, 
 vibrant, and truly fitting to the manga and anime. The screenshots on Gamespot don't do it justice; 
 it just looks great in motion.
  
  Some special attacks have videos in between, and I must say, I've never seen any better video quality. 
 There is no pixelation at all. This is like DVD quality on your DS.
  
  Sound: Top notch for the DS. Actually, the game is stored on a 128 megabit rom card, and the only 
 other games that have that are Elite Beat Agents and Hotel Dusk. This means that there is a lot 
 of room made for sound, and this game does not skimp on it.
  
  Gameplay: Well, this is the most important part. The game has a 4 player mode, in which they are 
 on the same field, however the field is divided into a upper and lower part. You can jump into 
 either part of the field and fight off everyone or play it safer and fight only 1 person while 
 the other two fight it out. Unlike Guilty Gear Dust Strikers, the four player scheme is done superbly.
 
  
  Initiating combos and specials are a task, especially if you dont know the buttons for A, B, X 
 and Y (for some reason, they use Japanese characters in the command list) , however it easily pays 
 off to learn some of them.
  
  Overall, this game is a must have for anyone that wants a good fighter.

Review:  Bleach DS 2nd: Kokui Hirameku Requiem is the second installment of the Bleach series on the DS. 
 The series is a unique fighting game on the DS. This game maintains that image extremely well. 
 That being said it also felt more like an update rather than a true sequel. Most of the new characters 
 that have been added have a terrible move set and for the most part those who have played the original 
 will stick with the original characters as well as those new to the series. The story mode is a 
 very nice addition to the game but the story itself is disappointing. Some of the older modes from 
 the old game have been changed for better or worse. Survival mode for example now allows you to 
 continuously earn money rather than stopping after 20 fights and forcing you to win 100; however, 
 the amount of money you earn is significantly less. Also Arcade, Time Attack, and Survival mode 
 now have a feature to play either 1 on 1 or 2 on 2 which provides a new experience but will more 
 often hinder than help you. Also the gallery mode which was a iconic feature of the first game 
 due to its dual screen images is still here but has much fewer images and no dual screen images. 
 Overall here's how it did in the following categories:
  
  Graphics: the graphics are a significant improvement over the original. Many of the characters 
 from the original that may have looked a little pixelated have been cleaned up. the attention to 
 detail in this game is very nice. things such as byakuya's scarf blowing as he launches his special 
 A and the bells on kenpachi's hair are all modeled very well and finally hitsugaya has his proper 
 bankai which looks gorgeous.
  
  Gameplay: the gameplay is a very street fighter-esque fighting style. three buttons control the 
 attack buttons one button to block one to switch planes and one to perform a flash step. combos 
 can also be performed with button combinations or by touching the appropriate button on the touch 
 screen. the gameplay has remained mostly the same from the first game with few tweaks in some of 
 the original characters which is a good or bad thing depending on who you are playing as. The time 
 a character can remain in his bankai has decreased quite a bit from the original. The card system 
 is still there and a new reiju system has been added which give the characters permanent stat boosts 
 which is nice. Sound: the sound remains just as clear and crisp. All the new characters have their 
 voices in perfectly and the voices of the original characters remain fabulous. the soundtrack in 
 this game seems a bit less comforting than the first one but still gets the job done
  
  Overall Bleach DS 2nd is a game that may appeal more to fans of the series but nonetheless is a 
 great game that any fighting fan should check out.

Review:  When i played the first one... its was addictive yet frustrating because its in jap. But... The 
 gameplay can keep you goin for hours without getting tired of it
  
  Here's the poop
  
  The game is like a fast pace game... Its like guilty gear with its own style of fighting. Each 
 character has its own skills and weapons (Duh!) . You can punch, kick, use your weapon, dash and 
 of course do special. You can have 4 players at once. It can be all-out or 2 on 2 battle.
  
  The graphics is like the last game with improvements on the actions. Some of the moves was 
 given more emphasis than before.
  
  The story mode can be easily understood not like the last game. Each stage has its own goals and 
 makes it harder to play.
  
  It will take a long time to complete everything... Its fun and can be cool to play against other 
 people. So... this is my review... its not that good.... but here you go...
