:::Review:::
7 Wonders is a competent clone of a competent Bejeweled clone that does little to set itself apart. 
 

  Success breeds imitation, and in the world of video games this is no more apparent than in the 
 realm of puzzle games. Casual game company PopCap struck gold with Bejeweled, a simple and addictive 
 grid-based gem-matching game, and it wasn't long before competing casual game company iWin conjured 
 up its own, Mayan-themed Bejeweled knockoff called Jewel Quest. Now MumboJumbo is getting in on 
 the action with 7 Wonders of the Ancient World for the DS, which cribs more directly from Jewel 
 Quest than Bejeweled, effectively making 7 Wonders a knockoff of a knockoff.  

  As a Bejeweled knockoff, 7 Wonders plays about how you'd expect. Each level consists of a grid 
 of different-colored runes that you can shuffle around to create rows or columns of three or more 
 like-colored runes in order to make those runes disappear. In 7 Wonders, each level is themed after 
 one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, which include the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Hanging 
 Gardens of Babylon, the Temple of Artemis, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the Mausoleum of Maussollos, 
 the Colossus of Rhodes, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria.  

           Ironically, one of the seven wonders isn't, 'I wonder why they made this game.'      

 
  The game operates under the premise that you're actually building the seven wonders by completing 
 these puzzles. You have to clear runes on every space of the grid at least once, and you have to 
 move a special building block from the top of the grid all the way to the bottom, all while working 
 against the clock. The shape of the grid changes from level to level, and clearing out runes in 
 some of the corners can get tricky, though special row-clearing runes that appear when you create 
 rows of four or five runes make short work of those hard-to-reach spaces, ultimately killing much 
 of the difficulty in 7 Wonders. And, as grand as the ancient-wonder-building premise might sound, 
 all it really means is that you get a slightly different wallpaper and background music every few 
 levels. Even then, the art is uninspired, relying heavily on drab earth tones, and the music is 
 generic.  

  You'll likely grow tired of the story mode before you work your way through all seven wonders, 
 which leaves you with the predictable free play mode as well as the rune quest mode, which changes 
 things up by challenging you to clear a number of specific types of runes before you're allowed 
 to advance. The rune quest mode is one of the few interesting bits in 7 Wonders. There are no multiplayer 
 modes to liven things up -- it's just you and the wonders -- though as a semiconsolation you can read 
 short descriptions of each of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World in the game.  

  With more inventive Bejeweled-inspired games like Puzzle Quest available for the DS, there's no 
 reason to settle for something like 7 Wonders of the Ancient World. The lack of multiplayer is 
 a serious omission, and what's there just feels like a photocopy of a more inspired game that we've 
 already played.

Review:  7 Wonders of the Ancient world is essentially a clone of Jewel Quest, but with a different cosmetic 
 face and a few minor tweaks. If you've ever played Jewel Quest, you've played this game. 
  Every stage (8 in all) has you matching gems according to color. For every set of three you match, 
 a building block is raised up to workers on the top screen, who heave it away to add to the Wonder 
 you're currently on. Match a set of four, and you get an explosive block that clears away an entire 
 row of gems. The goal in each level is to not only match gems, but to do so over every square of 
 the grid, until you've matched gems across the whole thing. Once all squares have been cleared, 
 you must get a cornerstone gem piece to the bottom of the grid to finish the level.
  In between stages, you can read historical information about the different wonders of the ancient 
 world, which is a neat, albeit an afterthought.
  I gave this game a 7.5 because it's not bad, its just nothing new. But again, if you like Bejeweled 
 or especially Jewel Quest, you'll like this because it's essentially the same game.

Review:  In a simple sum up, 7 Wonders is a puzzle game. The meat and bones of it is that you match up the 
 colored runes in lines of three or more to blast away chunks of rock used to make up the seven 
 wonders of the world. It is a simple game, more of a time-waster really. There are a few different 
 options of gameplay (Ok -- three different options) , but you have to unlock the other options with 
 the Story mode first. Each wonder in story mode takes about 5 puzzles to complete, and a bonus 
 mode to move on to the next wonder. After completing the 7 wonders, you unlock the way to complete 
 the CIty of Atlantis. 
  
  It's pretty fun to watch your workers on the top screen... they do some pretty funny stuff... The 
 music on there is pretty basic, too -- but it fits the theme. 
  
  Look to spend a couple of hours to beat the three mastery levels in the game. If you beat mastery 
 level 3 and still have lives left (they only allow a max of 5 lives) , you repeat mastery level 
 3 over and over and over

Review:  Everyone that I have talked to about 7 Wonder's has said the same thing, Another Bejeweled Game". 
 Yes, the game is similar but it's still a lot of fun. I have spent many evening's playing 7 Wonders 
 and i really find it entertaining and challeging. I'ts a game that once you get going with it you 
 really can't put it down. There are some really easy levels of the game and then there is some 
 not so easy levels. I wouldn't say that the game is hard because all you are doing is removing 
 the same color gems three or four in a row. I recommend this game for all ages. The Graphics are 
 nice and the music is good too. So if you are looking for a decent puzzle game, pick-up 7 Wonders. 
 The price of the game won't bankrupt you either.

Review:  Really this game is just bejeweled. As you play your little helpers take your blocks and build 
 the ancient wonders of the world. Then the game ends. I am a fan of bejeweled so I found this enjoyable, 
 but I can see where the ratings would have been bad because this game offers nothing but. 
  
  If you love bejeweled and want more from a game then just that, don't buy it. But if you are 
 looking for something to pass the time on that boring cross country flight, this'll do it! Check 
 the bargain bin for it, otherwise avoid paying more then $10.
