Peggle Dual Shot is a faithful translation of the addictive peg-and-ball puzzler. 

  After mesmerizing millions of PC gamers with its simple yet oddly enthralling gameplay, Peggle 
 has arrived on the Nintendo DS. Peggle is a puzzle game that incorporates elements of pinball and 
 the popular Japanese gaming machine Pachinko. You shoot a ball down into a field of pegs, aiming 
 to hit particular pegs to clear the level or gain power-ups. Although the action is very basic, 
 there's something quite engaging about taking careful aim and watching your ball bounce its way 
 to the bottom. Peggle Dual Shot accurately re-creates the fun of the original, and though the price 
 and multiplayer options leave much to be desired, there are enough levels here to satisfy folks 
 looking for some light puzzle fun.  

           Whittling down the web is surprisingly fun.      

  The gameplay is quite simple. Each 
 level presents you with a field of pegs, both circular and rectangular. Using the rotating launcher 
 at the top, you aim your ball and fire it down into the field. Once your ball drops to the bottom 
 of the screen, the pegs that you hit are eliminated and you get to take another shot. You can use 
 the stylus or D pad to adjust the trajectory or zoom in for a more precise shot, but the stylus 
 is the smoothest option, even though there is a small risk of readjusting your aim accidentally 
 when you go to hit the launch button. You have a limited amount of shots, but landing your ball 
 in the moving bucket at the bottom of the screen will grant you a free ball.  

  Most of the pegs are blue and merely earn you points when you clear them. If you clear all of the 
 orange pegs, you pass the level. The two green pegs activate power-ups that can be immensely useful 
 and offer new strategic considerations. These include multiball (instantly spawns another ball) , 
 flippers (pinball-esque paddles appear for a few shots) , a fireball (burns through pegs without 
 bouncing) , a zen ball (optimizes your shot trajectory) , and more. There is also a purple peg that 
 spawns in a new spot every turn. Hitting this will boost your score, and hitting it a bunch of 
 times in one level will send you to a bonus round in which you can earn bigger points and extra 
 balls.  

  Peggle Dual Shot's fun comes from the satisfaction of clearing a level or making a particularly 
 skillful shot. Great shots are rewarded with specific bonuses triggered by certain conditions, 
 such as making a particularly long ricochet. Earning these is fun, especially because they often 
 come as a surprise. The first few shots of each level rely a lot on luck; given that there are 
 so many pegs, your ball will bounce around quite a lot before dropping out. As you clear away pegs, 
 you'll rely more on precise aiming, and be rewarded with bigger point bonuses. This gradual rebalancing 
 of luck and skill is what makes Peggle so easy to enjoy. You can excel if you hone your skills, 
 but the element of luck means that the game is very forgiving. If your shot doesn't go well, you 
 can dismiss it as unlucky; if you get some lucky bounces, you can feel great about it. Skill-focused 
 players can rack up incredible scores, but more-casual players can still have fun and succeed. 

           The top screen displays some helpful information. As a bonus, you get Jimmy Lightning 
 and his bumpin' arboreal sound system.      

  There are a few different modes in Peggle Dual Shot, but none of them vary too much from the core 
 gameplay. The Adventure mode introduces you to 10 characters, each with a unique power-up and five 
 levels for you to beat. This mode includes two campaigns: Peggle and Peggle Nights. With 11 five-level 
 stages in each mode, plus bonus unlockable stages, there is a lot of Peggle to be played. Levels 
 vary in difficulty, but you can reasonably burn through most of them in a matter of hours. Quick 
 Play mode lets you play stages that you've beaten and aim for higher scores, and Duel mode lets 
 you face off against a computer opponent or a friend. The only wireless option is to send your 
 friend a one-level trial of the game, so multiplayer matches require you to pass the DS back and 
 forth repeatedly. Computer opponents can provide a tough challenge, even for skilled players, but 
 it's a shame that there's no way to face off with two DSs or upload scores to online leaderboards. 

  Peggle Dual Shot is a simple game that captures the addictive fun of its PC predecessor. The $30 
 price tag is too high for the fairly limited gameplay and weak multiplayer support, even with the 
 bevy of levels on offer. Nevertheless, there is a whole lot of fun to be had here. Watching your 
 ball bounce its way through the level and clear a path for your next shot is pleasing, and nailing 
 a great shot (be it skilled, lucky, or a bit of both) is really satisfying. Peggle: Dual Shot would 
 be easier to recommend if it was more reasonably priced, but it's still a fun puzzle game that 
 is well suited to this portable platform.

Review:  There are a lot of puzzle games for the DS, but Peggle: Dual Shot hits the top 5. There isn't a 
 story line in this game, but there is no need. 
  Peggle is very simple. You shoot a ball out of a cannon at the top of the touch screen, and watch 
 it hit the pegs hoping to hit the orange ones, and get it in the moving whole at the bottom of 
 the screen. 
  The game has great classical music throughout the game, and also humorous characters. Peggle Dual 
 Shot has multiple game modes, and two adventure modes. Peggle is extremely addicting and if your 
 not keeping track of the time the hours will just fly by. Every area has a new "trainer" who adds 
 two green pegs to the board, which have thier own unique power ups. From fireballs to flippers 
 the powerups just add to the already impressive game. 
  There isn't many negative comments about this game. Peggle can get very frustrating when you have 
 1 ball left and your an inch away from the last orange peg. Also the two adventure modes have the 
 same power ups, which was a disappointment.
