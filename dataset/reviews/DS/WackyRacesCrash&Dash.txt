:::Review:::
Stripped-down controls with little punishment for crashing make Wacky Races an extremely boring 
 racer. 

  Performance-boosting items have been a staple in mascot racing games for some time, but these arcade 
 experiences usually encompass some sort of racing structure as well. This is not true with Wacky 
 Races. You won't find a button for acceleration or brakes here -- and don't even think about powersliding. 
 This game requires only slightly more interaction than the 40-year-old cartoon on which it's based. 
 The presentation will give a nostalgic glow to anyone who remembers the Hanna-Barbera series, but 
 the actual gameplay will only produce shortness of breath and elaborate yawns.  

  Instead of using skill or savvy to make your way to the front of the pack, you need only tap the 
 stylus toward the finish line and watch your chosen hero cruise to victory. The majority of races 
 are displayed from a side view, though the camera shifts to a vertical orientation when the track 
 design demands it. If your car breaks down or falls off a bridge, you'll find yourself eating your 
 competitor's exhaust. You won't stay behind long, though. The computer AI is very forgiving, making 
 sure you stay close to your competitors no matter how poorly you perform.  

           Every race ends with a blowdown.      

  Though the track is littered with character-specific 
 items, you won't need to actually use them. It's certainly more dramatic to call in help from a 
 dragon or transform your vehicle into a rolling rock ball, but because the track design is so easy 
 to navigate, you'll find it's possible to snatch the victory crown without ever getting help from 
 the items. Like the rest of the gameplay, the items are exceptionally easy to use. Many of them 
 simply make your character move faster, which means you fly to the front of the screen only to 
 see your progress halted by the slowly scrolling screen.  

  If slowly navigating your way through poorly designed tracks doesn't excite you, you also have 
 to compete in minigames during certain segments of the race. Dick Dastardly sets up roadblocks 
 that can hinder your progress if you fall asleep midrace. These alternate between insultingly easy 
 and completely unresponsive. On the easy side, you have to connect dots or swat at lethargic mosquitoes. 
 On the unresponsive side, you have to slice up patches of poisonous fog. Oftentimes, the game will 
 not recognize your frantic stylus swipes, so you end up with a mouthful of deadly toxin. The penalty 
 for failing a minigame is slight, so there is almost no reason to take part in these mindless diversions. 

  The only portion of Wacky Races that you'll have to actually pay attention to is the final sprint 
 to the finish line. Regardless of how well you performed leading up to this point, the racers are 
 all tightly packed as they head to the end of the race. Here, you'll have to frantically blow into 
 the microphone to outpace your competitors. This is an exceptionally awful game mechanic. Not only 
 does it make the proceeding portions completely irrelevant, but it's also tiring and mindless. 
 It is nice being able to win a race even if you had some bad luck in the early goings, but this 
 design decision makes the vast majority of your racing experience worthless.  

           Lazily tap the mosquitoes to pass this minigame.      

  The visuals, at least, closely 
 mirror the cartoons on which this game is based. The characters aren't very detailed, but they 
 are full of vibrant colors, and it's easy to identify your favorite racer. The sound is true to 
 the source material; the music is appropriately happy and the sound effects do justice to the silly 
 items. There is also a commentator who calls out all the important developments in a race. He gets 
 repetitive after a while, but he adds a bit of flair to the dreary gameplay.  

  Wacky Races is just too simple for its own good. The dearth of skill needed to win races makes 
 this game tiresome, especially when you realize how little your input actually affects the outcome. 
 Even with friends, this becomes boring long before you finish the first track. An accurate representation 
 of the cartoon will only give you a short burst of happy nostalgia before the crushingly dull gameplay 
 squashes your fond memories. There is no reason to play this game.

Review:  It's much easier to write a review for this poorly conceived mess than to actually play it. Not 
 that the gameplay is complicated - you can do whatever you like, even completely screw up the racing 
 portion, so long as you're good at blowing into a microphone. If you aren't (and I'm not, particularly) 
 then expect to repeatedly lose regardless of what you do.
  
  Not that the single play portion is broken, it's just not any fun. None at all. If this game had 
 at least some multiplayer mode, at least a local multiplayer, it might have been passably amusing 
 as a party game. But instead racer is single player only, and that mode sinly isn't pleasant to 
 play. It looks as if the programmers put as little effort into making this game as they could manage, 
 and still fulfill their contract.
  
  A complete let-down. Even at $5 it would be a total rip-off.

Review:  Ah, Wacky Races. What a part of my childhood. I remember watching this along with Laff-A-Lympics 
 on Saturday mornings. Now everyone thinks I'm ancient. 
  
  First Impression:
  Oh look! A childhood fandom! Will I be able to have fun and reminisce the insane episodes and the 
 randomness of it all? More importantly, will I be able to play as Dick Dastardly? Let's find out, 
 shall we?
  
  Gameplay:
  I was expecting a racing game. You know. You're in control of a character in a car and you try 
 to beat other racers. I was expecting control using the directional pads and have a camera angle 
 akin to Mario Kart. 
  Oh man, was I wrong. 
  
  Wacky Races puts you behind the wheel with the entire cast at your disposal. There's no one to 
 unlock. Everyone's there to begin with, from the Slag Brothers to Penelope Pitstop minus Dick Dastardly. 
 There are no alternate cars to unlock, no extra powers, nothing but an alternate difficulty setting. 
 THAT'S IT.
  The rallies play like an episode of Wacky Races: you have three tracks to race in and in the middle 
 of the races, Dick Dastardly tries to stop you from advancing by sabotage and dirty sneaky tactics. 
 In the game, these are represented by mini games. If you pass, you retain your race position. If 
 you fail, you end up at the back, bringing up the rear.
  Much like the cartoon, you also get powers. There's an offensive booster which helps you speed 
 up and damages your opponents' cars, an offensive which has you poking the other cars to damage 
 them, an aerial power which has you flying over the rest of the cars and a booster that makes you 
 zoom right ahead of the competition. You activate these powers by tapping the icon when it becomes 
 available after you pick up a powerup on the track.
  
  Everything is controlled via the STYLUS. Yes, you heard me. The stylus. You put the stylus in front 
 of your car and move it in the direction you want to turn. There's no way to accelerate or slow 
 down. Now I don't know about you... but that makes racing a bit.. I don't know.. Awkward?
  And the last stretch to the finish like... Oh BOY. 
  This involves BLOWING into the microphone 
 and scratching on the touch screen with your stylus while your car goes on autopilot. Why? I don't 
 know. It works. I don't know why. But it works. 
  
  Once you get used to it, however, it's.... alright.
  
  Last words:
  It's alright for a quick 
 fix. If I was looking for a racer, I'd still pick up Mario Kart.
