:::Review:::
Monster Bomber isn't as complicated as some puzzlers, but its quick pace and hands-on nature are 
 undeniably appealing. 

  If you could toss Space Invaders, Bust-A-Move, and air hockey into a blender, the result would 
 probably turn out something like Monster Bomber. Majesco's latest budget puzzler takes the falling 
 alien concept from Space Invaders and puts a new spin on it. Instead of shooting the descending 
 invaders with lasers fired from a plain old spaceship, you eliminate the colorful ghastlies on 
 the upper screen by flinging like-colored balls at them from the touch screen. There isn't a ton 
 of strategy involved, and there aren't a lot of play modes, but the game's quick pace and hands-on 
 nature should appeal to a number of people, especially those who prefer to get their game on in 
 brief bursts throughout the day.  

          You fling explosive balls at aliens using the touch screen.     

  Like in any decent 
 puzzler, the underlying concept is fairly simple. Aliens on the top screen are slowly working their 
 way downward. If they shatter the shield at the bottom of the screen and cross over onto the touch-screen 
 area, the game ends. Your job is to push them back and obliterate them by flinging balls upward 
 from the touch screen. To generate a ball, you simply have to touch one of the colored bins. You 
 can then position it anywhere on the touch screen and send it sailing by dragging the stylus upward. 
 If the color of the ball matches the color of the alien, the alien will explode. If the ball doesn't 
 match the monster, however, the alien will be shoved backward a little bit and will multiply into 
 two aliens. That sounds like a bad outcome, but it's actually where all of the strategy lies. If 
 you shove one alien into another alien that matches the color of the ball, or if at some point 
 down the line you shove an entire group of aliens into another alien that's the same color as the 
 ball, the entire group will explode. Do you take out the lone aliens with a single shot, or do 
 you try to take out a big group of the little buggers and risk creating more of them? That's the 
 split-second decision you have to make second after second as the round goes on.  

  Despite the strategy that's involved in taking out whole groups, you can get by a large part of 
 the time by flicking a ball upward and hoping for the best. The play field on the upper screen 
 is so large and there are so many aliens up there that chances are you'll shove one of them into 
 a compatriot that's the same color as the ball. If you're playing in the scenario mode, some rounds 
 involve creating chains of a specific size. Flicking balls randomly won't work in those stages. 
 However, since the scenario mode always lets you pick from two upcoming stages, and one usually 
 involves simply obliterating a certain number of aliens, you can generally stick to the stages 
 that are better suited to random shots if that suits your style of play. Puzzle purists may also 
 be disappointed that the aliens aren't fixed into position as they move downward. Unlike in a traditional 
 puzzle game, such as Tetris or Bust-A-Move, where the pieces are fixed into position, the aliens 
 in Monster Bomber squirm and sidle about as they make their journey toward the touch screen. Since 
 aliens don't stay clustered for very long, it's difficult to set up massive chains. Sometimes, 
 a chain that you thought would occur doesn't pan out because the lynchpin alien in the middle squirmed 
 out of the way. For better and for worse, luck is just as much a factor in Monster Bomber as skill 
 is.  

  Rounds don't last for hours. The aliens scurry downward at a brisk pace, and they get faster as 
 time goes by, so most rounds take only a minute or two to play out. When the round ends, you can 
 start a new one to try to top your score or simply fold the system up and put it back in your pocket. 
 This is a good game to have along on the bus or on breaks, when you want to get your game on but 
 just don't have a ton of time to kill. Unfortunately, there aren't many play modes to pick from. 
 There's a scenario mode, where you can work through five of 20 different stages and see a short 
 ending sequence, and there's a survival mode, which lets you see how long you can last on any of 
 those 20 stages. The goals in the scenario stages require you to either take out a certain number 
 of aliens or create a certain number of chains involving a set number of aliens, so there's not 
 much variety there. Primarily, you'll keep playing the game because you enjoy playing it, not because 
 it has a bunch of missions and unlockables. Beyond that, there's also a multiplayer mode, where 
 as many as four players can compete to see who can survive the longest. The game uses the DS download 
 play feature, so only one cartridge is required.  

          If you knock an alien into a clump and one of the aliens matches the color of the ball, 
 they'll all explode.     

  As with most puzzle games, the presentation is hardly worth talking about. The selection boxes 
 in the menus are sufficiently large to make traversing the menus and choosing options with the 
 stylus an easy process. During the game, the lower touch-screen area simply holds the colored bins 
 and the launching area, while the upper screen displays a background scene and all of the tiny 
 aliens. The background scenes are static, but the artwork is drawn in a manga style that's charming 
 and appropriate. Besides the ball, the aliens are the only objects in the game that move. They're 
 extremely squirmy, as aliens are supposed to be, but their animated eyes and mouths are also cute 
 and nonthreatening. As for the audio, the music consists of the typical variety of forgettable 
 instrumental melodies that all puzzle games not called Lumines have, and the sound effects consist 
 of a modest selection of pops, explosions, and bizarre gurgles that generally fit with what happens 
 on the screen. The game was definitely designed around the system's touch screen and not its audiovisual 
 horsepower.  

  All in all, Monster Bomber is definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a fast-paced 
 puzzle game that's good for short bursts of play. It isn't the most intricate puzzler out there, 
 but it serves up plenty of fun for its $20 asking price.
