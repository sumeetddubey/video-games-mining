:::Review:::
Even fond memories of the 1989 original can't disguise the fact that Populous isn't relevant or 
 fun almost 20 years later. 

  Populous deserves its place in the history books. The Bullfrog god sim was revolutionary back in 
 1989, a genre-changing masterpiece that altered the landscape for strategy gaming in more ways 
 than one. But it's probably better left as a memory. This remake for the Nintendo DS is an exercise 
 in nostalgia that will be enjoyed only by old-timers who experienced the original in all its late-'80s 
 glory. While you have to give the developers credit for sticking tight to the 20-year-old design 
 in an era of glitz and glam, you also have to wonder how anyone could have thought that such an 
 ancient game could fly in 2008.  

           Playing divine landscaper can still be fun in short bursts.      

  Populous for the 
 DS is still a straightforward god game where you take on the role of one of five good elemental 
 deities overseeing the development of towns at the same time as a rival demon is building up a 
 similar community of followers on the other side of the map. You play a divine landscaper of sorts. 
 Most of your world-building efforts are confined to leveling terrain so that worshippers can promote 
 your greatness through the construction of ever more elaborate homes. More houses leads to more 
 happy, healthy people, who are needed at the end of each level to smack down the enemy demon's 
 goons in an Armageddon free-for-all determining who gets to be all Zeus-like and who doesn't. Win 
 this fight in the Challenge mode solo campaign (there is also Wi-Fi multiplayer support for up 
 to four players) and you'll move on to do it all over again against another big bad demon in another 
 world.  

  All you'll really need to do is find a balance between three tasks: alter enough terrain to provide 
 for the best possible building opportunities; keep an eye on the health of your worshippers via 
 their spirit scores; and leave your worshippers enough time off in their homes to get in the groveling 
 needed to boost your divine power, called psyche energy. Because your drones can't worship while 
 building, yet will die if they don't have proper shelter, you'll have to fiddle around so you don't 
 wind up building-rich and psyche-poor. Worshippers, buildings, and psyche are all vital components 
 in winning a level. You'll need people to build and fight the final battle, homes to keep people 
 alive and provide places for worship, and psyche to fire up miracles that devastate demon settlements. 
 Nothing sets back town-building like an inopportune meteor strike or an earthquake.  

  But where the strategy involved here seemed deep and imaginative in 1989, today it comes off as 
 shallow and predictable. There just isn't enough variety here to keep you interested beyond a couple 
 of levels, although each has at least been given distinct buildings and features that help and 
 hinder your godly tasks. You fight for divine provenance over everything from generic grass plains, 
 snowfields, and Persian-inspired deserts to special realms such as a fairy tale world based on 
 Candyland, a horror land with gothic castles, and 8-Bit Plain, where worshippers build consoles 
 and handheld gaming systems from Nintendo's storied past. Some levels have hardier worshippers, 
 some weaker. Others have terrain restrictions making it harder to build houses. Building on the 
 lava-strewn magma level isn't easy, for example.  

  Still, gameplay basics never change much, even with these variables. So you'll quickly fall into 
 a pattern of pulling terrain up and down, taking consolidation breaks to allow worship and psyche 
 to build up, and launching disasters whenever your enemy seems to be making too much progress. 
 After the initial nostalgic rush wears off, you won't be able to play for longer than a few minutes 
 at a time without getting bored. So even though this might seem to be an epic strategy game, you 
 have to play it in short, one-level-at-a-time spurts as you would a puzzle game or one of the minigame 
 collections that the DS does so well. Not that there's necessarily anything wrong with that, although 
 having to chew the game in bite-size chunks is certainly much different than the full-blown obsession 
 that had people playing the original for untold hours on end back in 1989.  

           Your followers may call volcano eruptions miracles, but they're really just good old-fashioned 
 natural disasters.      

  At least the touch-screen-only interface is outstanding. The game makes such tremendous use of 
 the stylus to manipulate terrain that you might stick around for an extra couple of levels just 
 to play with this feature. All landscaping is handled on the bottom screen, with the end results 
 being displayed on the main map screen above. It works pretty much seamlessly and is perfectly 
 intuitive, with the only niggle being how it can be more difficult to grab onto terrain at the 
 edges of the screen. Graphics are also pretty good, if a bit on the archaic side, presumably to 
 give the game more retro cred. Each level has a unique look that provides added personality through 
 its buildings, which run from candy mansions to old Nintendo consoles like the SNES, but the terrain 
 itself is bland and people are just tiny blobs. The Armageddon battle is more goofy than dramatic, 
 with these little folks waddling toward one another and then slap-fighting until only one survivor 
 remains. Audio is nearly nonexistent, with sound effects that you barely take notice of during 
 levels and a variable soundtrack that comes off as more of a blah ode to the 16-bit era than anything 
 distinctive.  

  If you're young enough to think the Commodore Amiga is some kind of hat worn in the Mexican navy, 
 Populous for the Nintendo DS is probably not for you. All this remake shows us is that 1989 was 
 a long time ago, and that Populous needs a proper reimagining along the lines of Sid Meier's Pirates! 
 to be relevant to a modern world.
