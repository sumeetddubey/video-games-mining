:::Review:::
Dragon Ball Z: Harukanaru Densetsu's attempt to do something different with card battling, while 
 commendable, doesn't compensate for its shallow gameplay. 

  A big part of the niche appeal of card-battle video games can be attributed to their relative complexity. 
 Unfortunately, this complexity also tends to alienate the majority of players. And that these games 
 often assume familiarity with real-world collectible card games doesn't help matters, either. Dragon 
 Ball Z: Harukanaru Densetsu attempts to address this by offering a simplified card-battling system 
 and couching it in a story mode that makes the whole experience more accessible. In the process, 
 though, the game loses much of the strategizing that makes card battling fun.  

          Simplified card battling makes Harukanaru Densetsu easy to pick up.     

  Dragon Ball 
 Z: Harukanaru Densetsu is essentially like the old playing-card game War -- two players draw cards 
 against each other, and the player with the higher card wins -- except with a few layers of nonsense 
 piled on top. During a battle, each combatant has a five-card hand -- no more, no less. Every card 
 has three defining characteristics -- power value, guard value, and action type. The power and guard 
 values simply determine that card's offensive and defensive levels, while the action type determines 
 what the card actually does. There are eight different types of actions, including a straightforward 
 attack action, the ability to raise the power and guard values of the cards currently in your hand, 
 the ability to swap cards with your enemy, and more.  

  Playing a card is simple, since you don't have to worry about card placement or tapping mana points 
 or anything like that. Just select a card from your hand, and your opponent will do the same. Whichever 
 card has a higher power value will generally win, at which point the difference between the winning 
 card's power value and the losing card's guard value will determine how much damage the loser takes. 
 This goes back and forth, with a new card from your imaginary deck taking the place in your hand 
 of any cards that have been played, until one combatant's life bar is depleted. It's terribly easy 
 to pick up, and the game offers a painstakingly detailed tutorial to make sure everything is crystal 
 clear. The problem is that by stripping out elements like card placement and tapping mana points, 
 luck becomes a much greater factor. Since the power value of the card you're playing all but determines 
 whether the card will have any positive impact for you, it's mostly a matter of luck as to whether 
 the card you play will outrank your opponent's. Not to belabor the point, but it really does feel 
 an awful lot like War.  

  There are card combos to consider that potentially make the action more involved and, hence, more 
 interesting. If you have multiple cards in your hand with the same power  or  guard value, you 
 can play them at once, adding up whatever the common value is. It still mostly comes down to whether 
 you've got good cards in your hand, but it's useful if you've got lousy cards that you just need 
 to get rid of. It's just too bad that the story mode takes its sweet time introducing card combos. 
 You'll probably be a good four hours or so into the game before guard combos are even introduced. 

  The story mode, which sleepwalks through the same, tired Dragon Ball Z story arcs that have been 
 used to prop up countless other DBZ games, adds another layer to the action by having you seek 
 out your enemies on a map screen in a series of separate scenarios. The same hand of cards you 
 use in the card battling are used here as well, with the power value of the card you play during 
 a given turn determining how many spaces you'll move and the guard value determining whether you'll 
 be able to avoid engaging in a random-encounter card battle. The goal in any particular scenario 
 is usually just to chase down and beat up any number of opponents, though there's also plenty of 
 meaningless wandering around that's seemingly designed to force you into more random-encounter 
 card battles.  

          Having to play through the same tedious scenarios multiple times is a chore.     

  
 What's most exasperating about the scenarios is that after you've spent a bunch of time toiling 
 about the map and getting into a series of relatively easy card battles, the process will usually 
 culminate in a battle against a foe that's significantly more powerful than any of the enemies 
 you've faced up to that point. If you lose this card battle, you'll have to start that scenario 
 from scratch. With an average scenario lasting about a half-hour, the prospect of having to go 
 through all that tedium just for an opportunity to advance to the next scenario is a grim one. 
 That you'll be subjected to the same looping battle music and repetitive 2D animations doesn't 
 help matters.  

  There are some multiplayer options, but it's no more fun to play the game against live local opponents 
 than it is against the computer. Points should be given to Dragon Ball Z: Harukanaru Densetsu for 
 trying something that doesn't just feel like a palette-swapped Yu-Gi-Oh! game. It's certainly something 
 different, but it lacks the necessary strategy elements that actually make card-battling games 
 fun.

Review:  instead of buying this i would rather buy a disney movie game rather than this however it is sightly 
 addivetive this is a card battles featuring the playblety of picallo gohan goku and vegeta you 
 play through most of the series most famous sagas other than that this game its worth the 20$ you 
 might pay for this still its some-what fun just to pwn emenies in a single strike as well as the 
 never ending walking!!! wich to walk you use the cards the unlockable really suck all it is is 
 voices and you obtain this by collecting joke books with some really sad jokes instead pay 30$ 
 for jump superstars you would get more hours of enjoyment and no tedious card battles even though 
 it is in japanese its still a better game than this. the only unlockable even worth it is vegeta 
 and even he has to collect lame joke books as well as everybody else in this game and the real 
 fun dosent start untill the 17th mission were you can do action combos!!! and even those suck

Review:  This is'nt all that bad of a game, but it is at the same time. You really should'nt have to face 
 some of the characters that you do, like princess snake, you should only have to run away from 
 her. Once you get the power combo, the game gets harder, but kinda funner. I wouldn't really reccomend 
 this game, unless you were a hardcore DBZ fan, like a I am, (I'm both Sonic and DBZ) so, make sure 
 you can get you're money back if you don't like it. But, if you do, well, keep it. Also, be careful 
 when you run away from Vegeta as Goku, you can't win if he catches you, he always draws Z cards....
