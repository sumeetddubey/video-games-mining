:::Review:::
This mild collection of minigames isn't worth the admission price. 

  2K Play's Carnival Games is a kid-friendly collection of themed minigames that goes for quantity 
 over quality. It does offer one truly addictive attraction, but the rest of its sideshows aren't 
 worth this game's very high price. As a carny might say, only a "mark" (sucker) would pay for it, 
 but even a "sharpie" (skilled player) could have some fun.  

           Frog flipping is this carnival's main attraction.      

  To begin, you create an avatar 
 out of a small assortment of customizable features, with many more to choose from once you've won 
 the tokens to pay for them. Then you enter the carnival, which looks like a poor man's Animal Crossing. 
 You use the stylus to guide your little guy or gal about the grounds, and a map on the top screen 
 shows you where all the games are. The whole experience consists of wandering from game to game, 
 winning tickets and then cashing them in for weird accessories, such as angel wings or a monkey 
 mouth.  

  The games themselves can be grouped into three categories: trash, junk food, and pure sugar. Only 
 Frog Leap qualifies for the last group. In this hopelessly addictive game, lily pads, birds' nests, 
 and boats travel down two top-screen canals in opposite directions. The bottom screen features 
 a little wood catapult with either a frog, a duck, or a cannonball in it. The idea is to pull back 
 on the catapult and launch frogs at lily pads, ducks at nests, and cannonballs at boats. At first, 
 you'll have trouble hitting anything, but after a few hours of compulsive play, you'll develop 
 a deft touch and an incurable addiction.  

  The junk food games include Going Nuts (Pachinko with squirrels) , Wild West Showdown (a carnival-style 
 shooting gallery) , Clown Splash (build pressure, then shoot water into a clown's mouth) , Hoops 
 (tap three buttons then a target) , Clown Bonk (Whack-A-Mole) , RC Raceway (race a car around three 
 tracks) , and Bubble Gum Battle (Red Light, Green Light, but with blowing) . Most of these are dumb 
 but vaguely playable, if just to beat your high score. Others, like RC Raceway, are fun but frustrating. 
 Finally, Hoops and Wild West Showdown are borderline habit-forming; both are fun tests of your 
 stylus speed and accuracy.  

  The last group is garbage, or what carnies might call "flats". These include Alley Ball (broken 
 Skee Ball) , Test of Strength (way too weak) , Nerves of Steel (guide a ring along a wire) , Buckets 
 of Fun (throw a ball into a bucket) , Balloon Darts (ugh) , Dunk Tank (trace a path within a time 
 limit) , Spilled Milk (click on the milk) , Meter-O-Love (click on hearts) , Loud Mouth (aka screaming 
 in public) , The Great Swami (pay tickets to ask a "yes" or "no" question) , and Bumper Boats (arguably 
 the worst of all) . Not all of these games are equally bad. Some are fun but too easily beatable. 
 Others, like The Great Swami, aren't even games. And a few are truly loathsome, like Bumper Boats, 
 in which you can spend most of a match completely unable to move.  

  The good news is that there are so many games, you'll be ready to take another crack at the first 
 ones by the time you've finished the last. In this way, Carnival Games can really help you kill 
 the hours. And if you have bored friends with you, you can entertain them, too. With just one copy 
 of Carnival Games, you can give them a proper "bally" (or in plain English, a sample performance) . 
 You can share Dunk Tank, Buckets of Fun, and Frog Leap. The first two are flats, but Frog Leap 
 is the best game of the bunch.  

           This strongman game is shockingly weak.      

  Now, this review isn't full of old carny talk just to be fancy. The point is, carny culture has 
 an ever-changing slang dialect and all sorts of other cool customs. But none of this is in Carnival 
 Games, which is just one mark of many against its lackluster and unimaginative presentation. From 
 the bland graphics, to the obnoxious voice work, to the random words that pop up whenever you finish 
 a game ("Frog Legs!," "Steady Hands!") , it's clear that developer Cat Daddy Games didn't go to 
 any extra effort here.  

  Yet Carnival Games currently retails at the full price of a normal Nintendo DS title. This is way 
 too much money for a mediocre collection of mindless minigames. If you can find an inexpensive 
 copy, Carnival Games is an OK way to burn a couple of hours. But if you're simply dying to spend 
 way too much money throwing baseballs at bottles or shooting water in a clown's mouth, go to a 
 real carnival. Who knows, you might even win an ashtray and pick up some colorful lingo.
