:::The Good:::
 Fighting bosses by tapping and drawing on the touch screen is sort of fun.
 Comic-book-style story scenes look nice.
-------------------------------------------------
:::The Bad:::
 The formulaic run-jump-attack design gets boring fast.
 You'll blow through all 20 levels in an hour or so.
 The 2D graphics are plain and don't employ any DS-specific effects.
 Only a small portion of the game is actually based on the movie.

:::Review:::
The Nintendo DS rendition of Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a short collection of 
 generic levels that hardly relate to the movie at all. 

  The Nintendo DS rendition of Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a prime example of why 
 video games based on movies tend to get a bad rap. This collection of side-scrolling levels, shoot-'em-up 
 stages, and boss battles gives the distinct impression that the developer just quickly threw some 
 levels together then shoehorned the characters in at the last moment. Roughly half of the game 
 involves jumping between platforms and beating up generic enemies. With the exception of a couple 
 of key levels and scenes, the story centers around characters and events that weren't even in the 
 movie. On top of that, you can complete the whole game and unlock every bonus in well under two 
 hours.  

           Sue can fly, Ben can dash, and Reed has a long reach. But the side-scrolling levels mostly 
 involve jumping and punching.      

  Roughly half of the game's 20 levels are traditional side-scrolling stages in which you control 
 one of the Fantastic Four members. As you walk through the stage, you'll have to jump over gaps, 
 activate switches, and beat up on various alien or robot enemies. If you run out of health or fall 
 into a bottomless pit, you'll have to start the level over. Each character has a unique superpower 
 (for example, Sue can fly) , but the levels mainly test your ability to jump over gaps and rapidly 
 press the attack button. There's nothing particularly noteworthy about how the levels are put together. 
 A surprise trap here and there guarantees that you'll have to go through some of the levels at 
 least twice, though that's not a big problem because most levels barely take longer than a minute 
 to complete. As for the enemies, they simply patrol their own small patch of ground or sky and 
 attack intermittently when you get too close.  

  The remaining levels are vertically scrolling shoot-'em-up stages and split-screen boss battles. 
 In the former, you control the Fantasticar or the Human Torch. Flying aliens and aircraft constantly 
 appear on the upper screen, making their way to where you are on the lower screen. Your task is 
 to dodge their bullets and shoot them down. Unfortunately, you only have a single-fireball-style 
 attack, and you'll tire of it quickly. The boss battles are somewhat more engaging mainly because 
 you have to use the touch screen to reflect the bosses' attacks. Dr. Doom or another bad guy stands 
 on the upper screen and repeatedly hurls energy blasts toward you, which you then need to tap, 
 slash, or encircle with the stylus before they hit your team members situated at the bottom of 
 the touch screen.  

           During boss battle, you tap and draw lines to reflect incoming attacks.      

  As 
 good as the boss battles are, they only last a minute or two, and there are only four of them total 
 in the entire game. For that matter, the entire game can be finished in about an hour. You may 
 be able to stretch that to 90 minutes if you bother to retry levels to achieve the A grades necessary 
 to unlock all of the bonus comic book covers. This lack of content speaks to the overall lack of 
 effort that the developers put into the game as a whole.  

  Most levels involve dull mountain locations, generic enemies, and throwaway plot points that weren't 
 in the movie. All told, only a of couple levels and story scenes actually involve Dr. Doom, the 
 Surfer, or Galactus. Visually, there's nothing here that the Game Boy Advance couldn't do. The 
 characters look crisp, but they don't have a ton of animation. The backgrounds are also a litany 
 of steel beams and stone walls interspersed with a few objects that you can smash. The comic-book-style 
 artwork that appears between levels is nice, though it's always just a sequence of nonmoving images. 
 For the audio, the developers did a great job with the dramatic, bass-thumping music. However, 
 they didn't bother to record any character voices. The sound effects are also just a bunch of generic 
 punch, laser, and crunch noises.  

  While there's nothing especially broken about the Nintendo DS version of Fantastic Four: Rise of 
 the Silver Surfer, it's terribly short, and the gameplay is mostly uneventful. Also, the characters 
 and story don't really jive with what transpired in the movie or what has happened in the long-running 
 comic book series. It may not be the worst game ever, but it certainly isn't worth taking home.

Review:  I PLAYED THIS GAME OUT OF ABSOLUTE DESPERATION BUT FOUND IT TO BE A DECENT LITTLE PLATFORMER. THE 
 GRAPHICS & SOUND ARE BAD BUT THATS WHAT YOU GET ON ANY DS GAME. THE GAME IS EXTREMELY SHORT & MOST 
 OF THE LEVELS YOU CAN BREEZE THROUGH. SOME LEVELS ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT SIMPLY BECAUSE WHEN YOU 
 DIE YOU RESTART FROM VERY BEGINNING OF THE LEVEL. THEY MIX UP STANDARD PLATFORMING LEVELS, FLYING 
 SHOOTING LEVELS (W/ THE FANTASTICAR, THE HUMAN TORCH & THE SILVER SURFER) & STYLUS USED BOSS BATTLES. 
 YOU DON'T PLAY AS THE SILVER SURFER UNTIL THE ABSOLUTE FINAL LEVEL, WHICH IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST 
 FLYING LEVEL. THIS IS NOT A GREAT GAME BUT WORTH PLAYING IF YOU LIKE PLATFORMING. IT DOES NOT MATCH 
 THE MOVIE STORYLINE 100%! YOUR BASIC OBJECTIVE IN THE PLATFORMING LEVELS IS TO COLLECT 3 COLORED 
 CRYSTALS BEFORE YOU REACH THE END OF THE LEVEL BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO. IT WILL EFFECT YOUR END LEVEL 
 GRADE BUT THERE IS NO OVERALL POINTS OR UPGRADES TO PURCHASE. THE BOSS BATTLES ARE TOO SIMPLE & 
 NOT VERY FUN. EACH BOSS THROWS VARIES OBJECTS AT ALL 4 CHARACTERS & YOU HAVE BOUNCE THEM BACK OR 
 SHIELD THEM W/ YOUR STYLUS.
