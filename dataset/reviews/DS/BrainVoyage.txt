:::Review:::
Everything Brain Voyage does has been done better by other logic and puzzle minigame collections. 
 

  The Nintendo DS doesn't need any more below-average collections of brain-training minigames. By 
 extension, that means the Nintendo DS doesn't need Brain Voyage. It's yet another substandard compilation 
 of logic puzzles that fails to do anything new or interesting.  

  Like with Brain Age, Brain Voyage's puzzles were created by an "expert," in this case mathematician 
 Dr. Reiner Knizia. Unlike Brain Age's doctor, who claims to be able to improve your cognitive abilities, 
 Dr. Knizia seems to be in the game only to take credit for designing the puzzles. This is a stretch 
 because many of the games are clones of existing games such as Memory or Minesweeper, and some 
 of them, such as sliding tiles to unscramble a picture, have been around for hundreds of years. 
 Perhaps he invented a time machine we didn't know about...  

           Little-known fact: Dr. Knizia invented counting.      

  Brain Voyage's 16 puzzles 
 are spread among cities across the globe. When you complete a puzzle, you earn a medal as well 
 as coins. The better your performance on a puzzle, the better your reward. Coins are used to unlock 
 new cities as well as puzzle variations. Each puzzle has five variations, for a total of 80 puzzles. 
 This may seem like a good number, but not all of the games are equally enjoyable. One of the best 
 games is a poker/solitaire hybrid in which you're dealt cards and then must try to place them in 
 a grid to make the best hands. Another good one is Carnival, in which you must divvy up dancers 
 onto parade floats according to their number. The Minesweeper clone, Ice Cap, is also enjoyable -- especially 
 when it introduces hexagons on the playfield.  

  The rest of the games are either uninteresting, frustrating, or both. There's a maze challenge 
 that's made more difficult because of inconsistent touch-screen controls; a game where all you 
 do is count sea life; and a real snoozer in which you must memorize the order in which musicians 
 play. A few of the puzzles, such as the one where you must zero out equations by addition, subtraction, 
 multiplication, and division, are significantly more challenging than the others, and there are 
 no hints to help when you're in a bind. The game is also quite demanding with its medal requirements, 
 which is a problem when you've done your best and still can't get a medal. The lack of hints is 
 a problem because if you're unable to earn medals you can't unlock any new areas. Every once in 
 a while the good doctor will have pity on you and give you a few perseverance coins, but these 
 aren't much help later in the game when the cities and puzzles are expensive.  

  You can save your favorite puzzles to play later, or you can play random ones that you've already 
 unlocked, but there's not much point in finishing Brain Voyage's puzzles, and there isn't any reason 
 to revisit already completed ones. The game doesn't track your progress, it doesn't evaluate your 
 abilities, and it doesn't do anything to encourage you to play on a regular basis. However, you 
 can share any of the puzzles you've unlocked with friends. This is great for them because they 
 can play the game's few good brainteasers without having to buy it, but there's no head-to-head 
 play, so your reward for sharing is to stand there and watch them.  

           One of the better games involves placing dancers onto different floats.      

  Brain 
 Voyage's presentation doesn't do anything to keep you coming back for more. The ever-present 3D 
 model of Dr. Knizia looks kind of creepy with its oversized head. The puzzles themselves aren't 
 much to look at; some are adequate, whereas others are extremely ugly. The audio is irritating 
 and will have you reaching for the volume switch in a matter of minutes.  

  It's possible to squeeze a few hours of entertainment from Brain Voyage, but you'll see everything 
 it has to offer in that short time. The presentation is dull and there's no reason to revisit puzzles 
 once you've finished them. It's impossible to recommend purchasing this "me too" game.

Review:  I normally feel that the official reviews of this type of game are overly critical and this one 
 was no exception. However some good points were made.
  
  General:
  Bunch of puzzles wrapped up in a "sort of story". Some are solvable by skill alone and some involve 
 an element of luck. All are fun to start with but some become frustrating as time wears on. Purchasing 
 new puzzles can become tiresome if you buy the "wrong" one first and cannot reach a high enough 
 level to win the coins. BUT most of the puzzles are solvable in the end and my wife and I have 
 been competing for high scores making the game last longer than it might otherwise have.
  
  Presentation:
  Good enough for this sort of game.
  
  Sound:
  As above!
  
  Overall:
 
  Has been lots of fun but will be trading once the end is reached (my wife only needs two more 
 golds grrrrr)
