:::Review:::
Though it's short and easy, Transformers Animated features some interesting gameplay and great presentation. 
 

  Transformers Animated: The Game for the Nintendo DS is clearly geared toward younger players who 
 are fans of the recently created show on which the game is based. While it might be easy to dismiss 
 it as a typical licensed affair, developer A2M has in fact delivered a rather clever puzzle experience 
 that will give its intended audience more than it would normally expect, and despite the game's 
 shortcomings, it might just hold the interest of older players too.  

           Using teamwork to cross this gap and break down that door is neat.      

  The straightforward 
 story in Transformers Animated: The Game takes many elements directly from the show and is delivered 
 with a mixture of boldly illustrated still shots, voice acting, and transform cinematics, all completely 
 faithful to the series' presentation. All of the original voice actors are here in full force to 
 provide authentic dialogue for every character. The polygonal graphics engine does an admirable 
 job of bringing the show's style to three dimensions with bright colors, large character models, 
 and exaggerated animation. While the frame rate occasionally dips, the aesthetics will definitely 
 satisfy Transformers Animated fans and strangers alike.  

  Underneath this sheen lies a non-Transformers experience, though this isn't entirely a bad thing. 
 The majority of the adventure is dominated by teamwork-based puzzle platforming -- during which you 
 can't transform, oddly enough -- that recalls Blizzard's The Lost Vikings. You guide Optimus Prime, 
 Bumblebee, and Bulkhead through levels by taking advantage of each character's strengths. Prime's 
 projectile attack can be guided with the stylus to hit remote switches, and he can grapple onto 
 girders to access areas the other two cannot. Bulkhead can punch straight through some heavy doors 
 and push or pull heavy blocks into floor panel switches. Bumblebee is the only one who can jump, 
 and he's able to rebound off walls and power up special switches that the others can't.  

  For the most part, this all works well. Progression is largely smooth as you constantly switch 
 between the three characters to use their talents. The level designs remain intuitive enough that 
 you'll rarely find a situation where you've gotten yourself stuck and your only recourse is to 
 restart.  

  The game falters when it tries to mix things up. Combat is an empty, button-mashing affair, and 
 there's almost no technique required to survive. Even when Prime and Bulkhead are subjected to 
 seemingly unavoidable hits -- neither of them can jump, remember, and their blocking animations are 
 a little too slow to be effective at all times -- they can take so many hits that it's difficult 
 to lose. The car chase levels aren't much fun since they employ a rigid slot-car mechanic. You 
 can transform into robot form to take down enemies by tapping them with the stylus, but this too 
 is hardly challenging thanks to how slow your targets are. At the risk of committing Transformers 
 blasphemy, it would have been better for the game to play to its strengths and do away with these 
 scenarios altogether, even though they're the only levels in which you can transform.  

           The slow slot-car chase scenes aren't so neat.      

  Thankfully, combat occurs in 
 short, tolerable bursts, and the car chase levels barely comprise a fifth of the game's 25 stages. 
 The bad news is that aside from those stages, the game is relatively bare-bones. Even for those 
 in the younger audience, the game can be beaten in a handful of hours. The promise of "unlockables" 
 in the main menu results in nothing more than the opportunity to watch the full-motion video cutscenes 
 that you've already seen in between levels.  

  Nevertheless, Transformers Animated: The Game gets enough right to be a competent, decently made 
 game that doesn't rely on its license to succeed but remains faithful to it. Well, except for the 
 lack of actual transforming.

Review:  This is my review about the game: Transformers Animated
  
  Read the information below to see what I think about different kinds of ratings.
  
  
  Graphic (8 
 out of 10) Great but very childish like the games from cartoon network. I don't really like the graphics 
 over there but it is
  okay to play with.
  
  Price (9 out of 10) Just right and don't need to persuade your mom. Just
  one problem that happened 
 to me. Well, actually not a problem. Your mom
  might say that this game is a lot childish.
  
  The Fun of the Game (8 out of 10) The same storyline in the cartoons except that some systems 
 are hard to play with and you'll eventually get bored with
  the game. The others are all okay except that the part that I just mentioned.
  
  By now you 
 should have noticed that I only count "The Fun fo the Game" part?
  I'm just saying what I think about other things.

Review:  Transformers Animated, the best show currently on TV. I can't wait for season 3 to premiere this 
 spring. I love the show, but naturally I was a little unsure about the game. The Transformers doesn't 
 exactly have a great record when it comes to videogames. Thankfully, it's great. As soon as you 
 start the game, you hear the awesome theme song. And then you get the show's intro. The game is 
 filled with several cool, but short cutscenes taken from the show. The presentation is flawless, 
 it has great graphics for a DS game. And best of all, most of the series voice actors are on board. 
 So you have David Kaye, Bumper Robinson, Corey Burton, Jeff Bennett, Lance Henriksen and the stunningly 
 beautiful and talented Tara Strong. I love that woman, she's my favorite voiceactress ever.
  
  The game is not what you'd expect. There's very litle combat in it, and it's not a platformer. 
 Only Bumblebee and Prowl can jump. It's more like "Lost Vikings", if you remember that game. The 
 levels are filles with several puzzles and challenges. You can control 3 characters, and those 
 are Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Bulkhead. But wait, I mentioned Prowl earlier. Yes, you do get 
 to play as him but he's only in two levels. But more on that later. There are two types of levels, 
 the most frequent are the "Lost Vikings" type levels. But you also get some 3D driving missions. 
 It's only in these you get to transform. These are not as fun, but they add a little variety to 
 the game. And you get to control Prowl. Ratchet is a nonplayable character, he gives you hints 
 and clues on what to do. DS Stylus controls works for the most part, and is used for throwing Prime's 
 axe, Bulkhead's wrecking ball and Prowl's ninja stars. 
  
  I do have one problem with the game, you only fight two Decepticons. Lockdown and Megatron. Other 
 Decepticons like Lugnut, Blitzwing and Shockwave do appear, but you don't get to fight them. Also, 
 the game is very easy, only the last battle with Megatron is somewhat challenging. Other than that, 
 it's a cakewalk. But it's for kids you know, so it's okay, really. It's also quite short and can 
 be finished in 1-2 days, despite having 25 levels.
  
  If you like the show, there's no reason you shouldn't get the game, it's awesome. With fantastic 
 voiceacting and visuals. Now, bring on season 3 of Transformers Animated.
