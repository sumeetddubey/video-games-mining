:::Review:::
Bee Movie Game on the DS has nice 3D graphics, but it's short, repetitive, and lacking in variety. 
 

  Like its counterparts on the Wii, PC, PS2, and Xbox 360, the Nintendo DS version of Bee Movie Game 
 lets players explore the 3D world from the movie and tackle numerous missions as the film's hero, 
 Barry B. Benson. However, unlike its console-based siblings, this portable rendition of Bee Movie 
 is short, repetitive, and lacking in variety. At first, you might enjoy playing the minigames, 
 fetching items, and flying back and forth. Soon, though, the relative lack of substance and flair 
 will cause you to lose interest.  

  The 3D graphics are the game's sole bright spot. Barry, the other bees, and the dangerous creatures 
 you'll encounter out in the wild are cute and detailed. All the different locations, including 
 the hive, the park, and the warehouse, are vividly brought to life thanks to the clean textures 
 and a high polygon count. The top-down viewpoint isn't any different than that of the typical adventure 
 romp, but since you can freely explore each environment and adjust your flight level to discover 
 shortcuts, you really feel as though you're getting the unique sense of what it must be like to 
 interact with the world as a fluttery insect.  

  While they're impressive for their technical qualities, the graphics don't deliver a whole lot 
 of excitement. Of course, the massive flowers, benches, garbage cans, and other objects you'll 
 encounter outside the hive are larger than life. However, they just sit there, and you can't do 
 anything to them except hide under them or whack them to knock pollen drops out of them. Frogs, 
 dogs, birds, and other nasty animals patrol small zones in each area, but their movements are matter-of-fact 
 and their attack animations are so short that you often won't notice that you've actually been 
 attacked until Barry gets knocked back. In general, the presentation is cheap. There's not much 
 to the audio, apart from some dramatic music and a few brief snippets of Jerry Seinfeld saying 
 "ouch," and the story scenes that are displayed at the end of each mission consist simply of still 
 images from the movie and plain text dialogue.  

  As for the hands-on aspects, they're obviously geared toward the less developed gaming skills of 
 young children. You can freely explore the environment, but missions and upgrades are doled out 
 in linear, regimented fashion. A green dot appears on your radar, you go there, another bee gives 
 you your orders, and you head to the next green dot to collect an item or rescue somebody. Barry 
 has a limited range of abilities. He can fly, dash into things, carry objects, and hide under surfaces 
 to avoid the rain or larger creatures. Once or twice per mission, you'll face off against a human 
 in a battle that involves dragging and drawing on the touch screen. If you accumulate enough points 
 in those battles, Barry will dodge all of his opponent's attacks and cause the meanie to fall down 
 dizzy. Those battles are fun. It's just too bad there are so few of them.  

  Occasionally, you'll notice insects standing around that aren't part of the mission narrative. 
 If you talk to them, they'll ask you to fetch something or deliver items to other insects in exchange 
 for a major pollen payout. Using that pollen, you can visit the Pollen Jocks at the hive and pay 
 them to take a crack at one of their minigames. These minigames are simple reflex challenges involving 
 the touch screen. For example, in the speed training minigame, you have to drag a puck back and 
 forth between the goals while dodging a spiked ball that's bouncing around the screen. The different 
 minigames are nice diversions, and they allow you to upgrade Barry's speed, stamina, and strength 
 ratings.  

  Unfortunately, there are only three minigames in all, so they don't actually do much to extend 
 the life of the game. Not that there's much life to begin with. Including the hive, there are only 
 four different environments, and it won't take you much longer than three hours to talk to everyone 
 and complete all the quests they offer.  

  You could argue that the reason the game is simple and short is because it's geared toward young 
 kids. While there's some merit to that argument, it really doesn't explain why the overall design 
 and presentation are so underwhelming. Besides the nice 3D visuals, there's nothing here to keep 
 kids entertained once they get bored of buzzing back and forth and fetching junk for other insects.

Review:  This is one of those games that got passed around a bit but not for the right reasons sadly. It 
 started out full of promise for hours of easy-going, happy-go-lucky entertainment and could so 
 very easily have maintained that status-quo. 
  The game is a designed around our main character buzzing around undertaking various tasks for other 
 bees in a range of environments. He has to avoid various hazards and learn new skills along the 
 way. The tasks were fun and posed good problems to solve and tested memory. To attain new skills 
 though, you had to undertake "training" back at the hive and this too was fun - to begin with anyway 
 but as the game progressed the training became harder and harder, disproportionately so compared 
 to the rest of the game especially bearing in mind the age rage at which it is primarily aimed. 
 Now that might not necessarily have been a problem except for one small detail which we all agreed 
 with and that concerned us and that was that pressure you ended up applying to the touch screen. 
 Basically because of the nature of the training, you end up stabbing at the touch screen with your 
 stylus trying to grab hold of a ball that is bouncing around the screen whilst trying to avoid 
 two mines which if they catch you, mean you lose your grip on the ball again!
  Now normally, I'd just assume that the DS could take this sort of stick but seeing as I'd only 
 just put on a new screen protector before the game and had to replace it after I'd finished with 
 it, it did make me wonder and the amount distortion being created by the stylus on the screen was 
 even more disconcerting. We began to wonder exactly how much pressure the touch screen on our beloved 
 DS's are designed to take so we checked out the Nintendo website - no joy there - so then we began 
 to wonder if Activision had an interest in Nintendo's repair division. All-in-all it was very sad, 
 as the game was so close to being a fun game that earned a decent score but as it is we actually 
 gave up on the game which is something I just don't do!
