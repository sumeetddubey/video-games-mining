:::Review:::
Kurupoto: Cool Cool Stars is a simplistic maze puzzler that you'll probably be done with in a single 
 sitting. 

  While battling a nasty flu, the moon sneezed and knocked the stars out of the sky. Now, it's up 
 to you to reunite the stars with their haloes so they can fly back into space. That's the story 
 behind Kurupoto: Cool Cool Stars, a puzzle game for the Nintendo DS that's certainly unique but 
 not really all that interesting or time consuming.  

  Kurupoto is about solving mazes. In each of the game's nearly 200 mazes, you have to guide a rounded 
 star to its halo simply by rotating the entire maze multiple times. For every quarter turn you 
 make, the star and any loose square blocks inside the maze will shift then fall into place. The 
 whole idea is to manipulate the blocks so that they fill gaps, open passages, and generally help 
 you get the star into the goal. Of course, one wrong turn and they may end up blocking your path. 
 That's the long and the short of strategy in Kurupoto: figuring out how to get to the goal in the 
 fewest turns possible.  

           To everything, there is a season: turn, turn, turn.      

  The controls are simple 
 enough. You can use the shoulder buttons to rotate the maze, or you can tap icons on the touch 
 screen to do so. Apart from the times when you need to choose modes and puzzles in a menu, you 
 can literally control the game with one finger.  

  Once you get the hang of it, the majority of puzzles can be solved in less than 30 seconds. Some 
 last upward of 40 turns, but most take 10 turns or less. If you're trying to earn the minimum turn 
 award for a puzzle, you may need to make two or three attempts. After you solve the 27 basic puzzles 
 in the story mode, you'll unlock 30 more puzzles in the normal mode. Completing those puzzles unlocks 
 another group of puzzles. In all, there are approximately 200 different puzzles to solve. That 
 may seem like a large number, but it only takes about two hours to get through all of them because 
 they're short and generally easy. You'd need even less time to finish the game if it actually let 
 you skip the poorly translated conversation scenes that appear after every puzzle in the story 
 mode.  

  Crudely translated bits of dialogue along the lines of "Here is close to the cape of Kurupoto island" 
 suggest that precious little money and effort were put into the presentation. However, the colorful 
 backgrounds and crisp maze objects do at least get the job done. Younger players will probably 
 get a kick out of the facial gestures the blocks and stars in the maze make. They'll also likely 
 enjoy the cute interactions that occur between the bouncy Kurupoto blocks and the mythical creatures 
 you encounter in the story mode's conversation scenes. Happy music and whimsical sound effects 
 further serve to keep the overall mood light.  

  Kurupoto might be an appropriate game to give a young child if you're going on a long car ride, 
 but that's about it. Otherwise, most people will find the design and puzzles too simplistic. Also, 
 there is too little content overall when you consider the $20 asking price.

Review:  Nothing more needs to be said really as I believe I said it all in the quick view. I'll probably 
 let my 3 yo have a crack at this in two years (or less) . 
  
  It''s a simple simple game. One positive though. It would probably be a good game to play while 
 waiting in line at the DMV, dentist, proctologist, wherever, you know. Otherwise, probably wouldn't 
 kill you to let this one slip through your fingers. Get Professor Layton and the Curious Village 
 if you want a challenge. 
  
  I guess to add one positive the characters are colorful and happy. They have the potential for 
 charm if the developers had spent a little more time on the story line. As it is it seems that 
 the story was cobbled together to market a simple puzzle algorithm for mass consumption. I wonder 
 if the original untranslated version had anymore appeal? Well, I guess that positive turned into 
 a negative too, shoot. Nuf said I guess.

Review:  It's delightful game and easy to play. The game's name is all about the stars in the sky that you 
 see at night. The story mode is easy to complete. Controls are similar to DKjungle Climber instead 
 of climbing you rotate puzzle left or right to get the star to it's halo. It starts easy then along 
 the way or progress of the game the puzzle gets hard but there is a way to solve based by numbers 
 of turns. Once you finish all the puzzle, a constellation in the sky appears. If you want a puzzle 
 game that is easy, this game is the one you should pick up and try solve it yourself.
