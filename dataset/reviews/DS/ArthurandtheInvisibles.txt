:::Review:::
The rapid-fire minigames found in Arthur and the Invisibles offer a different take on the WarioWare 
 style of play, and they're fun for the short time the game lasts. 

  To be clear from the get-go, Arthur and the Invisibles on the Nintendo DS isn't for everyone. The 
 frenetic pace of this minigame collection and the necessity for you to actually exercise your brain 
 to figure out what's going on may be off-putting to some. But, if you count yourself a fan of the 
 WarioWare series of games or are just interested in an alternative style of gameplay, there is 
 a lot to like about Arthur on the DS.  

          Some of the puzzles require a bit of thought to figure out what the heck is going on.  
    

  In spite of its format, Arthur and the Invisibles still imparts a bit of a story, namely by way 
 of a few cinematics at the end of each level set. By no means will you get a comprehensive overview 
 of the movie it's based on, but you will glean a few bits and pieces that describe each of the 
 three main players, Arthur, Selenia, and Betamech, as well as an extremely loose rundown of the 
 movie's plot. To keep it as brief as the game does, Arthur, Selenia, and Betamech set out from 
 the Minimoy village to Necropolis to attempt to save Arthur's grandma's house from foreclosure 
 and the microscopic civilization residing in his backyard from the evil henchmen living in his 
 basement. Along the way, Arthur rescues his grandpa, scores some crazy-hot rubies, and puts the 
 moves on a 900-year-old princess. While all of this is nice to know, it's completely ancillary 
 to the meat of the game, and if this is your only introduction to the world of the Minimoys, then 
 just ignore it altogether and feel comfortable in the knowledge that you're really not missing 
 much.  

  Like in the WarioWare games, you'll be presented with a quick succession of minigames that culminate 
 in a boss stage. The format is also similar in that you'll be given a countdown timer that lasts 
 anywhere from 5 to 20 seconds, and you'll need to finish your task within that time frame. There 
 are 12 levels in all, subdivided into three sets, and levels get progressively longer and more 
 difficult, with the first two containing 10 and 20 minigames, respectively, and the final throwing 
 a total of 40 at you. Many of the minigames follow a rapid-fire format, whereby on first encountering 
 them, you've typically lost before you realize what you're even supposed to do. However, many others, 
 especially in the latter levels, test your memory, coordination, and critical analysis skills, 
 rather than just your twitch-reaction speed. This is a departure from the WarioWare formula, and 
 the added complexity helps to alleviate one of the primary issues that plagued WarioWare: Touched!, 
 that being the repetitive and somewhat limited use of the stylus. Since solving the puzzles becomes 
 your focus, you'll be more interested in what's happening on the screen than what you're doing 
 with the stylus. This isn't to say that your actions won't become quite repetitive after a while, 
 as you're still limited to the same tapping, circling, scratching, slashing, and guiding, as well 
 as some blowing into the DS's microphone. Puzzle-solving does go a long way in sustaining your 
 interest in the game, though. It also helps that the game unfurls the 90-plus minigames at a measured 
 pace, so you'll still run up against things that make you go "hmm..." in the latter levels.  

 
  The game also packs in some extras. A few of the minigames aren't conceivably doable in the time 
 frame you're allotted until you've committed them to memory -- a particularly vicious mirror game 
 comes immediately to mind -- which is why it's nice that a training mode is included in the package. 
 Here, you'll have access to all of the minigames that have already been thrown at you, so you'll 
 be able to practice before you head back into the story mode. Your other option is a mul-mul rearing 
 mode, which is essentially a Tamagotchi knockoff. Your enjoyment of this mode hinges entirely upon 
 how cute you find mul-muls, because there really isn't much depth here -- there isn't much to do 
 other than pet your mul-mul and, when appropriate, clean up its poo. If you can find someone else 
 with an Arthur and the Invisibles cart, you'll be able to have the two pets visit, but as you're 
 essentially just looking at dandelion fluff with eyes and arms, there really isn't much appeal 
 here. Also, if neglecting your adorable little mul-mul and leaving it to wallow in its own by-products 
 would keep you awake at night in mental anguish, you have the option to pause the mode, which really 
 is a thoughtful touch.  

  Arthur and the Invisibles looks pretty good. There is a good deal of variety in the backgrounds 
 for the various minigames, and all of the colors are vibrant and engaging. You'll also see a pretty 
 good variety of objects on the screen, which typically are noteworthy elements of the movie, though 
 some of them probably aren't as detailed as they could be. As for the sound, nearly every action 
 has a distinct ring or noise to accompany it, which means you won't go batty hearing the same buzzer 
 over and over. The music isn't exceptional in any way, but it does do a good job of segueing between 
 minigames.  

          So there's this kid named Arthur, a sword stuck in a stone, and a civilization that needs 
 saving.     

  What you will find with Arthur and the Invisibles on the DS is a mostly enjoyable collection of 
 fast-paced minigames that will keep you on your toes and offer a play experience that's comparable 
 to the WarioWare series, if not quite as enjoyable. Once you've worked your way through all 12 
 levels, which could take anywhere from four to eight hours, you won't find much to keep you playing. 
 But while it lasts, it's a good bit of fun.
