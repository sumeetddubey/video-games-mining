:::Review:::
WALL-E's finicky camera and repetitive gameplay make this one lousy robot adventure. 

  As a robot designed specifically to make trash cubes, Wall-E's finely honed talent makes up a large 
 part of his existence, but it takes up only a small portion of the movie. There are only so many 
 unique ways Wall-E can interact with waste material before it gets tiring. Sadly, the Nintendo 
 DS version of WALL-E chronicles the robot's twisted relationship with cubes for the entirety of 
 the journey. A puzzle game designed around the joys of slinging garbage may seem like a promising 
 idea, but the tedium of constantly wrestling with a camera that seems to exist solely to hide valuable 
 objects while you dutifully hurl another block at another switch makes for a tedious experience. 

  The story of WALL-E vaguely follows the events of the movie, but the drama is so separate from 
 the gameplay, it's easy to forget about the narrative thread entirely. Important events are showcased 
 through cartoony cutscenes that, though they bear no artistic relationship to the big screen flick, 
 are well animated and cheery-looking. It's just hard to take Wall-E's plight seriously when you 
 see dramatic encounters play out in cinemas only to go through the same block-throwing puzzles 
 when the action starts up again. The fact that you're a lonely robot trying to save the humans 
 from their own greed and laziness doesn't seem important at all here. The segregated nature of 
 this quest makes everything seem slight and unimportant.  

           Wall-E squares off against a much more interesting robot.      

  Levels are full of 
 conveyor belts, laser-guarded doors, and wall-mounted switches that must be properly tweaked to 
 allow your safe progress. The key to every puzzle is throwing a cube at a switch. The Earth levels 
 have garbage stations where you can collect and compress ordinary trash cubes to toss at enemies 
 or buttons. The later levels, which take place on a spaceship, mix in cubes with different properties. 
 You'll have to manage cubes that explode, implode, and disable electronics (including you) to safely 
 make your way through the next cube-filled room.  

  There are plenty of head-scratching puzzles along the way, but a number of flaws make this experience 
 more frustrating than rewarding. The camera is awful. You view the action from a top-down, slightly 
 angled perspective. Because switches and obstacles line every wall of the area, you have to constantly 
 rotate your view to see what's going on around you. Methodically tweaking your position is fine 
 when you aren't in any immediate danger, but the later levels are full of enemies that make patience 
 impossible.  

  Furthermore, the punishment system is far too strict. You can only be hit five times per level 
 before you perish. Each level has about five rooms that you need to successfully traverse before 
 you can save your progress. Every time you are struck by a laser or accidentally fall down a pit, 
 you lose precious energy. Because of your limited view of the play area, it is far too common to 
 slip down a hole you didn't realize you were standing so close to or be hit by a laser you would 
 have sworn was going to miss you. And though Wall-E will flail his metal arms when he gets close 
 to a pit, you can't actually guide him away from death before he plummets. If you get too close 
 to a pit, you fall in and lose some health. If you do this too often, you'll be replaying the same 
 areas over and over again.  

           At least the cutscenes look pretty good.      

  There are some sections where you control Eve, but these only detract from the overall package. 
 As Eve, you fly down a narrow path, avoiding propellers and dropping blocks along the way. There 
 is too much pop-in here to fly quickly though, so this turns into a jerky, stop/start affair. It's 
 a clunky detour from the main puzzle solving adventure that serves to frustrate rather than exhilarate. 
 The visuals apart from the charming cutscenes are also more of a hindrance than a help. It's difficult 
 to ascertain which environmental pieces can be safely interacted with and which will damage you. 
 Thus, each new graphical variation leads to trial and error before you figure out the role of every 
 blurry object. The two-cart multiplayer has players race in the Eve levels, but they're just as 
 uninteresting with a friend.  

  WALL-E may have a few interesting puzzles, but the frustrating elements serve to make this adventure 
 far too tedious in the long run. Even fans of the movie just looking for a portable robot pal will 
 be disappointed here -- the eye-straining visuals and poorly integrated storytelling make this a 
 drastic departure from the theatrical hit.

Review:  The Good: Nice concept follows the movie well and Wall-e's actions mimic the movie. sounds and 
 ambiance are not too shabby for a hand held game.
  
  The Bad: Horrible camera angles make for an awkward attempt to move your charictor in and out of 
 places. usually resulting in a lost or fallen Wall-E off the side of cliffs and walls because the 
 depth is just not seen. and collision detection, Please don't even ask somethings you will pass 
 right through others well maybe you will lust run into them and stop for no apparent reason.
  
  Wrap up: I would say this game is fine if you were to find it under 15.00 bucks but with a 
 price of 30.00 Pass till you can find it in the discontinued bin it won't be long the game just 
 does not have any replay value what so ever.
  
  Overall Score:
  
  Graphics 2
  Animation 9
  Sound 6
