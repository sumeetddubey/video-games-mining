:::Review:::
Nicktoons Unite! is too content to be another generic platformer that leans exclusively on its license. 
 

  On the scale of big-time celebrity team-ups, the coming together of four of Nickelodeon's top cartoon 
 heroes under the banner of a single game in Nicktoons Unite! ranks somewhere between Power Man 
 and Iron Fist teaming up to fight crime and Elton John, Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, and Gladys 
 Knight getting together to sing "That's What Friends Are For" -- that is to say, it isn't very good, 
 feels more than a little forced, and does next to nothing that hasn't been done better elsewhere. 
 Certainly some members of the younger set will squeal with glee at the thought of being able to 
 control SpongeBob SquarePants, Danny Phantom, Timmy Turner, and Jimmy Neutron all in one game, 
 but once they get their hands on this decidedly lackluster platformer and its lousy controls, that 
 delight will quickly turn into frustration and boredom.  

          SpongeBob's back, and this time he's got a posse.     

  Indeed, you can play as the 
 four Nicktoon heroes throughout Nicktoons Unite!'s relatively brief adventure. You can only play 
 as one hero at a time, but you can switch between them on the fly by means of the touch screen. 
 Each hero occupies a corner of the touch screen, and all you have to do to switch between them 
 is use the stylus to drag and drop a character's icon into the center section. Each character has 
 its own abilities that you can use to get through a level. SpongeBob can float up to high areas 
 using a big bubble and can shoot bubbles that damage enemies; Danny Phantom can phase through solid 
 objects and shoot plasma bursts; Timmy can disguise himself as a bush to hide from enemies and 
 can call down his fairy godparents to slow down any potential foes; and Jimmy Neutron can use the 
 one-two punch of a flying jetpack and a shrink ray. Each character also has one special move that 
 can be activated only by picking up a power-up. Once you get a power-up, you need to move the stylus 
 on the touch screen in a specific pattern to pull off the special.  

  For the most part, you don't need to use any of the special abilities -- you will be fine using the 
 normal attacks. Most enemies (save for the bosses) are dull-witted and unaggressive. Usually, you 
 can walk into a level and start shooting up the place without getting damaged or really even moving 
 around much. Most of the game's challenge comes from trying to navigate the platforming sequences. 
 It's not that they're tough, but the character control is squirrelly and loose, and it's easy to 
 mistime jumps simply because you can't get a proper handle on the character. The camera is also 
 a pain. It tends to snap around or zoom in at inopportune times, and the manual camera positioning 
 is too touchy. The right and left trigger buttons are used to move the camera, but it's very easy 
 to overshoot the angle, which leads to a lot of annoying situations where you're forced to stand 
 around fiddling with the camera before you can properly make a jump.  

          It's not a bad looking game, but visuals are about the only thing it really has going for 
 it.     

  Nicktoons Unite! does present itself better than it plays. The graphics are surprisingly crisp 
 looking, especially the character models. Up close, the characters animate well and look clean -- even 
 the enemies. Obviously, the main characters are more detailed, but none of the characters seem 
 to have gotten the short shrift here. The environmental designs are decidedly more lackluster, 
 though. Everything maintains the same clean look of the characters, but aesthetically, all the 
 levels look drab and repetitive. The technical merits are there, but the artistic merits are not. 
 The audio is pretty run-of-the-mill for a game of this type. There's no voice acting -- all the dialogue 
 comes in the form of scrolling-text storyboards in between levels -- and the music and sound effects 
 are of the generally cartoony, inoffensive variety. There's nothing standout here, but it does 
 the job.  

  Nicktoons Unite! is, simply put, a very generic platformer. Lots of these games get released every 
 year, and many of them come out something very much like Nicktoons Unite! -- exhibiting the same 
 pitfalls of platformers past, and no measure of forward thinking. And the scant few touch-screen 
 mechanics do little to break up the monotony. If your kid is the biggest Danny Phantom fan on the 
 planet, or still insists on carrying around a SpongeBob lunchbox at all times, Nicktoons Unite! 
 might prove to be a marginal distraction for them. Anyone else, though, would do well to simply 
 ignore this one.

Review:  The Good Aspects
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  You get to play as four of Nickelodeon's stars.
  Powerups that you get are okay.
  
  The Bad Aspects
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  Plankton, in my opinion, was WAY too hard because he kept sending jellyfish down at me.
  The special power Timmy has should have replaced the bush... what the heck is the point of the bush 
 anyway?
  Some of the levels just made me want to throw my DS out the window.
  Seriously... what's the point of the bush?
  
  Nicktoons Unite! was a huge disappointment when 
 I played it on my DS. The Gameboy version was a lot better than the load of crap they released 
 for the DS. I mean it when I say it.
  First of all, let me point out that some bosses, mainly Plankton, TICKED ME OFF! What the heck 
 is with his jellyfish robot. And after you get to half way mark, Plankton literally flips UPSIDE 
 DOWN. Why did he have to do that load of crap?!
  I admit that most of the DS's levels were longer than that of the GBA's. It took me about 5 hours 
 to beat the GBA version. But if your game doesn't even let you get past Plankton, then there's 
 something wrong with the game. To make the level story short, some levels just made me so frustrated, 
 I wanted to throw my DS in a blender and put it on high.
  One thing that ticked me off so much was Timmy B move. When you hit B, Timmy hides in a bush. Now, 
 in the GBA version of the game, he used his fairies' wands to turn enemies into pickups. Now, in 
 the DS version, they got rid of one of the most useful moves in the game and instead, they made 
 it a special power up that you can't even get without a pickup. What the heck THQ?
  To make a short review even shorter, Nicktoons Unite! is bad news when you get it for DS. So don't 
 buy the game. If you do, you just wasted you money on another worthless game that can't even beat 
 the standards of games like Where's Waldo for the NES. If you want a Nicktoons Unite! game, buy 
 it for GBA, GC, or PS2, because I can assure you that they're much better than the DS version.

Review:  Don't listen to any of the bad reviews. Those people are just cranky because they can't get past 
 the Plankton boss stage (well I got to admit, so am I, but you don't see me bashing the game like 
 they did!) . and as for the review at the summary page, don't listen to that either. The controls 
 aren't that complicated, the game isn't that easy, and the camera isn't that wonky (you can control 
 the camera angle with the L, R, X, and A buttons which I garruntee you'll get the hang of) . Well 
 anyway, here's what I think of the game:
  
  It's a good action/adventure game for the Nintendo DS. The controls are easy to get the hang of, 
 and the levels will help some people get past other games. The story of the game is a little cheesy 
 and the characters are out of... character, but the gameplay is great and the graphics are pretty 
 good too. So whether your a fan of the characters featured in the game, or in the mood for a good 
 platform game, then I say, give this game a shot.

Review:  Nicktoons unite for the ds, is a overall good game. The graphics are very well done for a DS game. 
 With a few less glitches, this game could easily be an 8. Nickelodeon was being very ambitious 
 for them to create a game like this. One major problem faced by everyone i know who ownes it, is 
 fighting plankton on the boss batlle, is almost imposble to beat, its like there is a glitch in 
 th game forcing you to not be able to beat it.
  In my opinion the storylines could have had a little more flare. All they did was copy and paste 
 pictures from the shows with each other. They did not draw any knew ones.

Review:  NickToons: Unite for the DS is a complete rip off. I spent thirty something dollars on that game 
 and i still do not understand it. I managed to get passed Amity Park, but when i got to the last 
 place in Bikini Bottom, i had no clue what to do to beat Plankton. When i get a better DS game, 
 i am trading this one in for cash. Please people. Do not but this game. It is not worth your money 
 or your time. If you want to play NickToons: Unite, try the PS2 or GC versions of the game. The 
 graphics are better and they are easier to understand. If you buy this, then you just lost thirty 
 dollars.
