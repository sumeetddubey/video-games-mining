:::Review:::
Marvel TCG isn't too bad as far as digital trading-card games go, but it's unlikely to convert anyone 
 not already invested in TCGs. 

  Upper Deck Entertainment, one of the more prominent purveyors of collectible trading card games 
 today, has teamed up with Konami to bring Upper Deck's Marvel-licensed TCG to the Nintendo DS with 
 the succinctly, if dryly, named Marvel Trading Card Game. It seems like a solid representation 
 of Upper Deck's robust, flexible, and rather popular Vs. System Trading Card Game, and it packs 
 a feature-rich online element that's already teeming with activity. As is the case with most digitized 
 TCGs, it's not a particularly exciting game to watch. If you're not already knee-deep in the real-world 
 Vs. System Trading Card Game, or other similarly advanced TCGs, it can be a confusing experience, 
 as well.  

          Was Marvel Trading Card Game really the best name Konami could muster up?     

  In 
 concept, Marvel Trading Card Game is a straightforward exercise in strategy. Two players, each 
 armed with a deck of cards, take turns "attacking" one another by playing various cards with unique 
 characteristics until one player has had all of his or her hit points depleted. Cards are divided 
 into several different categories: characters, equipment, locations, and plot twists. Characters 
 are probably the most significant cards, as these are what you'll use to actually attack your opponent, 
 while equipment and locations can be used to enhance their abilities. Plot twists are also of great 
 import, due largely to the wide range of effects they can have, from simply buffing up one of your 
 character cards for a turn to forcing your opponent to discard cards. Plot twists can also be chained 
 together, which can potentially cause several reversals of fortune within a single character clash. 

  Before you can put any characters into play, though, you'll need to meet their resource requirements. 
 You can choose to play any card in your hand as a resource at the start of your turn, similar to 
 the way mana cards are played in Magic: The Gathering. Likewise, you can only add a single card 
 to your resources during any given turn, which generally causes the action to build up slowly over 
 the course of a match, since it will take time to garner the necessary resources to put your more 
 powerful characters into play. There's certainly a significant element of luck to your success, 
 since you'll be drawing cards randomly from your deck, but there are several thick layers of strategy 
 to it as well. Which characters you play is important, as each has a unique attack and defense 
 rating that will determine how it'll fare against other characters, but where you actually place 
 them on the playing field can matter just as much. There are two rows you can play your characters 
 in -- front and back -- and how they'll behave when placed in either can depend on whether they have 
 flight abilities and ranged attacks. Where they're placed in proximity to other characters that 
 share their team affiliation matters, too.  

  All of these elements can make for some really interesting play, if you can figure out what's actually 
 going on. There's a series of interactive tutorials to help beginners, which are helpful, though 
 you'll ultimately still have to jump in feet first to fully understand the ins and outs of the 
 game. Even then, the interface is densely crammed into the screen, with loads of tiny, obscure 
 icons used to signify lots of important stuff. Plot-twist chains, which will regularly determine 
 the outcome of a specific confrontation, can be especially difficult to keep track of due to the 
 way they're presented. Though the game does try to spruce things up with some nice background and 
 card art, as well as some light particle effects, it can still look like some kind of alien tax 
 return.  

          How about 'Marvel Card Battle' or 'Marvel Hero Clash'? We just came up with those, right 
 now.     

  If you can get a hang of it, though, Marvel Trading Card Game features several ways to play. There 
 are two unique and lengthy single-player campaigns to play through, putting you in the role of 
 either hero or villain. You can play against a live opponent locally, as well as online. The PSP 
 version of Marvel Trading Card Game that came out a few months ago featured all forms of user-created 
 and sponsored tournaments, as well as the promise of interoperability with the still forthcoming 
 PC version. However, on the DS, you're limited to jumping into a game with an anonymous stranger 
 or playing folks with whom you've already exchanged Friend Codes. To its credit, though, the touch-screen 
 support in the DS version can make navigating the game's dense interface a little more intuitive. 
 Also, the game is played by holding the DS sideways, as if it were a book. It uses the top to give 
 you a big, easy-to-read version of the card you currently have selected, which is a plus.  

  With its good implementation of the well-known Vs. System, Marvel Trading Card Game will make 
 those who've already got a taste for TCGs quite happy, and it makes pretty good use of the Marvel 
 license on top of that. It's a step up in sophistication from the Yu-Gi-Oh! games that Konami has 
 been churning out for years. Still, it's a shame that the game's depth gets in the way of its accessibility 
 to a wider audience.

Review:  It's true: Marvel TCG is an acquired taste. If you are not already into Tradeable Card Games, Marvel 
 TCG may not be the game for you. It is particularly tricky to figure out. I had trouble with the 
 game at first and I'm a bit of a TCG veteran, having played some MTG and YGO in my day, plus designing 
 my own TCGs and all. The User Interface (UI) can throw people off. As reviewers say, the big part 
 of the game is decrypting the mechanics of it all.
  
  Once you figure out the game, especially the timing of the cards and phase limitations, you'll 
 enjoy it a bit if you're into a thinking man's game. As an old-school comic book fan, I love the 
 fact that there are little factoids and quotes for all the characters. I would give this game a 
 higher rating but the lack of user-friendly design is a big issue.
  
  A major selling point for me is the fact that the game offers BOTH local wireless and Wi-Fi online 
 gameplay. I am often shocked by the number of DS games that don't implement Wi-Fi. SNK-Vs-Capcom 
 Card Fighter is a good example of one such shortcoming. If you are looking for a good TCG, this 
 or Yu-Gi-Oh WC 2007 may be your best bets.
  
  Hey, just get the game. You can probably find it cheap somewhere and I need people to battle online. 
 I can never seem to find opponents. =o (

Review:  It's very hard to figure out all the stupid card rules, and I did that after multiple tutorial 
 sittings, and mostly by trial and error playing. Finally got the hang of that and started getting 
 through the game. Then playing against Doc Oc, I just can; t beat him. Played against him 20 times, 
 no go. Even when I perfectly get the cards I want, and he straggles at the beginning of the match, 
 he kicks my ass. He has a great deck, and after spending all my money on as many cards as I could 
 get mine are mediocre at best. Was I supposed to fluke out and get much better cards in my booster 
 packs?
  
  Also, noticed one spot on my DS touch screen is now worn out, from pressing the "next' sign. 
 
  
  Only buy this game if you really like being agravated. I am giving away my copy, or maybe best 
 if I throw it away.

Review:  I am still figuring out the finer points of strategic playing, but I am really enjoying the challenge. 
 being a bit of a Marvel fanboy is a massive help, as if this were a trading card game about, say 
 cars or guns, I would've thrown in the towel a while ago. It has whet my appetite for this style 
 of game now thouh, and I will be checking out other trading card games such as Yu-Gi-Oh etc. The 
 graphics are ok, nothing amazing, but colourful, easy to recognise characters, situations and introduction 
 screens help to keep my interest. the music is a little bit generic, but not annoyingly so, and 
 it soon fades into the background as I get involved in a game. For anyone who, like me, comes to 
 this game without any prior trading card experience, I highly recommend gameFAQS to bolster the 
 in game tutorial.

Review:  DO NOT BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISMISSED THIS GAME. MARVEL OVERPOWER AND POKEMON ARE KIDS GAMES 
 COMPARED TO VS CARD SYSTEM. YOU CAN NOT DOG OUT THIS GAME IF YOU JUST WIMPED OUT AND NEVER LEARNED 
 TO PLAY IT. I JUST COMPLETED THE HERO STORY LINE AND I CAN GIVE YOU AN ACCURATE REVIEW. IT IS TRUE 
 THAT THERE IS NO LEARNING CURVE, BUT ONCE YOU HAVE REALIZED THAT YOU MUST KNOW THE MECHANICS OF 
 EACH AND EVERY TURN, YOU WILL NOT WANT TO PUT THIS GAME DOWN. THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING FOR ME 
 WAS NOT KNOWING HOW TO RECOVER A CHARACTER. YOU CAN ONLY RECOVER ONE STUNNED CHARACTER AT THE BEGINNING 
 OF THE RECOVERY PHASE. YOU MUST HIGHLIGHT THE STUNNED CARD YOU WANT TO RECOVER AND THEN HIT THE 
 RECOVER ICON, NOT THE ARROW. IF YOU DO NOT, ALL STUNNED CHARACTERS WILL BE KO'D. THAT IS NOT IN 
 THE INSTRUCTIONS OR THE TUTORIALS. ONCE I LEARNED THAT, AND WAS ABLE TO SURVIVE MORE THAN A FEW 
 ROUNDS, EVERYTHING ELSE JUST STARTED MAKING SENSE. LEARN YOUR CARDS AND REMEMBER TO THINK BEFORE 
 MAKING A MOVE, BECAUSE ONCE YOU HAVE STARTED AN ACTION ON THE CHAIN, YOU CAN NOT GO BACK. ALSO, 
 I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE SAYING THE GAME FREEZES ON THEM. IT HAS NOT, YOUR OPPONENT HAS CAUSED AN ACTION 
 THAT YOU MUST RESPOND TO. HIGHLIGHT YOUR OPPONENT'S CARDS (READ THE TEXT) , AS WELL AS THE AREAS 
 OF THE PLAYMAT AND YOU WILL FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO CONTINUE. THE COMIC BOOK STYLE STORY 
 LINE IS VERY ENTERTAINING AND IS DIFFERENT FOR HERO AND VILLAIN MODE. THE SOUND IS EASILY OVERLOOKED 
 WHEN COMPARED TO THE DETAIL IN CARD GRAPHICS AND CUT SCENES. PLEASE PURCHASE THIS GAME TRUE BELIEVERS, 
 SO KONAMI WILL PUT OUT A NEW VERSION WITH THE X-MEN, HERALDS OF GALACTUS, TEAM-UPS, AND LEGENDS 
 CARDS. IF YOU OWN THIS GAME AND HAVE ANY OTHER GAMEPLAY RELATED QUESTIONS, EMAIL ME AT XPHILE99@HOTMAIL. COM.

Review:  IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS GAME TUN AROUND AND RUN AS FAR FROM IT AS YOU CAN. TRUST ME 
 THIS ONE IS ABOUT AS ADDICTIVE AS A ROOT CANAL WITH NO NOVOCAINE. I DON'T SEE HOW ANY SANE PERSON 
 CAN DEFEND THIS GAME THERE ARE BAD MARVEL GAMES AND GOOD MARVEL GAMES THIS IS BAD BAD. IF YOUR 
 A MARVEL FAN THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS STOP!!! BUY SOME MORE COMICS A POKEMON GAME HULK UD SOMETHING 
 DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME MONEY OR SANITY. I HAVE PLAYED MAGIC THE GATHERING AND THE OLD MARVEL OVERPOWER 
 CARD GAME AS WELL AS POKEMON AND IF THIS IS ANY KIND OF A REPRESENTATION OF THE VS SYSTEM I WILL 
 SAVE MY MONEY.

Review:  Ok, before playing this I had played Magic, and learned the rules of Yugioh, and had no trouble 
 learning the game. However, even with the tutorials and things, it could be pretty difficult to 
 learn this as your first card game. If you do plan on playing this as your first card game, I'd 
 recommend going on the community website, and downloading the PC demo, and doing the tutorials 
 and first few battles on the larger screen.
  
  One of the things I was worried about when I picked the game up was that people were writing about 
 how, three hours after starting, they still hadn't beaten the first level. That fight in the end 
 took no more than fifteen minutes. I didn't really reach a wall until fighting Spiderman at the 
 end of chapter one. What I did notice, however, was that everyone talking about how hard those 
 first few battles went hero, instead of villain. In my opinion, go villain; your starting deck 
 sucks a lot less. So all and all, not too difficult, but a number of the fights have been a challenge, 
 taking a number of tries.
  
  I own both a DS and a PSP, and got this game for the DS because that way I didn't have to pay for 
 multiplayer. Unfortunately, no one is ever on (or it takes like five minutes to set up a match) . 
 SO I have not been able to play multiplayer.
  
  Graphics are what I've come to expect on the DS; just a bit better than a GBA. Sound is repetitive 
 and dull.
  
  All and all, a upper mediocre game, but, hey, it was what I was looking for. Play a card game by 
 yourself and for less than the paper versions. =)

Review:  I have only had this game for a day but it is highly addicting. However it is also extremely difficult. 
 The learning curve on this game is really high. This is due to the fact that it is unlike most 
 cards battle games. I am a huge fan of Marvel Comics, but not a big fan of Card battle games. I 
 love this game though. The art is true to the source material. The only set back to this game (other 
 then the difficulty) is the sound. The sound is awful. It is sort of rock music, but it is in continuos 
 loop and thats all it is one song the whole time. there is no voice acting at all, anywhere. All 
 in All if you are a fan of Marvel Comics, or card battle games, or both, I suggest you pick up 
 Marvel Trading Card Game for the Nintendo DS

Review:  Let me say that overall I reall enjoy this game. I have never really played the Marvel card based 
 game so at first it was very difficult for me to hvae any idea what I was doing. After about 3 
 days of playing it and reading the forums I have started to catch on with how to play. I still 
 have trouble and it is still hard but the fact is I have fun while I am playing so I just stick 
 with it. The cards have great art work and I love how each card has its own description on it. 
 There are many decks to unlock as well as game boards to play on. The super hero gameplay is awesome. 
 I haven't tried the villian side yet but you can choose playing the bad guy on the bad side if 
 you wish so that is a nice touch for some replay value. If you have played the Marvel card game 
 in real life you might be able to pick this up and play with no problem but for me it is still 
 kinda of hard. One thing I didn't like so far was the tutorial. It was useless for me. Overall 
 its a great game if you like card games and super heros or comic books. If any of those things 
 are a interest to you then buy this game for your DS,
