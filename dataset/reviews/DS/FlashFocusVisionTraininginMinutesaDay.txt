:::Review:::
It's debatable exactly how well this collection of minigames will really help your vision, but it's 
 fun all the same. 

  OK, so between the Brain Age games and Big Brain Academy, your mind is super sharp. Your noggin 
 can cut glass, but what about your vision? It's probably a total mess. That's probably why Nintendo 
 and Namco have teamed up to take the Brain Age concept to a new series of minigames with a focus 
 on hand-eye coordination, as well as other visual concepts, with the release of Flash Focus. OK, 
 so the science is probably just as shaky as it was in Brain Age, but either way, this collection 
 of quick and easy minigames is still pretty good.  

           We have it on good authority that the final challenge in this game teaches you how to 
 fire lasers out of your eyes. Don't tell anyone we told you.      

  Like Brain Age, the game is broken up into a couple of different modes. The Eye Age Check gives 
 you a series of random tests and, depending on how you do, assigns your eyes an age. The younger 
 your eyes are, the better. The random tests are taken from the longer list of training exercises, 
 which are broken up into core games and sports games. The core has you playing a shell game as 
 you try to follow a box with a circle hidden under it while it swaps around with two empty boxes, 
 among other things. The sports games are a little more involved than the typical minigame you'd 
 find in a game like this, and they look a bit better too. Boxing is a training game, where a trainer 
 holds out pads for you to tap with the DS stylus. Baseball has you tap the screen to hit a ball, 
 but you have to tap at the right time to get a good, clean hit. Basketball slides players into 
 frame and quickly turns them into black silhouettes. You must keep track of which players were 
 wearing your team's colors and tap the friendly players. It's all fairly fast-paced, and once you 
 master one game, a harder version of it unlocks. There are plenty of games to play too, but you'll 
 have to keep coming back and training every day to unlock most of them. While it's more twitchy 
 and less mind-empowering than the stuff in the Brain Age games, it's still a fun collection.  

 
  Visually, the game maintains a lot of the same elements as the Brain Age games, such as the calendar, 
 the ability to change your stamp, the way you sign your name in a box to create a profile, and 
 the like. The games themselves have a different look, though. For example, the game has you hold 
 the DS as you normally would rather than rotate it as you would in Brain Age. And the sports games 
 have a different look from the stick figure stuff in Brain Age. It's a welcome change. The sound 
 effects are minimal, while the menu music is upbeat and pleasant.  

  The game also has an eye-relaxation process that it takes you through after training. The relaxation 
 section has you rolling your eyes, blinking, and generally unwinding after a hard day of eye training, 
 which -- as we all know -- is 2007's version of working in a coal mine. It's accompanied by speech, 
 so you can still figure out what you're supposed to be doing even when your eyes are supposed to 
 be closed. As a result, playing this in public can look particularly silly. You can skip the eye 
 relaxation if you like, but unleashing your wound-up eyes on an unsuspecting world sounds pretty 
 dangerous. It's probably best to just do what the game says and not leave anything to chance. You 
 can also play with another player using download play, which lets you compete in some of the minigames. 

  The nicest part about Flash Focus is that like the other Touch Generations games that Nintendo 
 has released, it's available at a budget price. For a simple little collection of fun minigames, 
 $20 sounds just about right. If you've enjoyed other games of this ilk, you'll find Flash Focus 
 to be a refreshing alternative.

Review:  If you want "Brain Age: Vision Improvement Edition," Flash Focus is pretty much that. The minigames 
 are more fun than Brain Age and (supposedly) help improve your vision, but the game, like Brain 
 Age, gets old real quick. The games are divided into two sections, one for the basic eye training 
 stuff and one for sports-related minigames, most of which are actually pretty good and fun, but, 
 again, they just won't hold your attention for more than a week or so. There are also eye 'relaxation' 
 excersises that actually made my eyes hurt the one time I tried them. If you fall under the category 
 of 'casual gamer' then this game may be right for you, and for $20 why not give it a shot if you 
 have the chance? But for those of us who play video games more than just casually, Flash Focus 
 won't hold your attention for long.

Review:  You wait all this time just to play a mini game, which I usually have a lot of fun playing mini 
 games, but some of the mini games in Flash Focus can get aggravating. I had fun playing at first, 
 but I can only play for a little bit a day. Overall, I think Flash Focus and all the Brain Ages 
 are a good idea, but it's just not my style. I don't recommend that you go out and buy it for yourself, 
 but i do recommend that if someone gets you it as a gift, just keep it. It's good to have but not 
 necessary to buy...
  
  While I was playing Flash Focus, I kind of got a headache. I think my favorite thing about this 
 game was the baseball game. In the baseball game, you just have to tap the box at the right time. 
 It's all about timing. It's sometimes hard to time when the pitch and the pitch speed is different 
 almost every pitch... oh well. It's just an OK game. I give it a 7.0.

Review:  Flash Focus recieved mixed reviews because it was 'debatable' whether or not the game actually 
 helped your eyes. It will not seem as if it does at first but after a few play-throughs you quickly 
 realize how much of a great value this game is. You go through some simple-to-VERY hard mini games 
 that test your eyesight. The simple idea is worked out well, and really helps sometimes. 
  
  GAMEPLAY: 8.5/10
  
  While, honestly, the developer's focus in Flash Focus wasn't to make 
 a visually stunning game, it is actually very nice. The sports games (baseball, the punching one, 
 etc.) feature some nicely rendered graphics.
  
  GRAPHICS: 7.5/10
  
  There are some simple tunes, not much but is well suited for the game. 
  
  SOUND: 7.5/10
 
  
  This game is meant to be played every day and with its addictive system and replayability, I bet 
 it will be.
  
  LASTING APPEAL: 9/10
  
  Overall, Flash Focus is well worth the value if you are looking for fun, yet challenging games 
 that can actually help your health.

Review:  well this game its really well done, because with the new games that you win, the variety of 
 games that have, it really take you eyes in the game.
  and i recommend everyone that at least 2 times a week take the eyes relaxing, because your eyes 
 really get tired.
  some are easy to me, but i dont know how are the eyes of other people.
  you will be winning things, like games, new stickers, and with time, a new game mode.
  and you 
 will be able how your skills have improved, with the graphs, that way, youll see if you have gotten 
 better or worst.
  
  scores: this game takes in count how much you make mistakes, and how much you do it right, if you 
 do it right once, you level up, but you still playing, leveling up just makes it harder, and makes 
 you make a mistake, but the less mistakes you do, the better your score is, the limit is 100, but 
 if you do really good scores, you will unlock the hard mode in each game by separate, you must 
 do good scores in every game to unlock the hard mode in each one, and there are ranking, depending 
 on your score, and with the graphs youll see if you have gotten better of worst (i always stay 
 in the same or get better xD) .
  
  this game makes an "eye age check" wich one takes games that you have already have, and the better 
 you get on those proves, the better your aye age will be! (but you can practice for this test how 
 much as you want) .
  
  sports: this game have sports games, they are the most popular, in each one you must do real-life 
 things, like batting in baseball, passing in basketball, normal ping-pong play, punching mitts 
 in boxing, passing the ball in soccer, spiking in volleyball, and avoiding while running in football, 
 and in these sports game, you have must practice the normal games, that are the ones from the test, 
 the sports is to see how much you are in an overall, but every sport has its diferent combination 
 of needed skills.
  
  
  
  pros: 
  -it really strenghts your games, believe it or not.
  -the scores lets you see if you are good 
 or not.
  -good visuals.
  -good sounds.
  -you can do the eye check any time you want, but you just can do it one a day.
  -good features.
 
  -you can make up to 4 files.
  
  cons:
  -you cant play too much a day (i mean, i just saves itself one a day) .
  -no multiplayer mode 
 (but it would be useless) .
  -you might get tired.
