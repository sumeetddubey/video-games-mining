This isn't the brightest puzzle game you'll ever play, but it's a quality distraction in short bursts. 
 

  The premise for Prism: Light the Way, a new puzzle game for the Nintendo DS, is that sullen creatures 
 known as glowbos are dying from darkness. Only the healing light of creatures known as bulboids 
 can save them. To get the bulboids to the glowbos, you have to tap and drag the bulboids, as well 
 as a bunch of power-ups and devices, around each of 120 different puzzle boards. It's a pretty 
 simplistic formula, but one that does manage to make for some tricky puzzles.  

  The main mode, the puzzle mode, puts you through a progression of all 120 of the game's puzzles. 
 The puzzles themselves are all based on the touch screen, and you simply drag the various pieces 
 around the board until the light refracts to all the glowbos on the stage. However, it's harder 
 than it sounds. Some glowbos are in positions that the bulboids can't reach, given that bulboids 
 shoot light only in a straight line. Others are color-coded and require a specific color of light 
 for success. To reach these specialized glowbos, you have to bend or color the light using light 
 splitters, mirrors, and colored prisms. There are also hard blocks scattered around each stage, 
 which makes positioning even tougher. Creating the necessary strings of light required to feed 
 all the glowbos on the screen is a lot more challenging than you'd expect. Fortunately, there is 
 a hint mechanism to get you moving again if you get stuck, though you lose the hint function after 
 level 40.  

           It looks simple, but it's trickier than you'd think.      

  Outside of the core puzzle mode, there are a few other options. Time mode adds a ticking clock 
 to the proceedings, and hyper mode does basically the same thing, except that the glowbos explode 
 after a certain amount of time. Predictably, infinite mode gives you an infinite number of random 
 puzzles, and using hints in this mode reduces your score. There are also two multiplayer modes: 
 competitive and cooperative. The competitive mode is just a two-player version of the timed mode, 
 in which both players try to beat a series of puzzles while the clock ticks, and the player who 
 runs out of time first loses. Co-op has you and a friend playing the same puzzle with different 
 halves of the board on each player's screen. You can use only the pieces on your side of the board, 
 which makes this an exceptionally tricky little mode. None of these mode options mess with the 
 core gameplay much, but there's just enough variety to them to keep you from getting bored.  

 
  Prism isn't the kind of game that will suck you in for long periods of time. The mechanics are 
 exceedingly simple, and the game's total lack of presentational flair might cause you to doze off 
 from time to time. Nevertheless, Prism's puzzles are generally pretty good, and it's a nice little 
 time killer when played in short bursts. It's not the sort of game that can be played over long 
 stretches, but as the sort of thing you can pick up for a few minutes at a time, it's a decent 
 distraction. The game is maybe a bit overpriced at $29.99, but it's still worth a look if you're 
 on the hunt for a new puzzle game for your DS.

Review:  There have been a lot of rather random touch based games all over the DS lately, with many of them 
 being simply a bad idea, but this one doesn't quite fit that category. While the story counts for 
 nothing and the graphics are below average and the music is an slightly addictive single loop track, 
 the puzzle aspect is where the game is supposed to 'shine' and indeed does. Its a simple idea, 
 use lights of different colors to light up the light starved globos and when all globos are properly 
 lit, you win the level. The simple yet elegant idea is put onto the DS and controlled with the 
 touch screen with very little problems, and no problems that could cause you to lose in puzzle 
 mode (in which you can't really lose) . While the first 2-3 tiers offer no challenge whatsoever, 
 the game gets progressively harder and by just the 7th tier (out of 15) , you may already be scratching 
 your head. There are also time attack mode, hyper mode, infinite mode, and single card multiplayer 
 (the mutliplayer having 2 modes, battle or co-op) .
  
  All in all, there is actually quite a bit to do in this little package that you should consider 
 picking up if you enjoy puzzle games or the puzzle aspects in bejeweled, puzzle quest, super collapse, 
 or enigmo.

Review:  I've played something like this before in a freeware game for PalmOS. You arrange mirrors and splitters 
 to hit targets. This game mixes it up with filtered light, with each target requiring a certain 
 color. My favorite mode is Hyper . You're given a down-facing bulboid (the light emitting dudes) 
 and two mirrors. As the Glowbos (the targets) appear all about the grid, you have to maneuver the 
 Buboid and mirrors to channel light to the Glowbo before it explodes. As you continue, the game 
 tosses in some filters and different colored Glowbos, making for obstacles and short-cuts at once. 
 As this mode gets on in difficulty, I'm reminded of Wario's Woods, where keeping up with the game 
 was not so much the pace, but consistently making the right move. As a result, it's very satisfying 
 when you take out several Glowbos with one sweeping motion.
  
  I've only seen the first four tiers of the puzzle mode, and the hyper mode. The game is painfully 
 easy for the first two tiers, but quickly requires a bit of thought to get through the puzzles. 
 I imagine it will get very complex as I'm only a quarter through the puzzle mode. I'll revise this 
 when I've had more time with the game. I'll have to give the multiplayer a try. That may be the 
 deal-breaker for it's $29.99 price tag (sure to drop before long) .
