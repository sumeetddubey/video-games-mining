:::Review:::
Most of the minigames are lame and the touch-screen controls rarely work like they should. 

 
  Turn It Around is a collection of 24 minigames that all involve using the stylus to nudge and 
 spin a large wheel depicted on the touch screen. The game also allows two players to duke it out 
 competitively by linking up two individual DS systems and cartridges. However, before you go rushing 
 out to buy what ought to be the second coming of WarioWare, you should know that the majority of 
 minigames included in Turn It Around are lame and the touch-screen controls rarely work like they 
 should.  

  Like Nintendo's WarioWare, the minigames in Turn It Around vary widely in terms of length and quality. 
 The best ones are the knockoffs of Taito's classic games, such as Arkanoid and Fishing Master, 
 which employ elaborate graphics. They also really give you a workout moving the onscreen representations 
 of the paddle or fishing pole back and forth. There are six or seven minigames like that, while 
 the rest are less time-consuming or good-looking; they tend to feature simpler tasks like keeping 
 a man upright on the subway or guiding sushi pieces on a conveyor to their intended recipients. 

           By spinning the disc on the touch screen, you make the characters and backgrounds on the 
 top screen move, generally left or right.      

  The controls behind every minigame are roughly identical. There's a round disc on the touch screen, 
 and you're supposed to rotate it using the stylus. A few minigames require fine, short movements. 
 The rest challenge you to make rapid circles with the stylus as if you were trying to drill through 
 the machine. While that does start to feel uncomfortable after a while, the real problem is that 
 the game can't keep up with the stylus during those speedy minigames. Rather than spinning rapidly, 
 the onscreen disc will start and stop instead. An alternative, button-based control scheme is available 
 for most games. The button setups are generally counterintuitive, which means you won't feel as 
 drawn in to the experience as you would using the touch screen. Ironically, though, you'll achieve 
 better scores using the buttons.  

  Even if the minigames weren't lame and the controls weren't dodgy, you'd still find yourself becoming 
 tired of Turn It Around within minutes. WarioWare had multiple competitions and story arcs. The 
 single-player mode in Turn It Around simply involves completing all 24 games. They do feature cute 
 cartoon characters in goofy settings, at least. The two-player mode is slightly more enjoyable 
 because another person is involved, but you and your friend will quickly grow tired of that too 
 after you've had your fill of randomizing events or competing to see who can control the most board 
 game squares.  

  While many of the game's shortcomings are predictable, considering the game's budget price, that 
 doesn't excuse the poor minigame design or the broken touch-screen controls. The Nintendo DS definitely 
 needs an alternative to Nintendo's WarioWare. Unfortunately, Turn It Around is not it.

Review:  it would be easier to write the good than list all of the bad so lets do that. ready? go! . . . 
 . . . . . . oh, wait - there is NO good. bad graphics, poor touch screen use, boring and non-working 
 mini games... the list never stops. i only paid three dollars and i wanted SOMETHING to play and 
 still i feel like my three dollars would have been better off ripped up and thrown out a window.
 
  this one is going in my bag and i am handing it to the first kid i see with a ds.
  :P
  bad art, poorly thought out games which all revolve around using the stylus to spin a wheel. it's 
 just not fun. the games are, well, dumb. i even let my little girl play and she was like, "this 
 is stupid, sorry mom." she's 6. 
  next time i am in sore need of a game to pop into my ds i guess i will do more research - i thought, 
 it's cheap and cute and might be good of a day or two - um, no, no, and no.

Review:  In "Turn It Around", all you do is spin, flick, or nudge a wheel on the touch screen to accomplish 
 each of the 24 minigames included. Now, I first thought "Oh, this might be something new and fresh 
 to the whole minigame collection genre!" but no. Out of the 24 minigames, there are only 2 I actually 
 wanted to play: Arkanoid and fishing. Other minigames such as skateboarding, pottery turning, and 
 bug flicking are all very easy and dumb. Your award for getting a high score is a picture of the 
 pink or orange dude/dudette giving you thumbs up.
  Pros: 
  Some of the characters have some charm.
  Arkanoid and fishing are pretty good, but that's it.
 
  It has multiplayer?
  Cons:
  No slight sight of some story mode or something deep to keep you engaged to this game for more 
 than five minutes.
  22 of the mingames suck.
  Bad music.
  3D graphics are yucky.
  The touch screen can't handle the fast rotations you do on the wheel.
  Need I to say more?
 
  Just, please, if you do decide to play/buy/borrow this game, don't expect much...
