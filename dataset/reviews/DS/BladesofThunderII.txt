There's nothing fun or exciting about flying helicopters in Blades of Thunder II. And considering 
 that's all you do in the game, that's really sad. 

  Either the original Blades of Thunder was a smash hit that nobody knows about, or the sequel was 
 so cheap to make that it bore no foreseeable risk for publisher Summitsoft. Whatever the reason, 
 Blades of Thunder II is here, and it has the distinction of being the first helicopter combat game 
 to grace the Nintendo DS. Aside from that there's absolutely nothing notable about Blades of Thunder 
 II. It's a generic, shallow, and boring shooter that starts getting old the moment you start it 
 up.  

          Terrorists are everywhere, but your special fog-piercing ammo will take them down.     
 

  It's certainly not on par with even the worst episode of  Airwolf , but Blades of Thunder II does 
 have a story of sorts. The game is about a fictional group of peace-loving helicopter pilots known 
 as the World Anti-Terrorist Coalition, who are in charge of protecting freedom and eliminating 
 the terrorist group known as the Solar Martyrs. One day you're sent on a standard mission to blow 
 up a bunch of terrorist training camps in South America (which is extra great, since the back of 
 the box says the game takes place in the Middle East) , but as soon as you take off, the WATC headquarters 
 is destroyed... by terrorists, of course. There's no time to ponder the irony, though, as the attack 
 leaves you all alone to eliminate the terrorist threat by hovering around and pecking at indiscernible 
 enemies from afar with a machine gun.  

  There are more than 15 missions in the single-player campaign, which range from blowing up enemy 
 communication towers to blowing up enemy communication satellite dishes. It all amounts to flying 
 around a large, open map moving from one radar blip to the next until you've eliminated all the 
 blips. It's not quite that easy, though, because the maps are crawling with terrorist helicopters, 
 battleships, missile turrets, and tanks. Luckily, all of those terrorists can easily be taken out 
 with a few rounds from your handy infinite chaingun. You can also use heat-seeking missiles and 
 unguided missiles, but they are in limited supply and aren't any more effective than the chaingun. 

  Flying into enemy territory will get you killed in a hurry, but since the machine gun has unlimited 
 range (and can even shoot through mountains it seems) , you can just hover out of range of your 
 enemies and pick them off one by one. Since the draw distance in the game is short, you'll often 
 just be shooting into the fog and listening for the sound that indicates when you're hitting a 
 target. You know where to shoot because there's a little yellow targeting reticle that snaps on 
 to enemies regardless of whether they're visible or not. Needless to say, shooting at fog gets 
 old pretty quickly.  

  The controls in Blades of Thunder II are fairly flexible and easy to use. You move the helicopter 
 forward and backward with the D pad and shoot with the L button. You can aim and rotate your helicopter 
 using the four face buttons or by using the touch screen. The touch screen control works fairly 
 well and allows for quicker, more precise aiming than the buttons. No matter which control scheme 
 you use, you'll be frustrated by the lack of altitude control. There's no way to manually adjust 
 your altitude in the game, which is a problem because there are a lot of mountains and valleys 
 to negotiate on the maps. It's best to just avoid flying over mountains altogether, but if you 
 have to, you can inch up against a spot of raised terrain and after a few seconds and a bit of 
 coaxing, your helicopter will rise up over the new level of the land. More often than not, when 
 you do try to go over a mountain, you'll end up running into it and crashing before the game figures 
 out what you're trying to do. As a result, the stages tend to feel confined, which takes all of 
 the fun out of flying.  

  There are three different helicopters in the game, the main difference being maneuverability and 
 ammo capacity. You can also pick up and purchase upgrades for your helicopters to increase the 
 power of your machine gun, add more missiles, or bolster your armor. However, the upgrade system 
 is limited, and the helicopters in this game are nothing to get excited about.  

          This game somehow makes flying attack helicopters seem about as exciting as folding laundry. 
     

  If the single-player campaign isn't your thing, you can choose to play in freeflight mode. You 
 can choose a helicopter, a map, and a time limit and then just fly around and blow stuff up until 
 you get bored, which won't take long. If somehow you still haven't had enough of this game after 
 that, you can play with up to three other players (who must each have a copy of the game) in a 
 multiplayer deathmatch mode.  

  Even if you have a profound affinity for helicopters, you'll get bored with this game rather quickly. 
 The combat is repetitive and boring, and even the simple act of flying around an open map is completely 
 bereft of enjoyment. There's nothing fun about shooting fog and stiffly flying over pixelated terrain, 
 and that's about all there is to do in Blades of Thunder II.

Review:  I'm not sure on Blades of Thunder the first game? But this game has some or alot of issues. Its ok 
 for newbies like 6-9 yr olds. this is a type of sim that should not be on the ds period. It has the 
 basic controls for flying but its definetly an arcade level game. forget the dual thumb control. It 
 is very robotic. Stylus use is ok. over all its just a game. Remember Nuclear Strike? It was ok then. 
 But that game is a hell of alot better than this one. If this manufacture was to follow any type 
 of game play for this level of handheld .I think a new more bird eye view or even a little more 
 choices of views might have helped this game. Stick to a more cartoonish look instead of relistic 
 looking aircraft. Kinda Metal Slugish that might be more fitting for the control factor.

Review:  I just rec'd yet another DS-LITE in Navy today AND a copy of BLADES of THUNDER 2 for the DS as 
 well. I was surprised to find little or no info about it anywhere. The game was hard to find and 
 now that I've had a few minutes to load it, I can say I know I'll be spending a lot of 'quality' 
 time with it. The DS seems to make this more intuitive from a gameplay standpoint. I did a little 
 test battle and can see this will be a lot of challenging fun! The graphics are awesome considering 
 the platform and the price was what you'd normally consider 'bargain basement'.. What a deal at 
 $20! The price alone makes it a MUST have. I'll write more as I have a chance this evening to delve 
 in and shake'r down! Again, I'm not a hard-corer but, I like my gaming every bit as much and I 
 like games that may not require a life investment in time. I don't have hundreds of free hours 
 a day available to me. This will be a GREAT quick pick up for a few minutes and be able to move 
 on to other things kind of game....
  
  After having spent a lot of time with this game, I now would like to add the following. I've discovered 
 the scenery is not 'real' and you can target and destroy enemies literally through the scenry whether 
 it's a mountain or bridge or whatever. I find this to be a real detraction from the realism it 
 could have exhibited. As a result, I am changing my initial rating from a 9.3 to an 8.0. It's still 
 fun to play but, there is definately something missing here... They could have done better.. It 
 explains the $20 pricetag as well. At $20 bucks, the 8.0 is appropriate. At $35!! no way....
