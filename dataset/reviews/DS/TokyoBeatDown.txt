:::Review:::
Despite its amusing story and crazy characters, Tokyo Beat Down can't fight off mediocrity. 

 
  Breaking the law in the world of Tokyo Beat Down is not a good idea. A simple dine-and-dash in 
 this side-scrolling beat-'em-up can result in a thrashing usually reserved for the worst kind of 
 criminal. The cops of Tokyo Beat Down are so hardcore they make Dirty Harry look like a pushover. 
 Unfortunately, the gameplay of this bland brawler can't handle the extreme justice of their fists. 

           Fines don't work for the beast cops. Parking violators get a kick to the face.      

 
  Tokyo Beat Down stars the "beast cops" of the titular city's Yaesu police station. These cops 
 shoot first and ask questions never. You'll spend the bulk of your time playing as the flamboyant 
 criminal kicker Lewis Cannon as he investigates a series of crimes in Tokyo. Cannon is a fierce 
 fighter (you could say he's a loose cannon -- get it?) , but he isn't exactly the shiniest badge on 
 the force, and the same goes for most of his colleagues. After a few not-so-subtle clues point 
 to a connection in recent crimes, the cops band together to take down an old rival and his mysterious 
 employers. The story itself isn't groundbreaking, but the completely over-the-top characters and 
 ridiculous dialogue raise it above the average brawler story. Some of the cutscenes drag on too 
 long and others seem to exist only to deliver a pun-filled joke, but for the most part, the story 
 is strangely entertaining, like an episode of  Law &amp; Order  with cartoon characters.  

  Billed as a classic coin-op-style brawler, Tokyo Beat Down is reminiscent of the simplistic side-scrollers 
 that flooded arcades in the late '80s. There just isn't much to the TBD formula. Levels consist 
 of moving left to right, beating up fools, and then watching cutscenes. Some levels switch it up 
 and require you to move left to right, talk to random (and repetitive) character models, and watch 
 cutscenes, but that's about as fun as it sounds. Good brawlers make up for the repetitive nature 
 of the genre with a variety of enemies and combat maneuvers, but Tokyo Beat Down does not. There 
 are a number of different character models in the game, but most of them behave identically -- spamming 
 the same move until either they die or you do. As for your move set, it can be expanded by finding 
 scrolls throughout the game, but not by much. Guns and item pickups are scattered throughout the 
 levels, but using a firearm is often more of a hassle than it's worth.  

  Tokyo Beat Down's biggest letdown is its controls. The core punching and kicking controls work 
 fine, but the functions assigned to the shoulder buttons -- drawing your gun and blocking -- are unresponsive. 
 By the time the game has registered that you've drawn your gun, you're getting punched in the face. 
 Even if you draw your gun in time, hitting someone with it isn't guaranteed since there is no foolproof 
 way to aim. Not being able to block when you need to means you'll die more than you should. The 
 enemy AI is pure evil, often hitting you just as you get up or shooting you from offscreen, forcing 
 you into a death-inducing fall cycle.  

           Tokyo Beat Down is one part humor and one part frustration.      

  The sweet side 
 of Tokyo Beat Down's bitter gameplay is the pretty visuals. Despite some occasionally rigid animations, 
 the large detailed character models capture the quirky cops perfectly. The crisp 3D backgrounds 
 are filled with layers of little details that add depth and character to the environments. As great 
 as the levels look, they do get tiresome, since the game forces you to revisit most of them several 
 times. The music is mostly forgettable, and the battle cries of your cops get annoying fast. This 
 is one game that can be played with the volume down.  

  With a play time of around six hours (less than that if you skip cutscenes) , Tokyo Beat Down still 
 feels too long. The repetitive gameplay and sluggish, unresponsive controls make progress a chore. 
 The crazy story and absurd characters are certainly entertaining, but they aren't worth mashing 
 your way through hours of poor combat to see.
