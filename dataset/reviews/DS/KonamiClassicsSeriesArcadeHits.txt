:::Review:::
You won't enjoy every single one of the 15 games included, but Konami Classics has just enough good 
 stuff to make it worthwhile. 

  Konami's history goes way back to the late '60s, but the company first started to attract real 
 attention in the '80s with a healthy list of arcade games that seeded the ground for its eventual 
 expansion into console game development. While plenty of those arcade hits have been released in 
 various forms elsewhere, now the Nintendo DS is getting a stout compilation of 15 games from Konami's 
 past. The games feel pretty accurate, though the screen size of the Nintendo DS leaves a lot of 
 the games looking a little squashed.  

          You might not remember Roc'n Rope, but it's totally worth playing.     

  Using a rotating 
 wheel on the bottom screen, you can choose from Time Pilot, Roc'n Rope, Track &amp; Field, Circus 
 Charlie, Basketball, Road Fighter, Yie Ar Kung-Fu, Rainbow Bell (perhaps better known as Twinbee) , 
 Shao-Lin's Road, Gradius, Rush'n Attack, Contra, Scramble, Horror Maze, and Pooyan. Obviously, 
 some of those games are better known than others, and some of those games are better than others. 
 Basketball, for example, is a dreadful arcade game that's not much fun to play at all. But games 
 like Contra, Gradius, Time Pilot, and Yie Ar Kung-Fu are still reasonably exciting to play. By 
 default, the games run on the top screen. You can pause the game at any time to access a few different 
 options, including a few that change the orientation of the game screen. But most of the viable 
 options squish the screen a bit and take out a few lines of resolution, making a lot of the text 
 very hard to read. If you dig deep into the game options, you'll find pictures of the actual printed 
 circuit boards of the arcade machines, complete with adjustable DIP switches that let you change 
 the game's difficulty, the sound in attract mode, the number of lives, and so on. It's a cool way 
 to handle these settings that gives the whole package a more authentic feel.  

  In addition to just playing the games by yourself, you can link up with another player for two-player 
 games, and you can record yourself playing, then send those replays to other players so they can 
 watch your performance. Since the package is light on two-player simultaneous games, the link up 
 feature isn't supremely useful, but it's necessary where Contra is concerned.  

  While you probably won't spend too much time on games like Road Fighter or Circus Charlie, there 
 are enough bona fide classics to give the collection a first look, and there's enough depth with 
 some of the lesser-known arcade games to make it worth a second and third look, too.

Review:  I really liked this new classics game. Contra and Gradius are probably the best games on there. 
 I sometimes forget how hard some of those old-school games can be. Time Pilot and Yie Ar Kung Fu 
 are great classics from the mid 80s. Yie Ar Kung Fu definitely could be viewed as the grand-dad 
 of Street Fighter, so kudos to Konami. 
  
  I would have liked to see Super Contra and Ninja Turtles instead of some of the filler games like 
 Pooyan and Basketball. Basketball is absolutely horrible, I don't think the developers actually 
 understood the game of basketball. 
  
  If you are not a retro gamer, you will not enjoy this gamepak much. But for those of us who grew 
 up in the 80s, this is a great way to relive those old-school games.

Review:  With 15 titles, including the classic Contra and Rush 'n Attack. Konami Arcade classics is a must 
 have for fans of old arcade games. New-comers may be turned off by the high level of challenge, 
 but in my opinion that's what made these games so great to begin with. While it is sad that some 
 great Konami games like Super Contra, and Ajax are not included, there's still plenty to keep you 
 busy. It is also interesting that Arcade Classics seems to mimic M. A. M. E. , albeit with less features. 
 A nice feature is the ability to play in portrait or landscape mode. Strangely the game defaults 
 to landscape even though the majority of games were portrait. Stand out games in order of awesomeness;
 
  1) Track and Field
  2) Contra
  3) Rush 'n Attack
  4) Yie Ar Kung-Fu
  5) Road Fighter*
  
  *Surprisingly fun

Review:  It didn't take but a few minutes to go through the list of games included in this collection to 
 realize that there just wasn't enough to validate paying $30 for this collection. Luckily I found 
 it for $20 at Best Buy and had a $5 coupon so I only paid $15 in the end. Even still, it wasn't 
 what I was expecting,,, I wanted this to be as great as the Capcom Classics collections and hopefully 
 better than (if not on par with) the Namco Collection or Midway's Extended Play on PSP. Boy was 
 I wrong.
  
  It seems that Konami was better suited to the home console market. That's obviously where they 
 shine because there wasn't a single title in the collection that made me want to keep at it until 
 I reached the end for the classic Congratulations! Game Over screen. I understand that these are 
 retro games from the 80's, but damn... I don't remember these titles being that hot back when I 
 was a kid. Yes, I am old enough to have played these titles when they were fresh in what we used 
 call back in the day arcades . People would gather around the cabnet to watch some punk kid trying 
 to get the high score on Ms. Pac-Man, or wait for their turn to show the crowd what they were made 
 of in Street Fighter 2 or Mortal Kombat, but you never saw that kind of love for Circus Charlie 
 or Time Pilot. Sure they got played, but let's face it... Galaga and Rally-X were much better games. 
 It's not that the games were ALL bad... just most of them. The biggest problem was that there were 
 no improvements to the titles. The controls were just as bad as I remembered them from the arcades, 
 and why the hell could you only continue a few times in Contra before it gve you no more options 
 to continue? There should have been some sort of update to all of these titles to keep the nostalgia 
 but brush away the dust
  
  Overall, it's not a bad collection of nostalgia, but this is not a collection worth having on your 
 shelf. In fact, I was scratching my head 20 minutes after I popped it in my DS wondering which 
 of 4 or 5 games did I want to play... and I'm not talking about titles in the collection. For those 
 who loved Yie Ar Kung Fu and Scramble, this may be the collection for you. If you weren't old enough 
 to remember these titles, never dropped a quarter into Rus N' Attack, or thought tha Contra was 
 a NES game that everyone talked about but you never played, just continue to buy Konami's other 
 fine products. For the rest of you, find it cheap or find other alternatives to this collection. 
 Konami should seriously consider a NES Greatest Hits Collection... that I would pay $30 for.

Review:  As complications go this is by far the best ive played, excellent presentation, lots of options 
 inc' cheats, screen size and position, multiplayer WI-FI mode. Since playing this ive tried them 
 all and they are all faithful to the originals and all come with their own options and instructions 
 and tips. There are 15, yes 15 arcade games here many i had on home computers in the 1980's (i'm 
 27) . It had been years since i had played the likes of Time-pilot, Nemesis or Yi-ar-kung-fu, but 
 the best one after contra is Track and field, yes this arcade classic now in the palm of your hand, 
 and my poor DS's buttons have took one hell of a beating the last week, i really am addictive to 
 this one and even after completing it you want to go back and beat your score.. It really doesn't 
 matter if you have played them before, as 15 games and multiplayer via one game cart is a bargain. 
 So do yourself a favour and get this one as soon as you can.
