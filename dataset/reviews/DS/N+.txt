:::Review:::
The addictive gameplay and stylish design of N+ fit almost perfectly into the tight confines of 
 today's handhelds. 

  Not too long ago, an aspiring designer created a series of death traps for ninjas. These traps 
 were not merely cunning mazes or killing-machine-filled rooms, but also a downloadable game for 
 the PC. The game was known as N, a stylishly short abbreviation for Ninja. Atari now enables you 
 to enjoy redesigned ninja challenges on the go in the form of N+ on the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP. 

           Collecting gold is the key to longevity.      

  When picking up the game, you become the guide for a bell-bottom-clad ninja as he crosses chasms 
 and traverses increasingly challenging mazes to activate switches -- or series of switches -- to get 
 to the all-important exit. By making use of a full repertoire of moves, you can find the little 
 guy a way out of more than 200 encounters. Available moves include a wall jump, a wall slide, and 
 the ability to sprint up or down inclines. You can even bound off of walls and shifting blocks. 
 Although you don't have a sword or a double-jump ability, you do have plenty of control over your 
 in-flight movement. This will help you land on narrow ledges, slip through tight passages, and 
 reverse your momentum to avoid any number of diabolical devices. The creators of the various levels 
 cunningly imbedded deadly red mines, electrified blue orbs, and stationary units that shoot homing 
 missiles or deadly accurate projectiles.  

  As if the enemies and level designs were not challenging enough, a timer in the top screen ruthlessly 
 counts down a collection of microseconds toward zero or otherwise inescapable failure. As you traverse 
 the level, you can grab gold bricks to extend your total time. These units of golden measure are 
 frequently located in hard-to-reach or danger-soaked areas. The time you accumulate carries over 
 from map to map in five-map sets. Completing map collections unlocks victory animations, alternate 
 costumes, and other commodities that came standard in the Xbox 360 release or via homebrew download 
 on the PC. Despite the other versions granting you access to these items from the start, recategorizing 
 them as unlockables adds another element of motivation to continue playing from episode to episode. 

  The portable versions update the graphics to make the imagery cleaner, sharper, and slightly more 
 colorful. The trancelike soundtrack that was so great on the 360 is gone. The new soundtrack is 
 not only unlockable in two monotonous flavors (though the PSP version's music is less grating) , 
 but also has been buried in the options menu. While in the options menu, discriminating players 
 can choose to play levels in the shiny, new Plus graphics or in the retro Pure mode. Neither mode 
 of viewing has any affect on gameplay.  

  The level-creation opportunities and multiplayer modes have not disappeared now that the game has 
 been taken on the go. More than 100 levels can be selected to play in four ad-hoc and wireless 
 multiplayer modes. These modes allow players to collaborate, compete, and conspire to beat the 
 system. Aspiring ninja challengers can craft subtle jumping puzzles, mine-filled mazes, and overt 
 areas of enemy encounters. The only limit to your ability to create vexing arenas is your imagination. 
 The tool is simple enough for not only veteran builders but also amateur ninja slayers to compose 
 the most demanding gauntlets for other players to run. New episodes can be uploaded, downloaded, 
 and played via Nintendo Wi-Fi or the Sony PSP's ad-hoc connection.  

           Whether or not you believe these environments are a real pain or really great will depend 
 on your dedication to mastering the art of D pad Ninjitsu.      

  The DS version is cleaner, significantly easier, and optimized for play on the dual screens. The 
 PSP version has the best graphics ever seen in an N+ game, but suffers from long load times, frame 
 rate dips, and less precise controls. While each platform has its own set of levels, the PSP version 
 is definitely more of a challenge for those who have previous N+ experience. Only in the later 
 levels, does the DS version tax those who played other versions. Regardless of the version, the 
 levels are the perfect size for playing on the go.  

  If you have already downloaded the free version on the PC or the port to the Xbox 360, the gameplay 
 in portable versions are only made more compelling and rewarding. At $19.99, N+ is more expensive 
 than previous releases, but new puzzles and a renewed commitment to collaboration mean the opportunities 
 available via the online community are endless. Regardless of your jumping skill, platforming history, 
 or dodging prowess, N+ will be sure to keep you on your toes no matter where you are playing.

Review:  This game is ADDICTIVE. The first few levels are easy then suddenly the hard stuff gets thrown 
 at you. If you know what I mean, it's the frustrating king of hard... you know. Almost, almost, 
 and you die, making you want to try harder but after a while it gets annoying. Another little thing 
 that annoyed me is, robots vs. ninjas, I mean ninjas have weapons (yes there are no weapons) and 
 don't fight robots (with sucky AI and yet it's still hard...) . Also what's with the 2nd screen. 
 I know it's a DS but the other screen could have been used for something else (I can't think of 
 any thing right now but, something) . The level editor's fun to play with but that's the only thing 
 that sticks (at least it sticks) . Also about the PC download (it can also be played as a flash 
 game online but, it's free either way) . The website's at the bottom if you want it. It has different 
 levels but the basic concept is the same (Note: There's no level editor :- ( ) . 
  
  In the end, get it if:
  1. You liked it on PC and want it on the go
  2. You like to be frustrated 
 by games
  3. You're poor (it's only like $20)

Review:  This game is great it is quite the puzzler if your looking for challenge and sometimes it can get 
 a bit frustrating. All in all it comes together to form a great platformer game with stylish gameplay.
 
  It's sort of like Super Mario but you play as a ninja in a puzzled space and you have to reach 
 the exits to pass the level. The only problem is your faced with hopping over mines out running 
 laser beams, and dodging rockets. Which gives it a new/old school feel. It gets frustrating at times 
 because it is so easy to die in this game, the good thing is you dont have a set amount of lives 
 though. Which means you can die over and over on one level until you pass it or your Ds battery 
 dies on you. When i first got this game it seemed very easy until i started unlocking new levels 
 then it just became plain hard. If you like platforming games like Super Mario and other games of 
 that genre then you should definately give N+ a try. You wont be let down.
  Also if your interesting in trying it before you buy it you can easily play the older N game version 
 on your home computer just go to google and type in N and you'll see where you can try it.
  Hope this review helped

Review:  N+ is an enjoyable game, but it's a bit overrated in my opinion.
  CONCEPT
  N+ is the tale of a ninja, who basically collects gold and shows his impressive ninja moves.
 
  You play as a ninja, and you run around a level, find the key, then go to the door.
  Controls
  The controls are simple, d- pad to move, and a or b to jump.
  Music
  This game 
 has a really... interesting soundtrack. Depending on your style, you either love it, or you hated 
 it. I loved it.
  Design
  This game has great graphics, and the levels are well designed.
  
  Now, as much as I talked good about this game, I still agree with my score, a 7.0
  N+ is 
 not for everyone, but it is a worthwhile and fun adventure for anyone who likes 2d platformers.

Review:  N is a fun flash game, but taking it to the DS and adding "plus" at the end really doesn't improve 
 it. Why pay twenty dollars for a game you can play on your computer for free? Sure you might want 
 to play it on the road when you don't have a computer, but why N+ when there are ton's of better 
 games out there?
  
  I played N+ for about 30 minutes and got bored. It has fun game mechanics... for about 20 minutes 
 until you realize that you are playing the same game over and over again with little changes.
 
  
  The graphics aren't the greatest, but the kept the original N graphics so it's great for fans of 
 the original. This, on the other hand, makes it (once again) the same exact game as N but with 
 "plus" at the end of the title. The pretty much only difference is how you can unlock different 
 colors for yourself, which really isn't that big of a deal.
  
  The music and sound effects are nothing special, and (once AGAIN) just about the same as N, it's 
 predecessor. 
  
  So, in conclusion, if you have $20 lying around then why not? But if you want to spend your hard 
 earn cash on something really good, well then check out Gamespot's editor's choices. 
  
  6.5/10 from your friendly neighborhood Galen =D

Review:  For those that don't know, N+ is a stylized version of the cult hit N, a flash game you can still 
 find online. The goal is simple: as a ninja, navigate your way through each successive room you 
 come to, avoiding all obstacles and pitfalls you find along the way, within your allotted time 
 of 90 seconds. That time carries over within each level, each of which are made up of five 'episodes.' 
 
  To exit the level you'll need to reach the green crystal that opens the door. The crystal might 
 be cut off from you by secondary locks, so you must move quickly. You can regain time within a 
 level by collecting gold. With the time you have, you must use your speed and agility to run up 
 walls and leap across chasms. You will face many traps such as bombs and gun turrets, and electrified 
 chaser bots. All in all, there are plenty of dangers you'll need to figure out the best routes 
 around.
  The graphics are simplistic, though they are a step up from the ones in the original version of 
 the game. (For purists, you can turn off the new graphics and play these levels looking like the 
 original N.) 
  It will probably take a few levels for you to get used to the physics of the game. Navigating while 
 in midair may take a while to get used to, but once you have it down it becomes one of your greatest 
 skills. Luckily, the game ramps up the difficulty slowly, so you'll be ready for the challenges 
 when they arrive. In total, you'll find 250 episodes to wade through, and trust me, it will take 
 a while.
  If you do get around to beating all the levels, then you'll find the level editor to your liking. 
 You'll stay busy with N+ for a while. It may be difficult to recommend putting down the money for 
 this game when you can find a free version online that is mostly the same experience, but I do 
 believe you'll find the control pad and face buttons control much more easily than keyboard controls 
 do. If you're up for the challenge, go for it.

Review:  The internet these days contain so many games for people to play. My confession is that when i 
 am at school and most of the sites that hosted this game was blocked i had to find other sites 
 that weren't blocked to play it.
  But now that changed with this pure piece of gaming because this is a great port of the online 
 game. 
  The things i like about this are the addictive gameplay, well created levels and the character 
 is just a simply drawn sprite with no
  attitude at all. I would play this if i had a new psp and some money because this game cannot be 
 missed at all. The levels are relatively easy at the start but once you learn the controls the 
 game throws you harder levels so it can take a few quick reactions to help you clear the levels 
 after a small amount of deaths but that is just a part of the game because you need to learn how 
 to slove the levels instead of just running in and dying straight away you have to take your time 
 to clear them. Apart from that this is a great game and the price tag is good for the content that 
 is included and surprising how it all fits into the memory of the ds carts and the psp umd.

Review:  N+ is a low-budget production. It's like a NES-era game. It's only a very basic 2D platformer game 
 with very simple graphics and sound. Weird to see, it's rated highly among the game media. This 
 interests me to find out why they feel this game is so addicting and interesting. Unfortunately 
 it turned out to be a big let-down.
  
  ========================================
  Gameplay
  ========================================
  -- [Average] Basic escape 2D platformer 
 game: normal gameplay, nothing revolutionary
  This is a simple escape 2D platformer game. You goal is to go from start to end where the end is 
 a door. There are multiple obstacles which will prevent you from doing so, namely mines, rockets, 
 lasers etc. You are completely unarmed. No tool is available for you to attack the enemy. What 
 you can only do is to dodge and escape. This game is not for you if don't like such a passive play 
 style.
  
  That's it! It's all the game is about. Such kinds of games are plentiful. I played one game whose 
 goal is to climb to the top with obstacles and enemies in between. I have played this kind of games 
 a lot so I find N+ nothing special or particularly addicting. Yes simple gameplay can be fun and 
 a good time killer. But this alone doesn't warrant high ratings. If you like escape 2D platformer 
 so much, there are plenty on the Internet. Go and play like crazy. After all they are absolutely 
 FREE. ;-)
  
  
  ========================================
  Instructions
  ========================================
  -- [Bad] Instructions are scarce and horrible
  I'm 
 new to this game so I go straight to the tutorial first. But heck, the tutorial is awful. 
  
  When the tutorial starts, you are asked to press button "Y". Then it will play a demo. You 
 will see the character is running to collect a few gold coins, reaching the green crystal and finally 
 the door to exit. End of demo. Now it's your turn. What?! Hey you haven't told me a single thing 
 about the control (what each button means, or whether I need to use the stylus etc.) . The only 
 thing that I understand from the demo is it seems my goal is to reach the door to exit. 
  
  And what about the items on the map, like the gold coins and the crystal? What are their uses? 
 The tutorial is intended to guide me through all those stuff. How funny! The tutor simply plays 
 the game for me once and nothing more! No explanation! He thinks this is how I can learn everything 
 without a word of explanation! Granted it isn't a big issue since it isn't too hard to by trail 
 and errors. But this tutorial shows how much heart developers put on this game.
  
  The unlockable section is sort of confusion too. For the first time I managed to unlock some new 
 characters (actually new colors of the same character, argh!) . I wondered how I'm going to select 
 a new character. I went to the unlockable menu to see if it leaves any message about it. Not at 
 all! I tried to select the item "Purple Ninja" and press a button. No response! What's up? How 
 am I supposed to use the new character? Finally I found out the game expects me to select the new 
 character (or rather colour) in the option menu. This arrangement is a bit weird.
  
  I manage to unlock a few other bells and whistles too in the unlockable section but I don't know 
 where they have been added. It's confusing. If it cares to leave a message where the new contents 
 are added, it would be much better.
  
  
  ========================================
  Control and Mechanics
  ========================================
  -- [Below Average] Control 
 is okay but user-unfriendly in some areas. Some control mechanics are unclear to the player
  In-game control is generally ok and smooth. However nowhere does the game tell you what button 
 does what, so you can only try out to find the answer. That's user-*un*friendly! 
  
  Sometimes my character dies for no particular reasons. The place has no mines or other dangerous 
 things. What's wrong? Sometimes I climb up and explode (die) when I reach the top. Sometimes I 
 jump up and explode when I reach the bottom. This makes me mad when I first see it. I could only 
 guess my character will somehow die if it moves too fast. How weird! This kind of unintended "uncertainty" 
 really bugs me.
  
  Another problem bugging me is the careless assignment of functions of the "X" button. "X" button 
 is for self-destruction in the game. In other words, it's a quick way to restart at the same map. 
 However you will exit and go back to the main menu if you mistakenly press it twice. Then you lose 
 all unsaved data and have to play again. There should be a confirmation dialog before exit. They 
 shouldn't assign "X" button to return to the main menu.
  
  I'm stuck in some levels where it requires me to jump higher than the character can. There is no 
 wall around. It's not a problem of reflex and all that. I just don't fully grasp the mechanics 
 and the control. 
  
  That poor tutorial, as explained previously, is to blame. When I can't even get how this game works 
 (I can't figure out all those advanced control like ways to jump higher than normal) , how am I 
 going to enjoy this game?
  
  The level editor is clumsy and hard to use. I felt at sea when I first used it. There isn't much 
 text to help explaining the controls and the stuff. The Help button doesn't help much either. 
 
  
  The heavy stylus usage with little button usage makes creating a level a pain. Here's one example 
 to illustrate the problem. It takes plenty much time just to build some nice terrains. The whole 
 process is "Hold L -  Select Tilt A -  Release L -  Put it on the map. Hold L -  Select Tilt B 
 -  Release L -  Put it on the map..." There should be some buttons to do quick switch among different 
 tilts. Here's another example. To delete something, "Hold L -  Select "Delete" Marker -  Select 
 the item you want to delete". This kind of tedious process can be skipped with a delete button. 
 But it doesn't provide one at all. 
  
  See! How clumsy the control is.
  
  All the above, together with the lack of instructions, prove how sloppy the developers are. They 
 don't even bother explaining anything. You are on your own.
  
  
  ========================================
  Content
  ========================================
 
  -- [Fairly short] Only 50 episodes for games like this!
  It has 50 episodes (hidden/special episodes included) which are only okay for games like this. 
 I expect to see 100 episodes or so. Each episode lasts for about 5-45 minutes, depending on the 
 difficulty. If you get stuck on an episode, you may take much longer. Assuming you are capable 
 of finishing all episodes, you may finish it quickly in a few days only.
  
  There are 5 special episodes which can be unlocked by cheats only. I expect they will be unlocked 
 automatically after I complete all episodes. What's more, it's so hidden for you to miss them completely 
 (talking about bad interface/poor instructions again!) . The 5 special episodes are located at the 
 very top of the panel. Normally you should be able to push up when you are at the edge. However 
 you must first select Episode 0 before you can push up to see them.
  
  The richness of the content can be extended if the developers care to fix a few problems.
  1. 
 Gold Coin: Despite its name, gold coin is actually your life supplement. You start with 90 seconds 
 of lifetime left. One life supplement increases your lifetime by 2 seconds. However hardly you 
 will die because time is up. You can run all your way to exit without deliberately collecting gold.
 
  2. High Score: Getting high score is a balance of using less time and collecting more gold coins. 
 It requires skills and wisdom to get the highest score. If the developer cares to record high score 
 (and put more meat to it) , this game will be much more thrilling and long-lasting
  
  
  ====================
  Bonuses
  ====================
  The unlockables are mostly jokes, proofs 
 that developers don't bother creating better bonuses. They decide that they can simply take out 
 our rights to access some of the most basic stuff in the beginning and treat them as extra bonuses.
 
  
  There are a few types of unlockables, namely characters, level pack, music and animations. New 
 characters are merely the same stick thingy with 6 different colors only! How generous! I would 
 expect they should at least spend some efforts to create some really worthy unlockables, like redesigning 
 some new characters. A game called Taiko: Drum Master let you customize the color of face, body 
 and 4 limbs. Luckily it "unlocks" 63 colors at the start of the game. They are far too generous.
 
  
  I have unlocked some music and animations. But their presentation is so poor that I don't see what 
 and where has been added. Later on I realize, by reading information on the net, the animations 
 are the simple victory dance added upon each episode completion. The music additions (is it really 
 music?) are those played in the game.
  
  
  ========================================
  Graphics and design
  ========================================
  -- [Bad] Simple and casual design, 
 nothing flashy or impressive
  I believe the artwork of this game is intended to be simple and pure. The backgrounds, the items 
 and the characters are all very simple. We are back to the age of NES. Well simplicity isn't necessarily 
 always bad. A well-thought-out simplicity can be endearing and charming. Unfortunately this game 
 fails to do.
  
  The background of this game is just dull wallpaper.
  
  The terrains (walls) are patternless. They are just plain grey blocks.
  
  The character you 
 are controlling is just a black stick thingy. If you don't tell me I guess hardly anyone can tell 
 it's a ninja. It's just look like an ordinary man.
  
  The design of gold coin is weird. Instead of a collection to raise your score, it's actually a 
 booster to lengthen the time limit. Initially I thought the number on the bar was a score, and 
 gold coin is an item to raise the score. I was entirely misled. The presentation sucks.
  
  It appears the simplicity of graphics is to hide the incompetence or laziness of the developers, 
 rather than some fashion design. A ninja doesn't look like a ninja, nothing cute or endearing about 
 the stick thingy. The locked/secret characters only changes in color (lazy again?) . All these give 
 me nothing but impression that they want to rush a game to make quick cash.
  
  
  ========================================
  Sound
  ========================================
 
  -- [Abysmal] Non-lively and kind of repetitive
  Sound effect is simple but ok to me. 
  
  No music was played when I played the game for the first time. If my memory serves, it's because 
 the music is locked until you manage to unlock it after completing a few episodes. Well it's really 
 ridiculous if that is the case!
  
  I'm pretty much satisfied about any music putting into my ears. It's the first time I comment music 
 in a game as awful! The background music is so awful. Actually they are not real music. I would 
 call them "extended sound effect". It's way too short and repeats way too fast. It loops every 
 9 seconds or so! The rhythm is really bad: sometimes dull, sometimes annoying, sometimes even broken!! 
 It appears developers want to save money to hire some music composers.
  
  
  ========================================
  Replayability
  ========================================
 
  -- [Above average] This kind of games "built-in" replayability, so to speak
  Fortunately it's an escape platformer game. Although it doesn't have many episodes to play with, 
 you can always replay the same episode once in a while, without getting too bored. If you really 
 feel too bored, you can create your own (although it takes quite some patience to create a good 
 one due to the clumsiness of the level editor) .
  
  You can get custom maps created by others if you use WiFi. Users put much more thoughts than the 
 developers when designing maps (eg funny laughable maps, theme maps, really challenging maps and 
 so on) . This is a good plus!
  
  
  ========================================
  Bugs/Flaws
  ========================================
  - [Bad] Non-critical bugs/flaws here 
 and there
  The production of this game seems to be rushed and is incomplete, leaving bugs/flaws here and there. 
 Although no bugs/flaws are critical, some of them are unforgivable. I'll list a few so you can 
 witness the sloppiness of this game production:
  * Some game options don't save properly.
  * "Death" (fake) replay (You win the game. You replay it but you die this time. Why? I believe 
 this appears mostly in episodes with enemies like lasers/rockets which some randomness comes into 
 play. The replay doesn't save everything you do. The replay is not a real replay!!)
  * Ninja color doesn't change at the top screen. It's always black no matter what color you choose.
 
  * When you select single player, it will present you with a few more options. "New game" is placed 
 first, "Continue" next. If you start as a new game, it will erase all your previous data (including 
 the unlockables) . You may accidentally delete your data if you press "A" twice by mistake.
  * When you choose to save a level from WiFi, it automatically picks slot 1 and asks to confirm 
 overwrite. Again you may accidentally delete your data if you press quickly.
  
  That's about it. I'm not going to list more. The few bugs/flaws stated above should give you the 
 ideas how rushed and buggy this game is.
  
  
  ========================================
  Value
  ========================================
  -- [Bad] Not special or good enough to justify 
 the price
  You can't find a free game matching Castlevania or Final Fantasy series on the Internet, this kind 
 of game has very rich and deep gameplay. The production of this game is high. No hobbyist game 
 developer can manage to release one without charging you a penny.
  
  But you can find a free game matching N+ on the Internet. Really the gameplay of N+ is nothing 
 special. I highly doubt why the gaming media rate this game highly. Such kinds of games are plentiful 
 everywhere on the Internet. What's more they are FREE. I even find some games which have unique 
 and novel gameplay, with better characters, graphics and sounds. One example is Pillage the Village. 
 The character is so funny, so does the gameplay. It made me laugh a lot. It has a good tutorial. 
 The unlocked bonuses are interesting and great. More shocking is this game is absolutely FREE.
 
  
  
  ========================================
  Summary
  ========================================
  
  ====================
  Pros:
  ====================
 
  + Even though gameplay is nothing unique or special, it can still be fun and is good time killer
 
  + Multiplayer mode
  + Level editor allows you to create your own custom level
  + Good for hardcore N/N+ fans
  
  ====================
  Cons:
  ====================
  - 
 Gameplay is not particularly impressive or addicting
  - Game introduction sucks. A tutorial is not a tutorial. No explanation about the control
  - 
 The game never explains anything about the game mechanics. You are on your own. If you can't figure 
 out yourself (which isn't fun to do) , you will be unable to pass some levels
  - Unimpressive graphics and characters (eg one piece of dull wallpaper as the sole background for 
 all episodes)
  - Awful sound and music (eg music which is only 9 seconds long)
  - Lazy work of unlockables (eg a differently color ninja is regarded as a secret character)
  
 - Sloppy and poor presentation (eg some menus look like unresponsive) . 
  - Instructions or help is scarce
  - Careless design of in-game control (eg double "X" accidental 
 exit problem)
  - Clumsy control of level editor etc.
  - Bugs/flaws here and there (eg replay bugs)
  
  ====================
  Conclusion
  ====================
 
  If you have read through everything I write, you will see developers look really sloppy and lazy. 
 The game is not ready. They rush it anyway for the sake of quick cash. :- (
  
  When I see people still complain anything about the character design, graphics and sound of some 
 of the most serious games, it's interesting to see so much forgiving players are when it comes 
 to this game. I hear reviews like "Although graphics is so plain it serves the purpose well", "Music 
 is nothing noteworthy but playing without music is actually enjoyable." Ironically to say, this 
 implies you actually draw more complaints if you put more resources to better graphics/sound. ;-P
 
  
  N+ is only a simple escape platformer game with basic graphics and sound. Despite it's full of 
 non-critical bugs/flaws and is nothing revolutionary, it's rated so high. Why are they so forgiving? 
 I believe I figured it out eventually. 
  
  The game is originally called N and is created by Metanet as a free Flash game (website: http://www. thewayoftheninja. org/ 
 ) . This game is refined and ported to the console platforms as N+ after its success. The Nintendo 
 DS game is done by Silverbirch Studios, with Metanet as a "consultant". Silverbirch Studios has 
 never developed a handheld video game before, let alone a console one. So they lack the experience.
 
  
  I haven't played "N" before. To me N+ is way overrated on the media. It's a big let-down to me. 
 It can score 5/10 judging the gameplay alone. However, if we consider the "bads" about sloppy graphics/sound 
 and all sorts of bugs (which are actually worse than some free games produced by hobbyist game 
 developers) , it fails miserably in my eyes. Even though the game can be fun at times, I expect 
 a more serious game production when I'm paying a product. So I gave a low score.
  
  I know I'm very harsh when it comes to scoring. Definitely you are going to disagree with me. Well 
 I have list clearly why I come up with that and offer opposite opinions. Hopefully this review 
 is useful to potential buyers, especially those who doubt why such a simple game can score so highly.

Review:  Hey There:
  Let me come to my first Review on Gamespot.
  
 N + "
  
  Ok, what have we got here you ask? Let me try to answer your Question as accurate as possible.
 
  
  N+ is a Platformer for Nintendos DS, Sonys PSP and Microsofts XBOX 360.
  
  In this Game, you are controlling a jumping, sliding Ninja Stickmen through a Bunch of Rooms. 
 
  
  Sounds boring huh? NO, it doesn't!
  
  Those Rooms are filled with various Traps like Mines, Snipers, Rockets and so on.
  
  The Goal 
 is, to collect Gold, Hitting a Switch (to open the Door to the next Level) and move through.
  
  The Gold is needed, to get more Time out of it.
  
  The first Levels are easy to go, but 
 it gets harder but very addicting later on, because you try, to unlock as much Content as it has.
 
  
  There isnt much left to explain.
  
  Graphics: 5.0 (Retrolook isnt for Everyone)
  Sound: 5.0 (Electrosounds on Repeat, kinda sad)
  Gameplay: 8.0 (challenging and addicting)
 
  Controls: 7.0 (Great Controls, sometimes frustrating)
  Content: 7.5 (very much to unlock)
  
  
  Overall: 7.5
  
  Thats it. A solid, addicting Game that has much to Offer.
  
  If 
 you like Platform Games and have a cool human being, get this Game.
  
  Others might rent it first.

Review:  I was initially introduced to n+ while playing on my friends Xbox 360, the game was originally 
 available as download from the Xbox Live Marketplace, several hours later and we were still hooked 
 on what on paper seems like a simplistic game, but in reality is a highly thought out, highly addictive, 
 and extremely challenging game.
  
  You can imagine then my delight when I looked online and discovered that there was a version for 
 the DS. While the DS version lacks the soundtrack of the 360 version replaced by a more (in my 
 opinion) irritating soundtrack, it comes with improved graphics (though not really noticeable) 
 and a sharper, more colourful look (players however do have the option to switch between the new 
 and old graphics) . However the core gameplay has not been toned down in any way, nothing removed 
 and nothing changed, just pure 100% fun. 
  
  You control a small ninja in a game in which you must traverse various maps, jumping, running, 
 wall jumping, wall sliding and carefully navigating your way to the finish while dodging the various 
 hazards, from mines and floating electrical orbs to missiles and other homing projectiles - all 
 of which will kill you with one shot. If this wasn't enough, you are also against a timer that 
 continually counts down to your inevitable doom - you must collect gold pieces in order to boost 
 the time, however these are nearly always located in areas littered with hazards. As you complete 
 episodes (each episode is made up of roughly 4-5 maps and there are are 100+ maps in the standard 
 game) , you will unlock various bonuses such as different colour ninjas, new bonus episodes, different 
 victory animations etc.
  
  Once you have completed the 100 or so maps, there is the option to go online, you can create your 
 own maps (complete with hazards) and upload these or try out and download player created maps online 
 via Nintendo Wi-Fi - this essentially makes the game only limited only by your own imagination. 
 The creation tools are really easy to use, with even novices being able to create a deceptively 
 challenging map in only a short space of time.
  
  There is also local multiplayer where players (each with their own game card) can either join up 
 in coop to complete the various levels, or play two other game modes (domination and tag) . This 
 again adds to the re-playability factor of the game. 
  
  It is worth noting that the DS version is by far the easiest out of the two portable versions (the 
 other being the PSP version) , but is also the cleaner looking and the DS is by far the best suited 
 for the game with it's dual screens. Some might consider the 18 price tag to be a bit much, but 
 with the ever growing online community, the ever expanding commitment and constantly increasing 
 content available, the price is well worth the investment in the long run. Highly recommended for 
 veterans and newcomers alike.

Review:  Many people look back fondly on the days of the NES and the like because despite bad graphics and 
 some truly revolting gameplay premises, things were original back then. Not like now, when you 
 can't walk into your local Best Buy without drowning in deep piles of hop-on me-too games. So it 
 can be pretty refreshing to come across a game like N+, an old-school platformer in every sense 
 of the word which, despite the fact that it can be played for free online, is certainly worth a 
 look from DS-owners that happen to be over the age of eight. 
  
  What's interesting about N+ is the distinction that the game draws between games that are dumbed-down 
 and games that are stripped. Neither terms hold particularly positive connotations and tend to 
 bring to mind images of shovelware targeted heavily at stupid parents of four-year-old children, 
 or pornography (at least with regards to the second distinction) . Dumbed-down games suck; I won't 
 argue with that. But N+ shows that if you've got a good basic formula under all the bells and whistles, 
 your game will be just fine without all the nifty little accoutrements. 
  
  N+ is almost insultingly simple and in a time where we appreciate beautiful, detailed visuals N+ 
 stands out starkly. There's next-to-no color in the entire game and your basic actions are running 
 and jumping. That's it. You can't defeat foes, and the trappings of modern-day platformers are 
 nowhere to be found. It's a simple, stripped, pure title and offers a sense of fun that will remind 
 you why you first loved gaming. 
  
  That said, there are some significant issues with this title's design. If you've played the flash 
 version of N+, you'll likely acknowledge that what's fun about it is the trial and error approach 
 to platforming. You always know what to do: hit the switch and get to the door before time runs 
 out. It's simple. But the levels were so well-designed that each episode was brilliant and fresh. 
 And once you threw in the threat of enemies and environmental obstacles, you had a really tricky, 
 mind-bending but intuitive platformer. 
  
  Well, the DS version of N+ throws that out the window and takes an entirely different approach 
 to platforming. It may seem a bit subtle, but if you've played the flash version it will become 
 apparent. Rather than have an approach on adrenaline-rushing platforming and foe-evasion, the handheld 
 version of this game feels more like a puzzle title than a platformer. The focus here is less on 
 actual completion of each level and more on how exactly you'd go about that completion. 
  
  So I'm left wondering: did the developers even really know what made their game fun to begin with? 
 The flash version was awesome, but then the dev team decides it would be a good idea to disregard 
 all the great things the free version did and create a different game with the same name and sell 
 it for twenty bucks. It's almost like they were looking for something to distinguish their game 
 from the flash version, and as a result fundamentally changed how N+ plays. 
  
  That said, there's still a lot to love about N+ especially for anybody who grew up with older systems 
 and simpler games. It can be mind-bendingly difficult, but it's not a difficulty that I particularly 
 prefer. You're left trying to use the game's sometimes-nonsensical physics engine to get your ninja 
 across seemingly-impassable obstacles. But even with problems like this, there are occasions where 
 you'll experience that same, unadulterated fun that the flash version offered. The combination 
 of careful planning and spontaneous, split-second decision making that characterizes N+ makes it 
 a lot to fun and flaws are easier to overlook because of it. 
  
  On a roll with taking good stuff and making it suck, the development team behind the DS version 
 of N+ also botched the level editor. This was a pretty significant aspect of the free version and 
 building your own levels really represented what this game was all about: variety. There were so 
 many different freaking ideas that you could literally play this game forever and never get bored 
 (frustrated, yes. But never bored) . Well, the interface downright sucks for this level editor and 
 while it's great to be able to share levels online and create your own arenas for ninja-destruction, 
 it's hard to get it to work right. The editor is unintuitive and hard to use. 
  
  And seeing how the game only has forty episodes, each with five different levels, it would certainly 
 work in the game's favor to make it easier to create and share user-created content. It's a pretty 
 short game and despite the emphasis on playing through puzzle-like levels, it's not difficult to 
 the caliber that you might expect. I really wish that the dev team had just made an N+ that was 
 the N+ I knew and loved. But when you tinker with a perfectly functional machine you're liable 
 to screw it up, and sadly I get the sense that's what happened here. N+ is still a solid platformer, 
 but it could have been a hell of a lot better.

Review:  This DS game is actually a ver highly addictive game and as some people said it may frustrating 
 too.
  Me in person actually was frustrated in a few episodes but i got over it in a few tries.
  This 
 game actually could help the mind because you need fast response and even alot of concentarting 
 and thinking to see how the balls move and in which direction.
  I actually like this game because its about right in difficulty and there are alot of episodes (45) 
 which are 5 levels each wich equals too 225 levels in total.
  I loved the ninjas colours alot they really shine in the game. the best colour is the red then black.
 
  what i hated in this game is the graphics but it was ok for me because it was a few megabytes.
 
  I know that this game is on the xbox360 (which i dont have) and the psp (which i have) .
  I have played psp versioni know it is very hard even harder than the DS because of its episodes.
 
  But as i know the psp episodes gets even harer every time but the DS episodes dont get that hard 
 everytime i finish the episodes.
  the hardest episode i played on the DS is episode 29 the first level and the easiest which i think 
 everybody knows and it is level0.

Review:  N+, what can I say? It's fun, addictive, graphically simple yet strangely effective. Theres not 
 much to say thats bad about this game unless you have anger problems. I mean that in the nicest 
 way possible but if you do and play some of the harder levels, the game will have you buying a 
 new ds within a day of playing it. that said the difficulty is suprisingly the thing that makes 
 you keep playing!?
  
  The gameplay isn't exactly fresh as its basically a remake of the 'free' downloadable game called 
 N (where it all started) . But even so, the game is so addictive that you'll be constantly going 
 through levels to master the controls and from that you'll have the need to challenge yourself 
 even more. 
  That brings me on to the greatest thing you can have for a game like this, and that is; level sharing. 
 Through Nintendo's Wifi Connection you can download user created levels and test your might against 
 the hardest yet creative levels known to man.
  
  Although this game is essentially a Flash game put onto a NDS cart, the graphics have been given 
 an update and there's added music to go along with the frustrating and fun levels. That said, the 
 music isn't that great and sounds crappy at best, but the new graphics are welcome although fans 
 of the PC game will prefer to see the classic greyscale colouring scheme of simple 2D shapes. thankfully 
 the game has an option to change to the original Graphics which is welcomed with open arms.
  
  There are a lot of options to choose from in the game such as; the colour of your ninja, a 
 level editor (which rawks!) , music (on/off) , different graphic schemes, BLOOD! (on/off) , which screen 
 you want your map to be etc.
  One thing mentioned is the level editor. It's incredibly deep for such a simple game. you can create 
 almost anything you want, and the fact you can use the touch screen is great. although I've had 
 some problems such as items not going exactly where I want, but it just takes a little getting 
 use to.
  
  In conclusion N+ is a superb game, its highly addictive, fun to play, its got a great level editor, 
 and online level sharing makes it even more worth while, not only that; all the options you have, 
 the mass of levels you've got through the 'story' mode and more will keep you playing this game 
 for well over the 5 minutes you said to yourself when you turned your DS on. Although saying that, 
 you've basically got the same stuff in a free downloadable version on the web today, so the question 
 still stands, is it worth buying it if you can download it for free. Simple answer is yes, but 
 it's upto you if you want to buy it and play it anywhere or download it and have that restriction 
 on portability... Unless you have a laptop.

Review:  N+ is a very addictive yet frustratingly complex game that you will love to hate. With a very simplistic 
 control scheme, you don't have to worry about any messing around, very music in the same style 
 as old school platformers and arcade games. With over 50 levels and loads of unlockables, you must 
 guide your ninja through the various death traps that the developers have placed for you. Traps 
 include mines, rockets, two kinds of laser beams and floating electrical orbs. There is even a 
 level editor where you can design your own tricks and traps and put them on WiFi for others to 
 play, and you can play theirs as well. If you want a fun arcade type game that is loads of fun 
 with a good amount of content at a cheap price and will keep you trying to complete it without 
 throwing your DS at the wall, pick up N+.

Review:  N+ began as a simple flash game called N. After becoming immensely popular, N was expanded upon 
 for the XBLA game appropriately titled N+. A few months later, and the DS and PSP iterations have 
 released. However, despite all three games sharing the same name, none of them are the same game. 
 Each one has exclusive levels and features.
  The gameplay of N+ is deceptively simple: you guide an acrobatic ninja through obstacle courses, 
 trying to find the key to the door, and then reaching said door. However, every level has a 90-second 
 timer, and collecting gold pieces will add time to your counter. The timer is very rarely an issue.
 
  The real danger lies in the various tricks and traps set up all across the field. Among these 
 are mines, tracking missiles, patrolling drones, and laser beams, just to name a few. On their 
 own, these obstacles are not nearly dangerous as they are when coupled with the fiendish level 
 design. 
  The N series has always had excellent level design, and the DS iteration is no exception; these 
 levels will kick your butt. Thankfully, the difficulty progresses fairly uniformly. Every episode 
 will have at least one level that you have to retry over and over again, but it rarely discourages 
 you from playing. Every time you mess up, you can see exactly what went wrong, and how you can 
 fix it.
  N+ also features a level editor and a few multiplayer modes. The level editor has a lot of options, 
 but can be annoying to use. It would have worked a lot better as a grid-based function rather than 
 free-form. The touch screen controls here are unresponsive and a little clunky. However, people 
 who get used to the editor will be able to make some very impressive stages, and you can share/download 
 stages through Nintendo WFC. The multiplayer offers a variety of modes in both co-op and competitive 
 styIes.
  
  Closing words: If you can get around the high difficulty and empty presentation, N+ is an excellent 
 game that can be enjoyed by all hardcore gamers.
  
  Presentation: 6/10- Very basic, but that's what N is all about. Having to change your settings 
 every time you start up is not a nice thing. Level editor is clunky, but has potential.
  
  Graphics: 7/10- Again, very basic. You've got two options: Pure and Plus. Plus is the default, 
 but is considerably uglier than Pure. Pure makes the game look identical to it's origin as a flash 
 game, which is awesome.
  
  Sound: 4/10- Mostly obnoxious, "punk" techno. There are a handful of fitting songs, but they're 
 all just 5-second loops. The styIe is annoying, and it could have been better with a spy-theme 
 or something. Sound effects are bland.
  
  Gameplay: 9/10- Perfectly preserved N. N+ has a retro feel to it, and has some of the best level 
 design in gaming. Be cautious of the ridiculously high difficulty.
  
  Value: 7/10- There are over 40 episodes, with 5 levels each. Levels are short, but you'll be retrying 
 many of them over and over again. The multiplayer and level editor could keep you busy for a long 
 time.
  
  Recommendation: Consider buying it if you're a hardcore gamer who loves platformers.

Review:  A great game very suited to the DS. Gameplay is very fun. It is repetitive at times because some 
 levels are very hard and must be played over and over to beat them, but this is what the N franchise 
 is about. However, most of the time it will only take a few tries to beat a level. If you've never 
 played N before, this is a great place to get started as the gameplay and level design is a tad 
 nicer than other versions. If you're a vet, you can still find some challenge in the latter half 
 of the levels. The physics are slightly different but still fun. The level editor has a ton of 
 new options, such as color changers and lots of new and useful tiles. However, I personally find 
 it too hard to use as there are no gridlines and I have unsteady hands. I often find myself placing 
 a tile in the wrong spot with the stylus, and having to press multiple buttons just to undo it. 
 And even then, sometimes deleting more than I wanted to. Still, you probably won't have these problems. 
 I wish the D-pad was used for the level editor, but other than that, I have few complaints. If 
 you are a fan of N, I would say you should buy it.

Review:  For the first few levels you'd get excited to play this game but after a while you'll notice the 
 clichs. Mines are everywhere, how they are placed are practically the same in every level. All 
 the levels are just the same but longer. Sometimes I find myself running into death right at the 
 start of the level continuously, realizing why I'm playing this. The map editor has a variety of 
 blocks to choose from water, curves, points etc. It was more fun to create a picture out of blocks 
 than make a playable level. The game was wayyyyy overhyped. It does not introduce anything new 
 to the game other than the online map upload and rating. The price however, at $20 covers for lack 
 of a great game. Many will probably object to this review but I am sure all of them have a feeling 
 that this game is all not that great.

Review:  The Good:
  
  Classical platformer that brings back nostalgia | Addicting gameplay | Ability to create your own 
 levels | Awesome replay value 
  
  --------------------------------------------------
  
  The Bad:
  
  No Co-Op WiFi | Terrible and repetitive sound | Plain presentation | Repetitive 
 after a while | Blood option doesn't work
  
  --------------------------------------------------
  
  Before the release of N+, people were 
 already creating some major hype about this game. Sure, it's a classic platformer that most of 
 us played on the PC and home consoles, but comparing it to the hype of the releases of FFIV and 
 Zelda is a bit too much, don't you think?
  
  Graphics: This is 2D, plain and simple. Still, it's ideal for this game, since 3D would probably 
 even make it worse. 
  
  The main screen isn't linear at all in chapter numbers, since it goes 0,1,2,3,9, etc... making it 
 quite confusing. I also found the game's presentation to be a bit plain and unappealing. 
  
  Graphics Score: 6/10
  
  
  Sound: Very disappointing. I was expecting something a little 
 more exciting, but instead we get a very repetitive music that you hear from start to finish. No 
 alternative, just the one track. Fortunately, there's an option to turn it off, since this is really 
 annoying. 
  
  Sound Score: 1/10
  
  Gameplay: As opposed to sound, this is actually pretty enjoyable. It's a step down from the Xbox 
 version, but nonetheless a good one. 
  
  Basically, it's down to this: You jump around and collect gold coins while avoiding traps and etc, 
 hit a green gem to open a door, and make your way to it. Nothing special, although I admit it is 
 addicting the first few levels. After that, it gets progressively harder and challenging, but always 
 with the same objective, which can turn some people off.
  
  Oh, and the blood option doesn't work, so that's a major letdown for people who wanted to see some 
 gore. 
  
  Gameplay Score: 7/10
  
  
  Replay Value: With WiFi, this game already promises to have good replay value. Despite this statement, 
 it's not always the case. N+ does indeed offer WiFi features, but contrary to what many people 
 expected, it's not Co-Op play. 
  
  Instead, you get to play levels that people created, and you can also upload your own for others 
 to enjoy. A nice idea, although not as exciting as Co-Op would be. 
  
  The level editor is a good addition, although a little awkward to work with.
  
  Still, you'll 
 have hours of fun completing all challenges in single mode, but take it at a time, since this game 
 can become very boring after a while.
  
  Replay Value: 7/10
  
  
  Overall, N+ is a good classic 2D platformer that is initially quite fun and exciting, but then 
 it gets a little boring. You'll be disappointed by the lack of blood (and although the game DOES 
 have an option to turn it on, it DOES NOT work) and Co-Op modes. 
  
  It's a good game for people who want to revive some nostalgia or simply kill some time, but it 
 doesn't deserve the hype it has gotten at all. I say only get this game if you want a portable 
 version of the 360 version. If not, go for the latter, since it's much better.

Review:  I got this game today, and its amazing! It fits perfectly for the DS, and other handhelds, and 
 it's similar to the PC and Xbox version, just in a smaller version. You will keep coming back to 
 play this game, and it's just downright fun to complete the levels. And it's got great replay value! 
 You can make levels and share them online with others, and also play other people's levels they 
 create! I give this 9.5 for these reasons:
  
  Good: Just like the PC version with more levels! More types of enemies! Great Replay Value!
  
 Bad: Sounds suck! When you die, it's not satisfying! Wi-fi doesn't support multiplayer, only DS 
 download play!
  
  This game will keep you turning on your DS, coming for more... and once you complete all levels, 
 which will take you hours... you can play more on wi-fi, play co-op levels with your friends, and 
 download new levels everyday! The fun will never end, so get this game! =P
