:::Review:::
Dino Master is an underdeveloped and almost unplayable puzzle game that tries unsuccessfully to 
 mimic Pokmon's gotta-catch-'em-all attitude. 

  Reading the text on the back of the game's box, you'd think Dino Master was poised to become the 
 next Pokmon or Yu-Gi-Oh! You play through puzzle-based levels to collect fossils, which can later 
 be put together to bring dinosaurs back to life. Those dinosaurs, then, can be pitted against other 
 dinosaurs in the game's battle mode. It sure sounds like an awesome concept. Unfortunately, you 
 only have to play the game for a few minutes to realize that it is totally the opposite of awesome. 
 The controls are sluggish and unreliable, the battle mode is nothing more than a glorified rock-paper-scissors, 
 and the graphical quality throughout ranges from outdated to downright ugly.  

          You draw boxes around fossils to lay claim to them.     

  Dino Master consists of three 
 interwoven play modes, called fossil hunt, laboratory, and battle. Of the three modes, fossil hunt 
 is the most involved. Each of the more than 30 dig sites is a play area roughly two screens tall 
 and two screens wide. To dig up the fossils and items that are shown, you use the stylus to drag 
 an paleontologist around the play area. The paleontologist leaves behind colored lines as he moves. 
 When you create a square or a rectangle, the area inside the shape is claimed and the items inside 
 are automatically dug up. It works very much like the classic puzzle game, Qix, right down to the 
 fluttering enemies that are constantly chasing the sprite, or, in this game's case, the goofy male 
 paleontologist.  

  Once you try to steer the paleontologist out of the way of the first enemy you see, you'll notice 
 right off that there's a problem with the controls. It's bad enough that he moves at a snail's 
 pace and that you have to constantly drag the stylus to keep him moving. What's worse, though, 
 is that the game will often point him in the direction opposite to where you've tapped, or just 
 outright ignore your tapping. The fossil hunt mode is tough enough to play early on when there 
 are only one or two enemies visible. On later levels, it's downright unplayable, thanks to the 
 broken controls.  

  The other two play modes don't suffer from any control-related issues, but that's mainly because 
 they're so limited that the controls don't really come into play. When you put together dinosaurs 
 in the laboratory mode, all you can do is look at a two-dimensional drawing of the creature, check 
 out some basic battle stats, and upgrade the dino's special techniques using the items you've already 
 collected. As for the battle mode, it's a joke. Much like in a Pokmon battle, the enemy dino is 
 shown on the upper screen and your dino is shown on the lower screen. Each dinosaur has multiple 
 weak points. Using the stylus, you select the weak point on the other dinosaur that you will attack, 
 and select the weak point on your own dinosaur that your will defend. Then, the pictures of the 
 two dinosaurs shake a bit and damage is deducted. If you correctly guessed which spot to protect, 
 you won't take any damage that turn. It's all based on luck. You can't even choose to make different 
 attacks. Any special skills that you bought from the laboratory will happen automatically, and 
 they usually won't have a significant influence on the outcome.  

  An equally minimal amount of effort was put into the game's overall presentation. On the whole, 
 Dino Master looks and sounds like an early generation Game Boy Advance game. There are times, even, 
 where the graphics and audio dip into 8-bit Game Boy Color territory. That's pretty shameful, considering 
 that this is a Nintendo DS game released in the year 2006. Audio consists of some weakly synthesized 
 music, a collection of thudding sound effects, and a couple of low-volume dinosaur roars. Graphical 
 quality varies depending on the mode you play.  

          After bringing your dinosaur to life, you can battle other dinosaurs.     

  In the 
 fossil hunt mode, most of the upper screen's real estate is taken up by a simple green and blue 
 grid representing a status display of sorts. The lower screen shows a top-down view of the dig 
 area. Backgrounds are colored in washed-out shades of green, blue, and brown, eerily reminiscent 
 of the color schemes used by role-playing games on the old Game Boy Color. Richer colors are used 
 to fill in the various fossils and enemies, although they're generally tiny and don't exhibit more 
 than two frames of animation, when they animate at all. In the laboratory and battle modes, the 
 screens are filled by large images of dinosaurs, which would be fine, if only the images weren't 
 all cute drawings painted with a limited color palette. To make matters more unfortunate, dinos 
 in the battle mode don't actually move or attack. Instead, their images just slide across the screen 
 and shake in response to the commands you make.  

  They had a good idea with Dino Master. Unfortunately, the development team didn't manage to bring 
 that idea to life in a fun manner, or even a playable one. There are plenty of puzzles to complete 
 and roughly 100 dinosaurs to collect, and the battle mode even supports the requisite two-player 
 linkup. None of those things matters, though, because the game as a whole is underdeveloped, broken, 
 and ugly.

Review:  I imported this game a while back. I got it for 8 dollars in total. I think it's pretty fun when 
 I want to fill some time, and I have nothing better to do. The game is just a puzzle game. There 
 isn't a lot more to it, but the makers tried to add the fight-your-dino element to the game. I 
 could like the battling, but it's not very balanced or enjoyable. The actual puzzle game is the 
 fun part. I like trying to come up with ideas to get the most % possible, so it's not a mindless 
 puzzle game. I think its a game you should try for free, or get really cheap. It's something you 
 might like to pick up like you would if you wanted to play solitaire on the computer. I mean come, 
 is that game really THAT fun to anyone? -Just like Dino Master.

Review:  this is one of the worst games ever. forever. and always will be.
  the pad doesnt even work properly and sometimes when you touch the screen it does nothing. mine 
 crashed at least 10 times in 2 hours took it back almost immediatly for full refund. i would have 
 almost given it away for free. there is nothing else to say apart from that this game is extremely 
 rubbish and worse than anhything imagines a baby could do better than this very very very VERY 
 bad game,. i cannot think what else to say this should get a 0 . 0 0 0 0 1

Review:  The most horrid piece of crap ever made. I am actully dumber for playing it. If you ever have the 
 chance to play it dont. The box art makes this game look almost badass, you can dig, discover, 
 and you get to duel; now that sounds amazing. Thats what you'd think till you actully play this 
 game. What you do is drag the stylus in a box shape and everything in that field is digged up, 
 but if the enemy touches the box the player gets a shock and isnt able to fnish the box and if 
 you "box" up enough of the playing field you can move to the next area. While "digging" you find 
 fossils all over the playing field and if you box them completely you "catch" them, it kinda feels 
 like a retarded pokemon game. After catching them you take them to the dino rebuild area and the 
 professor will take the fossil and turn it into a dino of course some are harder to find than others, 
 after you catch one it goes into your collection. What more could you ask for in this game, humm, 
 how about the abiltiy to batle with yur dinos, sounds good to me, heres how that goes down. It 
 starts with two pictures of dinosaurs and you touch where you want to attack and where you want 
 to deffend the whole thing is based on luck. If this game sounds interesting to you, then you just 
 might be the next dino master.
