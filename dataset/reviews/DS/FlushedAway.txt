:::Review:::
Flushed Away for the Nintendo DS is a decent 3D side-scroller, but there isn't much more than a 
 couple of hours of play built into it. 

  Flushed Away for the Nintendo DS is a side-scrolling adventure game based on the animated movie 
 of the same name. In it, players juggle control between two streetwise rats, Roddy and Rita, and 
 explore roughly a dozen levels in search of the items necessary to repair Rita's boat and deliver 
 Roddy back to his cushy life outside the sewers. The game doesn't do much to break out of the standard 
 run-and-jump mold, but the 3D graphics and explorative level layouts should keep the movie's fans 
 interested long enough to see the game through to its speedy conclusion.  

          Although the game is a side scroller, the 3D graphics make it possible for the camera and 
 environment to follow the characters from various angles.     

  In terms of atmosphere, the game does a decent job of emulating the tone and style of the movie. 
 Each level has its own toe-tapping music, and the characters emit a variety of zany sound effects 
 when they move or take damage. There isn't a whole lot of recorded speech, but the yelps and one-liners 
 that are in there are amusing and appropriate. Visually, the levels scroll from left to right like 
 the levels in most 2D platformers do, but the characters and environments are rendered with 3D 
 polygons and textures. Because of that, the sewers and buildings in the game look similar to the 
 sewers and buildings from the movie, and the characters all have the same clay-sculpted appearance. 
 Character animation is smooth, and their movements are generally fun to watch. Another especially 
 nice touch is the way the camera and environment sometimes turn to follow the character, instead 
 of always just displaying the same old left-to-right movement. Games like Klonoa and Tomba on the 
 PlayStation employed a similar effect to make their 2D gameplay feel three-dimensional, and Flushed 
 Away succeeds here. Of course, everything looks 10 times smaller and rougher on the Nintendo DS, 
 thanks to its tinier screen and limited 3D capabilities, but that's to be expected.  

  As far as actually playing the game goes, a good way to describe it would be to say that it's Mario 
 with a dash of Castlevania thrown in. The levels are the typical side-scrolling sort, with paths 
 to run across, platforms to jump between, and deadly pits to fall into should you fail to land 
 on something solid. There are also enemies to deal with, in the form of the many rats, frogs, and 
 slugs that, for various reasons, don't like Rita and Roddy very much. They're not a huge nuisance, 
 however, since the characters can absorb five hits before losing a life and the game lets you continue 
 as often as you want. Roddy and Rita can both run, jump, and double-jump, as well as stun enemies 
 for a short time by giving them a good, hard smack. The two characters are mostly identical, although 
 they each have a unique special ability. Roddy can use his head to smash through certain obstacles, 
 whereas Rita can grab onto and swing across suspended hooks using her bungee rope. The levels are 
 designed so that either character can get through them, but there are spots in some levels that 
 can only be accessed using a certain character's special ability. You can swap between the two 
 characters at any time just by going back to Rita's boat.  

  What's interesting about the game is that the levels aren't strung together in linear fashion. 
 You don't go from one to the next, like you would in most platformers. Instead, the levels are 
 interconnected in such a way that each level opens into two or three others. Because of this, players 
 are frequently backtracking through previous levels and hunting down entrances to spots that haven't 
 yet been explored.  

          The interconnected level layouts are interesting, but not so interesting that you will 
 want to finish the game a second time.     

  The game also occasionally diverges from the side-scroller formula by mixing players up in a minigame, 
 boat chase, or boss battle. There are three different minigames, which, unlike the main game, actually 
 make use of the system's built-in touch screen and microphone. In the soccer match minigame, for 
 example, you have to blow into the microphone to kick the ball past the goalkeepers. Boat chases 
 are only slightly more complicated. Whenever you find a new map hidden in a level, you'll unlock 
 a boat-chase mission. In these missions, you have limited control over Rita's boat, the Jammy Dodger, 
 as it steams its way through the sewer. Your job is to keep the boat in one piece by hopping over 
 the trash and shooting at the enemies that appear. Boss battles, meanwhile, are the usual encounters 
 against supercharged enemies that you've come to expect from these sorts of games.  

  If there's any major problem with the game, it's that it is over too soon. You'll spend a good 
 hour or so figuring out how the levels are connected and where certain warps are, but once you 
 have the layout down it probably won't take you more than an hour on top of that to collect all 
 of the boat upgrades and map disks you need. And, after you beat the game, there's really no compelling 
 reason to play it again. The swanky 3D graphics and explorative layouts are good the first time 
 through, but their allure isn't strong enough to bolster the simplistic run-and-jump design a second 
 time. In that respect, Flushed Away for the Nintendo DS is a decent movie-based game that, for 
 better or worse, seems to have been developed for players who don't want or need to devote a ton 
 of time to playing video games.

Review:  Flushed away caught my attention with it's colourful graphics and most of all the description of 
 its gameplay. A 3D platformer which boosts quite good graphics yet the gameplay can be sort of 
 irritating and furstrating after awhile.
  
  Rita and Roddy both have different abilities and Rita's whip sometimes or most of the time doesn't 
 catch on to the hook, depending on your luck. Levels are inter connected and irritating because 
 you'll be confused and need to go pass the levels and beat all the same monsters again. And the 
 worst part is that monsters do not die, instead only get stunned for awhile, leaving u accidently 
 touching them again at times.
  
  Since it follows the animation cartoon for kids, I'm sure many children will be playing it, But 
 the levels are pretty hard for kids and can't be solved at all. (I'm still missing some map disks.) 
 Help is not readily available too.
  
  Rent it first and play for awhile, and finish the game, (If you haven't died from frustration) .
