:::Review:::
It doesn't bear much resemblance to the movie, and it's short. Nevertheless, the DS rendition of 
 Meet the Robinsons is a fun run-and-gun-style shooter. 

  Even though it's supposedly based on the movie of the same name, the Nintendo DS version of Disney's 
 Meet the Robinsons hardly references the movie. The narrative is loosely driven by the alternate 
 renditions of 2037 that were depicted in the movie, and the main character under your control is 
 Wilbur Robinson, one of the movie's main characters. However, the game doesn't emulate the movie's 
 artistic style, and key events from the movie are portrayed only in brief still-frame images. Furthermore, 
 the action doesn't involve interacting with the movie's characters or exploring the various realities 
 in the adventurous manner that Lewis and Wilbur did in the movie. Instead, Disney's Meet the Robinsons 
 on the DS is a run-and-gun-style shooter that looks and feels similar to Metroid Prime Hunters 
 in that you primarily roam expansive environments while blasting away at the robotic enemies that 
 constantly appear. What's remarkable is that if you let yourself ignore the fact that the game 
 provides almost no connection to the movie, you'll discover that it's actually a varied shooter 
 that makes good use of the system's graphical horsepower and touch-screen features.  

          Instead of the slapstick adventuring that happened in the movie, the game primarily involves 
 blasting away at armed robots.     

  Each of the game's five worlds consists of multiple interconnected areas and passageways. Your 
 job in each world is to run around within those areas and blast apart enemies until you've accomplished 
 all of the tasks necessary to unlock the master's lair. Once you defeat the master in one world, 
 the game whisks you off to the next. Your status is always shown on the upper screen, while the 
 action is displayed on the touch screen. The controls are simple and friendly. You use the directional 
 pad to move, the shoulder buttons to orient the view, and the main buttons to fire a volley with 
 the associated weapon. You can shoot while you're running, but the best way to handle enemies is 
 to first tap them on the touch screen, which locks your aim and lets you circle-strafe without 
 pointing your gun away from the target. Despite the third-person viewpoint and the heavy use of 
 lock-on targeting, the game feels like a first-person shooter. Each encounter with an enemy robot 
 lasts a few seconds; you simply strafe and shoot while the enemy does likewise. The lock-on cursor 
 generally ensures that your shots will hit the target, which takes some challenge out of the equation, 
 but enemies keep battles lively by occasionally jumping out of the way or attempting to pounce 
 on you. Boss battles serve up villains that alternate between multiple forms and serve up meatier 
 energy blasts than standard foes.  

  There are roughly two dozen different gadgets and items that you can use. As you go through the 
 game, the weapons you'll rely on the most are the charge glove and the disassembler ray. They're 
 the two weapons you start out with, along with a scanner that lets you scan objects to discover 
 their weaknesses and what goodies they're hiding. The charge glove's energy shots are effective 
 against the majority of enemies, and its rate of fire makes it the best overall weapon. The disassembler 
 ray is a finisher weapon of sorts in that it shatters weakened enemies into spare parts that you 
 can collect. You can then cash in the parts at the transmogrifier located near the entrance of 
 each world in order to buy items, build new gadgets, and upgrade existing gadgets. Additional weapons 
 include a lightning gun, a meatball launcher, and gloves that fire sonic waves. Some of the niftier 
 gadgets you can build let you jump higher, stop time, hide underground, and levitate enemies.  
 

  The game's worst flaw is that it's short. Most people won't need more than five hours to finish 
 it. Surprisingly, apart from a charge ball minigame that requires both players to have their own 
 cartridge, there's no multiplayer to speak of. Charge ball is an interesting meshing of air hockey 
 and brick busting games (like Breakout or Arkanoid) , but it's not compelling enough to make you 
 want to play it for more than a few minutes.  

          The gunplay, graphics, and audio are decent. Too bad the whole game is over in about five 
 hours.     

  While the development team skimped on content, it did at least take the time to make the game look 
 and sound decent. The quality of the 3D environments, polygonal characters, and textures is on 
 par with many PlayStation and Nintendo 64 games and at times rivals Nintendo's Metroid Prime Hunters. 
 Wilbur moves fluidly, enemies have a good variety of attacks, the frame rate is smooth, and objects 
 never just pop into view despite the ample draw distance. On the whole, the environments are intricate 
 and contain plenty of ledges to climb, streams to splash in, and decorative structures to hide 
 behind. It's just a shame that the areas in each world start to look alike after a while, since 
 enemies and certain environmental features are recycled constantly. The sound effects that accompany 
 the action don't stand out, but the various laser blasts and metallic crunching noises are definitely 
 appropriate. Some effort clearly went into the music too, as the tunes in each world are richly 
 produced and feature plenty of memorable melodies.  

  It's anybody's guess as to what Buena Vista Games and Altron were thinking when they decided to 
 fashion the Nintendo DS version of Disney's Meet the Robinsons into a run-and-gun-style shoot-'em-up. 
 Fans of the movie may be disappointed by how little the game references the movie, and they probably 
 would have been better served with a traditional adventure game. Nevertheless, the game is a solid 
 shooter that's lively and fun -- for the few hours it lasts.
