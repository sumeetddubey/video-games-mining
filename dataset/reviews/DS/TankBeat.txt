Don't bother playing Tank Beat. 

  Tank Beat isn't much fun. There's very little to it, and what is there is bland, and simplistic. 
 If there's one feat developer MileStone managed to pull off, it's how dull it managed to make the 
 act of blowing up tanks. That might be a fascinating accomplishment, but it makes for an utter 
 bore of a game.  

          Playing Tank Beat is exactly as exciting as looking at this screenshot.     

  The main 
 mode in Tank Beat is the story mode. Each battle is preceded by an introductory sequence featuring 
 plain anime character drawings engaging in barely cohesive dialogue. The story is a mix of soap 
 opera melodrama and freedom fighter hoo-ha, but it's all just an excuse to stick you in a tank 
 and make you blow stuff to smithereens. To do that, you maneuver your blue dot around on the touch 
 screen by drawing a line from the dot to a destination. You can sweep your viewing/firing arc around 
 your dot by dragging the stylus around in a circle. When you see a red dot, you hold the L button 
 and touch it. If you are a good shot, the red dot blows up. Most of the time, a friendly yellow 
 dot or even a green dot will join you. You can set the companion dot to follow you, guard, seek 
 and destroy, or move along a certain path. Usually you'll just have it follow you around, since 
 micromanaging buddy dots is tedious and unnecessary.  

  As it turns out, the dots are tanks, judging by the action on the top screen. You will need to 
 glance at the top screen from time to time to judge your line of fire, but even when you do pay 
 attention to it your eyes aren't apt to be pleased. The boxy tanks roam around blurry environments 
 with few topographical features. There may be some defensive walls or a few buildings and whatnot, 
 but the visuals are mostly drab. The bright spot is when you successfully blow up an enemy tank 
 and the camera zooms in to show you the hazy explosion of pixels. The accompanying soundtrack is 
 grating and annoying, as are most of the sound effects.  

  There is one upside to the sound: Sometimes your combat companion will tell you an enemy is ahead, 
 or off to the right or left. But to whose left is never clear. You might head off to your own left 
 while sweeping your view only to find nothing at all, just in time to notice an enemy rolling in 
 from the right. Another irritation is the simple act of drawing a path. If you draw one, it's indicated 
 with a bright yellow line on the touch screen to let you know where the tank is headed. But occasionally 
 there is a midmission cutscene, and when the scene is over and you are returned to gameplay, the 
 path is gone. So even though your tank will still be following the now-invisible path, you'll need 
 to either use your photographic memory to know where it's headed, or draw a new path. And while 
 some tanks can fire while in motion, others must stop before they can fire. With these tanks, if 
 you stop midpath to fire at an opponent, the path disappears and you need to redraw it. Was it 
 too much to ask to have the tank continue its journey once it fires?  

  The little campaign takes about three hours to finish, and you can skirmish against the artificial 
 intelligence or up to four other players using the maps and tanks you have unlocked. Tank Beat 
 supports both DS download play and Nintendo Wi-Fi, but it's tough finding even one opponent online, 
 let alone three. But it doesn't matter. Whether you think of Tank Beat as an action title or a 
 strategy title, it's easiest just to call it a game you shouldn't play.

Review:  After playing this game for a while, I thought it was pretty decent!
  It's not as bad as some people say, so let's start off.
  
  The graphics aren't the prettiest. I 
 thought it was odd for some people to say the graphics were nice but it's not so let's just leave 
 it at that.
  
  As for the sound, there's nothing spectacular here either. There are some voice clips but you almost 
 never hear them during gameplay (except in the main menu. For some reason a voice saying Tank Beat 
 can be heard when you make a selection there) . Anyway, while it's not the greatest the music occasionally 
 can be appropriate but it may annoy some people.
  
  The gameplay in this game, like many other DS games, has never been done before. You get the 3D action 
 in the top screen, and the map on the bottom. You control tanks in this game (The tanks they use in 
 wars, not the ones they keep water in) . You don't actually have direct control over the tanks. To 
 move, you use the stylus to draw a line for the tank to move. You attack by holding the L trigger 
 and by touching the enemy tank you want to shoot (If you're a lefthander you can change the controls 
 so don't worry) .
  
  You don't just control one type of tank in the game. There are plenty to unlock and each of them 
 play differently. You even get non-tanks like rocket launchers and drills. Still, it would've been 
 nice if you could make your own tank and equip weapons by buying them (that would make it custom 
 robo then I guess....)
  
  It all works well and can be quite enjoyable. The flaw here is that you'll probably keep your eyes 
 on the bottom screen most of the time, so you'll probably see less action on the top screen.
  
  The game is quite long, with the story mode having 27 missions with 3 extra missions. Also, you 
 can replay those missions in Skirmish Mode to obtain higher scores (Somewhat similar to Trauma Center) . Also, another 
 feature in this game is multiplayer. You have multicard play and singlecard here for 4 players. You 
 can also play in Nintendo Wifi Connection too. I've never played any DS games online yet, so I can't 
 give any impressions at the multiplayer at the moment.
  
  Overall, this game is better than most people say. It may not have the graphics or sound, but the 
 concept and the gameplay is good. Some people may not agree with me but.... Meh, who cares. Bottomline, this 
 is a decent game worth checking out.

Review:  Tank Beat. Just it's name calls you to the strategy and war fun which we all know and saw with 
 Advance Wars. Unlike it, however, it's played just with tanks. Nice until there but... the worst 
 reveals itself.
  
  Graphics: One of the best graphic games on the DS, top screen wise. It looks nearly like a game 
 from the N64, which some other games should have, and does this nicely. However, the bottom screen 
 leaves a lot to be desired, displaying a GBA-styled map.
  
  Sound: This is where Tank Beat goes down. The sound is really bad, with the really annoying battle 
 music looping every 5 seconds. Do you know what the worse of it is? It's you trying to figure out 
 a good strategy while the game repeats its boring and monotonous music every 5 god damned minutes! 
 To top all of it off, it has an ear-bleeding pi, pi, pi sound effect every time a character talks. 
 Sure, you can turn all of this off, but what's the point to play a game without sound?!
  
  Gameplay: All flash, no substance. Don't be eluded by the top screen's graphics, as the bottom 
 screen is quick simple, but VERY annoying. To move, draw a straight line. Great, but the problem 
 is you take like 10 minutes just to get to the other side of the battlefield! Attacking? Press 
 and HOLD (ridiculous!) the L button while you are pointing to the enemy to shoot. It's bad enough 
 to hold the button, let alone get a good accuracy with the enemy being a 5mm point on your screen!
 
  
  Wi-Fi/Replay value: I won't even comment on this. It's so weak, as people won't play Wi-Fi. Logically 
 too, as the time spent from moving to attacking to... beating your opponent seems endless. All in 
 all, Tank Beat could have been a much better implemented game. The sound sucks, the controls are 
 sloppy, and Wi-Fi play is weak. The only good thing about it are the graphics, but who would want 
 to play a game due to eye-candy? Very disappointing.
