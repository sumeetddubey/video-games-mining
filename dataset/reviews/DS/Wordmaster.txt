Wordmaster proves that hangman gets b_r_ng fast. 

  Where would we be without hangman? The timeless game has helped meetings go by quicker, students 
 study vocabulary, and young artists practice their doodles of poor stick figures dangling on the 
 gallows. Now the spirit of the classic game comes to the DS in the form of Wordmaster. No, you 
 won't be watching a virtual victim swing from a noose when you guess the wrong letters, but you 
 will experience the same smug satisfaction of guessing the right word before it's too late.  

 
           Those with sloppy handwriting might want to make use of the "how to write" screen, which 
 illustrates the best way to get your letters recognized.      

  The three modes in Wordmaster all revolve around guessing six-letter words. In the main mode, Wordmaster, 
 you're given a category -- something vague like "occupation" or "animal kingdom" -- and a set number 
 of tries to guess the correct word. After guessing five words correctly you play a timed bonus 
 game, which involves guessing the missing letters from a set of words, before moving on to the 
 next set of words and a higher difficulty. Moving to a higher difficulty means harder words and 
 fewer tries. If you can make it to the final Wordmaster difficulty you'll unlock the bonus game 
 as its own stand-alone mode.  

  The other modes include Practice, which lets you try out each of the five difficulties; Anagram, 
 which mixes up a word and tasks you with unscrambling it; and, finally, the aforementioned Time 
 bonus mode. Words seem to repeat often in the Anagram and Time modes, so don't count on those modes 
 staying challenging for long.  

  Wordmaster is as easy to play as any game of hangman. Holding the DS like a book, you can take 
 advantage of the decent writing-recognition system and scribble your letters out, or you can bring 
 up a keyboard. The writing recognition works well enough, but it feels like it was tacked on because 
 of the touch screen, not because the game needed it. The keyboard is the better option because 
 it keeps track of the letters you've already used and you don't have to worry about it misinterpreting 
 your handwriting. In Wordmaster mode, if you get a letter correct but it's in the wrong place, 
 it will show up red. If the placement is right, it will be green. On the lower difficulties, you 
 have so many tries that these color cues make it easy to sort out the letters through process of 
 elimination, even if you don't know the word. The higher difficulties aren't as nice, and feature 
 words like "kabyle" and "teasel," which apparently  are  real words.  

  Just like a real game of hangman, Wordmaster doesn't last long. You can see all the game has to 
 offer inside of an hour. Other than the obscure words and fewer tries, there aren't any new features 
 to unlock as you progress. The only incentive to come back for more is to watch the line on your 
 graph get higher, or expand your vocabulary of six letter words, and if you're playing the game 
 to do that, you might as well read a book.  

           It's a game about English words with a calligraphy theme. It doesn't make sense, but it 
 looks nice.      

  Despite being a little odd, the totally inexplicable Eastern theme looks nice with its bright colors 
 and crisp detail. The portly Wordmaster, Sum Ting Wong (you read that right) , sits in the corner 
 and judges your performance with a variety of nods and claps. Word puzzles roll out on frayed scrolls 
 and the writing area resembles a sand pit, complete with rake eraser. A couple of dragon backgrounds 
 and soothing music top off the strange but enjoyable presentation.  

  Wordmaster isn't a bad game, and fans of crossword puzzles, word searches, or sudoku might enjoy 
 knocking out a few puzzles before bed. Even so, it's hard to recommend paying for something that 
 could easily be found online for free.
