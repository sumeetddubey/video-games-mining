:::Review:::
Kong's DS adventure is unambitious, boring, ugly, and buggy. 

  Talk around the watercooler suggests that the console versions of Peter Jackson's King Kong are 
 thrilling and entertaining, albeit brief in length. If you're interested in playing a video game 
 based upon the big ape's recent silver screen adventure, by all means, pick up the console game 
 and enjoy yourself. Whatever you do, don't give the Nintendo DS game a passing thought, or, heaven 
 forbid, waste money on it. This poor excuse of a first-person shooter is so bad that other developers 
 should study it and use it as a guide for what to avoid when putting together similar games in 
 the future.  

          King Kong on the DS has very little in common with its console counterpart.     

  Like 
 its console counterparts, the DS game is set up primarily as a first-person shooter and only loosely 
 follows the events from the movie. Everything takes place on Skull Island, which is home to a tribe 
 of superstitious natives, some prehistoric beasts, and a giant ape known as King Kong. Players 
 spend the majority of the 17 levels directly controlling the swashbuckling hero, Jack Driscoll, 
 in first-person-viewpoint environments that are mainly oriented around shooting enemies and unlocking 
 doors. In the movie, key events are set in motion by three of Jack's companions, namely Carl Denham, 
 the pushy filmmaker; Hayes, the expedition guide; and Ann Darrow, the actress that Carl has hired 
 to star in his latest film. In the game, most of the mischief caused by these characters is shown 
 in still-frame cutaways, although they do tag along behind Jack during certain levels and help 
 out as necessary. Approximately every five levels or so, the game shifts gears and puts players 
 in control of the mighty Kong. These levels employ a third-person perspective and mostly involve 
 climbing, jumping, and swinging across the island with some hand-to-hand combat thrown in along 
 the way.  

  Without question, the idea of being able to play as a human one moment and Kong the next is brilliant. 
 Unfortunately, the action-packed combat and beastly cathartic moments that were realized so frequently 
 in the console game aren't present in the DS game. Progression through the first-person levels 
 is entirely too straightforward. Despite the jungle setting, each level is basically just a long 
 hallway with a few offshoots, turns, and doors incorporated in order to obscure the nagging feeling 
 that, indeed, you really are just walking down one hallway after another. Ironically, even though 
 this is a first-person shooter, players rarely get the opportunity to shoot at things. Enemies 
 are sparsely distributed, to the point that most combat situations involve a lone crab skittering 
 toward you with its claws extended. What's more, every enemy is a crab, a bee, a bat, or a Velociraptor-like 
 dinosaur. Velociraptors are worthy foes, but crabs and bees?  

  The control mechanics in the first-person levels are fine, but, there too, the developer didn't 
 make an effort to do anything interesting with them. You can move Jack around using the directional 
 pad, change his eyeline by dragging the stylus across the touch screen, and fire weapons or activate 
 switches by pressing one of the shoulder buttons. When you come across a switch that Jack can't 
 reach, you can also double-tap the touch screen to command Carl, Hayes, or Ann to pull it. That's 
 everything players have control over. Aiming is mostly automatic, Jack can't jump or perform any 
 melee attacks, and there isn't any inventory management because Jack can only carry one weapon 
 at a time. As it is, Jack's weapon options are pitiful and extremely limited. He can throw spears 
 and pick up and use four different guns. For whatever reason, though, someone on the development 
 team decided that the spear and pistol should be more effective than the shotgun or machine gun. 

  The Kong levels aren't much better. They give off a larger-than-life vibe because of Kong's size 
 and the third-person perspective, but all of the tree-swinging falls flat because the majority 
 of Kong's actions are pre-scripted. He can't fall off a ledge, miss a jump, or lose his grip. All 
 players need to do is press the B button over and over again to make Kong progress from one handhold 
 to the next. Combat requires slightly more input. Smaller lizards have to be knocked away by pressing 
 the punch or slam buttons, while larger T-Rexes must first be worn down with basic attacks before 
 initiating the killing blow, which is a neck snap that's performed by rapidly pressing the Y button. 
 Even though the Kong levels aren't that good, they're easily the best aspect of the game. It's 
 a pity that among the 17 levels, only four of them involve playing as Kong.  

  Clearly, the game was doomed from conception because the design and development staff wasn't ambitious 
 enough with their ideas. On the whole, there isn't much for players to do. The first-person levels 
 are overly linear and don't contain anywhere near what would be considered a satisfactory number 
 of enemies. There certainly aren't enough Kong levels. The control mechanics are fine, but so many 
 actions are automatic or pre-scripted so that it takes away hands-on opportunities that might have 
 helped the layouts and combat seem less boring.  

  Not surprisingly, the graphics, audio, and pretty much everything else associated with the game's 
 entire presentation are underwhelming. The woefully inadequate 3D graphics engine is about on par 
 with the early Turok games that were on the Nintendo 64. The environments look vaguely like the 
 caves and forests you might find on a jungle island, except that the layouts are numbingly linear, 
 and graphical flaws, such as blocky textures and excessive fog, are ever present. Polygon seams 
 are visible all over the place, too. A fair amount of polygons went into Jack's visible appendages 
 and his weapons, and also into Kong, so those character aspects look sharp. However, the other 
 characters and enemies are downright ugly. The crabs and bees are put together with so few polygons 
 that they look like two-dimensional sprites, and they barely animate. The rendition of Ann Darrow, 
 played in the film by Naomi Watts, looks sickly, as if she were recently bitten by a zombie and 
 decided to trade in her designer duds for a burlap sack. Although the accompanying audio isn't 
 bad, there really isn't much to the soundtrack aside from a dramatic music loop that repeats constantly 
 and a few rudimentary weapon and creature sound effects.  

  Above all, the entire presentation is just anticlimactic from the get-go. Every single one of the 
 movie's greatest and most action-packed moments is depicted in the game as a series of still-frame 
 images. Kong's climb up the Empire State Building, easily the most recognizable scene from the 
 film, is rendered using the game engine, but it too is a waste of time, since players can't actually 
 control any aspect of the sequence.  

  Adding injury to insult, the game is full of programming bugs. Bullets and spears will pass right 
 through enemies if they're at point-blank range. Sometimes, Jack can walk through walls, which 
 may cause you to fall to your death in a vague polygonal abyss. The game also has a nasty habit 
 of resetting itself, particularly in the ninth level when Jack and Hayes encounter a set of crabs. 
 A less-annoying glitch, but one that's amusing to witness, is when an enemy slides sideways across 
 the ground, like on a sheet of ice, and eventually just disappears right into a wall. Whether due 
 to bad planning, rushed programming, or poor quality control, there's simply no excuse for a retail 
 packaged video game to exhibit bugs like this.  

          The DS version of King Kong is full of bugs.     

  Mercifully, it only takes about 
 two hours to play through the entire game, although mentally the experience feels like an eternity 
 thanks to the mind-numbing gameplay and presentation. Once you finish a level, you can't replay 
 it without starting a new save file. There is no unlockable content. The reward awaiting any player 
 stubborn enough to finish the game is a brief, non-interactive Kong sequence that's honestly the 
 only part of the game players might actually want to have control over, since it involves the Empire 
 State Building and a few pesky airplanes. No such luck, though. You'll just have to watch Kong 
 do his dirty work and enjoy the credits that roll right after.  

  The DS hardware is more than capable of handling a competent, well-designed first-person shooter. 
 Even the Metroid Prime: First Hunt demo that came packaged with the first batch of systems is proof 
 enough of that. The DS version of Peter Jackson's King Kong is a wreck, not because of the hardware's 
 weaknesses, but because the developers just didn't put any effort or inspiration into their game.

Review:  I'm sorry, but the DS is capable of so much more then this heap of garbage packaged as a game. 
 Playing through the first time I really didn't think it was as bad as people made it out to be, 
 but that was only a brief rent. Actually buying the game and playing through a second time made 
 me see this game's true colors.
  
  Gameplay: The gameplay is horrid, to say the least. You begin the game as Jack and you start out 
 the first level on a beach. You literally just move up the beach to gain entry to a cave and boom! 
 You just completed the first level. I'm not even joking. There really wasn't any effort put into 
 these sections of the game. The only redeeming part about the gameplay is being able to play as 
 Kong himself, though sadly, these parts are short and few an far between. And don't even get me 
 started on the bugs. Just because I was going in the opposite direction of my current objective, 
 I slipped beneath the ground, resulting in an instant death! Its like the developers wanted to 
 remove any of all enjoyment from this so-called "game".
  
  Graphics: Terrible. Muddy. Glitchy. Bland. Pixelated. Need I say more?
  
  Sound: Probably the 
 only half-decent thing the game has to offer. Sure, the little music there is can get repetitive, 
 but it's a heck of alot better than what you get in the poor sound effects department.
  
  Value: What value? The game clocks in at about 2 hours, which is actually a good thing since the 
 suffering doesn't last long. But don't expect any kind of unlockables for what you had to endure.
 
  
  Overall: Don't buy it. Don't even waste your time looking at it. It's obvious this was a rushed 
 project and oh does it show! You'd be better off watching the old 1933 version of King Kong then 
 forcing yourself through this buggy mess.

Review:  First of all, I would like to say the game tricks you. It has pictures on the back of Kong in New 
 York City, where you don't even get to go. My friend and I played through all these seemingly similar 
 levels in order to see a clip scene of Kong falling down the Empire State building. The graphics 
 are terrible. I couldn't tell the hand from the arm. It was like playing Nintendo 64 again. For 
 other systems, the game was ok. Once again, this was a game based off a good movie that turned 
 out terrible. I spent forty dollars on this game and got four back when I rushed back to the store 
 a week later and shoved the terrible money-waster into the cashier's hands. I see what the game 
 designers tried to do, but it failed miserably. When choosing an old game thhat doesn't have many 
 modes of play, only get this game if it's under six dollars. If you pay a price above that, you 
 are being ripped off.

Review:  This game is a terrible mess. I'm glad I didn't waste any money on it, I just fell sorry for my 
 cousin who bought it as a present. Over companies should look at this game and learn from this 
 terrible mistake.
  
  The gameplay is atrocious. You can't run or even walk fast and your weapons never seem to actually 
 make any form of contact with the enemy. Kong's levels are far too easy and there are barely any 
 of them. Jack's levels are boring and rather horrid.
  
  The graphics on this game are ugly and extremly dated. The landscapes are clusters of coloured 
 pixels are part from the few dinosaurs there are in this game. There not particuarly good either. 
 This is yet another film spin off game, which has had no effort put into making it, at least you 
 can use the game to test if your DS works. Kong does feel bigger than he was in the film, I'll 
 give it that.
  
  THIS IS SIMPLE, THIS GAME IS A COMPLTE AND UTTER WASTE OF MONEY. DO NOT BUY IT AND TRADE IT IN 
 FOR A DECENT GAME IS SOMEONE GIVES IT TO YOU AS A PRESENT.

Review:  The Good: Nothing
  
  The Bad: Everything
  
  I was looking around in a local game store when I saw Peter Jackson's King Kong for Nintendo DS 
 on sale for two bucks. This game is a rip off even for two dollars. Seriously, you'd be better 
 off throwing the cash in a dumpster. Doing so would at least save you the hellish hassle of attempting 
 to learn and play this game.
  
  I knew this game would be horrendous upon the first instant of playing it. The graphics are grainy 
 and ugly. The level design is completely linear. Other than a few unnecessary left and right turns, 
 you're basically walking in a straight line with a few doors in between. Additionally, the weapon 
 choices are incredibly lackluster. The pistol, spear, shotgun, and machine gun are the only weapons 
 available throughout the entire game.
  
  Moreover, the controls on this game are especially clunky. Other FPS games such as Metroid Prime 
 Hunters, Call of Duty 4, and Brothers in Arms (though 3rd person) have made excellent use of the 
 DS touch screen. The touch screen works almost flawlessly on the these games, but such is definitely 
 not the case with King Kong. The fact that there isn't an option to use only the D-Pad and A, B, X, Y 
 buttons makes the clunky control situation even worse.
  
  If the enemies were at least a little challenging or interesting, I might be able to overlook some 
 of this game's serious flaws. But similar to the arsenal of weaponry, the enemies in King Kong 
 are boring and limited. As far as I got into this game before quitting, the only enemies I faced 
 were bees, bats, and crabs. Apparently there are also dinosaurs, but this game was long gone from 
 my possession before I was able to reach that point. Also, from as much as I played, I found that 
 enemies are placed rather scarcely. Occasionally a crab would pop out of the wall or a bat would 
 fly out of the sky, but there seemed to be more walking than shooting.
  
  To make matters even worse (I didn't think it was possible either) , bugs and glitches are rampant 
 in this dreadful excuse of a videogame. A few times while I was walking near a wall I fell into 
 a white world of nothingness. And the fact that you can only see a very short distance in front 
 of you due to the appalling graphics does not really help. Furthermore, I want to throw in that 
 the music blows. I won't go into detail. I'll just leave it at that.
  
  All in all, this game is not worth your time. In fact, if someone offers it to you for free, say 
 no. Games are meant for you to have fun with and play during valued leisure time. They aren't meant 
 to be a waste of time and energy, which is exactly what this pitiful game is. Peter Jackson's King 
 Kong DS is not only a disgrace to King Kong and the Nintendo DS system. It also brings shame upon 
 video games in general. I would be embarrassed to be part of the team who created this dreadful 
 excuse of a FPS videogame.

Review:  Gameplay: Your fastest movment is a slow walk. Your bullets 60% of the time go through your enemy, 
 and there are way to little Dinos. Kong's levels are played out, so you can't fall, and i'm pretty 
 sure he can't die, and there are to few of them. Jack's levels are boring FPS levels that are horrable. 
 You also can't play levels unless you atart a new file.
  
  Graphics: Every thing looks like a glop of colered pixels except the Dinos. But there are so few 
 that it dosen't even matter, and they are still pretty slopy.
  
  Replay value: There is none. I got it for $20 and I could'nt even bring my self to finish it, and 
 I ended up returning it the next day. I can't even begin to imagine a worse game. Yet...
  
  Conclusion: Never get this game ever! With any luck it isn't even on the shelves anymore. No matter 
 what anyone says don't get it!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE DON'T GET

Review:  King Kong, hmmmm this game has glictches, terrible graphics, horrible gameplay, repetitive sound, 
 no replay value, but still addictive for a while. So let's review it:
  Graphics: The scenaries look terrible in this game, with flat grass and mostly despixeled images, 
 also some glitches:
  4/10
  Addiction: For a while This game it's addictive, for it's difficulty, anyways, it is so damn short, 
 that it's just for a while:
  9.5/10
  Replay Value: Absolutely no replay value, you finish it once, and that's all:
  1/10
  Variety: 
 2 characters, some monsters, and different weapons are all the variety in this game:
  4/10
  Story: The same storyline that in the movie, but not as boring, just repetitive:
  6/10
  Total:
 
  4.9/10
  Conclusion: This game it's addictive, but has poor quality, just... rent it first.

Review:  This one is just bad, I cannot past level 8 cause of all the bugs and glitches in the game. Levels 
 are too short. The monsters actually hurt you. Not enough dinos but the bees hurt you. A little 
 bee hurting a giant gorilla? I suggest you to not buy the game. Do not rent it. If u have it throw 
 it into the shredder or return it for you're money back. This makes Dungeons and Dragons on the 
 NES look good. It insults the movie and all the other versions. If you want a good King Kong game 
 on a hand held get the PSP or the GBA versions.

Review:  When I first bought this game, I wasn't so sure how good it was going to be. But once I popped 
 it in, I knew straight away that this was one of the greatest games ever made. For God's sake, 
 the main menu made me pass out from sheer brilliance. Once I actually started playing, I was in 
 shock. The graphics were so amazing that the characters seemed to pop out of the screen! My pet 
 ferret died of a heart attack just watching me play! Then comes the gameplay and story -- I played 
 this game for five days straight without a hint of boredom, merely because of the amazing story 
 and creative and intuitive gameplay. Once I finally beat the game, I played it for another four 
 days until I fell unconscious to the floor from lack of sleep and nutrition. I woke up in the hospital 
 a couple days later and continued playing again for three days straight. Sadly, however, my concerned 
 roommates stole the game from me the day after and I haven't seen a trace of it since. Regardless, 
 however, I still remember the game as one of the greatest games I have, and probably ever will, 
 play. I swear, I haven't seen another game quite like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time -- wait 
 a minute... this is the King Kong for the DS board. Oh. Never mind then. That game sucked. Cheers, 
 folks.

Review:  This game is without a doubt the worst DS game Ever made! It's just absolutely terrible. Lets start 
 with the graphics. They are so bad that you can acctually see the pixels. The only good thing about 
 the graphics is when you rarely play as Kong himself. Only 2 out of 17 levels are acctually any 
 good! The gameplay it's self has to be the worst thing. Who ever came up with the idea that you 
 shoud only acctually use the touch screen to aim, must have been drugged out of their skull. There 
 are endless possibilites for use of the touch screen in this game.
  The sound is far too repetitive with each creature seemingly making the same noise when meeting 
 it's demise.
  IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are even considering buying this game, DON'T. Buy the console counterpart 
 instead or even the PC version, just get as far away from the Nintendo DS version as you can.

Review:  I am a huge huge huge king kong fan ( have made a website, watch the movie twice a month, have 3 
 version of game.) and the DS version is ok, despite what ppl say. It, somewhat like the platform 
 versions, has a soundtrack, just a bit of voice acting, and pretty good graphics (for a DS i mean) 
 the game is fun and can be hard at parts because of hard enemys and low ammo amounts. so idk why 
 ppl sya it sucks, its not bad.
  
  The music is mostly taken form the other versions but some of it is new. There are little bees 
 instead of giant millepedes (good for me, who jumps each time i hear the menacing hiss)

Review:  This game is completely awful. Crappy controls, horrible camera views, and the BUGS &amp; GLITCHES, 
 it's enough to make you insane. You can inadvertantly walk THROUGH the side of a mountain and fall 
 down a cliff that's not even there... you have to see it to understand, then again, don't bother. 
 The fighting was also completely awful. Half the time you can't even see what you're supposed to 
 be attacking because of the crappy camera angles. The game felt like it was thrown together in 
 a day so they could cash in on the King Kong name while the movie was semi-hot. It's games like 
 this that made me decide to get rid of my DS.

 character movement is way to slow. Got the Ds for my bday and this game and wasnt to impressed. 
 No way would i recommend this to anyone. In my opinion the Movie is almost always better then the 
 game. In this case it was by a long ways. Im very surprised to see such a low game coming from 
 ubisoft as well. Games such as the splinter cells, ghost recon, and resident evil 4. Very Dissapointing 
 game considering the hits they have made in the past.

Review:  True, the game isn't the best, but I thought it was ok overall. The game is similar to the PS2 
 version, with a little differance. I thought the game itself was really easy, but it was still 
 pretty fun. The game featured a pretty good use of the Touch Screen. I do think it could have been 
 better, espicallly compairing it to the PS2 and XBox versions, but it was ok. In the game, you 
 play as Jack, and you're making a movie. You're filming it on a island, where King Kong is at. 
 The game pretty much follows the movie. I don't think it was worth the $40 price is used to be, 
 but I bought it for $15 and I think that was a fair deal. So, you should either rent it first or 
 buy it cheap.

Review:  King Kong is a first person shooter for the DS... it is not good. The game had you going through 
 glitch filled and ugly levels and shooting or spearing giant crabs and dinosaurs. There are few 
 weapons but not many. You can pick up a spears, pistols, machine guns, shotguns, and a sniper rifles. 
 Most of them can't do crap. It took me 250 rounds with the machine gun to bring down one crab. 
 And the spear does more damage than any of the guns. Since when do sharp pointy things hurt something 
 more than a gun? Anyways you can't tell when you are about to die because you have no health meter. 
 This game is also full of glitches and bugs as I mentioned earlier. It is more fun to watch a crab 
 slide across solid rock or walk through walls than to actually play the game. The graphics are 
 awful. SNES graphics looked better. There is obviously nothing to be found here so stay away and 
 you should be alright.

Review:  King Kong was released about the time 'movie' based games started to become playable. This game 
 for the Nintendo DS is quite the opposite of the movie. The movie is long with fantastic special 
 effects, a great soundtrack and extreme action sequences. The game is short, has shocking graphics 
 and hardly action at all.
  
  The one big let down of this game is it's length. I bought it on a Friday and finished it by the 
 end of the weekend. This means you don't get your $70 AUS worth. I would totally buy this game 
 if it was $20 or thereabouts. Another let down of the game are it's graphics.
  
  The graphics in the game are shocking, it looks as if Jack isn't holding the gun properly with 
 his thumb on the inside. You can hardly make out what kind of gun he's holding! You have to look 
 twice can hardly make out if a human is male or female. Another point is the amount of action.
 
  
  I know in the movie most of the time they run from dinosaurs and King Kong, but in a video game 
 all people want to do is take them out. Sadly all you can do is run, or die. Through passages that 
 dinosaurs can't get to, it makes you feel kind of weak.
  
  Ah well, another bad game has come out and everyone should put it behind them and look to the good 
 Nintendo DS games out. The DS isn't a bad system, but this game is.

Review:  I never bought a game of whith I had the feeling that I want to sell agan so soon. For the first 
 moment the game looks good. But as soon as you get furder it's all the same. The characker walks, 
 shoots on spiders, opens a door. And continue doing the same. The movie is much better, and is 
 nice. The game SUCKS. You also can only walk into one direction. 
  
  I don't know what elso to say about it but I realy haven't seen such a wortless DS game in my life. 
 And it's was deffenetly not worth my 20 euro's.

Review:  Ubisoft really wanted to milk this king kong dry so they put out a ds version. It was $40 in some 
 places it was as much or more as the one on the cube (the good one) so expecting some one to pay 
 $40 (then) for a bustid linnear version of a already linnear game is just insain. There are so 
 many bugs here it's down right unplayable. You can hardley shoot any thing you fall though the 
 floor and the AI is busted. The monsters fall though the floor or just forget bout you. Or just disapear 
 and still attack you. The king knog leavals keep this game from geting a 1 but that still means 
 they are kinda bad. It's so dark and the fighting is even more unreponsive. So it's best to just 
 forget this cash cow it be better to. Maybey one day you will se it for $5 in some used game store 
 or 50c at some yard sell. Even then you spent to much money on it.

Review:  This game sucks very much! The graphics suck, the gameplay sucks, everything about this game sucks! I 
 don't see the reason why they had to make this for the ds. It is totally pointless!!!!! You should 
 avoid this game at all cost. I reccommend this game to no one!!!!! If you buy this game you are a 
 total dumb@$$!!!!! I'd rather play with sticks then play with this piece of $h! t they call a game! Overall 
 I give this so called game a 1 out of 10 because it's just a cheap imitation of the console versions! REMEMBER 
 STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!!!!! It is a total rip off and it makes the console version look sooooo 
 bad!!!!!

Review:  I played this game and I was very disappointing by it.
  
  Gameplay: This game is totally different then the other games. In the start you going through a 
 portabol which explaining you have to play the game. The biggest problem I had with the game is 
 that you don't play as King Kong and if you do then you do it in FP mode which suckes.
  
  Graphics: The graphics here are the worst graphics that the Nintendo DS can show us. The weapons 
 suck, the enemies suck and the gun fire is so awful that I cried. Common it is like you playing 
 a very old playstation 1 game.
  
  Sound: The sound in this game are actually pretty decent for a crappy game like this. The music 
 is a little disappointment because you don't have the beautiful song from the movie and the sound 
 effects sound like toys.
  
  Value: You can play this game for like 5 minutes and then be bored to death. The storyline is shorter 
 then what you played on the PSP version or the other versions and you don't have any speical things 
 just for the Nintendo DS version. And another thing, the touching screen is completly useless here.
 
  
  Reviewer's tilt: Overall this game is one of the worst games on the Nintendo DS and you should 
 definitely want to ignore this game at all cost.

Review:  Okay, maybe I was wrong to rent it, but I wanted a rental for DS! And c'mon, it couldn't have been 
 THAT bad judging by the screens... Could it? Appearently, it could be. And then some.
  
  I'll start with the good. The graphics are actually very good. What makes it even more amazing 
 is the fact the developer actually made it 3D rather than port the already made 2D GBA version 
 (Which was probably the better game) . I give credit where credit is due, and give the graphics 
 a 8/10.
  
  The sound is good in it's own right. That is, atleast it has some voice, and some effects you're 
 surprised are even in this monstrosity. I give sound a 7/10.
  
  Now here's the bad... Gameplay... Let me first say that the only reason it even got a 2 was because 
 it's worth a couple laughs at HOW BAD it is. I mean, there are certain sections in the ground that 
 you can actually fall through and die. It's not like it's a trap door or something clever, it's 
 dirt, you can fall through DIRT. That's kinda a big deal, when the earth's solid ground can't hold 
 you above it. Like I said, I give gameplay a 2/10.
  
  Please don't buy, rent, or even look at this game. Please, I'm trying to help.

Review:  King Kong is probably the worst DS game ever created. The gameplay feels like it was mashed together 
 at the last moment, is incredibly easy, linear and boring. Playing as King Kong is allright but 
 for the majority of the game you are playing as Jack, and you use guns, spears, and other objects. 
 Also, basically all you do is fight giant crabs which isn't very fun. You should be able to fight 
 more dinosaurs.
  
  At first glimpse, the graphics look good, but they are incredibly glitch-filled, and there all 
 walls that you'll fall right through, dead pixels and the whole shebang. there is ilittle detail 
 in the environment, and the gunshots look terrible. A puff of who knows what shoots out of your 
 gun and it just looks bad. Really bad.
  
  What's even worse is the sound. The music is allright at first, but gets really repetitive and 
 doesn't sound clear at all. The grating voice samples are just ughh... Like one the girl calls out 
 "Jack!" it doesn't even sound human.
  
  You beat this game, and I assure you you'll never want to play it again. The ending comes out of 
 no where, you just walk through a doorway and BOOM you've beaten the game! No final boss or anything. 
 You don'; t even get to play the scene where Kong rampages the city, and you don't get to fight 
 those planes either. It's just bad.
  
  Verdict: This game straight out blows.

Review:  king kong for the ds is a below average game playing as kong is a fun experience but u have to 
 get to it by playing as jack, killin enemies (which arent to smart) and helpin teamates which arent 
 that bright either sometimes) but the parts i hated most are rescuing ann, those are the most annoying 
 parts of the game shes usually on ledges, even when sehes being attacked she just sits there and 
 whine and complain. the enemies are pretty dumb, u run away from a raptor and turn a corner and 
 it sits there opening and closing its mouth while u just watch it. overall its not terrible its 
 below average

Review:  King Kong for the DS is very disappointing. The graphics are crap so I was expecting the game to 
 make up for that by having a good storyline with lots of mosters. However it turned out this game's 
 gameplay was as crap as its graphics. The game got very repetitve. I didn't even get to see King 
 Kong because I got too bored of playing it before I even reached the level with King Kong in it 
 and so I returned my copy. I do not recommend for anyone to get this game since it is so dire. 
 You might aswell get the console version because it is way better.

  Yeah , the giant

  while you're turning, because it takes like 5 swipes just to turn around, and while you're trying 
 to turn around, you're being killed from behind.

Review:  King kong for the DS is the worst game realse to the DS , even worst then pokemon Dash & O most 
 as bad as Elf blowing ! graphics look like they tried to make it as fast as possible with as little 
 money as possible look like sometime from a NeoGeo ! The controls are lousy in this game, as the 
 touchpad is used to turn from side to side and look up and down.... that's not bad, but even sliding 
 across the entire face of the touch screen only seems to turn you a few degrees.... to turn completely 
 around takes trying to turn a handful of times. The heroin of the movie is there to help you with 
 switches, levers, etc. Just try not to look at her. This is the only game i have ever seen on a 
 handheld console that FROZE!!! In the 2nd level you have to kill this retarded crab but as i aproched 
 it it started vibrateing and FROZE! I spent like half of the whole day trying to kill the stupid 
 huge crab. I still havent beaten it. Don't waste your money go for mario cart DS or something thats 
 worth your while

Review:  I loved the movie and I was stupid enough to buy this game!
  
  Gameplay: Navigating through a level is like trying to find your own bathroom. Pretty much all you 
 do is walk straight, shoot some baddies and BAM! Level complete. Hopefully you know where your bathroom 
 is so you can flush this game down the toilet!
  
  Graphics: I have 3 ds games and this has the wprst graphics out of all of them! There are so mANY 
 GLITCHES i will name you as any as I can remember!1. When you walk you see all these lines in the 
 ground 2. jack has a little tendency to walk through walls or fall through the floor and die (right 
 at the end of the hardest level!) That is, if you do not flush it down the toilet and make it to 
 the hardest level!
  
  Sound: Best thing about the game! Sounds realistic and is very calming.
  
  Value: Not worth 10 
 bucks! DO NOT BUY IT!
  
  Tilt: If I even have the patience to beat the game, Its going down the toilet or to gamestop. maybe 
 could get 5 bucks for it.
  Overall: DO NOT BUY IT! If you are a fan of the movie buy the ps2 version. if you want a portable 
 version, get the psp or gba ver..

 to make you wanna play it for any longer. im suprised i didnt turn it off or just smash it against 
 the wall (if it would have been mine i would have) . there's so many glitches in this crappy game 
 that its unreal. you may think the scrrenshots look good but i would rather pay 30 for them than 
 having the torture of playing it again.
  
  I saw my friend complete the game and it took him about 2 weeks 9but he doens't play games non- 
 stop. for some fun deprived child to keep playing this non-stop it would take him a few hours of 
 pain to complete. 
  
  trust me when i say this... GET THE PC VERSION. check out my review for that too...

Review:  Please read this whole thing. Then take a really close look at the screens.
  especially the one with the shotgun and T rex ... im sorry but the guns looked as if they were 
 folded boxes with pencil lines on them . *tch* i think the music is fine, for the game boy advance 
 (no offence advance players) the pictures on the box, HELL the screenshots here on gamespot look 
 much better than the actual game looks. 
  The PSP version is like console good so i would definatly recomend that one but this is pathetic..
 
  
  i was discusted when i saw the characters from the movie like jack black and the girl that played 
 ann.....
  O god it was like colorless paper dolls running around.
  
  it seemed like the only monsters in the game were Crabs, big crabs, rapter thing and T rex.... 
 i never seen such terrible graphics in a 3D game. it gives me chills that it was even put out.

Review:  When i was going to get this game i thought it wouldn't be that great because of the review it 
 got but i was really surprised when i played it. It definatly does deserve a pretty good rating, 
 Come on! Anyway i really enjoy playing King Kong on ds and this game was not a waste of money. 
 The game does have some glitches but it doesnt stuff up the gameplay. It mas look a bit funny, 
 a good way to describe it is... the King Kong game is too 'big' for DS (if that makes sense) Everyone 
 compared it to the console or PC versions, people said stuff like... this game doesn't deserve 
 the name King Kong or somthing like that. How can you expect such an awsome huge innovative game 
 it be crammed into such a tiny game cartridge. You can't compare it to the others because the game 
 is completely different game. If you wanted a portable version of the game and there was no DS 
 then you would need to by the 2D Game Boy Advanced version. You can't complain about this, but 
 this game is pretty damn good!

Review:  i remember when my friend said that i can borrow this game and never give it back, i was like yay!! 
 Then, 2 hours later, the game was literally a pile of dust in my bedroom corner. I got to lvl nine 
 and after the opening sequence, the game resetted itself! Also i remember a time when i was fighting 
 some dinosaurs with the old King Kong. i was kicking the crap out of them when suddenly they all 
 jus froze, slid sideways thru the wall, and then thru the ground. i was laughin so hard that my 
 next door neighbor told me to quiet down.
  
  While i was shooting at the flying dinosaurs, i was running around and the next i knew was i saw 
 myself falling down into wat i call a polygonal mess. i later then figured outt that i walked thru 
 a wall!! really dumb. i was throwin a spear at one of them and it goes rite thru the dino and i 
 die! and who thinks a pistol and spear are the weapon of choice? Seriously, when i was done with 
 this game i almost laughed myself to death becuz of how messed up and broken this game was. I think 
 it was jus thrown together with no time to actually plan out everything. And wat kind of shooter 
 game doesnt let u jump, cant sprint, and cant fall off ledges but can go thru walls? I was having 
 laughing fits at how broken this game was.

Review:  Okay all the people who thought this game was a piece of crap well your the pieces of crap and 
 a definitly not true gamers. This was a good expeirence for the DS players. the game was based 
 on an exciting game and movie. You guys don't understand that this game was extremly fun and it 
 was full of action and excitment. It wasn't very long but hey it was totally fun to play and not 
 a waste of time and or money. I cant believe it got a 2.8 it was one of the funnest DS games out 
 there. If you enjoyed Peter Jackson's King Konf The Official Game of the Movie on the bigger consoles 
 then you'll prolly enjoy this game too. Im tellin ya it is great. Great quality and amazing graphics 
 for a DS game. And all the feature from the others versions are on this one too. You can play as 
 Jack and Kong. Dude, you have got to get this game it is very addictive and fun.

Review:  You start the game not know how to move or do most anything, and as the game progresses you dont 
 seem to get the hang of it. Its hard to master and the 3D graphics are very basic, at points the 
 method of controlling using the stylus lets down the game even further making it hard to move around 
 quickly. If you wanted the game in order to play as King Kong himself, again you will be disappointed 
 as you are required to play a number of levels first, the beast is easier to control but hardly 
 that much easier, i wouldnt recommend the game to anyone!

Review:  This Game is absolutely boring and ugly, yeah but it sold cause it's from a movie, what a shame 
 for Peter Jackson!!... Where's the Quality Control Here?? Man I'm so mad, Nintendo I love you, your 
 games full of emotions, don't let horrendous games like these come out again, even if they sell 
 well... now, there are companies who know about programming good games with lil budget, games that 
 are interesting to play, warning: when u play games like these make you feel disappointed with 
 the videogames industry tendency, pliz DON'T BUY VIDEOGAMES JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE FROM MOVIES, 
 VIEW THESE REVIWS FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!

Review:  This was about the worst mistake of my life. I played the PC demo and thought the game my be as 
 cool on the DS. It is my new belief that the DS can screw over any game, series, or genre. This 
 game and the $150 I spent on my DS was completely put down the tube.
  This game lacks story line, music, graphics, and my attention. This is the most boring game ever 
 made. I played it for ten minutes and got bored of it. fighting t-rexs only lasts so long. The 
 DS needs to stop using that stupid touch screen!
  It is way to freakin hard to use. OMG! 
  Save your money. Do not buy this game. It would be a major mistake. Save your money. If you want 
 to play king kong do it on the computer. I played the 360 demo and even that lacked major. Peter 
 Jackson movies rock but his games blow.

Review:  King Kong for DS is by no means a good game, however, the reviews posted on GameSpot so far have 
 certainley been harsh.
  
  Gameplay: The gameplay is very sloppy and sometimes it feels that you arent in complete control 
 of character. The controls are very limited and is a bit stiff at points. There are only four guns 
 you can use as Jack, whom you play as most of the time.
  
  Graphics: The graphics in this game are pretty good for a handheld. It is in full 3d and on the 
 most part looks nice. There are some dodgy framerate issues and there are a few bugs. Some of the 
 characters especially look like zombies.
  
  Sound: The sound in this game is decent and has some good music and voice over work. However at 
 times it is very muffles and dosnt take advantage of the DS's speakers.
  
  Value: The game dosent take long to complete and there are 17 levels in the game. The bad thing 
 is that only 4 of them are where you actually play as Kong. They might as well have called this 
 game Peter Jackson's Jack Driscoll The Official Game Of The Movie.
  
  Overall the game is not so bad, it's probably one of the better FPS's on the DS, but probably not 
 up to standard with Rogue Agent or the upcoming Metroid Prime Hunters. But this game is still pretty 
 fun while it lasts.

Review:  Great dissapointment for Kong. You'd think that it would be better then what it is, but unfortunatly, 
 it isn't. The other Kong games are killer with a lot of action packed sequences that left me on 
 the edge of my seat. This game had the opposite effect on me.
  
  Kong might be King, but in this game he isn't. Perhaps this big monkey shouldn't be taken off Skull 
 Island, as should the game come of the shelves. If you truly believe that this game is great, think 
 again. I was frusturated and fed up with in the first 10 minutes of the game.
  
  Grade: F

Review:  This it is the worse game of DS than it exists. The music is... so that they occur an idea of the 
 quality of the musica, exist games of Game Boy Color with better music. The grafics... seem surely 
 fine cardboards doubled with better music... the control... of the worse thing of a portatil console... 
 if you have DS, that goes to you to interest, but better olvidate, for that exists the version 
 of Game Boy Advance, that is quite better than the one of DS. If you have homemade consoles, it 
 buys that version since it has all the necessary one to become one of your favorite games. Thanks 
 to read this review.

Review:  Ok, if you thought the xbox version had good graphics, you are so wrong. King Kong looks and sounds 
 great. I can't believe the reviews it was givin'.
  I meen they did so good on the music. OMG i had so much much adrinalin. I could have killed someone 
 from the rushing music. And the graphics are self explanitory. You would get such a kick out of 
 this game. Listen to me and no one else! this is the best game you can get for the DS. I am surprized 
 about the reviews.
  In conclusion, this is the best game for the DS. So if you want any other Awsome reviews, check 
 out my Ping Pals review.

Review:  Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie is the absolute WORST game I have ever 
 played in my life. It feels unfinished from the start. There are clipping problems in most of the 
 levels I have played, the controls are sluggish, and there's constant white lines in the environment 
 while moving. The frame rate is destroyed when you get into a big fight with a bunch of giant crabs, 
 and the aiming system feels like it was designed by a 5 year old with 5 year olds in mind. 
  The sound is crappy and looped, there are two whole music tracks on the whole cart. One is for 
 the normal boring slowly walking around part and the other is another crappy looped fight scene 
 theme. 
  This game has no place inside of anyone's DS, it is a violation of your handheld system and an 
 underestimation of the intelligence of consumers. The game was rushed to the shelves to take advantage 
 of people stupid enough to buy it... which I did, and I really do feel dumb about it. Please, do 
 not be dumb and buy this game... save your money for another game or start storing it away for 
 the Nintendo Revolution for when it comes out next year.

Review:  DS is much weaker graphically than its competitor, the PSP, but has an upper hand in all things 
 innovative, and it makes me sad that developers take the same approach to DS ports of their software 
 as to every other platform, instead of taking any kind of advantage of system's true capabilities.
 
  Peter Jackson's King Kong is another one of UBI hack job DS ports of their big license titles. 
 The game is so flawed, uninspired, and quite frankly, unfinished, it has no business sitting on 
 my desk, staring at me with its menacing looking boxart. Underneath that WETA-designed piece of 
 CG art, however, the game conceals every tell-tale sign of a title rushed to the shelves in time 
 for the blockbuster's release, and more.
  Everything about the game feals so unfinished, one can't help but think that either the developer 
 simply left placeholder elements in, or stuff was just thrown in at the last moment to make the 
 game even half-way presentable.
  From the IPL icon, which is an MS Paint-scribbled "KK", to the cutscene portraits that still have 
 the magenta outlines - a byproduct of recklessly scaled down sprites. The sound effects and music 
 are crackly and over-compressed - possibly a result of last-minute code malfunction that forced 
 the team to get rid of much smaller module tunes in favor of compressed WAVes. The graphics are 
 extremely dark, and low-contrast, making the game almost impossible to play with lights on.
  The first-person gameplay is sluggish and uninspired. Jack (in case you didn't yet know, that's 
 the human protagonists name) , moves excruciatingly slow, or rather, life like. Unfortunately, 
 lifelike walking speed, and an FPS - not a good match! The touch-screen mouse-look might work in 
 Prime-Hunters, but here it is, once again, marred by sluggishness. It takes up to three full finger-across-the-screen 
 swipes just to turn ninety degrees, making any kind of quick reaction to an aural threat cue impossible... 
 Yet the game still throws fast, relentless enemy drones at you from all directions, just to piss 
 you off... And when you aren't fighting drones, you are navigating some dark, boring, maze-like 
 corridors, while solving the same puzzle over, and over, and over again.
  The Kong part.. well... I never made it to the Kong part! The Jack's game is just so bad, I don't 
 think ANYONE will actually see the sidescrolling beat-em-up/platformer starring the huge ape, but 
 from what I've seen so far, I can confidently tell you, it wouldn't be great. OK, maybe, but not 
 great.
  Overall, a very, very poor piece of license software. Save your money for something better.

Review:  I can't believe this game was released for the DS. It plays like a beta version. The graphics are 
 not finished. Ann looks like someone from Resident Evil. While playing, you can tell that this 
 was a rush job. The graphics in the cave are an abomination, with flashes of white lines and outlines 
 constantly appearing. When you start the game, the sound is so bad and tinny, I thought that the 
 speakers on the DS had blown out. They hadn't. And there is no U. S. falg to chhose when starting. 
 Had to settle for choosing the British Flag - what's up with that? This game should be recalled 
 until it is properly finished and then released. What a shame!

Review:  this game is alright the graphics are OK and the gameplay is fast but it gives you a challenge 
 sometimes there aren't a big varity of creatures but enough to get though the game and you can 
 be kong or jack the controls are a little akward at first it like the touch screen controls on 
 metroid prime demo the sounds were alright the music sets the tone when your in danger or about 
 to fight a giant crab or a dinosaur and you yell ANN! when you want the butt-ugly person she moves 
 soooo slow its not even funny and you can hear the footsteps of the crabs and the people and the 
 cutscenes are pretty cool I spent forty bucks on this and it wasn't worth it get a game like Mario 
 kart or Tony hawk those games were made for the DS I say avoid this game.
