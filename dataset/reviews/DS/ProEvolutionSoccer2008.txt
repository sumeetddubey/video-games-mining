Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 is more playable than its predecessor, but it's just as muddled and unimaginative. 
 

  UK REVIEW -- Last year's Pro Evolution Soccer made a poor first showing on the DS, with the simplistic 
 gameplay failing to provide any depth at all. While the 2008 edition plays a slightly better game 
 of football than its predecessor, the rest of the package feels like a mishmash of ideas that once 
 again struggles to capture the essence of the series. The game does offer online multiplayer support 
 and a number of cups and competitions, but the poor team roster, the lackluster graphics, and the 
 average gameplay mean that they fail to be much fun.  

  On the DS, PES 2008 is undeniably ugly, meaning that it's difficult to recognise individual players 
 on the pitch. However, the animation system now bears greater resemblance to the console versions, 
 so players move in a more believable manner than before. Although this means you feel more in control 
 of your players this year, the control system remains simplistic due to the limitations of the 
 hardware. For example, the different running speeds that Pro Evolution veterans will be used to 
 are squeezed onto the one shoulder button on the DS. To sprint, you have to hold down the right 
 shoulder button and tap in the direction you're running. It's also more difficult to perform tricks 
 than in the console versions, although a limited number of moves can be performed by tapping the 
 left shoulder button.            This year's edition of Pro Evolution Soccer doesn't look great 
 or control well.     

  Like in last year's game, you can use the DS's touch-screen controls to adjust tactics midgame. 
 By moving your thumbs to the bottom of the touch screen, you can quickly make your teammates play 
 in a more offensive or defensive formation, something that can be quite useful if you need to change 
 the run of play. You can also use the touch screen to control the camera angles and replay speed 
 after scoring a goal, when the game goes into movie mode. Unfortunately, there's still no option 
 to save edited replays.  

  There are a reasonable number of game modes in PES 2008, including friendly matches, cups, and 
 training. The one thing that's missing is the series' much-loved Master League mode, which lets 
 you both manage and play as your favourite team in other versions of the game. In its place is 
 the World Tour, where you're assigned a random selection of players that you must take through 
 the various tiered cups until you're eventually playing the best teams in the world. While playing 
 with random players is arguably less satisfying than taking control of your favourite team, adapting 
 to an unfamiliar squad does provide an interesting challenge.  

  You can upgrade your team thanks to a strange system of gambling credits. Gold, silver, and blue 
 credits are dished out depending on your performance in each game, and you can then spend these 
 in the game's Gatcha-Get toy machines or traditional fruit machines. Different coins win you different 
 classes of players. Gold coins give you access to the best players, blue coins let you pick from 
 second-tier players, and silver coins get you random players. Once you have players in your squad, 
 you can increase their passing, moving, and tackling abilities in the PES shop. Ultimately, though, 
 it all feels a bit unrealistic and leaves you with very little feeling of attachment to your team. 

  This gambling feature is also completely at odds with the youth-oriented presentation of this year's 
 game. For whatever reason, Konami decided to include a very brightly coloured menu system that 
 features a child mascot explaining the various game modes. There's also a Pokemon-esque collection 
 element to acquiring players, as you can pore over photos and statistics almost as you would with 
 an old-fashioned sticker album. The audio doesn't fare much better. It lacks commentary, and the 
 repetitive, cheesy music does nothing to help the overall presentation.  

  One thing the DS version has in its favour is that, unlike in other versions of the game, the club 
 teams are all officially licensed, meaning that player names and team kits are as they should be. 
 The list is extremely limited, however, with only two teams per major football nation. This means 
 that you get Newcastle and Tottenham from England and Inter and A. C. Milan from Italy, but not 
 Manchester United or Arsenal. On the national side, 57 of the current top-ranked sides are present, 
 and you can unlock classic teams, such as Brazil and England, from the PES shop by winning matches 
 in the world tour. Strangely, the option to edit teams is only available for certain nations. You 
 can keep the United States' team roster updated but not England's, for example.            You 
 can control the replay camera by using the touch screen, but your edits still can't be saved.  
    

  Konami has catered to multiplayer fans with quite a few game modes. With one cartridge, you can 
 play against a friend using wireless game sharing. If you have friends who also own the game, then 
 that number goes up to four players, with two players per team. You can also trade the players 
 you've acquired in World Tour using the DS's wireless connection. PES 2008 also supports online 
 play for two players, and while this is definitely more fun than playing against the AI, it's difficult 
 to find people to play with. You can choose to filter players by location or skill, or by whether 
 they're on your friends list, and if you can find people to play with, performance is solid.  

 
  Pro Evolution Soccer has improved in some minor ways since its last outing on the DS, but Konami 
 has once again failed to take the game forward in any meaningful way. Although the animation system 
 has been tweaked to make it more realistic, the developers are still focussed on re-creating the 
 same Pro Evolution Soccer without adapting the control system to fit the DS hardware. The game 
 needs a serious overhaul, because it suffers from a muddled visual design, poor graphics, and a 
 very small roster of official teams. Fans of the series willing to put up with the simplistic controls 
 may get something out of this version, but most people will find little to love in this muddled 
 handheld port.

Review:  I'm so disappointed!!! I was expecting to be great, but it's the same like its predecessors!
  
  The Bad: -a few club teams
  -the graphics look like Fifa 96 or worse
  -at some points of 
 view, the game looks that it's for younger kids.
  -the same like its predecessors
  -nothing new, maybe Wi-Fi and the Al system
  -some problems with the controls
  -a few tournaments
 
  -no leagues
  
  The Good:
  -all the international teams
  -it has all the players from all the teams in the game
  -a new Al system
  -it has Wi-Fi
  
 -sounds are OK
  -the best in the series of PES on DS
  
  Average: If you are a fan PES and love Nintendo DS, I think you would love this game. If you are 
 a Fifa fan, love nintendo DS and the games which are great made stick with Fifa. If it was after 
 me, I would stick with Fifa. It's way more better than all soccer games I played in my whole life.
