:::Review:::
Underground Pool is a squalid representation of the game of billiards. 

  It's unlikely that anyone would go into a budget- priced handheld pool game and expect the moon 
 from it, but it wouldn't be hard to expect more than what a ramshackle piece of junk like Underground 
 Pool offers up. Shoddy ball physics, useless artificial intelligence, clumsy touch-screen controls, 
 ugly graphics, shrill audio, and a severe lack of modes are just the highlights of what's wrong 
 with this game.  

          Underground Pool: Because people were tired of all those sellout corporate pool games, 
 right? Right...? Hello?     

  Underground Pool offers single game, challenge mode, and multiplayer options. The challenge mode 
 is the closest the game gets to a career mode, but it's really just a scattered collection of tournaments 
 that unlock, of all things, more tournaments. Winning tournaments nets you cash, but the cash doesn't 
 do anything for you, except let you buy into more tournaments down the road. There are no bonus 
 items or new pool gear to purchase -- not even new games to unlock. In fact, Underground Pool offers 
 only two variations of the game of pool: 8-ball and 9-ball. There isn't even an option to futz 
 with the rules of each game.  

  Considering how utterly inept the two included pool variations are, maybe it's for the best that 
 the developers didn't try to shoot for higher sky and add more. For one thing, you might as well 
 just ignore most of the game's touch-screen functions. The game lets you rotate the pool cue around 
 the table with the stylus, but it's generally easier and less flustering to do it with the D pad. 
 Tapping on the cue when it's positioned at the top or bottom of the screen often results in no 
 response whatsoever. The one thing the touch screen is useful for is setting power for your shot, 
 but even this mechanic is flawed because the game doesn't use an intuitive power meter. It's just 
 a stick that you move up and down to determine how far back the pool cue is from the cue ball. 
 While that might seem easy enough, there are times in this game when seemingly small amounts of 
 power send balls flying every which way, so any measure of predictability is absent here. It probably 
 has at least something to do with the game's oddball physics. There's a bit of weightiness to the 
 balls on the table, but they seem too light overall, bouncing much more wildly than real pool balls 
 do.  

  Another huge flaw is that the camera system makes lining up proper shots nearly impossible. You 
 can float between a few different camera angles, but only one of them lets you properly line up 
 with a ball on the table, and even then, it's tough to gauge whether the angles you're taking are 
 beneficial or not. Again, part of the issue is the weird physics model, but it's tough to make 
 much headway with these awful camera angles, especially when the on-the-table angle can't deal 
 with your cue ball being near the edge of the table and obscures your view of practically everything. 

  That the AI opponents are basically idiots does ease some of the challenge presented by the lame 
 camera and broken controls. These invisible dolts repeatedly screw up seemingly easy shots. Even 
 when all they have to do is hit the side of a slightly blocked ball to avoid a foul, they still 
 can't pull it together. The Black Widow these players are not.  

          There are exactly a million different ways to play the game of pool that are better than 
 this one. We know. We did the math.     

  On top of everything else, Underground Pool looks and sounds awful, which is sad considering that 
 the graphics are probably the least offensive part of the game. The game does include several different 
 tables and club backgrounds, but none of them are pleasant to look at. The tables look kind of 
 grainy and blurry, and you can barely see the club backgrounds, save for quick looks now and again. 
 The audio is probably the game's worst feature. The ball-clacking noises sound weirdly tinny and 
 compressed, and the soundtrack consists of some of the most gratingly terrible MIDI you can imagine. 
 It's not even music. It's a 5-year-old with hooks for hands slamming wildly on random keys on a 
 MIDI keyboard. Horrific stuff.  

  Whether or not you're a pool enthusiast, Underground Pool is not the game for you. The single-player 
 game is pointless and severely not fun to play, the multiplayer game isn't any better (and requires 
 multiple carts -- there's no download play) , and the whole game is presented poorly. Go plop down 
 $20 at a local pool hall, and leave this hunk of junk on the shelf.

Review:  The physics of this game reminded me of mini-pool more than actual billiards. That is, the balls 
 are small and light-weight, which makes it difficult to judge the strength of your shots. If you've 
 ever played on those order-by-mail tables for mini-pool, then you might be able to get the hang 
 of the accelerated gameplay. 
  
  Don't get the Gamespot reviewers wrong... It's easy enough to make your combination shots, but 
 you'll have to painstakingly line up every other shot. Unfortunately, as they say, the touch screen 
 controls does not work towards the edges of the screen. If only these billiards games would make 
 the inputs small enough, in order to line up shots without repeatedly tapping back and forth on 
 the d-pad!
  
  The computer opponent seems only able to make two kinds of shots, which compensates for your lack 
 of control. It's best to take each shot from the first-person perspective, and take some time to 
 figure out the strength of your shot. Once you get the hang of this, the game provides a decent 
 fix for pool players.
  
  I think this game was developed by a bad company, but its good enough to play on the go.
