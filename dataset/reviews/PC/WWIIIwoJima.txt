:::Review:::
Ultimately, WWII Iwo Jima is a short game that is almost an insult to one of the greatest military 
 campaigns forged by the United States. 

  To say that ValuSoft's WWII Iwo Jima is better than the company's two previous budget-priced and 
 war-themed first-person shooters -- WWII Normandy and Vietnam 2: Special Assignment -- would be true. 
 It also wouldn't be saying much at all. Like its predecessors, WWII Iwo Jima is a budget game that 
 attempts to re-create one of the United States' memorable wars, but it falls well short of doing 
 so because of its length, elementary graphics, horrid AI, and otherwise poor gameplay.         
   Some of the enemies will stand perfectly still until you shoot them.    

  The game plays like any other first-person shooter, but it does have the somewhat unique ability 
 of letting you control up to three other US Marines during most of the game's 12 levels. But your 
 squadmates behave less like US Marines and more like your own personal meat-shields. The orders 
 that you issue them are simple ones, and they include defending a position and attacking an enemy. 
 However, they'll mostly just follow you around, shoot at anything that moves, and get shot at. 
 Sometimes they'll even walk right in front of you the second you fire your bazooka. Had WWII Iwo 
 Jima been released six years ago, this level of AI might have been considered revolutionary, but 
 today, it's simply a very bad implementation of squad-based gameplay. The Japanese enemy soldiers 
 aren't much smarter either. For the most part, they'll walk straight at you until you or your squadmates 
 cut them down. Those who don't will often just sit perfectly still, even if you're clearly standing 
 right in front of them. And even though there is a whopping total of four varieties of enemy -- one 
 with a pistol, another with a rifle, a third with a machine gun, and a grenade-carrying soldier -- they 
 all behave in the exact same manner.   

  The game's graphics are a little better than those in WWII Normandy and Vietnam 2, but not by much. 
 WWII Iwo Jima is "powered" by the LithTech engine, although at times it seems that the engine can 
 use a tune-up. The level design is unimpressive and is replete with muddy textures and horrible 
 sprite-based trees. Additionally the levels themselves are small, and most can be finished in a 
 handful of minutes. Likewise, the US and Japanese soldier models in the game are pretty simple 
 and clearly don't boast as many polygons as you'd expect in a typical first-person shooter. There 
 are absolutely no vehicles in the game, even though the box art clearly depicts a tank, and some 
 of the weapons are ripped straight from WWII Normandy.           The levels are largely bland and 
 make use of low-quality textures.    

  The sound of these weapons firing in the game seems somewhat muted, if not generic. And even though 
 each of the 10 weapons does sound different, it's hard to imagine that the dinky noise emitted 
 by them is what their real-world equivalents sound like. When shot by these weapons, all the enemies 
 in the game will scream one of three things, one of which sounds like Japanese for "thank you." 
 Your squadmates, on the other hand, will simply grunt. Interestingly enough, there is a well-done 
 soundtrack that accompanies each mission, although it does seem somewhat out of place in Iwo Jima. 
   

  There are no multiplayer modes of any kind in the game, and you probably won't want to replay the 
 single-player campaign after you finish it, which takes less than three hours. Perhaps one year 
 ago, the mere fact that games like this sold for under $20 was value enough, but after the release 
 of Serious Sam, these so-called budget games need to be held against a different standard. Ultimately, 
 WWII Iwo Jima is a short game that is almost an insult to one of the greatest military campaigns 
 forged by the United States. If you want a first-person shooter for less than the price of a pizza, 
 buy Serious Sam. If you want to relive the events of World War II, watch the History Channel.

Review:  Budget titles arent supposed to have all of the flash and finesse of those projects that are produced 
 by huge, well-funded teams of l33t designers led by a rocket scientist wunderkind. As long as I 
 kept that simple rule in mind, I actually derived some basic enjoyment from WWII: Iwo Jima. Sure, 
 the games mechanics are unbalanced and both friendly and enemy AI are driven only by a reactive 
 line-of-sight response. The environmental details are simple and far from impressive, as they consist 
 mostly of flat terrain cut into sections by repeating wall textures painted up to look like foliage. 
 Dialogue and sound effects are scarce and repetitive.
  
  The above shortcomings are, in my mind, primarily the result of a lack of experience and resources 
 on the part of Iwo Jimas designers. I dont know whether any of the games creators went on to 
 bigger and more prestigious projects  3LV Games as a whole apparently switched to address and 
 barcode label production as a living in 2002 -- but this title feels like a practice run, of sorts, 
 that actually turned out to have some playability. In this age of free mods and jaded players, 
 however, charging any amount of money in exchange for low expectations is a questionable approach 
 to learning the ropes.
  
  Whats to like about WWII: Iwo Jima? The inclusion of a tiny squad of compatriots was a nice touch, 
 even though they werent particularly useful. On a few occasions, the team came together for an 
 effective ambush or pinged a few lucky shots to help thin out a herd of attackers. A limited ammo 
 supply added to the games challenge somewhat, although the last two levels required a ludicrous 
 amount of conservation; I got the feeling that I was supposed to rely on my squadmates more by 
 then, having miraculously kept them alive through the first several incursions. Some levels were 
 designed well enough for some basic run-and-gun fun, although realistic tactics like sticking to 
 cover or sneaking over to a more advantageous position werent in the cards. As I mentioned, the 
 enemy soldiers were dumb enough that I could often lure them into a trap, which is always satisfying. 
 I enjoyed the prison break on Kwajalein Atoll if only for the large-scale slaughter on that islands 
 minefield near the levels conclusion.
  
  The benefits derived from a quick lazy afternoon playthrough of Iwo Jima are heavily outweighed 
 by the fact that the games combat mechanics and special effects were woefully dated even upon 
 the titles release in 2001. I indulged in one last round of island-hopping over the summer before 
 putting the disc away for good. As much as I can appreciate the apparent dedication that WWII: 
 Iwo Jimas designers invested in their little creation, the end result was only moderately entertaining.

Review:  Ok, instead of giving a reveiw focusing on the good parts of the game, im going to tell about the 
 bad points:
  
  You can use a flamethrower under water
  
  You can light a teammate on fire and they just crouch there, shooting.
  
  Some enemies don't 
 fire until you do
  
  The world ends aruptly, no invisable barrier or anything, you can actually see the end of the world. 
 (Not a blowing the world, I mean the world is flat.)
  
  The graphics make you want to throw up
  
  
  
  Oh, I almost forgot, there is one good thing 
 about Iwo Jima. The Menu. The menu features an 'Exit' button.
