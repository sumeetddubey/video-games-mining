:::Review:::
The best thing you can say about its poor graphics and sound is that they weren't wasted on an otherwise 
 great game. 

 The original Extreme Paintbrawl was generally considered  one of the worst games of the year  when 
 it was released in 1998. So we were surprised to find out that although it's four years later, 
 someone decided it would be a good idea to produce a fourth Extreme Paintbrawl game. But we weren't 
 the least bit surprised to find out that this game, like the original, is terrible.           Extreme 
 Paintbrawl 4 really isn't much fun.    

 Extreme Paintbrawl 4 is based on the sport of paintball -- an exciting game in which real human beings 
 get up from their computers, head out to a paintball range, usually a large outdoor area, divvy 
 themselves up into teams, then shoot at each other with special guns that launch balls of compressed 
 paint. If you get hit, you'll be splattered with paint, and you're considered to be "dead," or 
 out of the match. Though it's a less-than-accurate simulation of real-life military operations, 
 it can be good exercise and great fun. Yet somehow, Extreme Paintbrawl 4 manages to capture all 
 of the aspects of paintballing that  aren't  fun, and none of the good ones.   

  For starters, Extreme Paintbrawl 4 looks really bad. The game only has one character model -- a guy 
 wearing a helmet and a jumpsuit. It's what you look like, it's what your teammates and opponents 
 look like, and it's blocky and stiffly animated. Extreme Paintbrawl 4's dozen different levels, 
 which range from a snowy field to a movie theater to a dingy prison, all have a rough look to them. 
 Also, many of the indoor levels are extremely dark and difficult to see in. And though some of 
 the game's different areas look decent enough, others have crude, ugly, simplistic textures that 
 look terrible. Each of these areas' different features and objects, like trees, movie theater seats, 
 and latrines are all instantly recognizable for what they are, but they don't look very good.  

  Extreme Paintbrawl 4 doesn't sound too great, either. You can barely hear most of the game's sound 
 effects -- when paintballs are fired, and when they hit home, they sound more like spitballs than 
 anything else. And even though you might expect players to storm down ramps and down corridors, 
 you can barely hear the sound of footfalls in the game. For some reason, Extreme Paintbrawl 4 lets 
 you run, walk, or "sneak," but since running doesn't make much noise, it makes no sense to do anything 
 other than run all the time. Extreme Paintbrawl is modeled after an exciting pastime, so you might 
 expect to hear lots of excited, breathless chatter from your teammates and opponents. Instead, 
 all you'll hear is an occasional grunt and, whenever you or anyone else gets tagged, about two 
 or three variations of a guy saying "I'm out," or "Hit." These unexciting sounds don't seem to 
 fit with the game's loud, guitar-wailing soundtrack, which might've helped provide some real atmosphere 
 in a different game -- one that doesn't have blocky stick figures alternately running around or standing 
 stock-still, raising their hands while dispiritedly saying "Hit."   

  The best thing you can say about the game's poor graphics and sound is that they weren't wasted 
 on an otherwise great game. Extreme Paintbrawl 4 doesn't have the kind of fast-paced, arcade-style 
 pacing of a traditional first-person shooter like Unreal Tournament, nor does it have any of the 
 interesting tactics of a real-world shooter. It plays something like an unrealistic arcade shooter 
 in which you have a single, frustratingly weak weapon and are teamed up with fairly dumb computer-controlled 
 teammates. Most of the game's weapons shoot minuscule paintballs that float and whiff like spitballs -- you 
 can upgrade your weapon to a larger, more-powerful paintball gun, but although this can help by 
 increasing your rate of fire and accuracy, it also gets bigger onscreen, and blocks more of your 
 view. This problem is made worse by the fact that Extreme Paintbrawl 4's guns don't actually have 
 a heads-up display to help you target your opponents, presumably to help make the game seem more 
 realistic, though this makes the game a lot more frustrating than it should be. The game also has 
 excruciatingly long weapon reload times, another "realistic" feature that sometimes causes you 
 to run out of ammo just as the game is getting interesting, forcing you to duck out of a confrontation 
 and wait several seconds until you've reloaded.           Nobody actually plays this game in multiplayer. 
    

 You can play Extreme Paintbrawl 4 in a quick skirmish mode on any of the game's 12 maps, or in tournament 
 mode, in which you draft a set of teammates and play through different matches in search of cash 
 to recruit better teammates and buy better gear. You also have to make sure you buy enough ammo, 
 because if you don't, you'll be a sitting duck. Your teammates in both skirmish and tournament 
 mode just aren't reliable -- very rarely, they'll fan out and win an entire match for you before 
 you can even find your enemies, but more often, they'll block your path in a narrow corridor and 
 may even accidentally shoot you. There's no way to set any kind of behavior patterns for your teammates, 
 or give them any orders. Just like there's no way to adjust your mouse sensitivity past "medium/fast" 
 or "fast" to be able to turn quickly, there's no way to accurately draw a bead on your opponents, 
 and there's no way to make Extreme Paintbrawl 4 enjoyable. You might conceivably find more of a 
 challenge in multiplayer, except that no one plays Extreme Paintbrawl 4 in multiplayer.   

  It almost seems like the developers missed the point: there are certain liberties you can take 
 with real-world conventions to make a game fun -- Extreme Paintbrawl 4 doesn't really take any of 
 them, and instead keeps most of the unenjoyable stuff in. If you're really looking for a good game 
 of paintball -- get up from your computer, rustle up some friends, and go outside.

Review:  I think this game, despite the annoying music and graphics, is not bad at all. You get the fun 
 of a FPS without worrying about taking damage from falls, worrying about killing teammates, etc.. 
 the only down side other than the hard to navigate levels, poor graphics and music is that the 
 game is pretty much dead.. I played this game a long time ago and there was a decent bit of folks 
 online, its just dead now.. and its a shame. this has alot of online fun to it and its not a pricy 
 purchase. I do reccomend buying it and giving it a shot, its not as bad as everyone things it is, 
 and theres a good bit of fun to it.

Review:  Okay I used to have it, sadly I cant find that many places to buy it from, but you can get it off 
 of amazon. com, great game if you like paintball, you should like this 
  game,
  
  People put a lot of work into it, so please don't say it's terrible. Its just to bad you can't 
 download it for free. "Sigh" I personally play Paintball so maybe its just me but I don't think 
 so.
  
  Overall I thinks if you play paintball you should get a kick out of this game.
  
  But if you are not a Paintballer you may not like this game at all.
  
  
  Graphics not 
 the best but still okay
  
  Sound umm pretty good
  
  Gameplay fun
  
  My tilt superb
  
  Go out and buy this game, and have fun :-}

Review:  I Love this game! I maybe a bit simple when it comes to gaming and love first person shooters, 
 and this game was cool, the graphics were smooth, the track was good and all of that kind of thing 
 IS adjustable, Loud sound with awesome sound effects, detailed graphics, nice range of guns, (a 
 bit limited in my opinion) Cool player profiles, lot of functions and realism, like CO2 cannisters 
 that effect game play.
  
  The tornoment mode, is one of the best ways to build up tactics and understand the game. I have 
 to admit, it get difficult using the whole keyboard for different mernovers. You only have enough 
 money for a basic gun, so the challenge really starts up.
  
  I hope people buy this game and like it, even if it does take a while, stick with it. And you'll 
 have a lot of fun.
  
  Although contradicting in stuff in the first review, i believe that with 5 minutes with this game 
 will get you hooked.
