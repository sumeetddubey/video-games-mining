:::Review:::
It's simple to an extreme, but there's at least one amazing moment in each track that will keep 
 your engine revving to the next. 

 In the early days of electronic entertainment, going way back to the reign of the Atari 2600, game 
 designers would often build games around new technology - they would simply figure out a new little 
 trick the machine could perform and design a game to utilize it. For example, the 2600 classic 
 Yar's Revenge was reportedly designed after the discovery that the 2600 would allow color cycling. 
 The modern adaptation of this "new trick = new game" formula came shortly after the advent of the 
 CD-ROM, when numerous sub-par games flooded store shelves, hyping their CD-ROM status and hoping 
 to catch hardware pioneers unawares.  

 Ubi Soft's POD seems to have been the brainchild of the same mentality: Take a brand-new technology 
 (this time MMX) , and throw a simple game around it. The game in this case is a simple arcade racing 
 game - and despite a few design problems, it's pretty fun, as far as simple arcade racing games 
 go.   

 Visually, POD is often incredible. The frame rate with an MMX processor (which is recommended, though 
 the game will run on a Pentium-120) is great, and with a 3Dfx compatible card, it's even better. 
 The only noticeable hitch is some slight horizon warping when turning too quickly. But there are 
 some visual inconsistencies that run throughout - resulting in some confusing tracks. Each track 
 was seemingly designed with a limited color palette, leading to some serious inconsistencies in 
 quality. Some will make your jaw drop with their beauty (such as the deep blue sky and ominous 
 gray briars found in Hq) , while others are truly difficult to look at (such as the puce-magenta 
 swirled track of Nuke) . A more serious problem associated with this inconsistency is that maneuvering 
 the tracks can be a perplexing ordeal. You'll barrel around a turn and everything onscreen will 
 blend together, making it hard to discern exactly where the track is going.  

 The tracks themselves are inventive - filled with innovative little twists that keep the action 
 interesting. Some have you switching back along the same stretch of road, constantly avoiding head-on 
 collisions with your opponents. Others send you over jump after jump and turn after turn like an 
 out-of-control roller coaster. And, to their credit, the designers never seem to get too content 
 with one style; each track throws some new environmental challenge your way.  

 The control is extremely different between exterior and interior views - the latter is excellent, 
 the former is laughable. And during a championship, you can only save after every fourth race (though 
 you're never told this, so it appears as if there's just this big, useless "Save Game" button taunting 
 you after every race, and the lack of any documentation only makes things more confusing) . POD 
 is pretty fun once you learn to cope with its quirks, and it's a great value, with new tracks and 
 cars being uploaded to Ubi Soft's web site on a regular basis. It's simple to an extreme, but there's 
 at least one amazing moment in each track that will keep your engine revving to the next.

Review:  Simple premise, race with futuristic cars on another planet. Very beautiful and depressing setting. 
 Graphics are good, even for this day, though they were very very good when the game was released. 
 The handling of the cars is just fun, no other way to say it. There are a few different ways to 
 play each race, including with or without damage to your car. You can change the camera view, though 
 there is no in cockpit view. There are few good ones though. There are plenty of races and you 
 can download more (and more cars) . I finished the campaign story mode years ago but still play 
 it (even the same day I finished it) cause it is so satisfying to play this game.
  
  There are ways to make the game run under XP (I have) so give it a try. If you find it, buy it!

Review:  Not only did this game introduce me into the world of racing games, it also showed me that you 
 can race sci-fi cars around the ancient city of Pompei. i won every single race on this game, but 
 i could still play it every second of my life if i had it. I wish they would re release this game 
 for windows xp. If anyoine has an old computer and is thinking of having this game, you should 
 def. get it cuz it is just the greatest game of all time....... so you should all go out and get 
 yourself a copy of Pod, cuz it is shibby!
