Micro Machines 2 hearkens back to a kinder, gentler era of electronic entertainment. 

 Micro Machines 2 hearkens back to a kinder, gentler era of electronic entertainment. With simple 
 controls and intense gameplay, it offers a fast, fun, and addictive experience reminiscent of the 
 best video games of the late 1980's.   

 This is a pure racing game, where up to four miniature vehicles careen around high-speed tracks. 
 The off-beat courses are set in familiar but exotic locations, from a kitchen countertop to a pool 
 table to a toilet seat. Each track is laced with predictable hazardsjumps, oil slicks, and 
 hairpin turnsin addition to more unusual obstacles, ranging from forks and drillbits to slices 
 of carrot and pieces of toast.   

 You can start playing Micro Machines the moment you boot it up. There are only three controls that 
 matter (turn left, turn right, and accelerate) , and using them is completely intuitive. But learning 
 the controls and mastering them are two different things; it takes many hours of practice to perfect 
 the bumping and sliding techniques necessary for victory, and longer still to discover the subtle 
 intricacies of Micro Machines 2's dozens of tracks.   

 But discover them you will, as Micro Machines 2 is thoroughly addictive. Races are short, intense 
 affairs, made more so by the dirty tricks squad otherwise known as the computer-controlled cars. 
 These little guys are downright nastyone bursts out to an insurmountable lead, while the 
 other two nitpick you to death; a bump here, a nudge there, and next thing you know you're falling 
 off a corn-on-the-cob bridge into oblivion.   

 The action gets more intense when you put a human opponent or two on the track, although it would 
 be even better if Micro Machines 2 included network support rather than forcing multiple players 
 to crowd around a single machine. (In my book, three pairs of hands on a keyboard is two too many.) 

 While the gameplay is excellent, other aspects of Micro Machines 2 are less inspiring. The graphics 
 are clean and sharp, but totally lack the wow factor of cutting-edge competitors. The 
 CD-audio background music is rockin' but repetitive, and the spot sound effects are too subdued 
 to be noticeable. The addition of a track construction set is nice, but really, with over 100 prefab 
 courses included on the disc, who needs it?  

 Still, in today's world of bloated productions and derivative design, titles that can stand on the 
 strength of their gameplay alone are something of a rare commodity. Micro Machines 2 is that kind 
 of game, and for that reason alone, it deserves a look from action racing fans.
