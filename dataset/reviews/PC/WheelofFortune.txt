This is a game where the only reward is winning money and prizes. Imagining money and prizes is 
 just not the same. 

 Wheel of Fortune is one of America's most popular game shows. It's easy to see why. There's little 
 or no skill involved, and your fate is usually decided by the spin of the giant wheel. Pat Sajak 
 and Vanna White have become household names from sea to shining sea. Zillions of hapless Americans 
 tune in regularly to see who will walk away with the brand-new car, luxury vacation, or fabulous 
 yacht.  

 The premise of the game is simple. You try to guess a person, place, or thing by choosing consonants 
 and buying vowels. If you're lucky, your spin of the wheel lands you on a dollar amount (ranging 
 from $250 to $10,000) . If you choose a consonant that's in the mystery phrase, you get the dollar 
 amount you spun multiplied by the number of occurrences in the phrase. For example, let's say you 
 spun $500 and picked the letter T. The mystery phrase has four Ts, so you get $2,000. Vowels are 
 purchased at $250 a pop. The wheel is also loaded with Bankrupts, Lose a Turns, and Surprises. 
 If your letter guess isn't in the phrase, the wheel passes to the next player.  

 The trick of the game is to figure out what the phrase is quickly, then keep spinning until the 
 last possible moment. This strategy of sorts works well, unless you happen to land on a Bankrupt 
 or Lose a Turn. All this activity and puzzle solving sounds exciting, right? And it is, if you 
 happen to be playing the game in the Sony Studios and actually have a chance at winning money or 
 a prize. It's less fun watching it on TV at home; but there's still some drama and excitement, 
 wondering what each player will do and, of course, solving the puzzle before any of the morons 
 on TV can.  

 Although there doesn't seem to be a compelling reason to bring a game show like this to the PC, 
 Hasbro will definitely have an audience amongst people who dream of being part of the action of 
 a big-money American game show. But beyond that, what does this game really offer?  

 The game sets out right from the get-go to be as much like the TV show as possible. An emcee asks 
 you simple questions to get you started and puts you in control of the wheel. That vicarious thrill 
 alone will sell hundreds if not thousands of copies of this game. Not to mention the appearance 
 of the one-and-only Vanna White as the show's host. Hasbro has cleverly integrated her FMV image 
 dialogue into the show. Of course, at times, it's totally silly (there's this smiling clapping 
 thing she does that pops up randomly that's just hilarious) . But the dialogue and mannerisms are 
 exactly as they are on the TV show (I watched it a few times just to make sure) . It's the lack 
 of human interaction that makes her appear so much sillier on the PC.  

 The point of view also changes constantly. Since I'm not a regular viewer of the TV show (really, 
 I'm not) , I found this irritating in the extreme. After watching a few shows, however, I realized 
 this effect mimics the changing points of view on the set in an attempt - I'm guessing - to elevate 
 the level of excitement (sort of like that weird hopping camera on NYPD Blue makes it seem more 
 "real") . Another problem was that the mouse pointer used to select letters was slow, clunky, and 
 often jumped around the screen in an alarming manner. I made many incorrect guesses and was chastised 
 by Vanna for wasting time because I couldn't get my mouse pointer to simmer down and behave.  

 
 The first few games, I played against two computer opponents. Right from the start, I got the general 
 impression that the computer-generated players were having a lot more fun than I was. ("Come on, 
 baby! Big money! Big money!") The game isn't even smart enough to give these poor hapless ghosts 
 in my machine names. But when Computer Player 1 won the fantasy prize - an African ballooning safari 
 - I had no doubt that she was soaring the skies of the Serengeti somewhere between my hard drive 
 and my motherboard. I, on the other hand, could only imagine going on the luxury cruise I won and 
 paddling my antique wood canoe in a pond that looked like it belonged in one of those bottled water 
 ads.  

 The big problem I had with my exuberant opponents was that, unless I was in control of the wheel, 
 I spent a lot of time watching my AI counterparts playing, guessing, spinning, and winning. Then, 
 I wised up and played against myself (under assumed names, of course) . But I have to say, the game 
 soon palled. The mystery phrases were so simple, even I could guess them with only a few letters 
 showing. I totally realize that the object of the game isn't really to guess some difficult phrase 
 or use my brain in any way. The mystery phrase is just a vehicle of suspense for the greedy players. 

 But the worst part of Wheel of Fortune was the lack of reward. This is a game where the only reward 
 is winning money and prizes. Imagining money and prizes is just not the same. Even watching other 
 real live people win money and prizes on TV was better than imagining how I would spend my imaginary 
 $50,000 while driving my imaginary Land Rover. Another couple of games, and I'm cracking my computer 
 case to join Computer Player 1 on her African ballooning safari.
