:::Review:::
Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX can be fun, but the occasional problems with the graphics and collision 
 detection can quickly become a source of unnecessary frustration. 

 It's common for game developers to borrow ideas from other popular games - in hopes that their own 
 game receives the same kind of widespread success. Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX represents Acclaim's 
 attempt to cash in on the extreme sports phenomenon started by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and, as 
 a result, the basic game mechanics should seem very familiar to fans of the skateboarding game. 
 To its credit, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX introduces some new elements to the extreme sports subgenre. 
 Unfortunately, the game has a number of both major and minor flaws.   

  Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX's options are typical of an extreme sports game. The proquest mode is 
 essentially a career mode that lets you select from a lineup of the world's best BMX freestylists 
 to play as. It also lets you earn new sponsored clothing, new levels, and new bikes. Each track 
 has a series of objectives that start at an amateur difficulty level and then steadily increase 
 in difficulty after you complete them. In fact, the default bike just isn't good enough for accomplishing 
 some of the later, more difficult objectives, so there is substantial incentive for obtaining faster 
 and more maneuverable bikes. Even so, the proquest mode may be a little too easy for extreme sports 
 veterans, since the game visibly highlights the obstacles associated with objectives you need to 
 complete. However, this should be a welcome feature for those who are new to the genre. The game's 
 two remaining modes - freeride and session - are practice modes in which you can race around on 
 a track, with or without a time limit. Unfortunately, these modes are mostly worthless for practicing 
 in, since some tracks - particularly the backyard pools area - constantly change as new areas open 
 up and as you complete more objectives.   

  The gameplay in Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX is solid, if perhaps lacking in originality. Just as in 
 Tony Hawk, pressing a series of button combinations makes you perform tricks on your bike. The 
 more complicated your combination is, the more points you receive. Unfortunately, even executing 
 the simplest trick isn't as easy as it should be. The first problem is that when you're facing 
 the camera, you have to press "up" to turn your bike around. In theory, it's the ideal way to address 
 camera problems, but in practice, the sluggish controls really prevent this maneuver from being 
 useful. Another minor problem is the game's collision detection. Most of the time, it's easy to 
 judge your distance from the ground or from an obstacle, which makes trick execution ideal. However, 
 there are times when your bike seems to clearly miss an obstacle, but you'll still crash as though 
 you ran right into it. The inconsistent collision detection also becomes a problem when you attempt 
 to perform grinds - sometimes your bike can connect with an obstacle from an unrealistic distance, 
 and other times, you need to be very precise and land right on the object you want to grind.   
 

  Visually, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX is on par with other multiplatform ports of extreme sports games. 
 A few impressive textures appear here and there, like on the various riders' helmets, but the rest 
 of them are fairly bland and pixelated. The bike rider models are not incredibly detailed, but 
 there are enough subtle differences to help you recognize the differences among each of the riders. 
 Oddly enough, even though the various environments and the character models are essentially taken 
 straight from the PlayStation version of the game, slowdown and drops in frame rate can still be 
 a major problem in areas with numerous objects. The slowdown usually dissipates after a second 
 or two, but it can affect gameplay, especially if you want to perform a complicated trick in a 
 detailed area during the last seconds of the round. The game has plenty of other small visual problems 
 as well, like the crash animations. Since there are no pre-scripted crash animations, your rider 
 will just go flying like a limp rag doll whenever you hit something. It's humorous at times; however, 
 it's generally very awkward and unrealistic.   

  Other than the proquest mode, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX doesn't have much else to offer. There are 
 no multiplayer modes, which is unfortunate since most of the latest extreme sports games have found 
 ways to incorporate different types of multiplayer modes, either online or on a single computer. 
 In the end, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX can be fun, but the occasional problems with the graphics 
 and collision detection can quickly become a source of unnecessary frustration.

Review:  Dave Mirra is quite a good game, it could have been better. The bikes and players in the game are 
 cool. The levels are exciting. I have finished the game about 5 times now, so now I am getting 
 really board of this game, but for some one who does not have experience in the game, I think they 
 should try it. I have finished the game with Dave Mirra and I unlocked most of the things you can 
 unlock in this game. Recently I leant this game to my friend and he seemed to have liked it, he 
 had a single trick that game more 20000 points.
