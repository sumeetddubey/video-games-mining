:::Review:::
Shapo Gold takes points from other puzzle games and hangs them in the balance. 

  If you're looking for an interesting twist on the classic block-based puzzle challenge, Shapo Gold 
 just might be the game for you. In the game, you're tasked with either creating lines of colored 
 balls, or filling up an oddly shaped area with balls. The twist here is that you're also responsible 
 for making sure that the playing field stays level, as each ball is worth a certain amount of weight. 
 But if you place too much weight on one side, the board will tip over. While the game certainly 
 takes its cues from other puzzle games, it offers enough of a twist to keep puzzle fans happy.
