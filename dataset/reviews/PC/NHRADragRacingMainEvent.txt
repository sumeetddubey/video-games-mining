NHRA Drag Racing Main Event crams an incredible amount of drag racing action into a budget game. 
 

 It's not surprising that NHRA Drag Racing Main Event looks a lot like 1998's mediocre NHRA Drag 
 Racing -- it was developed by Moto 1, which, back when it was called Motorsims, acquired NHRA Drag 
 Racing developer Tantrum Entertainment. But while Main Event shares a few of the problems of its 
 forebear (particularly in its interface) , it delivers much more enjoyment and excitement, as well 
 as a very good all-around drag racing experience.           NHRA Drag Racing Main Event looks good 
 and plays well.    

  NHRA Drag Racing Main Event crams an incredible amount of drag racing action into a budget game. 
 In fact, it's actually two games bundled together -- NHRA Drag Racing Gold and NHRA Pro Stock Cars 
 and Trucks. Nearly 60 NHRA drivers are featured from four categories -- top fuel dragster, funny 
 car, pro stock, and pro stock truck -- including luminaries such as John Force, Kenny Bernstein, 
 Bob Panella, Warren Johnson, and the now-retired Joe Amato, to name just a few. Twenty-seven tracks 
 are featured (21 if you don't count redundant versions) , and while the 2D models of crew members 
 are a bit crude, the track textures and car graphics are quite good overall. The smoke and flame 
 effects are especially satisfying, though these can put a major hurt on the game's frame rates 
 on lower-end systems.  

  This is NHRA Championship Drag Racing, so you won't find bracket racing here -- just straight-up 
 action in head-to-head matches, single events, and a 25-event NHRA season in which you earn prize 
 money to offset racing costs. (The track list was apparently based on the 2000 season, since several 
 venues from this season are not available.) In both games, you can choose from novice, arcade, 
 or full difficulty settings. Novice is almost worthless since it puts you already staged at the 
 start line -- the only things you've got to do are pick a good crew chief to turn your car and have 
 a good reaction time. You can't tune your ride in arcade mode either, but at least you can perform 
 a burnout and stage the car yourself, as you can in full mode. Full mode also lets you make engine 
 and chassis adjustments.  

  Just as in NHRA Drag Racing, you don't have a lot of things to tweak in the pit, but the game is 
 so poorly documented that only a gearhead with a PhD could understand the manual. Take the clutch 
 settings, for instance. The manual says these are "probably the most important parameter of the 
 whole car" and then launches into an explanation that can leave your head spinning. Maybe some 
 people can readily understand that "the combination of the spring preload, the centrifugal weights, 
 and the coefficient of friction of the clutch plates determine a line of torque vs. speed that 
 the clutch will be locked or slipping," but even so, there should be a more down-to-earth way to 
 guide users through car setup. In the end, you may find that trial-and-error adjustments work best. 

  The interface, which borrows heavily from NHRA Drag Racing, can be a bit frustrating too. To return 
 to the main menu after a race, for instance, you have to choose "race mode" and then go back two 
 more menus. Selecting a track for a single event is similarly obtuse -- after choosing a rack from 
 the list, you go back to the previous menu instead of continuing on to the pits. There's no way 
 to pause or even quit a race once you've staged -- a real bummer when the phone rings and your opponent 
 hasn't even pre-staged yet.  

  The game's force feedback support is quite good, but be forewarned: Unless you want to know what 
 it's like to  really  wrestle with a 7000 horsepower beast, you should knock the settings down 
 quite a bit. The effects aren't nearly as brutal in the pro stock and pro stock truck races, and 
 you may even prefer controlling the game using a stick, which would likely make it much easier 
 to keep your cars from getting out of shape.  

          It's a bargain for fans of drag racing.     

  While the pro stock truck division may 
 not be as interesting, the action in the other three divisions offers enough fun in single-player 
 mode to make NHRA Drag Racing Main Event a bargain. Still, drag racing against computer opponents, 
 even if they are named Force and Bernstein, can draw you back only so many times. That's where 
 the Moto1. net comes in: Just head to the Web site and set up a free account and in no time, you'll 
 be putting your engine-tweaking and driving skills on the line against other players. The multiplayer 
 interface can use a little polish -- there's no way to actually watch anyone else racing (you do 
 see full results as they take place, however) , the waits before races can be rather long, and your 
 wins are tracked only during a single log-in session. Even so, the opportunity to square off against 
 human opponents for free gives the game a much longer play life than you'd probably expect from 
 a drag racing sim.  

  In the end, NHRA Drag Racing won't convert anyone who doesn't like drag racing. But those who enjoy 
 the sport will find a lot to like here -- and at a price that practically no one can refuse. And 
 that's a hard combination to beat.
