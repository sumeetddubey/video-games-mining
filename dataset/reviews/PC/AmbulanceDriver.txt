:::Review:::
Ambulance Driver is a horrible mistake of a game that should never have been made. 

 To put it bluntly, ValuSoft's Crisis Team: Ambulance Driver is the worst game so far this year, 
 and it's one of the worst games we've seen in a long, long time. If you were checking this review 
 just to find out whether you should buy this game, the answer is no. Move on to a better game. 
 If you're actually wondering what makes it so terrible, read on.           Ambulance Driver is 
 like Crazy Taxi from 1999 but is much, much worse.    

  Ambulance Driver is a budget-priced driving game that shamelessly steals its basic ideas from Sega's 
 1999 arcade game, Crazy Taxi, which was later ported to the Dreamcast in 2000. Crazy Taxi was a 
 simple, fun racing game in which you played as a cab driver who drove through the streets of a 
 large, colorful city, picked up passengers, and had to drive them to their destinations within 
 a certain period of time. You could also earn bonus cash and points by delivering your passenger 
 quickly or performing some crazy stunts, like narrowly scraping past oncoming cars. Ambulance Driver 
 is an arcade-style driving game in which you drive an ambulance and have to pick up injured people 
 on the street and then ferry them back to the hospital within a certain amount of time -- or else 
 they'll die. Ambulance Driver is a lot like Crazy Taxi but without the crazy, the taxi, the stunts, 
 the speed, or any of the fun.   

  For starters, Ambulance Driver looks awful. Even though the game has three different city courses, 
 they all look terrible. The game's buildings, walls, and other scenery have such ugly, low-quality 
 textures that they look as though they were drawn freehand in a matter of minutes with the trial 
 version of an outdated graphics program. Instead of driving through a large, colorful city as in 
 Crazy Taxi, in Ambulance Driver, you'll sometimes feel like you're driving through a maze of crayon-marked 
 cardboard walls. Ambulance Driver also has a ridiculous amount of graphical pop-up. That is, as 
 you drive down the road, objects such as scenery, oncoming cars, and pedestrians all appear out 
 of thin air, and they do it constantly. The game's pedestrians themselves look like crudely drawn, 
 crudely animated, blocky stick figures that will try to dodge your ambulance if you get too close 
 to them. What's worse, instead of dodging, they'll often "fall" out of the way -- basically, rather 
 than bending their knees, or actually running, they'll just lean forward stiffly and fly a few 
 feet.   

  Ambulance Driver sounds terrible too. The game's soundtrack consists of upbeat but repetitive rock-and-roll 
 music that isn't offensive, or wouldn't be, if it weren't being used in a blatant attempt to copy 
 Crazy Taxi's similar, better soundtrack. The actual game's sound effects are generally lousy and 
 often mistimed -- like when your ambulance crashes into a building or signpost and then makes a 
 crashing noise a moment later. The game's voice work is also pretty bad. If you get too close to 
 pedestrians, they'll berate you just before diving out of the way (just like in Crazy Taxi) . Except 
 that rather than use any kind of positional sound, the game makes all pedestrians sound like they're 
 magically sitting next to you and talking into your ear, rather than making a superhuman leap five 
 feet away from your ambulance. And instead of employing a decent voice actor as an announcer, as 
 Crazy Taxi did with its Wolfman Jack sound-alike, Ambulance Driver has a nerdy Canadian guy who 
 sounds like one of the programmers.   

  Even if you can ignore how Ambulance Driver looks and sounds, you won't be able to ignore how badly 
 it plays. For starters, it's clear that the developers were trying to emulate Crazy Taxi's unrealistic 
 arcade-style physics, but they went too far. The game has three different ambulances you can drive: 
 one is fast, the other two are slow. Plus, each of Ambulance Driver's vehicles handles like an 
 oversized inflatable raft in a swimming pool. If you run into a wall or other solid object, your 
 lighter-than-air ambulance will often wobble madly long after you've gotten clear. Making sharp 
 turns in the game will usually cause your ambulance to drift uncontrollably to the side, and even 
 though the game has a manual handbrake to let you perform powerslides through turns, powersliding 
 is unreliable at best. What's worse, each of the game's three courses consists mostly of sharp 
 turns. Part of what made Crazy Taxi so fun was flying through downhill straightaways and finding 
 shortcuts to plow through different areas. There are no shortcuts or straightaways in Ambulance 
 Driver, just sharp turn after sharp turn, so trying to control your ambulance is usually a lost 
 cause.           "Are ya gonna do something aboot that?"    

  Another reason why Crazy Taxi was so fun was its speed -- it was a graphically simple game to ensure 
 its blazingly fast frame rate. And even though Ambulance Driver is also graphically simple, so 
 much so that it looks much worse than Crazy Taxi, it's very slow, especially for an arcade-style 
 racing game and especially if you choose to drive one of the game's slower ambulances. And as far 
 as physics go, forget it. Crazy Taxi had some small amount of real-world physics: If you were driving 
 really fast and you hit something, you'd get jolted off course or come to a quick halt. In Ambulance 
 Driver, if you collide with a building or other vehicle, you'll slowly bounce off, and the cars 
 that you collided with will also slowly bounce off -- then, as an afterthought, they'll overturn 
 for some reason. And if you collide with a pedestrian, you'll actually get points. That's right: 
 If you hit pedestrians, they'll become regular patients that you can pick up and deliver to the 
 hospital to gain points as normal. Though this feature was clearly intended to be a cynical joke, 
 if you actually buy a copy of Ambulance Driver in hopes of vicariously living the noble life of 
 a selfless paramedic, you'll probably be horrified.   

  Then again, if you play Ambulance Driver, it's basically a given that you'll be horrified either 
 way. It's a blatant rip-off of Crazy Taxi, a game whose greatest claim to fame is that it was one 
 of the few decent US launch games for Sega's Dreamcast. If Ambulance Driver had been released back 
 in 1999, it would have seemed like a watered-down knock-off. The fact that it's out three years 
  after  Crazy Taxi -- and that it's actually worse in every possible way -- makes Ambulance Driver's 
 release completely baffling. It really isn't clear what ValuSoft hoped to accomplish by releasing 
 Ambulance Driver. All you need to know is that you should steer clear of it. Ambulance Driver is 
 a horrible mistake of a game that should never have been made.

Review:  JUST A FLAT OUT HORRIBLE GAME!!!! I hat this so muxh it almost drives me mad. it has horrible graphic, 
 terible sound, bad physics and most on all just bad gameplay. I hated it after 3 minutes of playing. 
 the only satisfacton you will get is that you KNOW the next game will be better even if it has 
 like a 3.4 out of 1.0 . so if you are even tempted to play this game take a car and drive it off 
 a cliff because chances are if you like this game you probobly have a horrible life or are so old 
 you still think the year is 1995.
  
  ALL I CAN SAY IS DON'T PLAY THIS GAME
