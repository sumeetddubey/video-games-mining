:::Review:::
Sierra's latest gambling game in the popular Hoyle series offers everything you would expect from 
 a solid and addictive virtual casino game. 

 Tastes tend to vary when it comes to playing in a real casino. Some like the speed and risk of blackjack. 
 Others prefer the community and excitement of craps. Still others simply prefer to get away from 
 the crowds and sit at a slot or video poker machine for awhile. Virtual casino games are a great 
 way to take part in all the gambling games you were ever curious about, without the risk of losing 
 your shirt in the process. And Sierra's latest gambling game in the popular Hoyle series offers 
 everything you would expect from a solid and addictive virtual casino game.   

  When you begin, Hoyle Casino actually lets you create a gambling persona that you'll later turn 
 loose in the casino. Part of creating your gambler involves making a face for your character. This 
 part is actually kind of fun - Hoyle Casino comes with a built-in "facemaker" that lets you combine 
 eyes, noses, facial types, body types, and hairstyles to form your own personalized gambler. There 
 are hundreds, if not thousands, of possible combinations. If all the possibilities seem too overwhelming, 
 you can also hit the "randomize" button to generate some truly hilarious-looking characters.   
 

  Once you've created "Joe Gambler," you're ready to hit the tables. Starting you out at the lobby, 
 Hoyle Casino puts five grand in your pocket and invites you to squander it on any of 12 different 
 casino games. Games include keno, slots, horse racing, video poker, seven variations of poker, 
 and favorites such as roulette, blackjack, and craps. New additions to the list include Let It 
 Ride, Caribbean Stud, and three-card poker.   

  In case you're not sure about how to play any of the games, Sierra has included an extensive manual 
 containing rules and strategies for each of them. There are also in-game tutorials for each game 
 and a practice mode that lets you get strategic tips as you play.   

  A good way to gauge a virtual casino game is to look at its environmental elements - the things 
 that give you a sense of actually being in a casino - including the quality of the graphics and 
 the ambient sounds. Hoyle Casino excels in these areas, for the most part. For example, when you 
 click on Craps, a bird's-eye view of a craps table appears, with your gambler character and opponents 
 seated around it. Here, everything is rendered in almost tactile detail - from the 3D-rendered 
 opponents to the arm that tosses the dice - right down to the chips. Opponents are animated - during 
 the game, they yawn, make faces, and take swigs of beer at random. Also, the dealer and players 
 make comments according to your progress. If you make a big score, one player may ask you to invest 
 in his new start-up company. If you lose big, the craps stickman might add, "Reinforcements for 
 the front line!" Though each of the different players has plenty of dialogue, some of the commentary 
 does tend to get repetitive. However, the talking still undeniably creates a more believable casino 
 atmosphere. If you prefer a less chatty game, you can adjust the slider in the options menu from 
 "talkative" to "serious."   

  An intuitive interface is also an essential component of any good virtual casino game. Hoyle Casino's 
 interface is very easy to use, and the game is mostly played with the mouse (though there are also 
 optional keyboard shortcuts) . Clicking on the chips in the bottom corner of the screen lets you 
 set your betting amount. After that you just point and click to place your bets. Another handy 
 feature: During games that allow multiple placed bets - such as roulette and craps - you can right-click 
 on your player, and only the chips you've placed will be visible.   

  The simple interface comes in handy, especially when you gamble with real players over the Internet 
 and must help maintain a quick pace. Fortunately, getting an Internet game started is a relatively 
 simple task. After selecting the option to play an Internet game, you're taken to a Web browser 
 that shows which online tables are available to join. Your personalized gambler carries over to 
 the Internet game you've chosen. Playing and chatting with real players makes gameplay that much 
 more exciting. The only off-putting aspect of Hoyle Casino's Internet play is the presence of real-money 
 online casino ads when you enter the game browser.   

  Hoyle Casino manages to deliver addictive gambling gameplay in an attractive package. Admittedly, 
 some of the simpler games - such as roulette and slots - lose much of their excitement in computer 
 translation. Still, if you enjoy casino games, or you're looking for a game to give as a gift, 
 Hoyle Casino is a safe bet.
