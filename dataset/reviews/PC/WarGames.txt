:::Review:::
WarGames is a decent real-time strategy game in the Command & Conquer vein. 

 In 1983, MGM released the movie WarGames and changed my life forever. The film transformed my casual 
 interest in computers into an obsession and actually motivated me to learn programming. So when 
 I heard that MGM Interactive was making a game based on the movie, I was pretty psyched. After 
 a few weeks with WarGames, however, I was pretty disappointed. This game has a nice 3D graphics 
 engine but adds nothing else of substance to the very familiar RTS formula.  

 The premise of the game is similar to that of the movie. In an attempt to play the latest video 
 game from Protovision (run by David Lightman, Matthew Broderick's character from the movie) , you 
 actually kick off a real-world conflict between humanity and the government's WOPR computer. Apparently, 
 the WOPR has evolved sufficiently to develop its own armies and equipment, and it believes that 
 it can eliminate all war by simply eliminating humanity. Problem: None of this information is ever 
 conveyed to the player in the beginning of the game. True, there are a few pages in the manual 
 that explain some of this, but how many of us read the manual before starting a game? The game 
 could really have used a cutscene to set up this chain of events (instead of the useless fake commercial 
 that kicks everything off) .  

 Stepping down off my cutscene soapbox, I will say that WarGames faithfully executes all of the required 
 elements of a Command &amp; Conquer-style RTS game. The game includes 30 missions - 15 if you play 
 as the humans and 15 if you play as the WOPR. In each mission, the first order of business is to 
 build a base and enhance your troop strength. WarGames allows you to keep your constructor unit 
 after he assembles a building (which is a nice touch) and uses a pretty cool airlift sequence to 
 animate the arrival of new vehicles. Also, you can queue production for all of your units and, 
 although money is usually tight, most of the basic units are pretty affordable. The units themselves 
 are well balanced, if somewhat unspectacular.  

 Money is the game's only resource, and you use the hacker unit to acquire more of it. When you send 
 the hacker into a computer center, he can acquire funds and accomplish a ton of other tasks, including 
 upgrades to your armor and weapons. The voice of the hacker is pretty funny, as are several of 
 the others used throughout the game. The game also uses a familiar and funny message to inform 
 you of incoming e-mail.  

 There's no denying the game's slick 3D engine, but let's not kid ourselves here: This is no Myth. 
 The two games may both use 3D, but the WarGames engine cannot truly compete with the beautiful 
 technology behind Bungie's stunning visuals. Still, the vehicles in WarGames are detailed and fairly 
 well animated. The terrain is nicely done also, and the rolling 3D landscapes add some depth to 
 the battles. The ground units, on the other hand, are pretty unappealing. The sprites used to illustrate 
 infantry in this game look dated and decidedly out of place against the 3D environment. Not that 
 the troops should all be 3D polygon models, but they could look a bit more realistic - the WOPR 
 drones look like they were yanked right out of Robotron.  

 The mission structure in WarGames is neither a strength nor a weakness. You won't find any Myth 
 "Shadow of the Mountain" missions in this game, though you won't find any MechCommander-style "replay 
 it 50 times before you win" missions either. The missions are of the puzzle variety, however, so 
 if you're looking for an RTS game that lets you develop your own strategies for success, you probably 
 won't enjoy WarGames very much.  

 WarGames' most serious failing is the gameplay. For starters, the enemy AI is not terribly bright 
 (despite all marketing hype to the contrary) . On nearly every mission in the game, WOPR forces 
 will make a beeline for you and your base as soon as they discover where you are. This was highly 
 reminiscent of Command &amp; Conquer in skirmish mode, when you played AI opponents in pseudo-multiplayer 
 games. The computer's aggressive tactics certainly make the game challenging, but they also make 
 it predictable. The friendly AI is decent, but is marred by atrocious unit pathing - the worst 
 I've seen in an RTS game. When you order a group of tanks to attack, they pile up on each other 
 so that only one can bring its gun to bear. Ground units meander all over the map when other friendly 
 units moving towards the same destination block a narrow pass. I even saw one of my jeeps floating 
 merrily down a river on one mission, when I had ordered it to cross at a bridge (must've been a 
 shallow river...) .  

 The difficulty stepping, which is not that bad overall, suffers from a few weak points throughout 
 the game. For example, when you first encounter the WOPR's massive Mk IV Walker, you'd think that 
 you would only have to fight one so that you could gauge its strength and be sufficiently warned 
 of the danger for subsequent missions. Instead, you have to fight at least three on the same mission 
 (while also handling the other, lesser Walkers and ground troops) .  

 The final disappointment with the game comes from the near-total lack of a tie-in to the film. The 
 name is there, the WOPR is there, as are the names of Lightman and Professor Falken. But that's 
 about it. This game could easily be played in a vacuum, with no mention of the film at all, which 
 makes it seem as if the WarGames license was used simply as a marketing gimmick (now that would 
 be shocking, eh?) .  

 Still, WarGames is a decent RTS game in the Command &amp; Conquer vein. If you're hoping for a game 
 that captures the feel of the movie or that can compete with the likes of Total Annihilation, Starcraft, 
 or Myth, you will be sorely disappointed. But if you just can't get enough of building bases and 
 solving puzzles disguised as battlefields, you will probably get a kick out of WarGames.

Review:  WarGames is a good RTS based on the MGM "man versus machine" movie. You take part as a commander 
 of two factions: NORAD - human army armed with tanks, scout jeeps, flyers and standard infantrymen. 
 WOPR is a robotic faction, which is similiar to NORAD in armies and structures. Those two factions 
 fight for domination of the world in Global Thermonuclear War. Gameplay in WarGames is almost unbeatable. 
 When I was a young kid, I always played this game. Man, I loved that one. Graphics were pretty 
 good as far as for Intel Pentium MMX 166MHz. But without 2D graphic accelerator, it wasn't the 
 same game. Sound is pretty good. Music was great composed. Value and Tilt has 10 because of my 
 addiction to this game. I played it for years!

Review:  Ever had one of those weekends where you had nothing to do and all your RTS games were boring. 
 Well introducing Wargames. This game you may play when your bored but once you start it may get 
 hard to get out of. This game is the love it or hate it type. The game has good graphics and a 
 great storyline. If you remember the movie there was the WOPR computer and the NORAD. Well these 
 two are fighting each other in WWIII basically robots vs humans. You can choose either side each 
 with there own unique units and each has a specialty. Each level begins with a pretty detailed 
 briefing and if you play as the humans the general can be pretty funny. During gameplay you can 
 hear the sounds of rockets, bullets, and your men screaming. If your lucky you may even hear one 
 say "O my God they killed Kenny!" It is a tough game though since your recourse money is rare. 
 Also your opponent advances way faster then you but once you master it you can goof off in the 
 lower levels. The landscape is unique and every battle you can go with a different strategy. Overall 
 once you learn to play this is a highly addictive game and will be hard to get out of.
