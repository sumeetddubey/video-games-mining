 Microsoft Baseball 2000 includes a number of enhancements and new features that make it better than 
 the original (Microsoft Baseball 3D) . Unfortunately, the game still suffers from a number of bugs, 
 design flaws, and gameplay issues that keep it at the bottom of the pack among arcade baseball 
 games.  

 First, the good news. Last year, Microsoft boasted some of the best graphics in the baseball genre, 
 and if there's one area in which the game continues to shine this year, it's the graphics. The 
 lush 3D engine features some of the best player models around, complete with eerily lifelike facial 
 features and skin tones. The animations are excellent for the most part, though the transitions 
 between multiple animations are so choppy and ludicrous that they make each game look as though 
 it's being played by a bunch of robots. In particular, the pitcher walking back onto the mound 
 after covering a base looks ridiculous (he runs to the mound then slams to a halt and climbs tiny 
 invisible stairs to the pitching rubber in near slow-motion) .  

 Still, the game does an excellent job of re-creating the look of a real baseball game. The 3D stadiums 
 are well modeled and, for the most part, accurate. They convey a great sense of depth too, which 
 is something that is often missing in computer baseball games. The play-by-play is very good also, 
 though it still sounds as if it's being recorded in a small cardboard box. Many of the comments 
 are humorous, and all of them are in context, which is impressive. The game even has a sizeable 
 library of rivalry anecdotes to spice up some of your matchups.  

 Gameplay is much improved over the previous version simply because WizBang! built in some midrange 
 difficulty levels. The batting difficulty, for example, now includes a middle setting so that you 
 don't have to go with just basic (which is laughably easy) or advanced (which is still very, very 
 difficult) . The batting interface is still a strong point, in fact, though it is tough to precisely 
 move the batter's aiming box with a typical gamepad. Triple Play 2000's toggle, which centers automatically 
 when you release the pad, is much more intuitive even if it doesn't create quite the same level 
 of realism. But for all its awkwardness, the Microsoft Baseball 2000 batting system does generate 
 an exceptionally realistic array of hits, foul balls, and whiffs. No other baseball game, including 
 3DO's impressive High Heat Baseball 2000, has as many varied hit locations and velocities as this 
 one. The pitching interface, by the way, is the best around without a doubt. It may take a while 
 to warm up to it, but after some practice, you should be able to appreciate the way it adds elements 
 of pressure and unpredictability to your pitching - good stuff. The gunshot effect has to go, though 
 - nobody in the MLB is really capable of throwing at 120 miles per hour, after all.  

 Fielding is very tough, though you can have the computer do it for you. Unfortunately, the computer 
 makes a lot of boneheaded plays on your behalf and, on numerous occasions, simply refuses to move 
 toward a ball at all (and there is apparently no override option that lets you assume control in 
 these situations) . Computer-assisted baserunning, as with most computer baseball games, is problematic 
 and should be avoided. Of course, manual baserunning can be tricky as well. Several times when 
 I would hit the button to advance my runners, they would ignore me completely. Turns out that I 
 had to hit the button three or four times before they did something, and by then it was often too 
 late to turn that single into a double (the gamepad was in perfect working condition, by the way) . 

 The game offers season, exhibition, and home run derby modes, but for some bizarre reason you still 
 cannot choose to play a short or medium-length season: It's 162 games or nothing. A great player 
 editor is included with the game, and it lets you edit, create, and trade players at will - but 
 just like last year, it is not incorporated into the actual game. You have to launch it separately 
 from the Windows start menu.  

 Microsoft Baseball 2000 exhibited a number of graphical bugs and glitches. For starters, the menu 
 screens were flaky, with buttons and menu items appearing and disappearing from screen to screen. 
 This happened with the latest drivers for a Riva TNT card, so the cause of the problem is still 
 uncertain. Also, the game choked completely the first few times I tried to launch it in Voodoo2 
 SLI mode (1024x768) . The game was actually going on, but all I saw was the "Game loading" screen, 
 overlaid by the lineup that appears at the start of each game. This problem eventually went away 
 on its own, but again, the cause is indeterminate. Finally, about halfway through a game between 
 the Cubs and the White Sox, the game flipped out entirely and decided that it was now taking place 
 between the White Sox and the White Sox. Both teams became the same, and the computer seized control 
 of the action. It was pitching, it was hitting, and it was fielding, and I could not stop it without 
 quitting the game entirely. That was a most disturbing bug.  

 Overall, this is still a decent game but not one that can compete well against High Heat Baseball 
 2000 or even Triple Play 2000. The graphics are excellent, and the batter/pitcher interface is 
 equally impressive. Unfortunately, the rest of the game is rather disappointing. About the best 
 thing Microsoft Baseball 2000 has going for it is the $19.99 price tag, which should help boost 
 sales among uninformed buyers.
