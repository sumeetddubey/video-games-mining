:::Review:::
South Park the game comes across as boring and ill conceived and reminiscent of Acclaim's historical 
 track record of botching good licenses. 

 Not so long ago, Acclaim was infamous for licensing movies and comics and turning them into bad 
 games. Comic book icons like Batman, Spiderman, and Judge Dredd all met similar fates under Acclaim's 
 misdirection. But around a year ago, Acclaim turned over a new leaf with its one-two combo of Turok: 
 Dinosaur Hunter and Forsaken, good games that succeeded if not on the PC, then on the Nintendo 
 64 console. Meanwhile, news that Acclaim acquired the license to the most popular prime-time cartoon 
 since The Simpsons wasn't a surprise to anybody. But the fact that the game would be a first-person 
 shooter, masterminded by the makers of Turok, raised hopes that South Park would be more than just 
 another slipshod show-to-game port. Yet while the result is an outstanding interpretation of the 
 show's distinctive look, South Park the game comes across as boring and ill conceived and reminiscent 
 of Acclaim's historical track record of botching good licenses.  

 At least the artists got the job done. The flat paper cutouts of the television show seem so self-consciously 
 two-dimensional that placing them within a 3D environment sounds like a recipe for disaster. Surprisingly, 
 though, South Park looks great - or at least it looks just like the show, with its flat, bright 
 colors and sparse detailing. All the major characters are here, as well as most of the minor ones, 
 and you can spot them all a mile away. Strangely enough, the characters and the environments seem 
 very much at home in 3D, no doubt in part because the simple shapes of the show lend themselves 
 to low-polygon-count 3D models.  

 No surprise the game sounds pretty much the same as the show, with all your favorite threats from 
 the big-boned Cartman and plenty of incomprehensible diatribes from the unfortunate Kenny. There's 
 some new dialogue, mostly during the "mission briefings" where Chef explains to the children what 
 they're up against. But mostly you'll only hear isolated bits of speech from the characters as 
 they throw snowballs, dodgeballs, and more at their foes, and that gets really old really fast. 
 The show is funny, if not for its audacity, then for its sense of timing; but when Cartman's all 
 but guaranteed to cuss whenever he takes a hit, you might be so inclined to turn the volume down. 
 And if the speech doesn't force you to do it, the music will. You'll start blaming the plucky, 
 all-too-upbeat soundtrack for droning on and on, when in fact the real culprit is the level and 
 enemy design.  

 Strip away that South Park sense and sensibility from this game, and you'll be left with one lousy 
 shooter. Many shooters are criticized for their inane puzzles, where you end up spending more time 
 looking for keys than pulling the trigger. The good news is, that's not the case here. In fact, 
 you'll spend almost all your time shooting in this game. But the scary thing is, soon enough you'll 
 wish you were looking for keys all over again. South Park is an incredibly simplistic shooter. 
 Half the enemies run straight for you, and the other half throw something at you once in a while. 
 You face these foes in enormous swarms, and they're all really tough to bring down, but they're 
 also really stupid and practically harmless except in said swarms. Add all that up, and you have 
 a game that doesn't merely get boring, but downright tiresome. Even with your wide variety of weapons 
 (each with an alternate firing mode) , from your trusty snowballs (regular or yellow) to the more 
 illustrious toilet-plunger launcher, you'll quickly get sick of fighting off so many enemies. The 
 occasional boss monster doesn't offer much in the way of variety, and these guys take so many hits 
 and are so formulaic to fight that you'll be dreading the bosses for all the wrong reasons.  

 
 If the bad guys went down easier, if they were smarter, if you fought more than a couple of types 
 of them per level, and if the levels themselves were more interesting, South Park would have been 
 a better single-player game. And while the weapons look good and are fun to use for a little while, 
 they all feel underpowered and slow to the point where it's all too easy just to run around and 
 avoid getting hit in a multiplayer match. Still, if you're going to take any pleasure from this 
 game, it'll be in killing Kenny firsthand and not from fighting through levels on end of nothing 
 but kamikaze turkeys and the occasional cow. You'd think it would go without saying by now, but 
 apparently it doesn't: A good license and good graphics aren't enough. If you're a fan of the show, 
 you'll be doing yourself a favor just sticking to the show.

Review:  Unfortunately this was a blatant grab for cash to try and make some money when the popularity of 
 South Park reached it's peak.
  
  The game was almost completely clean, which is defiantly not in the spirit of South Park. Although 
 at there time there was some simple pleasure in controlling the characters, there really wasn't 
 enough to sustain that premise at all.
  
  In fact a game like this would almost be worth of a south park parody.
  The game play was ordinary, 
 essentially a generic FPS, translating south park itself into 3D. Had they stayed in 2D and gone 
 with the feel of the TV show, the games may have retained some sort of charm, as it is it doesn't.
 
  
  The waves of enemies are dumb and you feel like you're going nowhere and you probably are. 
  
 
  Not recommended for fans of the show and really for anyone at all.

Review:  Good news - if you ignore the shortcuts and run from the program file, this will play on XP.
  
  After that, for me it was all down hill. I suspected this was a shoddy job when the install 
 screen asks 'what language do you want'. After selecting English the second screen of the install 
 process asks 'What language do you want' and introduces Spanish as an option that was not on the 
 1st screen.
  
  It installs no problem. The voices sound OK and just like the show.
  Played the 1st level in which you get to throw white / yellow snowballs at turkeys and wander around 
 South Park.
  Turkeys come at you in waves. Problem is there's no apparent AI at all so they all come in a straight 
 line. Once you line up to hit the 1st one all the rest follow it into your cross hairs. The only 
 challenge is hitting the keys fast enough.
  
  There is an on-line option ( you don't get to play the game at all even in single player mode unless 
 you confirm your ip address) but when I tried it I got 'No Servers Found'. Playing with other players 
 may have made this game enjoyable once upon a time, without that it's a curiosity for collectors. 
 I won't be playing level 2 Summary : Good points, voices &amp; characters are like the show.
  Average : music Bad : gameplay,

Review:  When I first heard there would be a South Park game released for the PC, I was all up and ready 
 to go get it. I got my $40 and bought. Even at the advice of the person at Software Etc to not 
 do it, I shrugged him off and bought it. It was 1999, I wasn't overly thrilled with the generations 
 new systems and I didnt have money for a dreamcast so I went the PC route. Back to the game. This 
 is just downright awful. The characters look like half assed generic 3D images. The characters 
 do look like the real cartoon in the facr, but south parks animation is what gives it character. 
 The 3d models are crap. Even Cartman looks fatter than he should be.
  
  There are a couple of cool things. Mainly the weapons and language, but thats where the fun stops. 
 The gameplay is among the worst I have ever experienced. The story line is too weak to grasp you. 
 I quit playing this in 5 days and haven't touched it since. But it left an imprint in my mind for 
 the past 7 years.

Review:  :Good Idea:
  The weapons are pretty funny. There's the sniper rifle (or chicken's butt) , a plunger, a turd, 
 and pee snowballs.
  The character models look pretty good and at least Acclaim paid the stars of the show to do some 
 voice acting. If anything, that's the best part of the game is how well they did the characters 
 and re-did the intro to the show in 3D.
  There's a ton of multiplayer characters to choose from, including Big Gay Al, Satan, and Jesus, 
 but...
  
  :Bad Idea:
  ... the multiplayer maps are so small, you'll never end up playing them. They put no thought behind 
 the maps at all. All the maps are about as big as a rectangle and there's nothing really to do 
 or hide behind in them.
  The story is a bit out there. It really doesn't make much sense, but then again, the show doesn't 
 either.
  Even though the weapons are funny, they're usually annoying and you'll probably stick to using 
 the snowballs or dodge ball the whole game.
  
  :Overall:
  If you find this game lying around, you might want to pick it up. I paid $2 for it online and 
 it's a lot better than the console versions of this game.
