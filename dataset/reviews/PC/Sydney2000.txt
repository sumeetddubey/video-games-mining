:::Review:::
Competing in the game's events is time-consuming and often frustrating. 

 Back in 1984, the now-defunct developer Epyx released Summer Games, a superb Olympics game for the 
 Apple II and the Commodore 64. This simple but addicting and enjoyable game offered eight events 
 and hot-seat support for up to eight players. Anyone who's played the game should fondly remember 
 the synthesized national anthems and the challenging but logical control schemes used for each 
 of the various events. If you can get your hands on a copy of this 16-year-old game today, it'll 
 be a lot more fun to play than Eidos Interactive's new Sydney 2000. Eidos' game has flashy graphics, 
 but its gameplay is tedious and completely unenjoyable.   

  Sydney 2000's 12 events include the 100-meter sprint, 110-meter hurdles, 10-meter platform diving, 
 the javelin throw, and skeet shooting. For each event, you can either compete in an arcade mode, 
 an Olympic mode, or a head-to-head mode against up to three other players. Multiplayer games are 
 unfortunately limited to four players on a single computer, in which one person must use the keyboard 
 while three can use daisy-chained Sidewinder gamepads.   

  Competing in the game's events is time consuming and often frustrating. The game relies heavily 
 on the back-and-forth motion made famous by the Konami arcade classic Track &amp; Field: You just 
 push two designated keys as quickly as possible without overlapping the keystrokes. This in itself 
 would not be so bad, but because the game forces you to work through three pre-Olympic stages before 
 even letting you compete for a medal, your arms - and especially your fingertips - will probably 
 grow quite tired long before you get to the serious events.   

  To make matters worse, the computer-controlled athletes get better at each stage of competition, 
 so your best chance of winning a medal comes from having your character train between stages. Each 
 event has three training exercises, and each exercise has three difficulty levels. Completing each 
 of these exercises relies on the same frenetic key-mashing scheme. And when you have successfully 
 accomplished one of these virtual exercises, you still have to run a qualifying heat in the event 
 to earn the improvements in your athlete's abilities that the exercise provides. The exercises 
 themselves include activities such as sit-ups and stretching, which don't make for a particularly 
 exciting simulation. Thankfully, the game includes a save feature that lets you record your progress 
 between stages and events. Otherwise, only real-world Olympic athletes would be able to complete 
 an event and all of its accompanying exercises in top form from start to finish.   

  Even if you don't mind all the key pressing, you'll probably get tired of the game once you find 
 that the athlete you control doesn't always react the way he or she is supposed to. Even when you're 
 absolutely sure you've gyrated the controls at the proper pace and in the proper sequence, the 
 3D Olympian on your screen will occasionally do something you don't want or expect. Don't bother 
 turning to the manual for help - all that you'll find there is a skeletal framework of instructions 
 for each event. An in-game coaching mode helps train you to some extent, but even this isn't helpful 
 for all of the events in the game.   

  But the worst part about Sydney 2000 is that it was apparently developed for video game consoles 
 and was not translated properly for the PC. The 3D graphics do look better on the PC than they 
 do on the PlayStation, but the game has multiple interface problems such as the way it forces you 
 to choose three-letter initials to represent your player by scrolling through the alphabet and 
 choosing the letters one by one. Even Summer Games lets you type in your name. These sorts of problems 
 wouldn't be a big deal if Sydney 2000 were fun to begin with, but since the gameplay is so poor, 
 the game's evident design for use with game consoles instead of PCs becomes more noticeable and 
 more annoying.   

  Overall, Sydney 2000 just seems like a mediocre console game that comes across as even less impressive 
 on the PC. Though the 3D graphics are quite fluid and detailed, and a handful of the events such 
 as the 10-meter platform diving are somewhat interesting compared to the rest, Sydney 2000 can't 
 even compete against the equivalent Commodore 64 game that's well over a decade old.
