Betty Bad isn't terrible, but you can download the free demo and get pretty much the entire experience 
 of playing the full game. 

  WildTangent's new action game, Betty Bad, is essentially a demonstration of the company's Web-based 
 gaming technology. Taken as that, it's pretty effective. Unfortunately, it's also being distributed 
 as a budget-priced stand-alone product. And judged against the higher standard imposed by your 
 potential $20 investment, Betty Bad is seriously lacking in gameplay and quantity of content.  
          Betty Bad plays like a cross between Tomb Raider and Tempest...    

  The action takes place in a series of long, twisting tubes that you -- as the eponymous heroine -- must 
 navigate on foot as waves of attackers approach from ahead. You can walk all along the inside of 
 the cylindrical environments, which appear to rotate around your generally fixed position. It's 
 sort of a cross between Tomb Raider and the classic arcade game Tempest. However, it manages to 
 not capture the exploration and puzzle-solving elements of the former, while simultaneously abandoning 
 white-knuckle action of the latter.   

  Though you swim through one level and walk along the  outside  of a cylinder in another level, 
 there's little variety in the game's environments. The placement of the bends change, as do the 
 wall textures, but each mission basically boils down to marching from one end of a tube to the 
 other and shooting everything that gets in your way. Each tube features a single path with no forks, 
 which means you'll never have to decide which way to go. In fact, you don't even have the ability 
 to look around freely, because the generally unchanging dimensions of each tube ensure that your 
 range of forward vision always encompasses everything there is to see.   

  Swarms of mechanical bugs attempt to impede your progress through each tube. "Swarms" is sort of 
 an overstatement, though. Seven or eight at a time is about as swarming as it gets. The roughly 
 eight varieties of bug vary in size, toughness, and attack pattern, and there are occasional environmental 
 hazards that must be destroyed or jumped over, but all the action is pitched at the same somewhat 
 torpid pace. The tension ratchet that characterizes great -- or even really good -- pure action games 
 is quite simply missing.   

  Some tension is generated by the fact that you can save only between missions. Most of the levels 
 take about 10 minutes to complete. So if you die in the final 10 seconds, you'll have to replay 
 the first nine minutes again. On the other hand, if not for this restrictive save system, the entire 
 game would take about an hour to solve. There are two short introductory levels, three regular 
 levels that must each be traversed twice, and then a final level. But even with nine levels, it's 
 still incredibly short.           ... but there's not much to it and it's over very quickly.    
 

  As befitting its status as a glorified tech demo, the graphics and sound are good. The textures 
 are crisp, the lighting is nice, and the tube effect is neat. The title character, designed by 
 ex-id artist Paul Steed, is well animated and looks suitably swollen in all the right places. But 
 the whole thing feels kind of threadbare. No attempt has been made to imbue Betty Bad -- both the 
 character and the game -- with any sort of personality whatsoever. It's the kind of simple, short, 
 and totally generic action game that you might get as a bonus for buying a lot of cereal.   

  Betty Bad isn't terrible, but you can download the free demo and get pretty much the entire experience 
 of playing the full game. Relatively speaking, as budget action titles go, the gulf between 20 
 bucks' worth of Betty Bad and 20 bucks' worth of Serious Sam: The Second Encounter is so vast that 
 it's virtually immeasurable. And Serious Sam even features a more enjoyable fight along the interior 
 wall of a cylinder.
