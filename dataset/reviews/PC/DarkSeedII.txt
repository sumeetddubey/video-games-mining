Some of the psychological sequences are certain to give the sensitive gamer nightmares. 

 H. R. Giger was very pleased with the original Dark Seed and although it's hard to be sure why, he 
 could only be happier with this weirder, darker sequel (set in the decidedly Lynchian burg of Crowley, 
 Texas) . While using the same digitized sprites, Dark Seed II sports vastly better looking full-color, 
 photorealistic environments ---no longer must players search for two-pixel-wide inventory items 
 in monochrome environments ---which make the gradual intrusion of Giger's biomechanical nightmares 
 even more stark and horrible. Again, Mike Dawson must navigate between the human world and the 
 Dark World, which co-exist in radically different but noticeably parallel forms, but this time 
 the agents of the Dark World have murdered Mike's high-school sweetheart and pinned the crime on 
 the hapless loser (this guy should really look into working with another game company) .   

 The real fun of this game isn't in the find-and-use adventure mechanics, which are still pretty 
 standard, but in the sheer nasty-mindedness of it: some of the psychological sequences are certain 
 to give the sensitive gamer nightmares; the music is high-quality and spooky; creepy innuendoes 
 abound (such as the jerk-hole medical examiner who can be seen furiously making out with an assistant 
 behind the pebbled glass in the morgue is a good example) ; anybody who fancied Blue Velvet a good 
 first-date movie should have a real ball with DSII. Even the end-of-game epiphany (which the marginally 
 disturbed gamer can see coming from the half-way point) is no less awful for having been predictable. 
 More valuable as an indication of what can be summoned from the game experience ---not to mention 
 a showcase of some truly ghastly art ---Dark Seed II is a worthwhile endeavor. Better yet, give 
 it someone sensitive and squeamish as a Christmas gift.

Review:  Darkseed was a favorite game of mine. I love the work of H. R. Giger and was highly anticipating 
 the game. For its time Darkseed was a revolutionary game with amazing graphics. 
  
  When I heard Darkseed 2 would be coming out it looked very promising. I bought the game as soon 
 as it was released. The box packaging was as cool as the originals game box. When I started playing 
 the game I quickly realized how much more could have done to make this game as good as Gigers art 
 is. The graphics in the Dark World of the game are first rate. A horrific mesh of biology and machine, 
 called biomechanical as a style. Images could easily give players nightmares. 
  
  Unforetunatly there is not enough of Gigers work in the game. The game should have been carried 
 out longer in the Dark World. The audio and sound are fine. The game play is nothing new, more 
 time should have been spent on creating something new or different in the way you play the game. 
 
  
  Overall this game is a good game for the simple fact that Gigers artwork makes up for many of the 
 games faults.
