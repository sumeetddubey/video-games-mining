:::Review:::
A number of small improvements make Baseball Mogul 2009 only a minor evolution over its predecessor. 
 

  It seems to be the year for incremental improvements in baseball management simulations. Just like 
 its main rival, Out of the Park Baseball 9, Baseball Mogul 2009 enters a new season looking a lot 
 like it did last season. After adding a tremendous number of new features and enhancements during 
 the past two years, the current edition of the text-based sports sim is more of a taking-stock 
 upgrade. It focuses on minor revisions to the presentation and artificial intelligence. The result 
 is a good game with subtle improvements that make a better big-league management experience, but 
 one that isn't essential if you already own its predecessor.  

  Baseball Mogul 2009's personality remains pretty much the same as when it first hit the market 
 way back in 1997. In contrast to the more complicated and stat-heavy Out of the Park Baseball series, 
 the Baseball Mogul line has always tried to balance accessibility with depth. Its gameplay is geared 
 toward both hardcore hardball buffs and casual fans who want to play an authentic turn-based baseball 
 management game without drowning in numbers. While you take over the complete operation of a big-league 
 baseball club with all of the responsibilities that such a job entails -- either in a solo league 
 or in an online league with other human players -- you're never overwhelmed with player stats, long-winded 
 negotiations with free agents, or financial screens with more numbers than the average corporate 
 tax return.  

           Baseball Mogul is still the only baseball management sim that lets you choose pitches 
 and take your cuts on the field.      

  All of the tasks here are simplified takes on their real-world counterparts. Signing a free agent 
 can be as simple as meeting his asking price and getting the deal done instantly. The minor league 
 system consists of handfuls of prospects organized into teams. Trades are little more than quickie 
 swaps on a dialogue screen with a rival GM. Entire seasons can be simmed in under a minute, or 
 you can manually proceed through games as a spectator GM, a manager making dugout decisions, or 
 as players choosing pitches then taking swings using the mouse. Economic management tasks range 
 from figuring out ballpark prices for tickets and concessions to committing to a policy for TV 
 broadcasts to setting budget lines for farm teams, scouting, and medical staff. Just about all 
 of the financial nitty-gritty can be automated, too. If you don't want to haggle over the price 
 of tickets or how much you're committing to the minor leagues, you can just click on the "let the 
 computer choose" box and forget all about them. Basically, this is a game that's as detailed as 
 you like. If you don't want to get so heavily invested in every aspect of team management, you 
 can hone in on core gameplay elements, such as setting rosters, and let the rest of the game run 
 more or less on autopilot.  

  Changes to this laissez-faire formula have been implemented this year. It's now a bit easier to 
 set up the league that you want courtesy of the five franchise scenario options that greet you 
 every time you fire up the game. You can instantly choose either the 2008 Major League season (complete 
 with updated rosters and 2,500 minor leaguers) , any season from 1901 to 2007, a totally made-up 
 league, an anything-goes custom league, or any MLB expansion team going back to the 1960s. The 
 latter is perhaps the most intriguing way to play Baseball Mogul 2009 because it's tough to resist 
 the challenge of trying to guide a truly abysmal club like the 1962 New York Mets or the 1969 Montreal 
 Expos from the outhouse to the penthouse.  

  Interface improvements can at least make those early years running an expansion team a little more 
 bearable. Many visual elements have been overhauled from last year, providing a more intuitive, 
 cleaner look to the game. You now have access to a depth chart, giving you a quick reference to 
 your full roster at all positions. The improved scrolling status bar at the bottom of the screen 
 now tracks more pertinent big-league developments in addition to running classic player quotes 
 and league leaders. Play-by-Play mode is now more lifelike when manually playing games. A new physics 
 engine provides more variety to plays during games, with the ball being knocked all over the diamond. 
 The only drawback to all of the above is that a few bugs have crept into the mix. Menu screens 
 sometimes come up blank, as if the game isn't properly importing schedules, stats, or even player 
 lists. Saving and reloading always clears this problem up, thankfully.  

           Now there's a trade that would have changed Major League history.      

  Artificial 
 intelligence appears to have been boosted somewhat as well. Computer-controlled managers employ 
 cutthroat tactics, smartly subbing in pinch hitters and pull pitchers at opportune moments. Rival 
 GMs offer mostly sensible trades now. You're typically presented with a raft of solid options to 
 buy or sell instead of the blitz of stupid offers that used to come across the screen every July 
 before the trade deadline. Teams seem to make moves to benefit their circumstances. Also-rans look 
 to dump high-salaried old guys for the prospects needed to rebuild, while contenders will make 
 pitches for key veterans that they think will get them into the World Series. Nothing says Major 
 League realism when cellar-dwelling sad sacks like the San Francisco Giants come calling on July 
 31 looking to dump $18-million-man Barry Zito for a trio of fine Yankee prospects. Some stat generation 
 is a bit wonky, though. As in previous years, offensive numbers trend higher than they should, 
 which is particularly noteworthy when you move back to earlier eras without the home-run-enhanced 
 scores that have been so common in Major League Baseball over the past decade or thereabouts. Seeing 
 games where teams routinely score 10 or more runs back in the Dead Ball Era -- or similarly run up 
 scores in the offensive desert that was the mid-1960s -- takes some of the shine off of playing classic 
 and expansion seasons.  

  Ultimately Baseball Mogul 2009 isn't a bad sequel, it's just an in-between one best reserved for 
 series completists and newcomers.

Review:  I am a person that has spent probably over a hundred hours of playing everything from Baseball 
 Mogul 1998 to 2009. So I'm pretty well established in this franchise. If your expecting graphics 
 and great sound or game play, don't. Because that is not what this game is about. It is about Managing 
 every aspect of whichever franchise you desire, or perhaps (new in '09) , you would like to start 
 an expansion team. Baseball Mogul offers up to date stats and projections from around the league 
 and bases their stat projections from previous years or prospect wise, it is actually pretty darned 
 accurate. Despite the fact you can't play as mentioned above, you can however manage games them 
 self from controlling where and how to pitch to batters. Another great thing about Baseball Mogul 
 is the modifications of leagues, although they haven't let you create seasons over 162 games yet, 
 they still manage to have many tinkering options till your hearts desire which makes it's replay 
 value almost limitless.
  
  Anyways, go check it out, its worth a second look.
