:::Review:::
The developer deserves credit for not simply making yet another budget-priced run-and-gun shooter, 
 but K-Hawk is unpolished, simplistic, and problematic. 

 Walk into a game store and you'll find that in many popular game genres, such as real-time strategy 
 and first-person shooter games, there are budget-priced versions for $20 or less. So it makes sense 
 that developers would also try to make a budget-priced version of stealth games like Metal Gear 
 Solid and Thief, and that's precisely what K-Hawk: Survival Instinct is. Unfortunately, as with 
 many budget-priced games, you get what you pay for with K-Hawk: a stripped-down game with poor 
 graphics, poor sound, and a clunky control scheme.           You play as K-Hawk, a helicopter pilot 
 who must act as a stealth operative.    

 In the game, you play as the titular K-Hawk, a young, blonde helicopter pilot who gets shot down 
 behind enemy lines and eventually unearths a diabolical plot. Though she's a pilot, K-Hawk will 
 actually spend all her time sneaking around outside the visual and audible range of nearby guards 
 as she completes simplistic objectives, such as flipping a certain number of switches or recovering 
 a keycard to open a locked door. She can run, walk, and crouch, though moving quickly makes more 
 noise, so it's usually best to creep past enemy soldiers. Of course, there will be times when you 
 simply can't avoid them and must shoot them down using a handgun or a rifle. Though you can recover 
 real-world weapons like a SOCOM pistol or an M16 assault rifle, the various pistols and rifles 
 are more or less identical, except that some rifles have a sniper scope and some guns can carry 
 different amounts of ammunition.   

  Stealth actually works pretty well in K-Hawk, at least at first. You're equipped with a radar scanner 
 (which you must put away if you wish to draw a weapon) that indicates the location and visual and 
 hearing ranges of your enemies, nearly all of whom are human soldiers. However, the game's levels 
 aren't laid out too well -- though they're large, it's easy to get lost in them, and your radar map 
 has no indication of the location of your next objective. In the meantime, the game becomes more 
 challenging mainly because the levels start to feature more narrow spaces and more of the same 
 soldiers patrolling each level, yet throughout most of the game, catching a guard's attention usually 
 leads to the same result: One of them runs off to sound the alarm, and you'll find yourself under 
 attack on multiple sides armed with only the game's pitifully inadequate weapons. K-Hawk's weapons 
 fire slowly, don't pack much of a punch, and do inconsistent amounts of damage -- sometimes a clean 
 hit with a sniper rifle can down an enemy soldier in a single shot; other times, you'll find yourself 
 repeatedly shooting a soldier in the face with the same weapon until he finally goes down.   

 
  K-Hawk doesn't look too great, either. The game's graphics are extremely blocky and chunky, and 
 while some of its environments are full of polygonal objects like rocks, walls, and inoperable 
 vehicles that you can use to take cover, they all look very simplistic. K-Hawk also has a number 
 of embarrassing graphical glitches, the most obvious being the long, hanging polygons that clip 
 in and out of view in certain areas.           Ms. Hawk is so stealthy that this graphical glitch 
 is oblivious to her approach.    

 The game's sound is similarly disappointing. K-Hawk doesn't have any background music, though it 
 does feature repetitive ambient noises, such as the looped "buzzing of flies" sample in the jungle 
 levels of the game. In addition, the game's voice acting is pretty lousy, and though many of the 
 voices are delivered by actors who seem fluent in English, the dialogue was apparently scripted 
 by writers who aren't. What's more, nearly all your enemies share the same voice -- an angry-sounding 
 male voice that is used to hurl vaguely menacing but nonsensical threats like "I'm gonna flatten 
 you!" and "I'm gonna knock your teeth right out of your face!" -- which make no sense at all, especially 
 considering the fact that your enemies attack you at a distance with rifles, rather than pummeling 
 you with their fists.   

  K-Hawk isn't even an especially long game, and though each level has a few scattered items, such 
 as extra ammunition or health packs, hidden behind its crates, you won't find much reason to go 
 back and replay the game once you've finished it. Developer Similis Software deserves credit for 
 not simply making yet another budget-priced run-and-gun shooter, and K-Hawk's implementation of 
 stealth isn't too bad, but the game itself is unpolished, simplistic, and problematic.

Review:  I was happy to find this game, K. Hawk, a couple of years after its original release. Reading ( 
 not a very positive) an article about it in my favorite gaming magazine, I was really curious to 
 see how it actually was.
  Although it mostly got negative reactions, I really did like it!
  Of course the graphic is fusty and blocky but the atmospher was conceivable and it gave a plausible 
 feeling of being there.
  I liked the fights, as the enemy was eligible and responsive.
  I specially liked the sniper, this sequence was really thrilling and
  quit exciting.
  The scenes 
 in the factory were also good, the action scenes and all. The Bosses were also convincing and they 
 all (unlike many current games) deliver good and challenging fights.
  K. Hawks character was also (regarding fantasy world of Gaming)
  believable and real. Altogether 
 I had a quit good time playing the game, was not bored or fed up with it, I didn't want to stop 
 in the middle and wished I have had played
  it earlier when it was first released.
