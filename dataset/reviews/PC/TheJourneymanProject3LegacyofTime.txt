:::Review:::
While it looks nice, sounds nice, and plays nice, JP3 is a game hampered by its noticeable lack 
 of story, sloppy writing, and one really annoying "feature." 

 Anyone who doubts the adventure genre is getting more than a little tired needn't look any further 
 than The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time. This traditional adventure creaks more than the 
 rope bridges spanning its depiction of Shangri-La. While it looks nice, sounds nice, and plays 
 nice, JP3 is a game hampered by its noticeable lack of story, sloppy writing, and one really annoying 
 "feature."  

 Gamers familiar with the Journeyman Project series will feel right at home playing as the millennia-hopping 
 timecop Gage Blackwood, Agent 5 of the Temporal Security Agency. As the game begins, the Symbiotry, 
 sort of an intergalactic UN, is threatened by ruthless aliens searching for the Legacy, an artifact 
 of immense power. You guessed it, it's your job to find the Legacy in the distant past and save 
 the TSA, Earth, and the Symbiotry. I may be wrong, but wasn't this basic premise exhausted sometime 
 in the second season of the original Star Trek?   

 Pieces of the Legacy are scattered in the mythic cities of El Dorado, Shangri-La, and - due to an 
 apparent constitutional mandate governing all adventure games - Atlantis. Traveling to these ancient 
 lands is accomplished via your Chameleon Timesuit. Not only does the timesuit let you zip through 
 time, it projects holographic images of people you meet during your quest, allowing you to masquerade 
 as a host of characters as you infiltrate the religious orders that protect/revere the Legacy pieces. 
   

 JP3 does a commendable job integrating the artifact into the various faiths (both invented and real) , 
 and, though each faith is unique, it creates a unifying consistency of tone throughout the game. 
 Only by understanding each religion do you progress: Getting a handle on the Buddhist wheel of 
 life is rewarded with a chunk of the Legacy. Happily, there are no senseless math or slider puzzles 
 to be found here - puzzles are logically and seamlessly made part of the environments, further 
 enhancing the smooth flow of the game.  

 Well, that is until the jarringly out-of-place FMV sequences that follow each discovery of a Legacy 
 piece. You're cruising along in a nice, thoughtful game, and wham! - a bad science fiction movie 
 breaks out. It's a low-budget schlock fest laden with dialogue so stilted and hackneyed you can 
 actually see the poor actors cringe right before delivering hoary cliches like, "Now my people, 
 my planet, are in terrible danger!" Yikes. What makes this worse is that these wincingly bad interludes 
 compose the whole of the plot, and all that time spent wandering the past doesn't push the plot 
 forward one bit, despite seeming hours of bland FMV conversations including a particularly tedious 
 lecture by a Tibetan lama. You're bound to feel you're wasting your time.  

 The lack of an engaging story makes it hard to work up enthusiasm to keep playing. Arthur makes 
 it near impossible. Arthur is your timesuit's artificial intelligence, a useful source of clues 
 and information saddled with a blabbermouth personality that "irritating," "grating," and "worthy 
 of death" don't come close to conveying. Fortunately, you can gag the little virtual creep, at 
 the price of missing some important information.   

 In the end, the pretty, 360-degree panning environments, the sparse ambient sound, and the modestly 
 challenging puzzles aren't really enough to make JP3 a must-play. Fans of the series will probably 
 enjoy it, but gamers weary of eye-catching but dull adventures might want to wait until someone 
 really does something new with the adventure genre.
