:::Review:::
Traitors Gate 2 is a mess of a game that feels more like punishment than fun. 

  The best adventure games let you explore diverse and exotic locales; they let you meet fascinating 
 characters; they let you take part in a gripping story; and they let you solve puzzles that are 
 challenging, but not frustrating, and reward you for solving them. Traitors Gate 2: Cypher does 
 almost none of these things. There's a neat idea buried somewhere in the game of taking an old-school 
 adventure game and throwing in a tiny dash of Tomb Raider and Splinter Cell. Unfortunately, Traitors 
 Gate 2 is almost -- literally -- unplayable. The puzzles are arbitrary and too hard, the pace is boring, 
 the gameplay is tedious, and the story is forgettable. If that weren't enough, major bugs and general 
 sloppiness also mar the proceedings. In many ways, Traitors Gate 2 is a perfect example of how 
  not  to design an adventure game.  

          This colorful intro raises false hopes.     

  In the original Traitors Gate, you had 
 to foil a jewel heist. In Traitors Gate 2, you again play as a mysterious operative named Raven, 
 but this time around, the stakes are much higher: Global security is at risk. Terrorists from an 
 unnamed Middle Eastern country are working with an American defector to develop a computer virus 
 that can re-encrypt secret communications codes, thus crippling militaries and causing mass chaos. 
 Your goal is to sneak into the lab where the virus is being developed. You must then copy the virus 
 and destroy the lab. Conveniently enough, for an adventure game, you'll have to access the lab 
 via an ancient Babylonian temple complex. This sort of old-fashioned pyramid crawl hearkens back 
 to the earliest adventure games, like Scott Adams's Pyramid of Doom (1981) .  

  Now, though, instead of a simple text adventure, you get the benefit of today's 3D technology. 
 You control Raven as you would in a typical third-person action game, by moving him with the arrow 
 keys and looking around with the mouse. Sadly, he can't jump or climb over even the tiniest of 
 obstacles, and you can't remap the keys. Worse still, he frequently gets snagged on objects and 
 sometimes spins about wildly. This is, at best, annoying and, at worst, is a contributor to your 
 character's death as he gets caught up while trying to evade moving traps. The fact that you have 
 to line Raven up perfectly with an object to pick it up or to operate it is equally problematic 
 and can cause you to ignore a useable object that you, at first, might mistake as part of the immovable 
 scenery. Still, getting to freely control a character's movement in a 3D environment at least, 
 theoretically, makes Traitors Gate more immersive than your typical graphical adventure.  

  There's precious little in the way of interesting story or characters in Traitors Gate 2 to immerse 
 you, though. For almost the entire game, the only character you see is Raven. You just watch the 
 back of his head the whole while, and every great once in a while he'll make a stupid observation, 
 like when he spots a serpent statue and says, "Whoa! Sir Hiss, I presume." So, the game is really 
 all about the puzzles. During the great majority of the game, the puzzles revolve around lame "find 
 the secret button to open the secret passage in the pyramid" dilemmas. Near the end of the game, 
 you get to use a few high-tech gadgets to retrieve the terrorists' virus.  

  To help you progress through the mazelike temple complex, you use some clues from an archaeologist's 
 old diary and sometimes use hints found on ancient paintings or carvings. Oftentimes, these clues 
 aren't enough, and they can even confuse the matter. Almost-comically-gratuitous Rube Goldberg 
 puzzles abound in numbing succession, often involving a whole bunch of levers and buttons and wheels 
 and too little feedback about whether you're on the right track. Between the confusing clues and 
 confusing puzzles, you can easily spend way too long stumbling about in this game, getting nowhere 
 and growing utterly sick of the proceedings.  

  Even if you know what you're doing, some of the puzzles are so elaborate that they can take an 
 eternity to finish, making this a painfully boring game. Just as bad, you rarely feel like you're 
 making any progress. Good adventure games reward you for solving puzzles. They, of course, offer 
 the simple satisfaction of having figured out a problem, but they also let you learn more of the 
 story, explore neat new locales, and meet interesting new characters. In Traitors Gate 2, you miss 
 all these things. It just feels like you're on a treadmill, facing one arbitrary puzzle after another 
 and never earning anything for it. Just to make sure all your fun is squashed, the game suffers 
 from some major bugs. For instance, you can sometimes fall through walkways, you can permanently 
 freeze when you pull a lever, and you can suffer from other such similar things that may prevent 
 you from completing the game.  

          You get a few high-tech gadgets, but the game is mostly old-school adventure.     

 
  Traitors Gate 2's presentation is a bit better than its gameplay, though it's still only mediocre. 
 There are some believable ambient sounds, but sometimes the 3D audio makes them come from the wrong 
 position. The soundtrack adds a little ambience but contains no memorable themes and doesn't add 
 any real drama. Visually, the game looks dated and sputters and chugs as it loads new rooms on 
 the fly. The endless, look-alike hallways aren't merely monotonous but can make navigation a chore. 
 (Why isn't there an automapping feature?) On the bright side, the Babylonian temple setting is 
 refreshingly unusual, and the developers clearly had fun with all the ancient Middle Eastern motifs 
 and luxurious colors.  

  Traitors Gate 2 has a neat concept but totally fails to deliver on it. You never feel like some 
 elite counterterrorist adventurer, but, rather, you feel like some poor schmuck who got suckered 
 into wandering around a sprawling temple filled with one gratuitous, tedious, and frustrating puzzle 
 after another. Couple that with major bugs, sloppy typos, and a painfully slow pace, and you get 
 a mess of a game that feels more like punishment than fun.

Review:  I was looking forward to this sequel. The first Traitors Gate was a great game. I liked being 
 Raven, I enjoy first person text adventures, especially when they incorporate a great balance of 
 puzzles and action. I figured the sequel would be just as good if not better. Instead they turned 
 a great text adventure into a 3D debacle. 
  Now you control Raven as you would in a typical third-person action game, by moving him with 
 the arrow keys and looking around with your mouse. However, control is almost impossible with 
 this guy, he spins violently like someone possessed. What a disappointment. The old adage, less 
 is more, applies to this one.
