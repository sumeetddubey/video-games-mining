European Air War doesn't push the state of the art, but it excels at good, old-fashioned gameplay. 
 

 European Air War doesn't push the state of the art - it just barely matches it in many areas - but 
 it excels at good, old-fashioned gameplay. While other World War II flight sims can claim technical 
 superiority over various aspects of European Air War, none can match it for pure atmosphere and 
 immersion. Realistic mission tasking, populated landscapes, huge bomber formations, and swarms 
 of aircraft twisting in aerial melees all come together to provide a level of detail you can truly 
 get lost in.  

 European Air War sports three campaigns: the Battle of Britain in 1940 and Battle for Europe campaigns 
 set in 1943 and 1944. In the Battle of Britain, you can fly for the English or Germans. In Battle 
 for Europe, you can fly for the Americans, English, or Germans. Enlist in a Pilot Career, and you'll 
 choose a squadron, which in turn will select the plane you fly and the base you'll fly from. The 
 campaigns are dynamic rather than prescripted, with missions generated on the fly by the computer. 
 If you take out a target, it will remain destroyed when you fly over it again in a later mission. 
 If you fail to successfully defend your airbase from a bomber attack, in the next mission, you'll 
 find yourself flying from a new base. The dynamic nature of the campaign keeps you from ever getting 
 the same mission twice. Be warned, however, that the mission tasking is fairly realistic, so missions 
 can be repetitive. For instance, RAF pilots will spend most of the Battle of Britain performing 
 bomber-intercept missions.  

 In addition to the campaigns, there's an instant action mode as well as a quick mission builder 
 that lets you select between various types of missions (such as escort, interdiction, and intercept) 
 and the types and numbers of friendly and enemy planes. To MicroProse's credit, this latter interface 
 is also used for multiplayer, letting you fly real missions with and against other human players 
 when you grow tired of the deathmatch mode.  

 The game features 20 different models of 11 flyable aircraft, including the Spitfire, Hurricane, 
 P-38 Lightning, P-51 Mustang, FW-190D9, and the ME-262 jet. The flight models aren't as refined 
 as those in Microsoft's Combat Flight Simulator, but the performance variations between aircraft 
 are accurately represented. You can fine-tune realism by toggling details such as stalls and spins, 
 torque, structural limits, blackouts, and engine overheating. There are excellent audio indications 
 of impending stalls and overheating engines.  

 In the cockpit, situational awareness is very good. The keypad can be used to snap the view to any 
 direction, and there's a virtual cockpit with a padlock mode. An optional target ID box and descriptive 
 text tag assist you in sorting friends from enemies. Unfortunately, you're more or less forced 
 to use these targeting aids due to the sim's limited resolution and the scaling of aircraft. European 
 Air War's graphics engine is limited to 640x480 resolution, so aircraft at a distance appear as 
 dots or tiny crosses. You're forced to get unrealistically close to them to make a visual identification. 
 (There's also a magnify mode, but the field of view is way too restrictive to make it useful.) 
 It's true that making the planes larger at a distance wouldn't be 100 percent realistic either, 
 but given that the human eye can see much more detail than is apparent at 640x480 resolution, it 
 would prove a less distracting compromise than chasing Luftwaffe planes with giant glowing neon 
 letters above them spelling out "FW-190A."  

 The AI pilots are a mixed bag. To MicroProse's credit, they do start out using historically accurate 
 tactics, something rarely seen in a WWII sim. But it's fairly easy to pull AI pilots into a turning 
 fight, and since they don't push their planes to the limit (I've never seen an AI plane spin or 
 visibly stall out) , patience will bring you victory. Dogfights aren't difficult to win in a one-on-one 
 situation, but those are rare. With more than 30 planes twisting and turning throughout the same 
 airspace, the sheer number of bad guys will keep you from getting complacent.  

 While European Air War doesn't have the impressive visible damage effects of Jane's WWII Fighters, 
 the actual damage modeling is extremely well done. Having control surfaces shot out causes you 
 to lose maneuverability, and oil, fuel, and coolant leaks can force you to land in the fields. 
 The only real gripe here is that landing gear can be damaged, but belly landings seem impossible. 

 Similarly, enemy planes blow up real good. Hit a B-24's engine, and it starts smoking. Hit the fuel 
 tank, and it explodes in flames, ripping off a wing. Bombers can be brought down with only a few 
 hits, not totally realistic, but then neither is the low-res, fixed gunsight you use in WWII sims. 

 Graphics are decent, but not exceptional. Glide and Direct3D as well as software rendering are supported. 
 (If you have a 12MB 3Dfx card, you must download a batch file from MicroProse's web site to fix 
 a bug that shuts the sim down at startup.) The planes and panels have a painted rather than photorealistic 
 look, but the effect isn't bad. Down low, you'll find trees (that you can indeed collide with) , 
 houses, and towns. There are plenty of surprising details, such as tiny soldiers who scatter out 
 of damaged vehicles and buildings. Sound is absolutely superb, from the "warble" when your plane 
 approaches a stall to the steady drone of bomber formations.  

 Certainly, there are plenty of nits to pick with European Air War. The limited screen resolution 
 affects combat, flight models could be better, and the AI could use some smartening up. That said, 
 I haven't found a flight sim experience this immersive since the ancient days of LucasArts' Their 
 Finest Hour: The Battle of Britain and EA's Chuck Yeager's Air Combat. The parts may not be perfect, 
 but they come together to create an experience no flight sim fan can miss.

Review:  Defend england from waves of german bombers!!!! In this game you play in the European theatre. 
 You can fly as americans, british, or german. There is a veriety of missions. You can fly up to 
 20 authentic aircraft from each faction. You can create and manage your own squadron. Anywho if 
 you love flight sims pick this 1 up, but it just might get boring. Anyways here the main part u 
 want... 
  
  + Graphics arent THAT good but good enough..
  + The veriety of fighters is neat
  + you can actually play this for hours if u r into flight 
 sims
  
  - At some point in the game you might yell out "wats the point!?!?!?!"

Review:  what can I say... I love this game... 
  
  excellent mix of planes... american, british, and german... covering the entire period of the war... 
 
  
  pretty good flight characteistics, that can be set for level of realism... and damage modelling 
 is good as well... you'll definitely want a joystick/throttle/rudder combination to squeeze every 
 bit of performasnce out of your plane... I've gone through three just to get the best combo I can 
 find...
  
  the graphics are a bit dated, but the planes are beautifully rendered, and occasionally I will 
 be surprised at the level of realism and beautiful panoramas that can be achieved in this directX 
 6 game... be sure to get the v1.2 patch and you can set the graphics all the way up to 1280 x800... 
 greatly improves the cockpit visuals... set it for dusk with light clouds and fly into a beautiful 
 sunset... 
  
  quick fly single mission is very flexible for setting up the scenario and weapons configurations, 
 also single player campaign, and multiplayer are all good...
  
  this has been my go to game for a quick 10 minute game since it came out... give me a P-38 (4x 
 .50cal machine guns and a cannon!) with a sky full of luftwaffe and I am a happy man... 
  
  best thing... you can often pick it up in the bargain bin for under 10 clams...

Review:  First of all it takes a certain type of person to appreciate this type of game. We picked it up 
 on a fluke and been playing ever since. There is a big following with this game. There are many 
 that have put a lot of effort into extras. More planes and skins and the ability to create your 
 own plane art. Mods galore. Pacfic as well as the european.
  
  The flight models are well done so the planes fly pretty acuratly. a good manual built in for stats 
 on planes and flying advice. Multiplayer is supberb with the ability to co op as well as DM. Graphics 
 are not as good as IL2 but are good. The sound is well done as you can hear other planes as they 
 come up behind you. Straffing ground targets is always fun. The interface with the joystick of 
 your choice is well put together for ease of use. 
  
  The learning curve depends on you. If you are beginner you can fly like arcade and if you are seasoned 
 you can set for every realisim. Stalls and spins, landing or takeoffs what ever you want to set 
 it up as.
  
  You can play campagne, quick fly or simply one time scenario. Get ready to dogfight you butt off.
