:::Review:::
You might wonder if other tables from the past would have been more worthy of recreation. 

 Microsoft has done a fairly good job recently of reviving games for their nostalgia value. The 
 Revenge of Arcade and Return of Arcade collections brought back classic '80s arcade games from 
 an different era when video games first began to reveal the possibilities of electronic gaming. 
 Before that, relatively low-tech pinball tables ruled the arcade floors, and now, Microsoft has 
 turned the clock back even further to explore the unsought realm of historical pinball simulation. 
 Because of Microsoft's decision to limit itself to one pinball company, Microsoft Pinball Arcade 
 comes off as more of an interactive history lesson than a collection of good games.  

 Microsoft Pinball Arcade attempts to simulate seven pinball games from manufacturer Gottlieb, the 
 first being from 1931 when David Gottlieb designed the "first" pinball game called Baffle Ball. 
 The rest of the tables are from the succeeding decades, showcasing innovations in design and play. 
 Included in this collection are Baffle Ball (1931) , Humpty Dumpty (1947) , Knock Out (1950) , Slick 
 Chick (1963) , Spirit of 76 (1976) , Haunted House (1982) , and Cue Ball Wizard (1992) .  

 The available variations in design guarantee that each table plays remarkably different from any 
 other. In pinball, you're basically playing "against" the design of the table so that the goal 
 is to overcome the obstacles with a limited number of control factors (flippers, nudging, and plunger) . 
 The layout of the varied tables requires a good bit of thinking while playing to make sure you 
 nudge or flip at exactly the right moment. To help you through all this, Microsoft's in-game documentation 
 is an excellent reference source for understanding how pinball strategy works (how to flip and 
 "catch" the ball) as well as giving complete layouts of the tables with descriptions of all the 
 scoring elements within the games themselves. This resource is a godsend for novices who usually 
 just pound the flippers in hopes of getting big points.  

 However, what the variations in table design don't provide is an assortment of the "best of the 
 best" that pinball has to offer. Sure the tables are old and give you a great sense of how far 
 pinball has come, but with all the money Microsoft has, couldn't it spare a few more bucks to include 
 great tables from manufacturers Williams and Bally? The result is a collection of tables that range 
 from confusing designs such as Humpty Dumpty (with no bottom flippers, only outward-angled side 
 flippers) to a classic such as Spirit of 76, which is almost a picturesque version of pinball from 
 its golden years.  

 The one game element that really draws you in is the faithful reproduction of the sounds from all 
 the tables. Anything from a ball hitting a steel pin to the distinct sound of a bumper will make 
 you sit up and notice this game amongst the myriad pinball titles out there. Even when the table 
 design is frustrating, you're going to find yourself aching to get the next bonus table feature 
 just so you can hear some classic bell sounds you haven't experienced yet.  

 What also elevates this game's style to above average is the faithful rendering of the back-glass 
 scoring system from each table. The newer tables such as Haunted House and Cue Ball Wizard use 
 electronic font displays to show your score, while the older tables use lighted signs such as "2 
 million" in combination with rolling dials akin to automobile odometers. The producers of the game 
 even went so far as to make you wait for the dials to roll/reset to zero before you could play 
 another game.  

 If you're eager to learn pinball, Microsoft Pinball Arcade is a great history lesson, as well as 
 a good way to learn table navigation and scoring techniques. If you're just looking for a solid 
 pinball game to pass the time, there are other games out there with more graphically entrancing 
 features and more modern sounds. But, if you're an elite pinball player looking for the only game 
 that will let you go back in time for a gem such as Slick Chick, this is the only game for you. 
 Microsoft has done a good job recreating the past, but when it comes down to gameplay, you might 
 wonder if other tables from the past would have been more worthy of recreation.

Review:  A era resurrected on pc for those who were there back in the days. Different layouts to choose 
 from and very intense. I remember the good old days growing up playing pinball machines. They seemed 
 dull at first but they grew on everybody. Bump the machine with your body to alter the direction 
 of the silver ball. But don't bump too hard or the machine will tilt (game over) . All this excitement 
 for just one quarter. Now on the pc version all you need is time and electricity. Don't bump your 
 pc though or you might have more problems than just tilt. Test your skills at controlling the silver 
 ball and aim at designated targets. Try to get the highest score or even turn the game over. This 
 usually happened when you cause the counter to start over from zero. Achieve this goal and you 
 know you have become not only a legend but a grand master.

Review:  Although I've only played the demo version of this game, it impressed me for what computers in 
 1998 could do. 
  
  Gameplay:
  Everything is very simple. You use the mouse to navigate throughout the menus to choose things 
 from. There are only three essential controls, corresponding to the left flipper, the right flipper 
 and the launcher. Nothing too complex. 
  
  Graphics:
  I think there is still a little 3D rendering in here. I'm not sure. 
  
  Sound:
  The pinball 
 sounds sound just like a real pinball machine, but the music can be annoying sometimes. 
  
  Value:
  Pinball Arcade is really fun, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. Get the demo instead.
