:::Review:::
You won't be disappointed with this novel new title. 

 Rocket Jockey is almost really, really cool, and unlike the majority of almost cool games, Rocket 
 Jockey has the potential to one day attain that lofty status. The basic story: Rocket Science (No, 
 don't get me started, I'll touch on that later) has shipped a fine product, with passable graphics, 
 a cool premise (blazing around on big rockets trying to drag people behind you counts as cool in 
 my book) , and the best soundtrack to ever bless a video game (that's five tracks of Dick Dale goodness) . 
 All of this is good. On the back of the box (see the company line area of this review) Rocket Science 
 tells us that we can take on our friends with network play. This is also good. The problem arises 
 when you return home with your new purchase to read a small slip of paper hidden inside the box 
 that says, "This is the card I'm supposed to write to calm you down once you find out your Rocket 
 Jockey CD doesn't have LAN connection stuff. But frankly, I'm as PO'ed as you are, because I didn't 
 get mine either." It blabs on a bit here with some further descriptions of what fun you'll be having 
 once you get your multiplayer patch and finishes with, "You can order the stuff by calling 1.888. SegaSoft 
 or you can download it at http://www. segasoft. com/rockjock/patch. html." Okay, this is kind of annoying, 
 but at least you can download the patch right? Wrong. Traveling to the above URL gets you more 
 cute messages and more hype, but no patch. That's why this game received such a low value score, 
 and a reduced gameplay rating as well. Once the patch is available and we get a chance to tackle 
 the multiplayer functions, I'll come back and sort it all out. Maybe.  

 With the venting out of the way, I do have to admit that even without multiplayer options, Rocket 
 Jockey is a lot of fun to play. In each of the three different modes of play, Rocket Race, Rocket 
 War, and Rocket Ball, you hop on the back of, well, a rocket, and zip around, steering your craft 
 by shooting grapples out of the sides of your craft and attaching them to pillars positioned around 
 the arena. It sounds a lot more confusing than it is, and once you realize that these same steering 
 ropes can be used to grab other players' craft, to grab other players' bodies, and, best of all, 
 to create clotheslines to trash anyone who's following too closely, you'll dedicate the necessary 
 energy to figuring out the controls.  

 Rocket Race is just as it sounds, a race through various sets of pillars. You can grapple with your 
 enemies if you like, but odds are if you waste a lot of time doing it, you're not going to qualify 
 in the end. Rocket Ball is a lot more fun. In Rocket Ball you attempt to grapple a ball and sling 
 it into your opponent's goal. Very soccerish, and messing with your foes is a great deal more satisfying 
 and rewarding than it is during a race. Finally there's Rocket War, the purest form of the game. 
 You're set down in an arena and given different point scores for doing nasty things to the other 
 guy. Picture the possibilities: using a hook to knock some loser off the back of his rocket; grabbing 
 him as he desperately struggles to get back to it; and, if you're really skilled (and really mean) , 
 dragging his bike just a few steps ahead of him while he scampers behind you impotently. As I said 
 in the beginningcool.  

 Okay, you knew I was going to have to take a potshot at Rocket Science's earlier material (Yes, 
 we still remember Loadstar: The Legend of Tully Bodine) , but Rocket Jockey has done a great deal 
 to clear the bad taste of the past out of my mouth. First, the kids over at Rocket Science have 
 apparently read enough bad reviews to realize that FMV is NOT the wave of the future, and there's 
 none to be seen anywhere in this title. Second, and more importantly, Rocket Jockey is at its core 
 a really good game, not a device for showing of technology or telling a story. I'm not sure there 
 even is a story here, and I like that a lot. Finally, they got Dick Dale to do part of the soundtrack. 
 I can't even begin to tell you how amazing the tunes are, and I'm not going to try. If you're into 
 Mr. Dale's past work you know exactly what I'm talking about, and if you're not, then frankly something 
 is wrong with you and you may want to see a doctor. This is the work of a company that has at least 
 partially figured out what gaming is all about, and I think they should get a touch of credit for 
 moving so far so fast.  

 In its single-player mode, Rocket Jockey is a slick little game that gives action fans a whole new 
 set of moves and strategies to discover. Its format is so unique that for the first time you may 
 find yourself actually wondering about new ways to cream someone rather than finding a new weapon 
 to do it with. Even so, Rocket Jockey's real strength will lie in its multiplayer mode, and to 
 put it bluntly, that mode is not available yet. If you're looking for a little something new to 
 play alone, or if you want to start practicing for the day when a multiplayer patch is available, 
 you won't be disappointed with this novel new title.

Review:  I came across Rocket Jockey in the bargain bin at a warehouse sale. The cover looked interesting, 
 and I decided to spend the 2 dollars to buy it. From the moment I installed it, I knew that I had 
 found something special.
  
  This game puts you in the driver's seat of a rocket engine that has been outfitted with a fins 
 to steer and grappling hooks. Because of the nature of rocket engines, steering with the fins is 
 limited. The grappling hooks provide added turning capabilities as well as becoming useful in the 
 different events in the game.
  
  The three modes of play are Rocket Race, Rocket War, and Rocket Ball. Rocket Race is a fairly straightforward 
 race against other jockeys. Navigate your rocket around obstacles and through the gates as fast 
 as you can. in Rocket War your objective is to incapacitate the other jockeys before time runs 
 out. Points are given for attacking your opponents in different ways. In Rocket Ball, you're essentially 
 playing a game of soccer on the back of a rocket. Objects will appear for you to grab or ram into 
 various goals in order to score more points than your opponents in the time allowed.
  
  The physics in every aspect of the game is truely wonderful. There's a certain thrill that you 
 get from watching a jockey get tossed across the ground and tumble into one of the barriers during 
 rocket war. The various objects you pick up during Rocket Ball each react differently when grappled. 
 Also, the damage your rocket takes affects the ability to steer, which makes the game dynamic from 
 the first round to the last bell.
  
  Last, and certainly not least, is the soundtrack. For whatever reason, Dick Dale's surf rock works 
 perfectly with the game.
  
  For me, I can think of nothing I'd like to see more than the whole game getting revamped for a 
 console release. Just imagining the extra bells and whistles that could be added on even a PS2 
 release makes my mouth water. I highly recommend going back and trying this game out, if you haven't 
 yet.

Review:  This is one of the first games i was ever able to play on the PC..... Fun, Fast, Strategic.
  
  This is not only a racing game, but also soccer (Rocket Ball) , and a battle game (Rocket WAR) .
 
  
  Beutifully rendered graphics for the time, too bad this is the only one. This game possibly set 
 a standard on what the true definition on what computer 3D graphics should be for a game and not 
 the Pseudo 3d graphics which were still the 2d renderings, but this is the real deal for the time.
 
  
  I recomend playing it (or buying it) . But good luck finding it, this can be very hard to find....
