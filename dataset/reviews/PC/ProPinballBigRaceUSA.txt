If you are even remotely interested in pinball, you would be wise to add this to your collection. 
 

 It isn't easy to make a good pinball simulation. So much engineering goes into designing the real-life 
 tables that crafting computer simulations becomes a twofold task. A computer pinball game must 
 not only provide realistic physics, but the table being simulated must also be fun to play. With 
 last year's outstanding Timeshock, Empire's Pro Pinball series earned a reputation for fulfilling 
 both criteria, and Big Race USA maintains, or even exceeds, this level of excellence.  

 Before any bumpers, ramps, or flippers, your average pinball designer needs to come up with a premise 
 that provides an interesting context for the player. True to its name, Big Race USA puts you in 
 the role of a taxicab racing from New York to San Francisco and back again. Along the way, you 
 can pick up passengers and deliver them to destinations, speed away from the cops, and even knock 
 other cars off the road. All of these actions are accomplished through aimed shots at various table 
 targets. The game keeps track of cities visited and gives you a lighted map that shows your progress. 
 This is a great design that lends purpose to the game without encumbering you with a lot of unintuitive 
 accolades. Even if you're not planning on making it all the way to the end of the Big Race, the 
 number of side objectives is sure to keep you busy.  

 Aside from the dazzling table trinkets and large colorful table features, you will immediately notice 
 the sheer number of graphics modes that the game supports. The graphics settings are so customizable, 
 that even players with meager video options will be able to find a setting that looks good and 
 plays smooth. And even if you can't afford a new graphics card, it's good to know that Big Race 
 USA's most impressive graphical feature, its true 3D silver ball (complete with noticeable imperfections) , 
 is hardly taxing on your CPU. What's more, the 3D ball is more than just a pretty graphic, as its 
 spinning surface helps you determine which direction the ball is rolling.  

 The graphics aren't Big Race's only good point. The simulation allows you to adjust the slope of 
 the table (which affects how fast the ball accelerates down) , as well as the physical condition 
 of the table itself. If you've wondered what it would be like to play the same table after it's 
 been pounded on for years, or want to feel as if you're playing a table fresh off the factory line, 
 Big Race USA lets you set the wear level where you want it. You can even go into the table's operator's 
 menu to adjust every option in gameplay. This level of detail makes Big Race USA much more than 
 just a pinball game.  

 Because of its depth as a simulation, maybe it's no surprise that Big Race USA is designed for experienced 
 pinball players. The table is quite difficult, and the required level of proficiency is rather 
 high. Nearly all of the table's goodies are accessed through targeted shots, and these are often 
 at supremely challenging angles. The effect is that the shots you make to progress the game are 
 the most difficult, and the difficulty settings merely tone down the number of required shots. 
 Although this is preferable to the game artificially adjusting your shots with "creative" physics, 
 the monotony of repeatedly trying to make that one special shot is likely to frustrate less experienced 
 players.  

 Another minor problem occurs when you view the table from a low angle, where the top-end trinkets 
 conceal too much of the ball's movement. Although you grow accustomed to this and learn to anticipate 
 which way the ball will roll, the number of pathways available to the ball makes such predictions 
 unreliable. And if you're partial to top-end bumpers, you're out of luck with Big Race USA. Those 
 round clanging randomizers are conspicuously absent, making table play a little less chaotic.  
 

 Nevertheless, any problems with Big Race USA are minor, and relate more to table design or even 
 subjective opinion than to its effectiveness as a simulation. When you get right down to it, it 
 may be the best pinball simulation ever. If you are even remotely interested in pinball, you would 
 be wise to add this to your collection.

Review:  Empire Interactive's Pro Pinball has merged real-life pinball with amazing action concluding to 
 this fantastic game.
  
  In Big Race USA, you drive a taxi, and with the help of well-targeted shots into the table, you 
 will race across the US, delivering customers across the country, chased by cops and who knows 
 what else, you will end the Big Race successfully. But even if you don't, the game will keep you 
 tuned for a long time.
  
  The table and all of its features are well-designed and very realistic, even nowadays. When it 
 was released, the game faced many bug problems and graphics card glitches, which do not exist now, 
 making the game smoother and revealing its true, pure quality.
  
  Unfortunately, sometimes the pinball you play turns out to be too difficult, allowing victory only 
 to more experienced, if not masters of the table. But the funny moments the game offers mean nothing 
 in front of this minor maybe problem.
  
  I recommend this game to everyone who is tired of playing arcade and action games and wants to 
 relax a bit.

Review:  Big Race USA is in my opinion the best PC based pinball ball game on the market. The ball physics 
 emulate those of a real machine, the sounds are fantastic, and the overall graphics are top notch. 
 The game rules are quite complex and it will take awhile to master the many shots needed to drive 
 across the country. This is by far one of the best sit down and play a quick game in your free 
 time options out there. The one downfall is when all the graphics options are set to maximum, there 
 might be some slowdown if your machine isn't powerful enough. If you have any affinity for pinball, 
 go out there and find yourself a copy.
