From initial concept to practical execution, Baldies is sick and wrong. 

 From initial concept to practical execution, Baldies is sick and wrong. It's one thing to have a 
 serious, rock-jawed game like, say, Command &amp; Conquer, wherein you order very serious military 
 units to advance upon enemy positions, attack key targets, and, if the need arises, employ nuclear 
 force - but THIS: Cute little Ziggy-esque moppets jogging around, punching each other out or shooting 
 one another... stepping on cute little land mines called "poppers"... using little animals in biological 
 weapons testing - BUNNIES, yet growing angel wings for the purpose of airborne assault... 
 perverting the very meteorological order of nature... did I mention bunnies?  

 Sick And Wrong.  

 A self-proclaimed game of "demented action for people who think," this one 
 has now officially supplanted Total Distortion as the single weirdest game I have ever played. 
 As the god/commander of the Baldies, it's your job to oversee every aspect of their ongoing war 
 with their Hairy enemies (presumably, the conflict is aesthetic in nature) . The goal here is nothing 
 less than genocide (with a good deal of cruelty to animals thrown in for good measure) . Divinely 
 intervening with your drag-box and Grab Hand cursor, you determine who the Baldies are and what 
 they do; drag-select a group of Workers and suddenly change them into Solidiers - zing, now they're 
 soldiers, ready to punch or shoot or otherwise harm any man (or whatever) not of their kind. Inside 
 your houses, Scientists labor away on new technologies, and when your Grab Hand plucks some little 
 animal out of the nearby fields and drops it into one of your Houses, he's lab-fodder, and any 
 number of dastardly creations may result. Animals don't fair well in Baldies, and they're as likely 
 to get used for minesweeping duty as anything else. Cows have a particularly bad time of it when 
 your Scientists develop Exploding Cow technology, which is just what it sounds like. The cow attracts 
 Baldies from all around, and then it's Moo, Boom, and Splatter. It does a body bad.  

 One of the hardest things to get one's head around in Baldies is that you're only somewhat in control. 
 The Baldie soldiers, apparently afflicted with severe thyroid problems and/or massive chemical 
 difficulties, continually totter hither and yon through the grassy fields, and do their jobs only 
 when the enemy happens to run right up in their faces (the enemy, too, is running around without 
 focus, like a stage four Alzheimer's victim on crank) . You can continue to pick up and put down 
 a particular soldier with the Grab Hand until you land him squarely on his intended target, but 
 it's a better idea to just saturate an area with soldiers, mines, bear-traps, and the like and 
 just let things run their course. In the parlance of Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert, every Baldies 
 unit is in "guard" mode ALL THE TIME. Eventually something is gonna die, but the actual process 
 is enough to give a Command &amp; Conquer player seizures.  

 Eventually, you're going to grow jaded and corrupted enough to want the big stuff (what the manual 
 refers to as Acts of You) : artificially-induced storms errode terrain, drown the unwary, and bring 
 down helicopters (yes, there are helicopters, and cars, and - just never mind) ; the Flamehead attack 
 allows you to reach down from Heaven, as it were, and smite a particular creature - or to do a 
 Sodom-and-Gomorrah tune-up on an entire stretch of terrain; and what holy war would be complete 
 without Armageddon? This is The Big One: Use it, and all your guys, everywhere, will be turned 
 into soldiers, whisked off to a newly-created island where the same fate has befallen the enemy, 
 and the Last Battle will commence.   

 The learning curve is so atrocious here because of the complete lack of any comprehensive tutorial. 
 The manual included with the game manages to be brief and opaque at the same time. Who are these 
 guys? What is my goal? What the hell am I supposed to do? (And in the back of your head: What were 
 the designers smoking, and where can I get some?) Players are given specific uses for weapons and 
 tech, but no broad-stroke explanation of the game mechanics, so it's up to the diligent gamer to 
 fully explore Baldies. And there is a lot to explore, with secrets to find and mistakes to not 
 make again. Confusing at times, funny at others, Baldies is worth a play if you have some gaming 
 under your belt and a streak of chaotic violence a mile wide (sample Gamer Tip: "If it's still, 
 blow it up; if it moves, burn it") . And when the need arises, don't hesitate to make it rain goldfish 
 so your minions can pick them up and eat them.

Review:  This classic old game is under appreciated, it does not have the best sound or grafix but who cares? It 
 is fun to play when you dont have anything better to do.
  
  The game is simple but fun to play, where did gamespot get the sick and just plain wrong from? Even 
 if it was Sick arent a lot of games these days? Ever played GTA San Andreas?
  
  Its not great but it is under appreciated. You might get it for 50p if you see it. The game is simple 
 and fun if you are bored for a few minuites.
  Nice simple game underrated in my opinion.
