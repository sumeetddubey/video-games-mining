:::Review:::
Whether you're a vocab virtuoso or a remedial reader, you'll find a suitable challenge in Bookworm 
 Deluxe. 

  Bookworm is a word jumble game similar to the Parker Brothers tabletop classic Boggle. You are 
 given a board filled with lettered tiles, and you have to string them together to form words, at 
 which point the tiles disappear and new ones drop from above. You get points for each word, and 
 longer words are worth more points. There are special tiles too, including score bonuses and the 
 dreaded burning tiles. The red tiles burn through the tile below after each turn. If a red tile 
 reaches the bottom of the grid, you lose the game.  

  The premise is super simple, and the game plays quickly if you just keep making small words like 
 "dog" or "cart." But, you can spend a lot of time hunting for the elusive "ravioli" or "heliotropism" 
 as well. There's also an action mode here, which makes the red tiles burn constantly, so you have 
 only a few seconds to make each word. No matter how you play, Bookworm Deluxe is a fun and easy 
 vocabulary game that will please everyone from word wizards to the barely literate. The only problem 
 is that it doesn't offer much more than the free Web version of Bookworm.

Review:  As Popcap games go this one is pretty good.. One solid play can last you a nice hour.. I found 
 the game pretty fun, but also aggravating. My aggravation is due to the game not recognizing all 
 the words in the english language. Sure that would be hard to do, and can make the game a bit easier 
 to play.. After all the game DOES recognize foul language, which is just weird . At any rate the 
 challenge, for me at least, is finding what the game DOES accept as a word. This is the cause for 
 my classification of mixed reactions 
  
  Now down to the basics:
  
  Gameplay: easy to pick up and play. you can make the game as easy or as hard as you want.
  
 
  Graphics: scrabble.. hmm not much there.. but it does have nice graphics for what type of game 
 that it is.
  
  Sound: the music can be tiresome but you learn to tune it out after a while, and the sound effects 
 are pretty good.
  
  Value: If I were to say that every Popcap game doesn't have an end.. I would be more or less right.. 
 but the added bonus of different game modes does enhance the gameplay.
  
  Tilt: Its a great game.. just annoys me at times. :/
  
  Plays well via STEAM.

Review:  Think of it like Tetris only with letters in the blocks. You've got to link up letters to make 
 words. If you feed the bookworm too many small words he'll send down fiery red letters. You must 
 use them right away before they blow up your whole game. Sound easy? It's not. My longest word 
 so far has been 8 letters. And did I mention the music is very, very cute.
  
  I've played the PC version, which, unlike the GBA version keeps high scores and has online ranking. 
 There are online scores of about 50 billion. I don't think I'll be beating it. Nonetheless, it's 
 quite possibly the most addictive game ever.

Review:  As always, Popcap never fails to deliver a casual game that has high replay value. While such games 
 cannot fight against games by Blizzard, EA or such, these games are good alternatives to Solitaire 
 or Minesweeper, if you get what I mean.
  
  BookWorm boasts of 2 different modes with relatively reasonable graphics and sound, considering 
 that the game takes up no more than 15 MB of system space. That is to say, don't expect cutting-edge 
 effects.
  
  The classic mode is the classic scrabble game, with a twist to it. The alphabets are randomly jumbled, 
 and you have to form words that are adjacent to each other. Bonus words are periodically displayed, 
 giving you extra points if you successfully form it. Alphabets will turn into burning tiles every 
 once in awhile and incinerate tiles beneath them. The game is over if a burning tile makes it to 
 the bottom.
  
  The action mode, as it describes, is fast-paced. Alphabets will turn into burning tiles every so 
 often, so you have to keep going.
  
  It would be nice to see a multiplayer function or even online play. If you're pressed for time, 
 you can exit the game anytime and go back to it again later as it autosaves. Try the free 60-min 
 demo if you've got the time. This is a classic.

Review:  When I first came across Bookworm Deluxe, I didn't know how much I would like playing the game, 
 so I first tried it for free on popcap. com and downloaded a free trial of the deluxe version. During 
 that time playing, I really enjoyed playing the word game, because of the way you could get extra 
 points by making the bonus words or making longer words. Another thing that I enjoy about the game 
 is how each level has rather humorous names with funny pictures that pertain to each level. I also 
 think that it is pretty cool that there is a "Hall of Fame" for the notable achievements during 
 the game that you play in one sitting, such as high scores, longest words or if you got a lot of 
 points for a particular word. In all, I find this to be one fun game to play, because of the enjoyment 
 factor and how easily it is to play the game.
