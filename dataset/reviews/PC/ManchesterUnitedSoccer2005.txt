:::Review:::
Manchester United Soccer 2005 is a difficult game to recommend -- even to fans of the club. 

  In Europe, Codemasters releases a series of "Club Football" games every year, each one geared 
 toward supporters of a different major European team. One of those teams, predictably, is Manchester 
 United -- a club that enjoys such popularity around the world that its game has been judged the only 
 one worth releasing in North America at this time, albeit under the new title of Manchester United 
 Soccer 2005. The game boasts a few interesting features, but it also lacks a number of options 
 that you'd take for granted if you were playing something like FIFA. Unfortunately, Manchester 
 United Soccer 2005 is difficult to recommend even to fans of the team, because, unlike Alex Ferguson's 
 world-class squad, the game doesn't play an attractive, realistic, or even challenging game of 
 soccer.  

          The game looks like soccer, at least.     

  The game's biggest selling point, at least as far as Codemasters' marketing department is concerned, 
 is that it allows you to create a "career player" and add him to the Manchester United squad. The 
 player-editor tool is quite comprehensive, and you should have no trouble creating a player who 
 bears at least a passing resemblance to what you're aiming for. Unlike most soccer games, Manchester 
 United Soccer 2005 doesn't allow you to create a "perfect" player. Rather, it forces you create 
 one with 11 below-average attributes and then grants you skill points to spend on him according 
 to his match performances. It can get a little frustrating having to field an abysmal player in 
 place of a United regular, but there's definitely something satisfying about seeing yourself playing 
 alongside and mingling with the Manchester United team, especially if you happen to be a fan of 
 the club. Other soccer games feature player editors, of course, so this feature actually isn't 
 anything new -- the difference is that it's an integral part of the game here, even after you step 
 out onto the pitch.  

  Manchester United Soccer 2005 essentially features two modes of play that you can switch between 
 at will during any match. The "team" option plays much like any other soccer game, and will see 
 you assuming control of whichever player on your team (you don't have to play as Manchester United -- not 
 in all the gameplay modes, anyway) is closest to the ball. The "player" option, on the other hand, 
 will allow you to control just one player (it defaults to your career player if you've created 
 one) for the entire match. The player mode is an intriguing idea, and if this were a better game, 
 it would arguably offer the most realistic game of soccer around. Unfortunately, you'll find that 
 calling for the ball (using the key that would otherwise be reserved for switching between players) 
 often doesn't result in it being passed to you successfully. Also, no matter how good a soccer 
 brain you have, you'll find it hard to resist the urge to chase the ball all over the park, because 
 the intelligence and tactical knowledge of your teammates is questionable at best -- especially at 
 the back. Goalkeepers are often too slow to come off their lines and seem to go out of their way 
 to get caught in no-man's-land (you can bring them out manually, though doing so is often ineffective) , 
 and rather than close down an incoming striker, your defenders will invariably back off and then 
 turn their backs on the ball, almost as if they're deliberately testing their own keeper and want 
 to see how he fares.  

  For better or worse, your opponents' AI is every bit as disappointing as your teammates', and if 
 you're playing on anything but the toughest of the game's five difficulty settings (which still 
 isn't particularly challenging) , you'll often be able to steal the ball from your opponents' kickoff, 
 walk it into the penalty area, and take a shot at goal. You won't necessarily be able to walk in 
 a straight line, but if you avoid the temptation to run or pass the ball (or to play soccer, basically) , 
 and keep a reasonable distance from the static opposing players, you'll have no difficulty keeping 
 the opposing keeper busy. That's assuming, of course, that you've mastered the game's controls, 
 which are really no different from those in the FIFA and Winning Eleven games, but aren't as responsive. 

  If you're a fan of the Red Devils -- and you'd have to be to even consider buying Manchester United 
 Soccer 2005 -- you'll be pleased to hear that the game boasts a "club album" full of player profiles, 
 photos, and videos (which include a tour of the Old Trafford stadium and replays of some of the 
 team's most memorable goals) . All the content in the club album needs to be purchased, though, 
 using the points you'll accumulate as you progress through the game and enjoy success in league 
 and cup competitions. You'll also be awarded points for successfully completing scenarios based 
 on historical matches, although, inexplicably, the game boasts only six of these. The scenarios 
 included in the game (you can also create your own using a "fantasy match" option) date back as 
 far as the 1999 Champions' League semifinal against Juventus, but they're always played using this 
 season's team rosters and uniforms. To illustrate just how little care has gone into making the 
 scenarios authentic, when re-creating the extra time period in the 1999 FA Cup semifinal against 
 Arsenal (after Roy Keane was sent off and Peter Schmeichel saved a Dennis Bergkamp penalty shot -- unforgettable) 
 the game challenges you to score the winning goal with only 10 men on the field, but when you start 
 playing, you'll have a full team. It's also a little disappointing that you don't get awarded extra 
 points for beating the scenarios on the harder difficulty settings, because once you've beaten 
 them on the easy level, there's really no reason to ever return to them.  

          The Manchester United players are all instantly recognizable.     

  Unsurprisingly, 
 everything Manchester United-related in the game is instantly recognizable -- the players, the uniform, 
 the stadium, and even the replica uniforms being worn by much of the cardboard-cutout crowd (who 
 doesn't cheer goals and so presumably is actually made of cardboard) . The same can be said for 
 all the major teams that warrant their own versions of the game in Europe, but you'll notice that 
 other teams in the game have a much more generic look, and actually all wear different-colored 
 versions of the same uniform. We should also point out that, although the player-model faces are 
 instantly recognizable, they're not as good looking as their FIFA counterparts, and their bodies 
 don't animate nearly as well.  

  Manchester United Soccer 2005, then, is a difficult game to recommend. If you're not a fan of the 
 club, it's a miracle that you even reached the end of this review, and if you are, you're probably 
 well aware of the fact that you can play with your favorite team (and add yourself to its roster) 
 in EA Sports' latest offering. Furthermore, FIFA Soccer 2005 will allow you to challenge online 
 players all over the world, while Manchester United Soccer 2005 supports only four players on a 
 single machine. The final analysis? Just because a game looks like and claims to be soccer, that 
 doesn't mean it is.

Review:  well what can i say this game is ust a disaster, graphics are poor sound poor all is poor the only 
 good this is that the players are sort of recognisable there arn't many options to choose from 
 it's just VERY VERY VERY POOR!! One other thing you can make your own team and your own player 
 but the looks of the player are terrible you just can't make him look like a proffesional like 
 he does not look realistic and the team you make the kits of them are terrible bad poor, the players 
 are not good there passing defending etc.. are rubbish so i suggest you never buy this game a waist 
 of your money!
