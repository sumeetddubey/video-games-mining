:::Review:::
If you have the hardware to run it, this simulation really stands out. 

 Fifteen years ago, Microsoft ruled the computer skies with Flight Simulator. More recently, the 
 civilian flight simulation market has seen some impressive competition rise to challenge the longstanding 
 champion, including such sims such as Looking Glass' Flight Unlimited 3 and Terminal Reality's 
 Fly. However, in what can only be seen as good news for fans of the civilian flight sim, Microsoft 
 has met its challengers with another superb product in the Flight Simulator line.  

 Excluding Combat Flight Simulator, the last version of Microsoft's sim was Flight Simulator 98 - 
 and what a difference two years can make. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 is available in standard 
 form and in what's called the professional edition. The professional edition includes two additional 
 aircraft (the King Air 350 and Mooney Bravo) , six additional cities (plus the six present in the 
 regular edition) , and various extra features, including a flight-dynamics editor. Both versions 
 enhance Flight Simulator 98 by adding the Concorde and the Boeing 777-300, as well as updated versions 
 of some old favorites. But the real payoff comes in two disparate aspects of the game: its graphics 
 and documentation.  

 One of the most daunting things about the early versions of the Microsoft Flight Simulator series 
 was the feeling that you had to do a lot of homework on your own before having any fun with the 
 game. However, Flight Simulator 2000 includes tutorial information right in the manual and actually 
 makes it fun. The outstanding tutorials and accompanying text take you all the way from keeping 
 the aircraft aloft to making an ILS (instrument landing system) approach, and many details in between. 
 There are more than 100 pages of text devoted to these tutorials, and they are supplemented by 
 a great deal of additional material within the game itself. The text is written by Ron Machado, 
 a professional flight instructor whose explanations are uniformly clear, informative, and even 
 amusing. There are even tests you can take to prove your progress. The instructional part of Flight 
 Simulator 2000 is exceedingly well done and should assuage the fears of anyone who is interested 
 in flying but is easily daunted by a steep learning curve.  

 The greatest strength of Flight Simulator 2000 is undoubtedly the graphics. The whole series has 
 been known for its detailed and wide-ranging terrain, and Flight Simulator 2000 ups the ante with 
 12 tremendously detailed cities as well as outlying terrain that also looks good, even far beyond 
 the major urban areas. Weather effects such as clouds and lightning are equally impressive and 
 are modeled accurately during flight. The aircraft look great, and the instrument panels remain 
 the best in the business. Although the graphics in Flight Simulator 2000 might be heaven for the 
 flight sim enthusiast, getting them to look good has a very steep hardware requirement. The box 
 actually says the minimum system for the game is a Pentium 166 with an optional 3D accelerator, 
 but you'd best not even try the game with a machine that slow. In fact, you shouldn't even bother 
 unless you have a high-end Pentium II or Pentium III, or else you'll be too bogged down by poor 
 frame rates to care about much else.  

 If you can get it to run, you'll find that the flight models in Flight Simulator 2000 are superb 
 and seem like improved versions of those included in the previous game, in that they are slightly 
 less forgiving than before. The only problem is that the smaller aircraft ride too smoothly and 
 encounter few of the continuous bumps and jolts that are experienced in such planes even in relatively 
 calm air.  

 One of the key draws of the Flight Simulator series has always been its expandability. Users could 
 always expect a host of third-party commercial and free add-on products in the form of additional 
 aircraft and scenery. However, in this case, such expansions are hardly necessary, as the world 
 of Flight Simulator 2000 is impressively detailed right out of the box. You can even join virtual 
 airlines online and fly specified routes. Its expandability and large user base are a significant 
 advantage that Flight Simulator 2000 has over its competitors.  

 The Flight Simulator series has quite an impressive pedigree, and the latest in the line still shows 
 its good breeding. While its strong competition means that Microsoft's product is no longer the 
 only great simulation out there, the reigning champion isn't yet ready to relinquish its title. 
 If you have the hardware to run it, this simulation really stands out.

Review:  This game has a great seletion of aircrafts to mess around with and plenty of places to fly over, 
 but it just does not feel as good as it should.
  
  It takes a desent computer to run the game, but if you have a good computer this game will run 
 nicely.
  
  This game is a really good Simulator, but some of the Planes/Helis seem a little to hard to get 
 the hang off. Helicopters are dang near impossible to take off with in this game.
  
  It takes a lot of time to get good at landing... Its really easy to glide around up in the air, 
 but when it comes time to land some or the weaker graphics in this game make it a real problem.
 
  
  If your looking for a good plane game and have a good computer then there is no reason not to give 
 this game a try.

Review:  Flight Sim. 2000 is so fun, it may be an oldy, but that doesn't make it bad. In this game you can 
 choose so many different planes, like the concorde, a world war one plane, learjet and many more 
 i just don't want to say them all because i forgot their names. You can also fly a glider and a 
 helicopter. Gameplay is awsome, you can free roam or do a challenge, free roaming is so cool cause 
 you can literally fly around the world. The farthest distance i flew was in a small plane from 
 Chicago to Toronto but there is a challenge where you have to fly a concorde from London to New 
 York City. Graphics are ok for todays standards, sound is great like the engine of the plane and 
 all the other sounds like that are realistic, not sure bout the value cause i bought it at a garage 
 sale. I guess you should buy it for $20 max.

Review:  FS 2000...................... cool
  
  FS 2000 is a good flying game fun for the people and you learn stuff, like how to operate the Radio.
 
  
  the game is easy for beginners and the missions are some quite hard like the mission where you 
 need to land on a aircraft carrier dek, normally that is hard but without the engine its ever harder.
 
  this game is also good for trying new stuff out like gliding with a Boeing 777.
  you can ever ad you own plane with Flight sim designer studio.
  and its all legal.
  
  The 
 tutorial from this game learns you everything basic in flying with the game from taxing to taking 
 off and landing. it learns you how to fly with a small aircraft, and it learns you to fly with 
 the big Boeing 777.
  the graphics are very good from the planes and cockpits and even the big buildings and bridges 
 we all know are in 3D. you can even go past the empire state building with a 737.
  and land behind the white house with the jet ranger.
  i even tried to fly across the world in 
 a P40.
  
  overall there is a lot you can learn by playing this game.
  and its only can get better and better.
  
  Score 8.6/10
