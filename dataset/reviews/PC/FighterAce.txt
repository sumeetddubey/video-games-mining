:::Review:::
Those looking for some action and who don't give much thought to realism shouldgive it a try; those 
 who have played and enjoyed more realistic online flightsims should probably stay away. 

 Following the relative success of Interactive Magic Online's Warbirds, a number of developers 
 quickly began jumping onto the online flight simulation bandwagon. One of these developers, VR-1, 
 attracted the interest of software giant Microsoft, and soon thereafter VR-1's Fighter Ace appeared 
 as Microsoft's first premium pay game on the Internet Gaming Zone. There is no boxed set available 
 in stores; you can download Fighter Ace (around 8MB) straight off of the Internet. The only other 
 requirement is that you'll need Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser software since it's required 
 to access the Internet Gaming Zone (though it will support Netscape soon) .   

 Fighter Ace comes in two pricing schemes: a $1.95 per day rate or $19.95 for a month - both flat 
 fees, so if you plan on flying more than ten days a month, the second rate looks a lot more sensible. 
   

 First off, Fighter Ace is definitely not Warbirds by any stretch of the imagination. The bulk of 
 the action takes place in the basic arenas where the flight models are simplified and the chances 
 of taking off right in the middle of an air battle are pretty good. In fact, the opposing airfields 
 are typically clustered together, making any attempt to actually use real-world air combat tactics 
 a waste of time and energy. Few, if any, pilots fly in the realistic arenas. Consequently, Fighter 
 Ace is not for online pilots looking for realism or real-world physics modeling - at least, not 
 if they want to fly with everybody else.  

 The graphics in Fighter Ace are all texture-mapped, but it doesn't help much. At anything but high 
 altitudes (and sometimes even then) the ground is a horrible hodgepodge of organically colored 
 splotches with little or no real terrain features except for pixelated roads and the occasional 
 hill or big rock. Buildings and airfields are merely adequately done, and the only things that 
 look even halfway decent are the aircraft and the smoke effects. While offline practice is nice 
 and smooth at all detail levels, the same is untrue online. The best thing to do is run the game 
 at the lowest terrain detail level just to make it playable online. Expect some strange problems 
 to crop up because of Net and server lag.  

 On the IGZ there are free-for-all arenas, as well as team arenas where there are four countries, 
 each with an airfield: the United States, England, Germany, and Russia. Each country has four different 
 aircraft to choose from, for a total of 16 aircraft overall. The arenas are further split into 
 the beginner and regular arenas, segregated by online combat experience - once you reach a certain 
 kill/death ratio you are "promoted" in rank.  

 Air combat is fast and furious; aircraft damage models are based on a simplistic percentage system. 
 As damage accumulates, the aircraft's flying performance degrades appreciably. In the simple arenas, 
 each of the different kinds of aircraft fly fairly similarly, with only small yet discernible differences 
 in the modeling. While combat in other simulations involves mastery of your particular aircraft, 
 combat in Fighter Ace involves the mastery of the online environment. Shooting someone down involves 
 little skill except (in most cases) getting behind someone and blasting away. If this happens to 
 you, well, hopefully you have friends around or you know how to take advantage of Fighter Ace's 
 atrocious view system (in this environment, padlock is almost useless) .  

 Admittedly, Fighter Ace does have some things going for it: The air combat does seem to get a bit 
 addictive in spite of the problems, you can tune down the graphics to get rid of the ground textures 
 completely (ending up with something that looks similar to Warbirds) , and the action is never-ending. 
 Those looking for some action and who don't give much thought to realism should give it a try (the 
 first day is free) ; those who have played and enjoyed more realistic online flight sims like Warbirds 
 should probably stay away.

Review:  Nothing that AI can do will EVER compare to the thrill of flying in a squadron of real, live, human 
 pilots against a team of practiced enemy. And a better flight engine has never been published. 
 This is as good as it gets !!
  
  Gamespot's review was written many moons ago. The game has evolved since then. The line-up of planes 
 is extensive. The combat scenarios are rich with variety and challenge. The scenery is terrific. 
 And the camaraderie of participating with a squadron is the real attraction of the game. You need 
 somebody to watch your six.
  
  Ketsujin is the new owner. They have poured money into improvements for the last two years. The 
 results are obvious: flight engine realism, at least ten scenarios running, 200 players on a good 
 night, skill levels for beginning pilots and advanced Aces, and historical simulations allowing 
 pilots to compete for the glory of winning the real thing.
  
  On the downside:
  Expensive.
  Better than average PC equipment required.
  Not enough terrain/map development.
 
  Limited to WWII flight equipment and scenarios.
  
  Possible improvements:
  Korea scenarios with Migs, Saberjets, B-29s and Grumman Panthers
  WWI flight equipment and scenarios.
