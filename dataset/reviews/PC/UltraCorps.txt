:::Review:::
UltraCorps is recommended to anyone interested in a simplistic, slow-paced sci-fi strategy game. 
 

 It's always good to see a game that takes a simple approach. UltraCorps, from VR-1 and available 
 via Microsoft's MSN Gaming Zone, is about as simple as a game can get. This turn-based online-only 
 strategy game is all about patience and conquest, as you struggle to build your empires one day 
 at a time.  

 The game is much like a play-by-e-mail sci-fi wargame, except for the fact that 200-300 other players 
 are competing against you all at once. A single game of UltraCorps lasts for either 30, 45, or 
 60 turns, with either one or two turns per day. All totaled, the game requires an investment of 
 about ten minutes per day - plus the $9.95/month subscription fee, that is. At the end of the day, 
 the game computes all moves, resolves any battles, and updates the universe for the next turn. 
 You can get more for your money by joining more than one game session, since there are frequently 
 three or four concurrent games running on the Zone at any one time.  

 You begin each game with control of a single planet, which is home to a meager population, a small 
 military cadre, and some ultranium (the game's universal currency) . These elements vary depending 
 on the race you decide to play. In all, the game has 14 different races, ranging from the enigmatic 
 Cosmic Needle Men to the strikingly familiar Entradishar (ever see a Simpsons Halloween special?) . 

 Your choice of race also dictates the technology you possess at the beginning of the game. Though 
 UltraCorps does not include a research element of any kind, it does limit you to building military 
 units for which you own a design license. You begin with a few licenses specific to your race but 
 can then purchase additional licenses for any unit in the game (there are more than 30 core units 
 in all) . Once you own a license for a unit, you can build as many as you want so long as you have 
 the people (labor force) and ultranium (money) to do so. Also, each planet in your empire must 
 have its own design licenses in order to build units (I bet Microsoft added that little feature) . 

 Battles take place whenever two fleets meet over a planet. The computer decides the outcome of these 
 battles and reports on them to you the next time you log on, but the results are fairly easy to 
 predict. He who has the most firepower wins - always. Battles last until one side is completely 
 destroyed, so before you deploy your fleets, make sure you know what you're doing. You can always 
 see what sort of defenses a planet has, whether you control it or not (this does not include stealth 
 units, which are invisible until encountered in a battle) .  

 One of the game's most impressive elements is its dynamic economy, which fluctuates according to 
 supply and demand and the buying habits of the universe. For example, Xiron Medical Cruisers are 
 popular because of their high defense value and the number of attacks they get per combat round, 
 so the price of this unit typically skyrockets in the first five to ten turns. Units like the Anti-Population 
 Rover, on the other hand, are basic components in most players' inventories and tend to cost very 
 little to produce.   

 The overall goal in UltraCorps is simple - conquer as many worlds as you can. Still, the game features 
 a healthy amount of diplomacy between players. In fact, while there is no diplomatic model per 
 se, players simply negotiate nonaggression pacts and treaties amongst themselves. The game has 
 its own built-in e-mail and discussion groups, so communication between players is readily accessible 
 and reliable.  

 As far as graphics and sound go, UltraCorps really doesn't offer much. There is no sound, in fact, 
 and the graphics are exceedingly plain, unless you call up an encyclopedia entry for one of the 
 game's units or races (then you get to see a nice hi-res static image) . But that may be part of 
 the game's charm. A fancy graphics engine would only slow down this browser-based game, while adding 
 very little value (if any) .  

 As it stands, UltraCorps is recommended to anyone interested in a simplistic, slow-paced sci-fi 
 strategy game. If you can spare ten minutes a day and $10 a month, UltraCorps is definitely worth 
 a look.
