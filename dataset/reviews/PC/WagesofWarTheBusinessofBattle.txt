Kick ass, take names, and collect your paychecks! Wages of War is outstanding - when it doesn't 
 crash. 

 War is hell. War is evidence of mankind's savage nature. War is also an excellent moneymaking opportunity. 
 In New World Computing's Wages of War, you head an organization of mercenaries. Your task is to 
 complete military missions for different sponsors while making as much money as possible. Kick 
 ass, take names, and collect your paychecks! Wages of War is outstanding - when it doesn't crash. 

 The premise of the game is not unique, but its execution is impressive. You must hire mercenaries, 
 lease weapons (you cannot own them!) , and pay for information and travel. The office setting where 
 you run MERCS, Inc. uses common items as icons for different activities. The rolodex is filled 
 with mercenary profiles, the weapons catalog shows what's available for your men, and the fax machine 
 provides contract and travel information. You can choose any of 16 individual missions involving 
 theft, hostage rescue, and lots of shooting. A campaign option strings the missions together. While 
 more missions would be nice, their time-consuming nature compensates for this shortcoming.  

 Once you have hired, equipped, and trained your people, it's off to the target area. The mission 
 graphics are well presented - a third-person angled perspective reveals great detail. The men run, 
 crouch, crawl, and shoot realistically in a turn-based system. Sound effects include shattering 
 glass, gunfire, and the occasional "I'VE BEEN SHOT!". Even more impressive is Wages of War's AI 
 engine which is smart enough to cause you a great deal of grief as you play. One guard with an 
 Uzi can devastate your entire squad. Smart military tactics do pay off in this game - it's important 
 to learn them quickly.  

 Once you have completed or failed your mission, it's back to the office. You receive a profit and 
 loss statement reflecting your performance. A brilliant clone of Don Adams (from Get Smart) analyzes 
 your financial situation and makes recommendations. Since you only lease weapons, stocking up like 
 Rambo is a waste of money. Experienced mercenaries cost more to hire, so be careful when putting 
 together your teams. Overall, the financial element of the game makes careful planning a necessity. 

 One significant flaw mars this game - it crashes. It crashes hard, and it crashes often. It usually 
 waits until you've spent a couple of hours achieving the mission goals. Suddenly, the screen goes 
 black. This major flaw will sufficiently motivate you to save your work often. Wages of War has 
 great gameplay, excellent graphics, and serious replay value. If New World Computing can make it 
 more stable, it may be the perfect squad-level game.

Review:  I remember as i remember yesterday.. It was a cold winter night and i was standing at the stand 
 of the games at a computer shop with the money i saved from my school expenses.. At that time CD 
 games are so expensive for me and had to choose a longlife playable game.. And i have choosen Wages 
 of War without any clue on it.. 
  
  It is so sad that there had been no game like Wages of War for nearly 13 years.. I have played 
 for about 10 times and still playing it without a bug (!) .. After Jagged Alliance series and Wages 
 of War i dont understand why the companies dont spend any money on mercanery games.. Although the 
 specifications of the weapons and the prediction of the future politics are fully right, characters 
 are very solid (even there is no Turk in the list) and AI is stisfying. If you like turn based 
 strategy games and want to play a worth to play classic, i strongly recommend you this great game..
 
  
  It is one of my best choices and glad to keep it still in my archive.. It is my pleasure to congratulate 
 its makers..
