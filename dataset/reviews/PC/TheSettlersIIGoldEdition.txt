:::Review:::
For those of you who never played the "non-gold" edition of Settlers II, it's best described as 
 a mix of SimCity and Civilization. 

 It seems the latest trend in computer games is the "gold edition" - a re-release of an existing 
 game with new features and enhancements to provide more depth and playability. These gold editions 
 are often a great deal for gamers who never bought the original version of the game, but for players 
 who have already bought the add-ons that are included in the "gold" edition, it's a much tougher 
 sell.  

 And so it goes with The Settlers II Gold Edition. In addition to the original game, the Gold Edition 
 includes The Settlers II Mission CD. What this means is that you get two linear campaigns; an "Unlimited 
 Play" option that allows you compete against up to six computer opponents on any of 30 maps, with 
 control over various game parameters such as victory conditions and resource levels; an excellent 
 map editor for designing your own maps from scratch; and display resolutions of up to 1072 x 768 
 x 256.  

 For those of you who never played the of Settlers II, it's best described as a mix of and , with 
 a heavy emphasis on economics and construction. In the Roman Campaign, for instance, you begin 
 with only a headquarters containing building supplies; to help your tribe grow and expand, you 
 must choose the most efficient order in which to construct new buildings. Before building a sawmill, 
 for instance, you should first erect a house for the woodcutter who'll chop down the trees to bring 
 to the sawmill. New building types become available as your civilization advances (in individual 
 scenarios all building types are available from the get-go) , and before very long you'll find yourself 
 trying to harness a complex economic system in which there truly is a reaction for every action. 

 Players who revel in the minutiae of micromanagement will be delighted with the complex balancing 
 act required here, but less patient gamers will likely shake their heads in bewilderment when things 
 don't work the way they'd anticipated. True, it's all very linear, but even so, trying to track 
 down the missing link in the production line that's responsible for a particular shortage can be 
 maddening. One reason is the manual, an overly wordy and poorly organized affair that amazingly 
 doesn't have a single screenshot of the main game screen. The online help system doesn't tell you 
 anything you haven't already figured out, and the bare-bones walk-through that explains how to 
 build the first three buildings in the Roman Campaign is appreciated but far too skimpy. A game 
 like this practically screams for a tutorial - and such a feature would help it earn that "gold" 
 moniker.  

 You'll eventually engage in combat against other tribes and races, and here too The Settlers II 
 falls short: You have zero control over defensive postures of your troops, and when attacking, 
 you merely choose how many attackers you'll send and whether you should use stronger or weaker 
 troops from your garrisons. If you're looking for deep military strategy here, you'll be disappointed. 

 If you're not searching for sophisticated military options and don't mind investing a few hours 
 mastering the economic model, The Settlers II Gold Edition has the potential to offer countless 
 hours of play - assuming you don't mind playing against computer opponents, that is. You'd think 
 the multiplayer mode would have gotten a major reworking for a "Gold Edition," but instead all 
 that's available is a two-player hot seat mode that requires you to hook up two mice to your computer 
 and play in split-screen mode. That could be for the best, considering the relatively sedate pace 
 at which this game moves, but I'm sure there are some strategy fans out there who wouldn't mind 
 spending an hour or two (or more) in a game over the Net.  

 Players who already own The Settlers II and the Mission CD can easily pass on the Gold Edition. 
 This game is definitely not for everyone, but for those who think they're up to the challenge of 
 lording over a sprawling empire, the Gold Edition is an excellent deal.

Review:  I first played the original Settlers II game while at University. It gave me several hours of stress 
 relief from the contant essay and thesis writing.
  
  Settlers II gold is a great game to just loose yourself in. You can set it going, get the industry 
 working and watch your little guys go to work building and expanding your empire. This you really 
 don't have to think about that much so if you want to clear your mind of the daily grind, this 
 is the perfect thing to play. It has something for any mood you are in. If your mind is too active, 
 the long game play will sort that, if you are in an angry mood, go and kill the computer simulation 
 player (bonus) .
  
  In the gold edition there is also a map editor in which you can make your own maps, with your own 
 resources and starting points. You can make this as easy or wacky as you want them to be. Then 
 go back into the game and try them out.
  
  I am addicted to this game and I would recommend it to anyone who likes real live strategy games.

Review:  Maybe it's because I played this game when I was a kid... hang on I still play this game now and 
 I'm 19. Ok so it's probably not that then. Anyway Settlers 2 is a great game. Back in a time when 
 strategy games weren't all that complicated Settlers 2 was a simple well made game. I think this 
 is mostly due to the road system used in the game. As when settlers 3 came out I rushed out to 
 buy it - only to find that the road system had been scrapped and settlers 3 was just one of many 
 faceless startegy games. But its not just the road system that makes this game great.
  
  The idea of settlers is simple. You have just arrived onto these new shores and you must build 
 up a civilisation from scratch. And although this seems like a large task, is in fact quite simple. 
 You build buildings using the supplies you start with and gather resources. You use the resources 
 to expand and explore and eventually you will run into another tribe that you must take over. This 
 is done by building an army.
  
  And that's it! I can't really explain what is so appealing about it. Is it the cute animations 
 of the settlers themselves? The great sound? Or just building something from scratch? If you haven't 
 ever played settlers I urge you to. It's a simple game that is great fun. But don't go out and 
 buy the newer versions of the game. Settlers 2 Gold Edition is the best.
