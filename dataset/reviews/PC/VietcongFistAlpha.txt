:::Review:::
Fist Alpha offers more of the intense and suspenseful single-player and multiplayer action that 
 made Vietcong the respectable game that it is. 

  Vietcong got a bum rap when it was released a little less than a year ago, even though, for the 
 most part, it was an excellent first-person shooter. Unfortunately, certain bugs and other issues 
 in the shipping version caused the game to perform poorly on some systems, and as a result, some 
 of those who tried it came away disappointed and were understandably dismissive of the game's many 
 fine traits. Well, the game's since been patched into the state in which it should have shipped 
 to begin with, and now, Vietcong also has its very own expansion pack -- for good measure. This add-on, 
 Fist Alpha, is available either as a budget-priced supplement for those who already own Vietcong 
 or as part of Vietcong: Purple Haze, which is a bundle that includes the original game and its 
 expansion  and  also sells for cheap. Either option is a good deal. Though Vietcong has noticeably 
 aged in the past year, it does still hold up to current standards. Furthermore, Fist Alpha offers 
 more of the intense and suspenseful single-player and multiplayer action that made Vietcong the 
 respectable game that it is.  

          Fist Alpha adds new single-player and multiplayer content to Vietcong, one of last year's 
 most overlooked first-person shooters.     

  Fist Alpha is a pretty straightforward expansion that offers up a fairly brief, new single-player 
 campaign set during 1967. Included are eight new multiplayer maps, a new multiplayer game type, 
 and some new weapons. The most surprising thing about the new campaign is how much swearing it 
 gets away with, despite its teen rating. The new main character, Sgt. 1st Class Warren Douglas, 
 is a good ol' Southern boy... with a noticeable propensity for cussing when things turn sour. As 
 well, some of his colleagues -- whom Vietcong players will recognize from the first game -- are just 
 as quick to start flinging the four-letter words around. Anyway, though Fist Alpha's new campaign 
 is relatively short and only about a day's work, it still capitalizes on Vietcong's rather unique 
 mission design and pacing. This means that you'll often find yourself skulking through the overgrowth -- usually 
 following your point man's lead -- while on the lookout for hidden assailants. Though there's understandably 
 not a ton of variety to the environments, the missions themselves are actually quite varied and 
 generally intersperse suspenseful sneaking with brutally fast kill-or-be-killed shoot-outs. The 
 missions are linear, and your progress is automatically saved at key points, which undermines some 
 of the suspense since you'll have a pretty good idea of when you're safe and when you're not.  
 

  Nevertheless, the campaign can be pretty difficult. The Vietcong, as well as the North Vietnamese 
 Army troops whom you'll clash against, tend to be numerous, camouflaged, and careful about attacking 
 from behind cover and in groups. You often won't see them until the flashes from their muzzles 
 betray them. Even once you do see them, it's no easy task to take out a partially obscured target 
 that's firing on you from 50 meters away when you're using a relatively inaccurate rifle that kicks 
 wildly in your hands. Fortunately, your squad will help you fight, and your fellow troops are a 
 significant aid in battle. In fact, you'll notice that they almost can't be killed, though you 
 aren't blessed with this same quality. All this adds up to a healthy challenge, for the most part, 
 though the campaign includes a frustrating stealth sequence near the end in which you automatically 
 fail if the enemy notices you before you silently take him out. (Didn't these instant-fail stealth 
 sequences go out of style more than a year ago?) In addition to the new campaign, Fist Alpha -- like 
 Vietcong before it -- lets you play a randomly generated quick mission in which you'll face assorted 
 enemies with or without a squad at your side. Since the enemy AI is very tough and the core gameplay 
 is good, these quick missions can extend the life of the single-player game substantially.  

  Fist Alpha features a few new weapons that weren't in Vietcong, such as the M14 (with and without 
 optics) , the Sten submachine gun (which features suppressed fire and therefore is perfect for the 
 aforementioned stealth mission) , and the Scorpion machine pistol. Also, bayonets are available 
 for certain weapons and can lead to satisfying (or humiliating, depending on your perspective) 
 multiplayer kills. All in all, these make for good additions to the game's already substantial 
 arsenal of pistols, grenades, submachine guns, rifles, and other weapons. You'll also see a few 
 new vehicles during the campaign, though vehicles don't figure prominently in the gameplay itself, 
 because this isn't Battlefield 1942.  

  Despite the new weapons, the core gameplay hasn't changed in Fist Alpha. You can still move from 
 standing, crouching, or prone postures, and the right mouse button (by default) conveniently lets 
 you switch between shooting from the hip and aiming down the sights. When you're behind cover, 
 the aim button offers the added benefit of automatically making you emerge from cover only as much 
 as necessary, thus allowing you to take potshots while keeping your head down and also preventing 
 you from having to wrestle with the game's controls. This remains an excellent feature exclusive 
 to Vietcong.  

  Though Vietcong uses a proprietary 3D engine developed by Illusion Softworks, it happens to provide 
 a solid multiplayer experience, which Fist Alpha carries onward. A variety of multiplayer modes 
 are available here, ranging from cooperative battles against computer-controlled VC squads, to 
 pure deathmatch and team deathmatch, to capture-the-flag, to a mode called "turn table," in which 
 sides take turns on offense and defense -- with the offensive side trying to capture a number of 
 flags while encroaching on the defensive side's territory. CTF, team deathmatch, and co-op still 
 seem to be the most popular multiplayer modes, and plenty of servers can be found running them 
 at all times via the game's built-in browser. The new maps in Fist Alpha are large and quite cool, 
 such as one that takes place in and around an ancient temple, which conceals an underground tunnel 
 network. Vietcong may not be as smooth in multiplayer as some other shooters out there, but it 
 offers a unique enough feel and a good breadth of options (such as the ability to choose from different 
 character classes, like soldier or sniper) , thus making it a competitive and compelling choice 
 amid a saturated market of war-themed shooters. The simple fact that many people still play Vietcong 
 online, almost a year after its release, speaks volumes.  

          Both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes are available to keep you busy once 
 you're through with the single-player portion of the game.     

  The game's graphics have held up fairly well during the past year, though they've noticeably aged. 
 If you don't get too close to any of the characters or scenery, it all looks quite authentic. Foliage 
 moves gently in the breeze and is thick all around, creating a convincing sense that you are, in 
 fact, in a lush jungle. Character models move their mouths when they speak, and their eyes flit 
 about in search of danger, though the characters look a little blocky overall. Many of the game's 
 animations are great, like when characters vault over fallen trees or search dead bodies and so 
 on. But at times, at least in the single-player, the character pathfinding can be pretty spotty, 
 so you'll see your squadmates getting "bunched up" on one another every now and then, which ruins 
 some of the illusion. At any rate, Fist Alpha doesn't look any better than Vietcong before it, 
 but it does feature the same serviceably good graphics. The audio is still quite impressive overall, 
 and it adds a lot to the game's atmosphere, especially as evidenced by the selection of '60s rock 
 that punctuates the game's menu screen and campaign cutscenes. Other than this, weapon effects 
 and ambient noises seem appropriately loud and realistic.  

  Fortunately, Fist Alpha is compatible with Vietcong game servers, so those who upgrade to the expansion 
 won't be limited to playing online only with those who did the same. That's smart of the designers, 
 who've succeeded in building a sizeable following of dedicated players for their game, not only 
 due to their insistence on ironing out the game's most significant issues but also because Vietcong 
 and the new Fist Alpha expansion offer a decidedly different first-person shooter experience, which 
 is one that presents plenty of action and variety in both single-player and multiplayer modes. 
 So if you're a fan of Vietcong, for 20 bucks this add-on is worth your while. And if you passed 
 on Vietcong the first time around, now's a fine time to give it a second look.

Review:  It is a great multiplayer game, it had many good thinks and only a few bad. I start whit the bad: 
 voice chat is pretty weak on-line, but good on lan; there are some minors bug, but not annoying. Now 
 the good stuff: you can created your own servers free and have many playing  
 more) ,VC sniper its just great, the VC sapper pouting booby-traps its innovating and deadly (in 
 jungle maps are quiet heavy to spot) , calling air-strike in jungle its very interesting using the 
 map details, very easy and useful commands on both side that will help you communicate whit other 
 players, the maps are amazing, especially the ones in jungle (65% are jungle type maps) were you cant 
 hide very easy ,So if you want to play WWII you play Call of Duty 2, if you want to play Vietnam 
 war you should play Vietcong: First Alpha, the best game about Vietnam war.

Review:  This game occur 3 months before the story of the first game and you are a new character Douglas 
 Warren and you find yourself in the jungle of March 1st 1967 as you searching for a pilot whom 
 his F-105 plane craqshed in the jungle due the Vietcong. All your friends from the 1st Vietcong 
 are here besides Nhut and your pointman is Nham Nguyen (you'll find out later when and why Nhut 
 will come) The story is very interesting if you liked the first Vietcong because it's cool to see 
 how things evolved for example the game occurs when the Nui-Pek base is still under construction!
 
  
  The graphic and the sound of the game are same as they were in the first game since it's a EP of 
 course but there are lots of new thing besides the story:
  
  The US will get 3 new weapons: (M-14 W\O Optics and Silenced Sten MK-II)
  While the North Vietnamese 
 get 4 new weapons: (Vz 61 Scorpion , SVT -40 W\O Optics and Degtyarev LMG) .
  
  The game has only 5 missions but as you know every mission divided to 2 or 3 sub-mission but since 
 it's a EP the game is very short compared to the first game...
  
  The MP still suffer from Bugs issues but this game is recommended for the people who enjoyed from 
 the first game and wants to know more about the plot.

Review:  Since Fist Alpha is connected to Vietcong through the pairs Purple Haze combo pack, a separate 
 review is almost unnecessary. Pterodons lean prequel follows the ill-fated tour of SFC Warren 
 Douglas (whose down-home speech mannerisms are a welcome improvement over Hawkins peculiar Casey 
 Kasem impersonation) as his team makes nice with the local Montagnards while hashing out the relative 
 safety of their base camp at Nui Pek. The game reproduces the originals beat-the-bushes approach 
 to semi-realistic guerrilla warfare very satisfactorilywith one ginormous failure of an exception, 
 which Ill get to in a moment. I was also glad to see the original crew members return as Douglas 
 relatively dependable sidekicks, with a late arrival by good old Nhut as a replacement player for 
 the ARVN team. It was also nice to see the formative trenches and foxholes of Nui Pek, in a heartwarming 
 homecoming sort of way; after all, the camp and its darkened, dirty subterranean huts were a very 
 familiar setting by the time the area was overrun by enemy forces in the original.
  
  Apart from Fist Alphas interesting shift to a point earlier in the games timeline and its corresponding 
 use of a protagonist whose death is guaranteed (Hornster confirmed that much, as well as the circumstances 
 of Douglas demise, at the very beginning of Vietcong, so I found myself bracing for that moment 
 throughout certain parts of the prequel) , I spouted many a curse for the Pterodon crew for the 
 horrible design choice they made for the execrable stealth sequence included in the Field Guns 
 Battery level toward the end of the game. True, the hated one wrong move, and this partys over 
 convention also appeared in Fist Alphas last level as well as Vietcongs POW rescue scenario, 
 but the solution to the challenge in question was so random and unrealistic, I was tempted to simply 
 stop playing  and, brother, I aint a quitter. After trying a number of approaches  almost all 
 of which involved me crawling on my belly at an excruciatingly slow pace under what I thought was 
 ample cover, only to have the disgraceful FAILURE message appear for no discernable reason  I 
 can confirm that the lucky headshots recommendation in DEngels excellent walkthrough really 
 is the only method that works. I found myself wondering if the designers and testers for Fist Alpha 
 played through that section (which honestly comprises only a miniscule portion of an otherwise 
 fun seek-and-destroy level, except for the hours worth of quickloads it requires) and actually 
 said to themselves, Yep, thats some good gaming, there. No, no it wasnt, and the fact that 
 the gameplay builds to such a whimper is a harsh mark against an otherwise entertaining return 
 to the hazardous jungles of Vietnam.
  
  My recommendation for those who enjoyed Vietcong but dont have much patience for broken stealth 
 sequences is to pretend that Douglas caught his unlucky AK bullet at the very end of the fantastic 
 series of skirmishes in the Preventive Strike level and then shut the game down. Anyone with 
 the fortitude to press on, and who does enjoy a well-staged silent kill or two, will probably have 
 fun pinging the perimeter lookouts in the last level and hanging around for a proper sendoff of 
 what was mostly an endearing hunting simulator.

Review:  Gameplay:
  It plays different than most of the shooters you might have played, like COD and MOH. You need 
 to pay attention to your surroundings. Cause when the enemy hits you, they'll do it hard. They 
 will duck behind cover and throw grenades at you. Making it very hard at times. But your worst 
 enemy in this game is your squad. I found it to be a great tactic to rush ahead leaving them behind. 
 Not a hard job since they seem to get stuck all the time. The AI have terrible pathfinding. How 
 on earth could they release an expansion without correcting the AI problems??? An excample of how 
 bad the AI is programmed, On attacking the temple in one of the missions I was lighting a cig after 
 blowing the door with C-4. While smoking I had a good view of two sqaudmembers. Inside the tempel 
 the Vietcong was firing at something. And the command lines for this scenario must have been something 
 like:
  IF - Vietcong shoots even though unable to hit you.
  THEN - Hit the dirt.
  IF - Vietcong dosn't fire there weapons for two seconds.
  THEN - Stand up.
  This went on for 
 about 10 munuttes. And thats how the game plays from start to finish. The AI never miss an oppurtunity 
 to get in your way or block your path.
  One thing was improved compared to the original. The tunnels was made wider... AARRGGHH! Graphics:
 
  Released in 2004? Well you could have fooled me. Far cry, half-life 2 and doom 3 was from 2004 
 as well. Let's just say that it could and should have been better or just released in 2002 :)
 
  
  Sound:
  They have got this right. Weapons sound really good. And the natives speaks in their own tongue. 
 They also scream things at you while fighting, very very good. Dialogue is also well done. Value:
 
  I got the game aa a really good price. And it did take me roughly 5 hours to complete. So if it 
 wasn't for all the stuff!!!
  
  Tilt:
  If you loved the original then this a good buy. And if you hated the original! Well then you'll 
 have 5 more hours of pure hate to deal with. Well four, the last hour was more frustrating and 
 painful : (

Review:  Vietcong added more maps and fixes to its add on in fist alpha and if you played vietcong you will 
 see more of it in fist alpha. I love the multiplayer and in it the co-op games. Sometimes the enemy 
 is hard to find and have enough of them. The Ai can be in a class of real mean. I hate them firing 
 on you from behind bushes and then laughing at you while you die.
  
  The replay value is high and we around here do a lot of it on our LAN. Having the regular co-op, DM, TDM 
 and CTF now with computer ai members during CTF too!
  Graphics and sound are not explosive but well done. In the single player the gtame was action packed 
 and a great story line as well as having historical accuracy and even the music. You should be 
 able to find this game in a affordable price as it has been out for a while start looking in the 
 bargin bins.

Review:  If you played the first vietcong & liked it you'll welcome fist alpha with open arms. Its not as 
 good as call of duty but fist alpha takes one of the best shooters from last year & makes it much 
 better. I just play it online because it has a great multiplayer (mabey one of the best) . So if you 
 just have a 56k or you still send smoke signals do us all a favor & don't buy it. On the other hand 
 if you have a strong surround sound set up & a cable modem you'll be in for a hell of a ride. The 
 net code needs some work but this is an stand alone game no quake 3 engine, so you gotta cut em 
 some slack. If you nit pick this game you'll have a long list, if you just play it you'll have 
 one kick a$$ shooter on your hands!
