Baseball Mogul 2005 has all but ignored the recent evolution of text-based sports management simulations. 
 

  Time seems to be standing still for the Baseball Mogul franchise. Developer Clay Dreslough and 
 his Sports Mogul company have all but ignored the evolution of text-based sports management simulations -- as 
 witnessed by more-comprehensive efforts like Out of the Park Baseball -- and have held on to simplistic 
 graphics and monolithic gameplay since 1998. The recently released 2005 edition is so out of step 
 with the times that it reminds us of those rainbow uniforms that the Houston Astros continued to 
 wear long after the Day-Glo 1970s had come to a close.  

          Lahman database support lets you guide any team from 1900 and beyond, although numbers 
 still aren't scaled to represent different eras.     

  At times, you might think that you've been playing Baseball Mogul 2005 since the 1970s. It's almost 
 a tradition that this series changes little from one year to the next, but so few improvements 
 have been made between the 2004 edition and the 2005 edition that it's hard to tell them apart. 
 The structure of the new game is nearly identical to its predecessor. You take over the operations 
 of a Major League baseball club, looking after every facet of the organization from setting the 
 starting nine to determining what ticket prices will draw the biggest crowds. As always, the bottom 
 line is the bottom line. While winning on the field is important, success is measured by how much 
 cash you have left over at the end of every season. So while you can win it all with a collection 
 of high-priced superstars, you might bankrupt the club in the process and mortgage the entire future 
 of the franchise for that brief moment of glory in October.  

  Tense? Sure. There's an undeniable attraction to trying to build a franchise that wins games, draws 
 fans, and makes truckloads of cash all at the same time. But we've seen it all before. It's one 
 thing to stick to what you know and build upon a game's strengths. It's another thing entirely 
 to copy the previous game.  

  And when we say copy, we mean it. Even the look of the new game is a mirror image of the old one, 
 with the same dreary roster screens and clunky play-by-play interface. Many players have agents 
 whose faces have been in the game for years. The lone addition to the game seems to be a baseball 
 cap-wearing frog, who has been dropped into a number of menu screens as the series' new mascot. 

  Gameplay in Baseball Mogul 2005 is virtually identical to that of Baseball Mogul 2004. Last year's 
 significant upgrades -- specifically, Lahman database support so that you can begin play with real 
 Major Leaguers in any season from 1900 to 2004  and  the dropping of the points system for salaries 
 in favor of actual cash -- have been carried over in their entireties, with few noticeable additions. 

  There just isn't enough in the way of depth here. Finances remain far too simplistic to engage 
 all but the most casual baseball gamers for long. You either keep the payroll down and hit the 
 sweet spot with ticket and concession prices -- or you don't and wind up crippled by debt. Although 
 this can lead to some interesting moments, especially if you're guiding a sad sack with little 
 fan interest and even less cash (Bonjour, Montreal!) , you can only adjust the price of tickets, 
 beer, ice cream, and hot dogs so many times before ennui starts to settle in.  

  With just these four principal economic factors in the game, there isn't enough to do, especially 
 if you've been playing this series for a few years. This limitation also makes teams too dependent 
 on gate receipts. George Steinbrenner's Yankee empire doesn't rise and fall depending on the number 
 of hot dogs sold in any given week, so it seems strange that this continues to be a central part 
 of staying in the black in New York. So you wind up playing rich clubs like the Yankees and Dodgers 
 much like you do the Twins and Royals, because there aren't enough elements in the game to represent 
 the stranglehold that the wealthy teams have on such things as merchandise sales and TV rights. 
 The former isn't in the game at all, and the latter is too simplistic, with just three options 
 (regular broadcast, pay-per-view, and local blackouts) . There isn't enough of a swing in broadcast 
 revenues between rich and poor, either, with the cable channel-owning Yanks bringing in just $20 
 million or so more than the likes of impoverished small-town rivals like Oakland.  

  Other financial elements in the game remain unrealistic as well. Rich teams start with about the 
 same amount of cash in the bank as poor ones. (There's only a $20 million or so difference between 
 the Yankees and the Expos, which is meaningless in a game where midrange pitchers demand north 
 of $10 million a season.) This means that teams can fall into debt far too readily. You should 
 at least be able to blow the bank in New York or LA for a few years before running into debt trouble. 
 Falling into debt is still ridiculously suicidal, too. Wind up even a few thousand bucks in the 
 red and you lose the ability to re-sign players who are asking for more than the market minimum, 
 which can gut your franchise overnight. As always, this seems needlessly gimmicky. Can a $200 million 
 baseball franchise somehow not qualify for a bank loan? Can it really exhaust all of its financial 
 reserves in a single season?  

  Also, you still aren't given room to maneuver when it comes to player contracts. Agents continue 
 to demand sums that can only be adjusted by playing with the number of years in the deal, meaning 
 that a lot of the time you have to simply walk away from superstars. This happens in real life, 
 of course, but there isn't even any pretense that you're negotiating here. You either meet the 
 demand or let the player go. And since broadcasting isn't a meaningful factor and merchandising 
 is excluded entirely, the richest clubs in the game have to abandon star players just about as 
 often as their poor rivals. This makes for a more level field of play, but it doesn't seem right 
 that big-market teams have to suffer the financial issues more common to small-market teams.  

 
          Play-by-play is so bland that there isn't much point in watching games unfold.     

  But at least those star players are putting up more-realistic numbers now. The out-of-this-world 
 stats (Babe Ruth hitting .552, Steve Carlton winning 34 games, etc.) that marred last year's game 
 have been dialed back to Earth. In the three dozen or so seasons we simmed (from all eras of the 
 past century) , the numbers were generally in line with those that are being posted by current Major 
 Leaguers. This means that you still can't go back to the "Dead Ball" era or even the run-challenged 
 late 1960s to see numbers accurate for the time, but at least the contemporary statistics better 
 reflect reality now. Player ratings have been switched from letter grades to numbers as well, which 
 both seems more professional and flows more smoothly with the stats.  

  All in all, Baseball Mogul 2005 is something like a comfortable old shoe that's finally starting 
 to fall apart. Revamping some of the graphics and switching the player ratings system from letters 
 to numbers make this seem like more of a remake than a sequel. Gameplay has been allowed to stagnate, 
 which is very disappointing considering that Baseball Mogul 2004 indicated that changes were on 
 the way. Playing a big-league owner and looking for the perfect ticket price still possesses a 
 bit of the "just 15 more minutes" magic that made this series so enthralling in its heyday, but 
 this franchise desperately needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.
