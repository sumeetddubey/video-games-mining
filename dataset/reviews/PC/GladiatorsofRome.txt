:::Review:::
If you can get past its problems, you may find Gladiators of Rome to be a quirky strategy game that's 
 interesting to play -- at least for a little while. 

 It's not really clear why Activision Value and Cat Daddy Games chose October of 2002 to release 
 Gladiators of Rome, a PC strategy game that revolves around traditional Roman arena battles, especially 
 considering the fact that the popular motion picture  Gladiator  came and went two years ago. The 
 game doesn't look or sound too spectacular, and its gameplay falls short in several areas. But 
 if you can get past its problems, you may find Gladiators of Rome to be a quirky strategy game 
 that's interesting to play -- at least for a little while.           For your glorious victory, you 
 earn... a thousand bucks?    

  In Gladiators of Rome, you control a team of up to 10 gladiators, whom you buy from your local 
 slave pen. Basically, you recruit gladiators from several weapon-based character classes (such 
 as mace, hammer, blade, axes, and bows) and then participate in arena battles against other gladiators 
 in preset matches as part of a linear single-player campaign. Each gladiator class has a standard 
 attack, a standard defensive maneuver, the ability to walk or run to different parts of the arena, 
 and two additional special abilities (for instance, the hammer gladiator has a double attack that 
 deals double damage and a stun attack that briefly paralyzes a group of enemies) , but you'll find 
 that through most of the game long-range weapons like slings and bows aren't as reliable as close-range 
 weapons. The actual gameplay generally comes down to ordering your team of gladiators to attack 
 the opposing team until one group dies off, though you can also play the crowd by cheering at them, 
 or using "finishing" attacks to down nearly-dead opponents -- either of these actions can win you 
 more prize money at the end of a fight.   

  Gladiators clearly draws inspiration from the Baldur's Gate role-playing series for its fighting 
 system. All fights take place in real time, but since you'll be spending all your time giving specific 
 orders to specific gladiators, you'll generally have to pause the game frequently by pressing the 
 space bar, exactly like in Baldur's Gate. At its best, Gladiators is surprisingly enjoyable, because 
 it has simple tactical elements, such as using a hammer fighter's stun ability to set up another 
 gladiator's follow-up attack. At its worst, Gladiators is sluggish and boring, since all your gladiators' 
 actions are dependent on onscreen bars that indicate your stamina, and you'll often find yourself 
 waiting for your gladiators' stamina to replenish before you can execute your next maneuver. You'll 
 also likely have problems with your gladiators' poor pathfinding and slow foot speed, which often 
 result in pitched battles turning into a single ugly mass of arms and legs on the battlefield -- one 
 in which it's difficult to target the enemy you wish to defeat.           Battles can often get 
 messy.    

  There are several other problems that you could cite about Gladiators of Rome. For instance, the 
 game has only three arenas (each of which has only a handful of fights, which you perform in a 
 single, linear order) , so it's not terribly long. And just as your gladiators will have to overcome 
 their initial enemies to get to their more-challenging foes, you'll have to overcome the game's 
 lackluster graphics and sound to get any enjoyment out of the game. Gladiators of Rome is a 3D 
 game that uses simplistic, occasionally primitive 3D graphics to represent its drab arenas and 
 its limited selection of gladiator models. Though these gladiators can be outfitted with different 
 weapons and armor that show up on the actual character models, they're still pretty blocky, and 
 their animation is extremely limited, including nothing more than animations for walking, running, 
 and a few maneuvers.   

  Gladiators of Rome's sound isn't particularly noteworthy either, since your gladiators possess 
 only a few generic sound samples that become repetitious quickly, and the whole game is set to 
 forgettable synth-orchestral music that's appropriate but easy to ignore. The game also doesn't 
 try very hard to stay true to its subject. For instance, you buy your equipment and slaves using 
 "dollars," and you train your gladiators by clicking on a little statistic button that increases 
 their abilities (which are represented by green numbers on a status screen) rather than by training 
 in a slave pit.   

  Gladiators of Rome had a lot of potential -- the idea of fighting massive tactical battles against 
 enemy gladiators and ferocious beasts could have made for an intriguing game. As it is, the game 
 is still somewhat enjoyable in a simplistic way, but it's doubtful you'll enjoy it for long.

Review:  Basically you buy slaves.
  
  The higher priced the slave is the more abilities that he has to fight in the arena. You are trying 
 to win matches to gain money to buy better slaves, and equipment to win in the tournaments. 
  
  It's not about the slaves fighting for freedom, it's about winning - why would you want to 
 let your winning slave go free?
  
  As you enter in the first few challenges your placed against opponents with poison on there daggers, 
 smart moves, better abilities. Your quick thinking and know - how has to get you throughout the 
 next levels.
  
  There's basically no plot or thought to the game. Just you, making your way to fame with your array 
 of slaves and there better equipment. Of course your skill does decide the winner also. In the 
 later levels your placed 4 vs 1 or matches 2v2v2 free for all. It's very hard to command through 
 all the chaos, as of course there's no pause button and hardly any time to strategize. 
  
  All in all, look at it - but don't waist your hard earned money. I made that mistake, I'm trying 
 to keep YOU from doing the same.
