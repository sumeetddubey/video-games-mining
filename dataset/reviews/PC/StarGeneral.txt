Sometimes, when you get a game design just right, it's okay to coast for awhile. 

 Sometimes, when you get a game design just right, it's okay to coast for a while. That's what SSI 
 has done to some degree, and who can blame them? Panzer General was a slick, sweet design that 
 became the best-selling war game of all time. It was easy to learn, hard to win, and very well-crafted. 
 Allied General offered more of the same without much change to the system, while Fantasy General 
 took the whole thing to the world of elves and fairies, complete with spells and fantasy landscapes. 
 Now, Star General takes the system still further while staying with the basic design, and in the 
 process creates an eminently fun, beer-n-pretzels conquer-the-galaxy game.  

 Star General is an intergalactic wargame with minor resource management and diplomatic elements. 
 It is not, nor does it attempt to be, a deep, Master of Orion-style strategy game. The fun of it 
 comes from its wide open play and two-level design. You begin a game of Star General in one of 
 two ways: either as a single, set game or as a randomly generated campaign. The individual scenarios 
 have specific goals, such as conquering planets A and B, and pre-set enemies. There are some problems 
 with many of these scenarios, namely unrealistic turn limits that require you to conquer an armada 
 and two planets in, say, 15 turns. Not bloody likely.  

 The best way to play is the custom campaign generator, which allows you to create the universe you 
 want to play, and pick or randomize opponents. You can set universe size, planet density, diplomacy 
 options, starting funds, tech levels, and other features to produce just the kind of game you want. 
 The universe generates itself, and you begin the conquest of a new and unexplored galaxy, defeating 
 enemies and seizing planets as you go.  

 Play itself is on two levels. You usually begin in the space around your base planet. Using some 
 starting funds, you begin to build your empire on the ground and in space. You can zoom down to 
 the planet level, which can have varying landscapes and city configurations. To help generate new 
 resource points, the common coin of the game, you build revenue-generating structures on the planet 
 such as mines, factories, and biodomes. A military complex enables you to build ground combat units, 
 while a tech facility will research new unit technology.   

 You can then zoom out to the space level and build your armada of space ships, which follow the 
 familiar patterns of naval combat from Panzer General. Battleships, cruisers, destroyers, gunboats, 
 and other space ships each have their own unique abilities, with different ratings for range of 
 movement, attack, defense, armor strength, and so on. With this armada, you will explore the black 
 void of space, seeking out new planets to colonize and enemies to engage. When you have beat an 
 enemy's space fleet, you can close in on their planet, bring up troop transports loaded with ground 
 units built on your home planet, and begin the ground war.  

 It's this dual ground/space attack that makes Star General such a blast. Combat follows the Panzer 
 General style of simplified move and attack, with some nuances to each unit ensuring a strong tactical 
 wargame element. Play is tough - damn tough at times - and an early patch to the AI has already 
 been released to make it tougher yet. If there is a flaw it is with the modest quality of the graphics. 
 There are some 100 space units and almost as many ground units in this game, coming from seven 
 different races. At times it's almost impossible to tell a cruiser from a light cruiser from a 
 destroyer, and more refined graphics would have lessened this problem. But that's the only fly 
 in the ointment here. While it's no great leap in design innovation, Star General is simply a good, 
 challenging, fun game.
