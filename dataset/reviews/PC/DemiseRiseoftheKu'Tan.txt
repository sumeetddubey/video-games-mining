:::Review:::
Demise's generally crude graphics and poor sound effects do little to mask the flaws in its otherwise 
 simplistic gameplay. 

 Artifact Entertainment's Demise: Rise of the Ku'Tan has the straightforward hack-and-slash gameplay 
 of a standard dungeon crawl ... but very little in the way of looks or sounds. This might not seem 
 surprising, considering that the game's development began about four years ago and has experienced 
 a number of delays since then. Unfortunately, time hasn't been kind to Demise; its generally crude 
 graphics and poor sound effects do little to mask the flaws in its otherwise simplistic gameplay. 

 Despite the complex story described in Demise's manual, the game itself is nothing more than a first-person 
 dungeon crawl. You start in the town of Dejenol and create a party of up to four characters from 
 a combination of nine different races and 12 different character classes - though only a few classes 
 are actually available to each race. You then set forth into the dungeon to fight monsters and 
 search for treasure and experience points; as you venture deeper into the dungeon, you'll find 
 tougher monsters and better loot. The adventuring is done in a node-based first-person view reminiscent 
 of older computer role-playing games like Wizardry and The Bard's Tale. Your party will hack its 
 way through the dungeon, loot the occasional treasure chest, and engage and kill (or be killed 
 by) just about every monster it encounters, and gain experience points for doing so.  

 Unfortunately, Demise has a number of problems right from the start. The game's interface is divided 
 into a convoluted set of mouse-driven submenus that clutter the screen. It's easiest to manipulate 
 the interface using the game's keyboard shortcuts. But these shortcuts aren't printed out on a 
 handy quick-reference card, as they should have been; instead, they're hidden in the pages of the 
 game's hefty, yet vague manual.  

 Once you've created your party, you'll venture into the dungeon and begin the game's limited and 
 repetitive routine: Fight monsters and gain experience points, then return to town to sell your 
 loot, heal your wounds, and convert your experience points into character levels. And that's about 
 it. Though over time your characters can advance to level 100 and beyond, they'll be doing the 
 same thing at level 80 that they did at level 1: Enter the dungeon, fight monsters, head back to 
 town, then head back to the dungeon again.  

 Demise's actual combat is hack-and-slash stripped down to the bone: It's round-based and completely 
 automatic. Essentially, all you'll do is walk into a room with a monster in it, initiate combat, 
 then sit back and hope for the best as your party and the monsters exchange blows in real time. 
 And even if you can appreciate this sort of mindless, hands-off gameplay, whatever enjoyment you 
 derive will always be cut short by your characters' inevitable need to head back to town to lick 
 their wounds or gain a level. As such, even if your characters are extremely accomplished, they'll 
 spend an undue amount of time on the easier upper levels of the dungeon, fighting their way out 
 to get back to town or fighting their way back into the lower levels. You might think that Demise's 
 up-to-16-player multiplayer options would add at least some diversity to the game, but they don't. 
 Multiplayer in Demise is purely cooperative; there's no competitive play, no player-killing, and 
 no real variety; it's just you and up to 15 other people wandering about, killing stuff, gaining 
 loot and experience points, then heading back to town.  

 Perhaps as a consequence of the game's development difficulties and the delays that resulted from 
 them, much of Demise looks rather outdated. Certain parts of the game, like the character portraits, 
 are displayed with hand-painted 2D art - some of which looks quite good. Unfortunately, the majority 
 of the game takes place in Demise's 3D dungeons. And the dungeons themselves - and most everything 
 in them - look quite bad. They consist of tiled corridors and rooms, and many of these tilesets 
 are overly simple and bland. In addition, these corridors and rooms are decorated with static fixtures 
 that are simplistic and crude. The dungeon's denizens don't look much better - Demise's monsters 
 are blocky, poorly animated, and, in some cases, downright silly.  

 And, unfortunately, Demise also sounds about as poor, overall. The game's background audio consists 
 alternately of unobtrusive faux-symphonic tracks and ambient sounds, neither of which is particularly 
 offensive, though neither is especially good. And some of Demise's sound effects, like the running 
 water of a decorative fountain or the buzzing of a magical teleporter, are likewise acceptable. 
 However, many of the game's monsters sound absurd, and nearly all of the game's monster-related 
 events - such as when monsters flee from combat, steal money from your adventurers, or offer to 
 join your party - are heralded by falsetto voice samples that are completely ridiculous.  

 Demise isn't a complete disaster - if you can forgive the game's poor graphics, silly sounds, and 
 clumsy interface, and if you're satisfied with aimless hack-and-slash gameplay, you should by all 
 means consider downloading the 100 MB demo. But if you'd prefer a single-player role-playing game 
 with an engrossing story or an online multiplayer game with a sprawling world to explore, you should 
 look elsewhere.

Review:  It's a dungeon crawler at it's heart - take a look at it's predecessor (Demise is also referred 
 to as the The Dungeons of Dejenol 2 if I'm not mistaken) and you will see that it's basically a 
 Rogue-like.
  
  Some users (csf-60) can't even write a review properly - one does not rate a Rogue-like having 
 spent less than 10 hours on it. I'd even go so far as to say, you don't have any business rating 
 a Rogue-like without having spent a week at it.
  
  As far as Rogue-likes go, Demise is average. Which translates to hard in casual gamer lingo. You're 
 going to get your ass kicked if you don't pay attention to the details. It's fairly easy enough 
 to jump right into it, but without an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the character 
 races and classes you will quickly end up with a dead party, again and again. Demise is BRUTAL.
 
  
  ... which just adds to it's demented charm. Bone up on the stats like any good rules lawyer and 
 you will see that it is prudent to build an all-brawn party with a thief to scout the terrain ahead 
 and pick up loot to prepare for your REAL long-haul party.
  
  Unfortunately I picked this up way early when it was buggy, and I never got around to re-trying 
 it. Hopefully the next time around I can finally finish the dungeon. Bear in mind this brief romp 
 which got me down as far as level 6 in the dungeon took me 2 months. Yes, that's right people, 
 2 friggin' months... just to get strong enough to reach the 6th floor. It's maddeningly tough, 
 and the pain just keeps me coming back for more.

Review:  After reading some of the reader's reviews it is clear that some people narrow down RPG to their 
 small vision. As I grwe up with CRPG's as Larn, Moria, Nethack I find that Demise and Mordor (the 
 first release from David Allen in 1995) very good and after all those years these are the games 
 that I put on evry new computer I have owned or still own and play them both on regular base (o 
 and they even work good under WinXP) . Despite the simpel looks there is a lot under the hood that 
 is quite interesting and I mean statistics (I love this!) . It is terrible that people judge games 
 by their appearences (as I say to my customers: if you want good graphics, buy a DVD!) . The Gamespot 
 reviewer would do better if he changed job and become a DVD-reviewer, he has no understanding about 
 gameplay.
