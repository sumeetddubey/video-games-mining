:::Review:::
TEKWAR has an interesting story line and is certainly a nice anti-aggravation device, but it fails 
 to accomplish anything else. 

 What do you do when you're thrown into the middle of a city ruled by Tek Lord kingpins with an arsenal 
 the National Guard would be jealous of? That's right, you blow the crap out of everyone in sight! 

 TEKWAR is a typical first person shooter. Walter Bascom, a. k. a. William Shatner, will debrief you 
 on your mission objectives; then, depending on whether you succeed or fail, he'll shower you with 
 praise or threaten you with deep-freeze. As interesting as the premise sounds, the game just isn't 
 that exciting. The missions quickly become repetitive and tedious as you hop the subway over and 
 over again, traveling from one section of the city to another in search of the Tek Lords.  

 Although the city scenes in TEKWAR are realistic and intriguing, the graphics are blocky and the 
 movement of the characters is jerky and lifeless. In the Matrix level, which you can only access 
 after you have captured all the TekLords, the simple and repetitive graphics are confusing and 
 it is easy to get lost. You'll wonder why you bought a $3,000 computer to display circa-1978 graphics. 

 TEKWAR's artificial intelligence is also feeble. For example, a Tek goon can unload a barrage of 
 bullets on you and the city's police officers won't shoot back. However, if you whip out your gun 
 to return fire, the cops will start filling you with lead. This inevitably leads to the annihilation 
 of a whole city population as you gun everyone down to keep yourself alive. (Take it from me: go 
 for the kneecaps and the head!)   

 However, TEKWAR's biggest shortcoming is its lack of solid documentation. William Shatner's mission 
 briefings are uninformative and you are often left to figure out on your own exactly what to do. 
 Also, there is hardly a mention of the Matrix in the documentation, which adds to the confusion 
 on this already mind-boggling level.  

 TEKWAR has an interesting story line and is certainly a nice anti-aggravation device, but it fails 
 to accomplish anything else. This is a shame; the premise behind the game had the potential to 
 be a real treat. In a market overloaded with 3-D shooters, TEKWAR offers nothing new or innovative; 
 it's mediocre, at best.

Review:  TekWar was a pretty popular TV/book series. It had many fans and was overall very good. But throughout 
 that, Capstone showed up and made a game out of it. And I'm sure you can guess the outcome of that.
 
  
  The game plays very slow. Basically you wander around the city (s) looking for the Teklords. Then 
 you kill them, and you continue on to another level in which you do the same thing. The Teklords 
 are always hiding in some kind of hideout, and is protected by armed guards. This is pretty cool 
 because the game has thriving cities with pedestrians and police officers patrolling the streets.
 
  
  But, to do all this - kill the guards and Teklords - you're going to need some weapons. And Tekwar, 
 surprisingly, does pretty well here. Instead of the standard pistol, shotgun, machine gun etc. 
 you have more creative weapons such as flamethrowers, taser guns and more. But there's only one 
 problem; the weapons are loud as hell. Well, not really, but they seem to attract every cop in 
 the city and make the civilians run around screaming, no matter where you are. Sooner or later 
 you'll have to make a one-man stand against every police force officer in the city, including the 
 Teklord/Tekguards, and chances are you'll be face-down in the pavement sooner or later. Good potential... 
 but bad execution.
  
  There's also a 'matrix' world with lots of new enemies and stuff - very strange, but a pretty cool 
 idea and it looks interesting overall.
  
  The whole story is basically like the series, and that's good, but that's the only decent part 
 of the story. The way the game actually presents it is horrible. You've got an opening intro which 
 is an abomination; you can barely identify anything. The people barely even resemble human beings! 
 Before a mission you get a briefing but it's not the least bit informative - all they tell you 
 is that you've got to kill a Teklord and you've got to be careful. Once you're in the mission you 
 have no clue what to do. Bleh.
  
  The graphics are decent. The textures look nice for the most part, and the weapons look cool, but 
 the enemies are rather messy. It looks like they tried to incorporate the detail of a real-life 
 person - but it's so pixelated it does more bad than good. There's also lots of bugs with the graphics 
 - sometimes the cops/tekguards display their shooting frames when they're walking forward, dieing 
 frames when they're shooting etc. How on earth did that get into the final version? Level design 
 is rather poor for the most part but occasionally there's some cool stuff.
  
  The sound is just bad. Really bad. It's hard to hear most of the voices because it sounds so muffled. 
 Weapon sounds are too quiet. Overall, meh.
  
  As for replayability, well, there's really nothing to bring you back to the game. Not sure if this 
 game is even possible to complete because it's so buggy. But overall you probably won't even complete 
 the game the first time because it's so poor.
  
  Even if you do replay it you'll know where the Teklords are, so it will be rather boring.
  
 
  Altogether I think I can classify this as another failed attempt by Capstone. The bugs completely 
 kill the gameplay and the sound makes your ears bleed. This could have been great. Avoid this one 
 at all costs - It's just another grab at your money from Capstone.
