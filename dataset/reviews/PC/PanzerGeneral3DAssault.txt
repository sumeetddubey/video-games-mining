:::Review:::
Though the 3D graphics can occasionally lead to command and control problems, the game is based 
 on a good underlying system. 

 With its all-new 3D graphics engine and a handful of new features, Panzer General 3D Assault brings 
 this popular turn-based tank-warfare series back for a third go-round. Though the 3D graphics can 
 occasionally lead to command and control problems, the game is based on a good underlying system 
 and offers the same brand of gameplay that made Panzer General such a huge hit. In short, it's 
 more of the same, only better in most respects, which ought to be good news for fans of the series. 

 It won't take long to spot Panzer General 3D Assault's most prominent new feature: Instead of painted 
 backgrounds and prerendered units, the game uses true 3D terrain maps and tiny little 3D-rendered 
 unit graphics. As a result, this Panzer General looks very much like a tabletop miniatures game 
 (but one played on a really cool tabletop that comes complete with rivers and little cities) . The 
 graphics are mostly good, and the rolling terrain is quite impressive. Unfortunately, the game 
 suffers from the same problem as Panzer General II: Units in city hexes often get lost amidst the 
 scenery. Also, aircraft float above their hexes but are often tough to pinpoint in areas cluttered 
 with other units. Ordering aircraft to attack other aircraft can be confusing as well, as you must 
 click on a destination hex square to move the planes, but then click on an airborne target that 
 looks as if it's in a completely different spot.  

 However, once you get used to the 3D interface, most of these issues fade away. The only one that 
 stays with you throughout is the lightning-fast combat resolution that occurs when units attack 
 one another if you turn off the unit animation. As any Panzer General veteran knows, the combat 
 animations are great for the first scenario or so, and then you shut them off to speed up gameplay. 
 However, in Panzer General 3D Assault, it's difficult to tell what happened in a particular engagement 
 unless you leave the animations on and watch the combat unfold. Otherwise, you pretty much have 
 to go back and find the combatants on the map and highlight each to see who came out on top. Obviously, 
 this is more of an issue when the AI takes its turn, since you can control the pace of your own 
 attacks. You can click through moves to speed them up, but this can get repetitive. It's too bad 
 there's no way to speed up the animations without actually skipping them.  

 Of course, there are some real benefits to the 3D engine. For starters, the maps and units are very 
 well rendered, which gives the game an impressive and consistent look. Also, units that have sustained 
 damage in combat will smoke and flame at varying levels to let you know their status. This is actually 
 quite helpful when you're skimming the battlefield to see how things stand.  

 If you've played previous installments of this series, you probably won't have to change many habits 
 in order to adapt to 3D Assault. Deep inside Panzer General 3D Assault's newfangled exterior lies 
 a game very much like its predecessors, with the same basic wargaming system at play. Some of the 
 extra features that had been added to Panzer General II are alive and well in this installment, 
 including leaders with special abilities. Also, you can now make multiple moves and attacks with 
 your units - the better a unit's leader is, the more actions it can take in a given turn. Some 
 leaders let bombers operate even in bad weather, provide first-strike capabilities on every engagement, 
 or let units avoid support fire from enemy artillery.  

 The game offers a new interface for managing all your leaders and the rest of your army between 
 scenarios. Though the units look toy-like, and the process of assigning a leader to a unit could 
 stand to gain a confirmation dialogue, this army-customization screen is fairly effective at simplifying 
 the task of outfitting and upgrading your troops.  

 Panzer General 3D Assault includes eight campaigns that take place on the Western Front. Four of 
 the campaigns are lengthy, full-fledged affairs, while the other four are much shorter minicampaigns. 
 You can opt to command American, German, British, or French forces, and as in any Panzer General 
 game, you can adjust all the various difficulty and game settings, such as the quality of reinforcements 
 for both you and the AI.  

 The sound effects are pretty solid throughout, and each type of unit sounds appropriately different. 
 Also, though they grow old in a hurry, some of the attack animations look pretty good. Dive-bombing 
 attacks on ground units are particularly fun to watch. As with many SSI games, the musical score 
 will probably strike a love-hate relationship with you; if you like the idea of stomping German 
 forces to John Philip Sousa, then the music will suit you just fine.  

 Overall, Panzer General 3D Assault is a solid game built upon a proven game system. Despite its 
 occasional problems, the 3D engine is a nice addition, and the gameplay is akin to Panzer General 
 II with an even broader set of features, which should please most fans of the series.
