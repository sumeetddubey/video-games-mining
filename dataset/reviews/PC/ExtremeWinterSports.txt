:::Review:::
About the only thing Extreme Winter Sports really succeeds at is to remind you of how much better 
 other snowing and skiing games are than this lifeless sim. 

 That relentless summer heat getting you down? Dreaming of those brisk winter days where the powder 
 was perfect and you could do no wrong? Then dream no more, because Head Games' Extreme Wintersports 
 lets you vicariously relive all those moments and many other adrenaline-packed adventures - all 
 with a price tag that'll help you afford those new ski boots you've been eyeing for the last three 
 months.  

 No, wait a minute - I just can't do it. You see, that's the way a lot of reviews were written in 
 the bad old days, when some PC game magazines kowtowed to publishers for fear they'd pull their 
 advertising dollars (or not advertise in the first place) . So here's the truth about Extreme Wintersports, 
 or at least my decidedly biased version of it: This game exists only because Head Games managed 
 to talk Arctic Cat (snowmobile manufacturer) and K2 (ski manufacturer) into sticking their names 
 on the box and allowing their products to be featured in the "game."  

 At first glance, Extreme Wintersports would seem to be several notches above such Head Games oddities 
 as Top Shot (a target-range simulation) or the nauseating Extreme Paintbrawl. At least it's based 
 on sports that have been made into fun games in the past. But about the only thing Extreme Wintersports 
 really succeeds at is to remind you of how much better other snowing and skiing games are than 
 this lifeless sim.  

 Like Extreme Tennis, Extreme Wintersports opens each session by sending you to a Pro Shop where 
 you're supposed to pick out equipment and accessories - but none of your choices have any impact 
 on how you perform when you hit the slopes or trails. You just look at the stuff and pretend to 
 buy it, then choose skis, a snowboard, or snowmobile all over again when you finally play. Head 
 Games could have added 15 or 20 minutes to this game's play life by giving you a budget to work 
 with while in the Pro Shop, but that idea probably got nixed because it would show how boring the 
 rest of the game is.  

 Once you finish with the advertising fluff, you leave the shop and try your hand at one of three 
 sports: skiing, snowboarding, or snowmobiling. How "extreme" is the skiing? Well, don't be expecting 
 any freestyle acrobatics; all you do is head down a slope in hopes of racking up the fastest time. 
 Snowmobiling? Except for some ridiculous power-ups you can grab to cut your time or give you a 
 speed burst, the only thing "extreme" about this event is the railroad ties someone's thoughtfully 
 scattered in your path on the cross-country courses. That leaves snowboarding, which clocks in 
 slightly higher on the fun level by giving you the chance to perform some acrobatics - but there's 
 no half pipe for pulling off really outrageous maneuvers, and things get old pretty quickly here 
 also.  

 Miss a flag while practicing skiing - yes, practicing - and you've got to start all over again after 
 some "cool" guy calls you a loser. Snowboarding practice sessions end with the same jerk's voice 
 if time expires before you reach the bottom of the run (or at least I think that's why the session 
 ends - it might have something to do with a mysterious meter on the left side of the screen that's 
 not mentioned in the two-page "manual") . Those fancy snowmobiles are almost impossible to control 
 no matter what input method you choose (you can't reconfigure keyboard or joystick commands, by 
 the way) , and after a few runs you'll be ready to pack it in for good. Topping off this boring 
 mess are the earsplitting sound effects preceding each race that you'd swear were ported directly 
 from an Atari 2600 game - a suspicion that grows stronger when you hear the pathetic Atari whine 
 used for the snowmobile or the grating hiss that's supposed to be the sound of someone skiing. 

 The best you can say about Extreme Wintersports is that HeadGames, K2, and Arctic Cat apparently 
 got what they wanted: HeadGames was able to crank out yet another budget title, and K2 and Arctic 
 Cat got either licensing dollars or free advertising, or both. Too bad no one ever thought to include 
 gamers in the equation.
