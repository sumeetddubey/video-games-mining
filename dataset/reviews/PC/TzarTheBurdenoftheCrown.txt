:::Review:::
While Tzar may have borrowed a great deal from other strategy games, it failed to inherit several 
 of those games' strategic amenities. 

 Tzar: The Burden of the Crown is a solid but derivative real-time strategy game. It looks decent, 
 sounds mostly acceptable, and plays fairly well, but it suffers from a few specific problems - 
 most notably its own lack of originality.  

 Tzar takes place in the Dark Ages, circa 500-1000 A. D., though it also incorporates elements of 
 fantasy, such as magic spells and fire-breathing dragons. The game lets you play as one of three 
 medieval civilizations: Asian, Arabian, and European. During the course of the game, each of these 
 may develop differently, but as in many other real-time strategy games, they must all begin the 
 game in the exact same way: They must all gather resources, build structures, and amass an army 
 to defeat the enemy.  

 Tzar has a handful of distinctive features. The first and most obvious of these is its four-part 
 late-game technology tree. Though most missions require you to begin by harvesting resources with 
 your peasants to build an economy then move on to create a basic military, you may also choose 
 from four special guild structures: the warriors' guild, the mage tower, the religious center, 
 and the trade center. Each structure may supplement your kingdom with advanced military (in the 
 form of interesting special units or magical powers) or with economic support (in the form of enhanced 
 economic and trade options) . Each of these structures is restrictively expensive, so much so that 
 you won't be able to afford to build even one until you've gathered thousands of resources for 
 your cause. As such, you must choose wisely. Though you may find that certain civilizations' options 
 are more powerful than others, for the most part, these guilds - and the civilizations themselves 
 - are fairly well balanced. And in addition to the guild structures, Tzar also includes magical 
 artifacts that increase a unit's abilities or let it learn a magic spell.  

 Unfortunately, Tzar has very little else in the way of original content. In fact, you've probably 
 seen most of what Tzar has to offer in another recent game - Ensemble's Age of Empires II: The 
 Age of Kings. Much of what you'll find in Tzar - from its four basic resources of food, gold, wood, 
 and stone, to its medieval, pseudohistorical premise and its use of different real-world cultures 
 - closely resembles Age of Kings.  

 But while Tzar may have borrowed a great deal from Age of Kings, it failed to inherit several of 
 that game's strategic amenities - and a great deal of its depth (aside from the obvious fact that 
 Age of Kings had 13 different civilizations to Tzar's three) . For instance, though you can garrison 
 your vulnerable peasants against enemy attacks, you must do so manually by selecting your peasants 
 and ordering them into your castle; and once they're in, you can tell them all to emerge, but you 
 must manually reassign each to his tasks.  

 Tzar would also have been much improved had it taken advantage of two of Age of Kings' particularly 
 elegant combat options: the fact that grouped units move at the speed of the slowest unit, and 
 the ability to assign marching formations. Tzar has neither, and thanks to its poor unit pathfinding, 
 its battles are much worse. This is because most of the battles in Tzar take place later on in 
 the game, between large armies of varied units with different strengths and movement speeds, so 
 trying to control these large-scale battles without the aid of formations - or decent pathfinding 
 - can often be frustrating. What's worse, your troops will often become confused when they encounter 
 terrain obstacles such as cliffs or mountains; they'll split up and wander in a completely different 
 direction, which can make large-scale military maneuvers even more difficult. And these pathfinding 
 problems make Tzar's already difficult campaign even worse; in much of the campaign, your armies 
 will be greatly outnumbered by even larger battalions of enemy troops. Defeating a larger, more 
 powerful enemy force is difficult; trying to do so with a large, unorganized army of your own is 
 even worse.  

 Despite its gameplay problems, Tzar looks quite good. The game lets you play at resolutions of 800x600 
 and 1024x768; it looks good in the former and even better in the latter. Tzar's buildings aren't 
 represented completely to scale, as Age of Kings' impressive cathedrals and wonders were, but they 
 are fairly detailed and colorful. In contrast, Tzar's units are much more detailed, meticulously 
 animated, and they look excellent overall.  

 Unfortunately, Tzar doesn't sound quite as good as it looks. Though all of the sound effects are 
 effective, Tzar doesn't have any sort of audio cues for unit acknowledgement. Units are strangely 
 silent when selected or given an order. This is unfortunate, since different voice cues for different 
 units might have made managing the huge armies in Tzar's large-scale battles a bit easier. In addition, 
 Tzar's music consists mostly of strident and rather silly fanfare that gets tiresome quickly. Fortunately, 
 it can be turned off easily.  

 For all the criticisms that can be weighed against it, Tzar is still a solid game. It's fairly balanced, 
 it has some depth, and thanks to the included scenario and campaign map editors, it has some replay 
 value as well. Unfortunately, Tzar greatly lacks originality - it borrows from other, more sophisticated 
 real-time strategy games, but it doesn't assume some of the more advanced options that made those 
 games easier and more enjoyable to play.

Review:  When I first got this game, I was just amazed by it. Still am to this day, it is a great RTS, but 
 also a compelling RPG (all right the story could use some help, but hey, whatever) . All units can 
 gain experience, and most can use items. 
  
  The "Tzars" are the Arabians, The Asians, and The Europeans. Each has a uniqueness to it, for example 
 their wizards and priests do different things/spells. The game basically runs like this... very 
 similar to most RPGs...
  
  You start out, you have a castle and some peasants, with some nearby resources. The resources in 
 the game are Gold, Stone, Wood, and Food. In my opinion, gold and stone are the hardest to get, 
 as their mines run out rather quickly, forcing even the most hardcore turtles and base builders 
 to expand, because your base is mostly secondary, it is all units really. Trees also because they 
 don't grow back and you might not start by a lot. Food is unlimited, where it be from irrigation 
 fields (infinite) , fish (finite) , or cows (Milk infinite, meat... well you kill them so Finite) . 
 You have a wide variety of buildings to build, things to "research/upgrade", and units to train.
 
  
  The population limit is 200 max but considering every unit costs 1 each, that is plenty big. The 
 game includes a lot of myth from all 3 cultures, there are Djinns, Dragons, Golems, Vampire bats, 
 skeletons, ghosts, etc. The ultimate goal of the game... destroy your foes, sounds familiar doesn't 
 it?
  
  By my description this may seem like every other rts, but I own a lot, of every genre, about 50 
 total I would say. But, you must play this game to truly experience the brilliance, and skill put 
 into it.
  
  Besides, it has insanely low requirements.

Review:  To some people, they think this game is crap. Just because it may be old, and the gameplay isn't 
 that great, if you actually spend time on this game, you can find it entertaining. Now, finding 
 this game nowadays isn't that easy since it's a really old game. When I first bought this game, 
 and it came with another game, I thought, 'Man, this game is nothing compared to the RTS games 
 that are out there now'. But actually, when I spend some time in it, it wasn't that bad. The gameplay 
 isn't that horrible, in fact, I found it amusing. The unit selection was a lot and to most RTS 
 games, the space of your empire is low. But in this game, it's pretty tremendous. The variety of 
 skills and buttons you press is large. Try this game out, you might like it.

Review:  What in the world is this? I mean this game is one of the hardest I have ever played in my life. 
 You are frequently outnumbered and outgunned by your enemies. The sound is not too good either. 
 There are no acknowledgement sounds for the units. The music just plain sucks. The graphics are 
 pretty good though. I also had a few minor stability problems. Also, this game is so long that 
 you probably have to spend a good 50 hours finishing the campaign. If I were you, I'd save may 
 money for a better game such as Warcraft of Command and Conquer.

Review:  The sound and the graphics r the best. Really fast with some cheats, code, and hints. Controlling 
 armies then attacking your enemies is so intense. It is like owning your own world. I would recommend 
 this game for people of all ages who like an exciting PC game!!!!!!!! It is not some game that 
 is beaten within a day. This is day, week, months of work and winning or losing battles. You will 
 want to play this every minute of every day. 24-7. Oh Ya. It may take a while to learn and remember 
 where you can get, buy, and build every thing. But that is one fun part. Panic. AWESOME!!!!!!

Review:  Tzar was a great game for many reasons. One of them are the graphics i got the game in a demo pack 
 last Year (2005) and i thought the game had just came out but when i looked it up to buy it i found 
 that it was over 5 years old! this was very amazing to me i would have to say. Another reason is 
 its replay you could spend hours and hours playing this game. Even though it was a great game it 
 had its faults. Even though the graphics were good they werent That good and some of the spells 
 and attacks are kind of lame but non the less this is not my type of game but somehow it sucked 
 me in.

Review:  Tzar has a good idea to it, but there are still many problems that may tick off many users. For 
 instance, After a giant fight, invisible walls are put up, restricting movement and trapping units. 
 This is very common to when gates are a major battlesite. Also I have had some problems where i 
 get an error midgame that says usually an archer is screwed up. However, the game removes the character 
 and the game goes on. The story mode is both compelling and hard at the same time. It leaves quite 
 a good challenge to most veterans of these types of games. The leveling up of characters is also 
 a good idea for those who want to raise a surprime army. I felt that there could of been more types 
 of charater sets, and each with far different options. Mostly the three groups were just the same 
 except for different buildings, charaters, and the fact that some skills seen in other clans were 
 not seen in the clan you could be looking at Overall a pretty good made game and is probably one 
 of the best stratagy games for the computer considering it's age.
