:::Review:::
With so many better options available, Harbinger's shallow gameplay and limited replay value make 
 it difficult to recommend. 

 While most action role-playing games, such as the extremely successful Diablo series, are set in 
 a fantasy world, Harbinger attempts to stand apart from the crowd by taking on a sci-fi theme. 
 Although the futuristic setting is a welcome change of pace, Harbinger falls short of the mark, 
 with half-baked action and role-playing elements that are overly shallow and simplistic.       
     Harbinger is a big, lonely ship.    

  The game takes place on the titular space cruiser, in which a small band of outcasts hides away 
 in a tiny corner of the ship. Harbinger is a slave ship, and most of its occupants are trapped 
 aboard under the iron-fisted control of a being known only as "the overlord." Amidst the backdrop 
 of a major war between the ship's primary factions, you and your band of misfits attempt to stay 
 alive.   

  There are only three character classes to choose from in Harbinger: human, gladiator, and culibine. 
 The gladiator is a cyborglike robot infused with the consciousness of a living being, while the 
 culibine resembles Diablo's sorcerer character, though in practice, all the classes play about 
 the same. While the different classes have special gadgets they can use -- the gladiator can control 
 remotely operated cameras and the human can drop mines of varying types, for example -- these items 
 actually don't figure prominently into the gameplay because of play-balance issues between the 
 attack types.   

  All three classes have a ranged attack, and the human and gladiator have true melee attacks. When 
 engaged in close-quarters combat, the culibine can use a spell-like ability to damage enemies in 
 a small radius around her. However, almost all ranged attacks from enemies in Harbinger are slow 
 projectiles that are easily dodged. You can also outrun just about all the enemies in the game. 
 As a result, you'll find that the entire game consists of running away, firing off a couple of 
 shots, dodging your enemies' shots, and then running some more. There is no point in putting yourself 
 in harm's way by moving into melee range when you can avoid damage altogether by just running and 
 shooting all the time. While you could argue that this kind of shallow gameplay is a feature of 
 almost any other game of this kind, Harbinger lacks the fun elements that better action RPGs possess. 
   

  There are few monster types in Harbinger. In fact, for some bizarre reason, the game has about 
 as many different types of treasure chests (in which you can find items and weapons) as it does 
 enemies, especially if you count the same soldier carrying three or four different weapons as one 
 unique type, and the same bug with slightly different coloring and textures as one type. Each character 
 class has only four different attributes to choose from when it gains an experience level. Since 
 melee combat is more or less useless, that leaves three useful attributes per character. This relative 
 lack of traits or new skills to unlock essentially takes all the excitement out of gaining levels. 
   

  There isn't even any fun in finding new weapons and armor, because each character can use only 
 extremely specific types of armor or weapons. Gathering money doesn't even come into play until 
 about three-quarters of the way through the game, when the merchant finally turns over his inventory 
 with better items. About the only thing you'll want to buy are health packs, because you can almost 
 always find better equipment in the field.   

  The only depth to be found in Harbinger is the fact that different enemies are vulnerable to different 
 types of attacks. For example, robotic opponents are weak against EMP attacks, while the buglike 
 cimicidae are vulnerable to electricity. Once you find a weapon that can fire all four different 
 types of attacks, you're all set for the rest of the game, and playing is just a matter of swapping 
 different attack types into the same weapon.           The few voice-overs in the game are accompanied 
 by comic-book-style speech bubbles.    

  Unlike Diablo, Harbinger doesn't feature randomly generated maps or any multiplayer options; it's 
 strictly a single-player game. Although the three classes play along separate but parallel mission 
 paths that intersect from time to time (with limited branching options) , the replay value in Harbinger 
 is extremely limited -- it's unlikely that you'd want to play the game again with another class after 
 beating the campaign once.   

  Graphically, Harbinger is no better than average. While it has some reasonably detailed environments, 
 the game suffers from a lack of frames in its character animation and occasional slowdown when 
 a lot of enemies are onscreen. There isn't a lot of music in the game aside from some background 
 pieces to set the mood, and the sound effects are fairly basic, so even the game's production values 
 are particularly engaging. With so many better options available, Harbinger's shallow gameplay 
 and limited replay value make it difficult to recommend, even with its modest retail price of $30.

Review:  Okay, to be honest, I liked this game at the very beginning. I loved the witty banter from my character 
 in the comic-booklike dialogue. And it kept me there for quite an extent of the game. However, 
 the numerous flaws in the engine and the gameplay really bogged me down.
  
  The opening sequence (the show off) is silly, long, and just not very related to the game at hand. 
 I like the opening movies to actually give me some sort of insight into the gameplay. Not give 
 me a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach about one of the characters.
  
  The game quickly descends into a paceless grind that doesn't end, levels that are too large to 
 care about, and I ended up feeling totally cheated in the end. A total anticlimax after a massive 
 fight with a nearly unbeatable foe. I don't think I'll even be going back to play a different race 
 than I started. I played the Colbine.
  
  I did love the wit and cheer of the main character and the stories that I was actually playing 
 the game to discover, but there was no other substance.
  
  Come to this game expecting a Diablo meets Gauntlet syle of wave-after-wave of monster conquest; 
 apparently no happy ending for characters you come to love; and finally a complete lack of any 
 sort of a ending reward (cut scene, tying up loose ends, anything at all.)
