:::Review:::
Mystery of the Mummy is fundamentally a pretty unoriginal adventure game. 

 In Frogware's new graphical adventure game The Mystery of the Mummy, you play as Sir Arthur Conan 
 Doyle's renowned inspector Sherlock Holmes, and you must investigate the mysteriously abandoned 
 mansion of a British archeologist. But the setting is basically an excuse to send you through a 
 series of enclosed areas, solving some pretty unoriginal puzzles along the way, because Mystery 
 of the Mummy is fundamentally a pretty unoriginal adventure game -- the kind that essentially consists 
 of several puzzles separated by some brief cinematic cutscenes and a whole lot of backtracking. 
 As such, you might find it hard to appreciate Mystery of the Mummy unless you already consider 
 yourself to be a great fan of adventure games.           Yeah. No shinola, Sherlock.    

  Mystery of the Mummy is played from a first-person view in pseudo-3D environments that you can 
 look through and pan about as you go. Occasionally, you'll happen upon an item that you can pick 
 up and add to your inventory, then later use to solve one of the game's puzzles. The game's story -- that 
 Holmes is on a case to investigate the spooky home of an Egyptologist who has mysteriously vanished -- unfolds 
 in cinematic cutscenes that play each time you solve major puzzles. Unfortunately, like with so 
 many adventure games in the past few years, Mystery of the Mummy's puzzles are often unintuitive 
 and even nonsensical; it makes no sense at all that the world's greatest sleuth would be spending 
 his time using a fork on a painting to reveal a scepter to use on a fan to shatter a vase to recover 
 an ankh, or that he'd be trying to complete a slider puzzle with a picture of a sarcophagus on 
 it. These puzzles generally aren't too challenging, either; you can actually solve most of them 
 by experimenting with every item in your inventory, though you occasionally have to perform the 
 traditional adventure-game pixel hunt by carefully moving your pointer across the screen until 
 you find the hidden piece of the next puzzle.   

  The puzzles might seem appealing to longtime fans of traditional adventure games, but unfortunately, 
 the game's graphics probably won't seem appealing to anyone other than adventure-game die-hards. 
 Mystery of the Mummy runs at a fixed resolution of 640x480, though from the looks of it, the game 
 itself was designed at an even lower resolution, because nearly everything in Mystery of the Mummy 
 looks blurry and unfocused. It doesn't help matters that Mystery of the Mummy's color palette is 
 generally dark and drab -- especially when some of the game's puzzles require you to hunt for hidden 
 items and switches. Considering that most modern computer games have begun to use 3D graphics, 
 it's safe to say that Mystery of the Mummy would have, and should have, looked better with a fully 
 3D graphics engine.           How about a scepter behind a painting you have to use a fork on? 
    

  Mystery of the Mummy also doesn't really sound like much -- Sherlock Holmes himself often makes loud 
 remarks that serve as hints when you uncover clues and important items, and while Holmes' lines 
 sometimes seem as though they're delivered a bit too enthusiastically, his dialogue is appropriate 
 enough. Other than a few canned sound effects that signal a completed puzzle, Mystery of the Mummy 
 has no other sound besides its subdued music soundtrack, which isn't all that great but really 
 isn't especially noticeable. Strangely, the game has absolutely no music when you first start the 
 game, and no title screen either -- you just end up staring at a menu screen full of icons in complete 
 silence.   

  The opening menu serves as a good indication of how substandard Mystery of the Mummy's production 
 values are and how stripped-down the entire game seems as a result. The game's blurry graphics, 
 sparse sound, and unimaginative puzzles probably won't impress anyone, though true-blue adventure-game 
 fans will at least appreciate the fact that Mystery of the Mummy is a fairly lengthy game that 
 sells for a budget price of just $20 at retail. Unfortunately, it's also completely linear and 
 offers no real replay value. While it's true that new PC adventure games are getting more and more 
 scarce, it's also true that much better adventure games than this have come along in recent years.

Review:  This game was going okay, but then at one door puzzle it would not work. I tried every combination, 
 and I consulted a walk-through for the correct combination, but no go. It was, of course, a room 
 vital for the plot.
  
  The game was merely okay up to that point -- the game controls and the graphics worked okay. Of 
 course I don't know how it progressed from there and ended, but it had not been interesting enough 
 up to that point for stopping to feel a loss. I suppose for anyone who enjoys mediocre pulp fiction, 
 there might be some potential IF they can make it beyond where I failed. I don't know.
