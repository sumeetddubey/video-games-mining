:::Review:::
Microsoft Golf's designers focused on the elements of a great golf game without going overboard 
 on the bells and whistles. 

 In the world of PC sports gaming, golf games are kind of like the royal family - first to arrive, 
 cultured over time to a high level of sophistication, and currently resting on their laurels. Microsoft 
 Golf is a perfect example. Using the exact same game engine and add-on courses as the terrific 
 Links series from Access, this game is fun, challenging and easy to get into. It does not, however, 
 bring anything particularly new to the table.  

 The question is, then, do we want anything new? As certain members of the British royal family has 
 recently proven, doing something new (adultery, phone sex and divorce) may not be the best way 
 to endear oneself to the public. Taking that lesson to heart, Microsoft Golf's designers focused 
 on the elements of a great golf game without going overboard on the bells and whistles.  

 And as far as golf games go, this is one of the best. From the smooth interface and fast redraws 
 to catchy voiceovers, putting grids, fly-bys and tips, Microsoft Golf will see to it that your 
 round of golf is enjoyable, immersive, and, perhaps most important, quick. One minor problem: it's 
 next to impossible to develop consistency when chipping from around the greens - but most golf 
 pros will tell you chipping is one of the hardest parts of the game.  

 Replays from normal and reverse angles let you decide whether to play a mulligan or save the replay 
 for later viewing. (See - now you've got a way to prove all those golf stories you've been telling.) 
 You can play against a friend or the computer, or log onto the PlayerNet for long distance modem 
 battles. And for those who crave variety, Microsoft Golf is one of the few golf simulations that 
 comes complete with two different courses, both of which are very good.

Review:  Easy to play and very hard to win if you are a beginner. A business oriented mindset kind of game 
 for those in heat or on heat and in need of a cool off at work places off the random insanity that 
 goes on in and out of our work places, to the luxury of and comfort of brushing shoulders with 
 the wealthy to do to play it in real or pro as in the ghettos of far away Soweto townships. It 
 is like the biblical garden of eden of the old testament here you are more than Adam, yes you are 
 in fact the tree of life as well as that of the knowledge of good and evil. The field is like Adam, 
 it doesn't matter just, play!. The locks or lock ups on the way in case you are not lucky are the 
 sand holes and the bushes or the pools of waters are also Eve herself. The ball is nothing in this 
 respect but Lucifer with the club or clubs being your sole authority on earth or the eden as Adam 
 under God's supervision.
  
  Microsoft Golf, is the fastest game to learn to play to finish that I know of, it is as soft as 
 a gentle flowing river yet it is a spring which could also be said to be a lake in wait at bay, 
 it generates a powerful turn of flow to turn bins to effect a mechanic accuracy to ignite a stream 
 of electrons to produce electricity at the least provocation.
  
  With highly athletic looking players to excite you to swing or stroke as they do in real life of 
 play. Unique scenery and advanced and enhanced graphic representation at its highest peak. Cool 
 strokes of the ball to hole, with little or no effort but just a club of a mouse button to effect 
 a stroke as gentle as one wants it or as hard as one can hit all regulated by on screen navigational 
 aids.
  
  Choose a player and difficulty to start with, with lots of clubs of dimensional probabilities at 
 your disposal, it is very easy to free one's self at lock uo points or positions in the little 
 woods or bushes to the sandy pits. Off course the ball is rolled back into the field of play when 
 in falls into the pools of waters to add beauty to the game to relax and conserve your energy as 
 you play along to fine tunes of strikes of the ball with lots of clubs for easy and quick ease 
 of strokes of the ball to perfect tuition on course if you want to learn of the game it self.
 
  
  You can play as single or multi player in a tournament or on a training course. With gentle breeze 
 of fine windy air blowing down the turf of play at the plush and luxurious turf know to man and 
 made by man on earth up to date from the popular ones as in Monte Carlo to lesser known ones in 
 South Africa.
  
  Scores are collected at end of play for total submission for the declaration of the eventual winner 
 of a hole.
