:::Review:::
It's important to understand that The Covert Operations is not a sequel to Command & Conquer, but 
 merely a rehash of it. 

 Down in Texas, there's a saying that goes Too much ain't enough. After playing Command 
 &amp; Conquer: The Covert Operations, I think it's probably safe to say that this adage doesn't 
 necessarily apply to computer games. In fact, Westwood Studio's add-on disk to last year's best-selling 
 strategy title proves almost the opposite point: Too much of a good thing can actually be a bad 
 thing.   

 It's important to understand that The Covert Operations is not a sequel to Command &amp; Conquer, 
 but merely a rehash of it. The graphics, weapons, sound effects, and interface have all been directly 
 ported from the original game, with nary an enhancement in sight. And apart from the new ten multi-player 
 maps and fifteen single player missions, the only significant additionsand it may be a stretch 
 to call them significantare seven new music tracks, which can be listened to either during 
 the game or on a standard CD player.   

 But as much as The Covert Operations resembles Command &amp; Conquer, it's not nearly as much fun 
 to play. The main problem lies with the missions themselves  not only are they outrageously 
 difficult, but their design makes then seem more like puzzles than tests of strategic skill. There 
 are few, if any, players who will be able to complete any of the missions in a single session; 
 in fact, most will quickly be reduced to move and save mode as they struggle to discover 
 the one correct solution that will lead to victory. This rigid, linear mission design 
 completely eliminate the raw edge that makes a real-time strategy game interesting, and it will 
 make playing The Covert Operations a chore for all but the hardest of hardcore Command &amp; Conquer 
 fans.   

 A great story would have helped to compensate for these design flaws, but there is none to be found 
 on the disk. Unlike Command &amp; Conquer, which pulled you -- ready or not -- right into the fray 
 and kept you there with a wicked blend of cinematic cut scenes and unpredictable plot twists, The 
 Covert Operations takes an a la carte approach, allowing you to play any mission in any order. 
 There's no greater purpose or goal to worry about, nothing to save, nothing to achieve. It's almost 
 as if Westwood is saying Pick a mission, pick a side, play, quit, whatever  we don't 
 really care. If they don't care, why should we?  

 The one redeeming factor about The Covert Operations is that it's relatively cheap; you should be 
 able to pick it up for about $28. But even at that price, it's really no bargain. Save your money 
 for Command &amp; Conquers true successor, Red Alert. You'll be glad you did.

Review:  This is the first and only expansion to groundbreaking RTS game Command &amp; Conquer. It's includes 
 15 new missions, few new music tracks and one really interesting hidden bonus.
  New missions are really tough, don't even try it if you haven't yet completed original C&amp; C 
 campaigns. AI is going to strike you intense, however same old tricks like sandbag rush is working. 
 I used it on one GDI mission, which is almost impossible to accomplish. Mission goals and design 
 varyed greatly. Some missions are about building a base and destroying enemy, but some are really 
 interesting and innovative. Like the one where you have to free villager's wife and so he would 
 discover the location of important enemy building for you. There are more interesting situations 
 you may discover if you want. Single player missions include units that was rare or wasn't used 
 in single player of C&amp; C like toxic troopers and V rocket launchers. Also lots of missions includes 
 commando.
  Most interesting feature of this expansion is Fun Park missions. They can't be played without changing 
 executable file. Fun Park mission takes place on some kind of Jurassic Park, you take command of 
 nod forces and have to fight with dinos. 5 cool missions, special intro video with Kane also included, 
 that is the only new FMV in the whole expansion!
  Unfortunately Covert Operations have no new units at all (except dinos) and no new videos (again 
 except dino one) . This makes expansion's value very low. It will be interesting only for those 
 who want more of original C&amp; C gameplay, which is still great and highly addictive.

Review:  THE GOOD: A good challenge, good missions, just a nice little expansion on the whole.
  THE BAD: Some missions are just impossible, no new units or structures.
  
  I am a huge C&amp; C 
 fan and C&amp; C the Covert Operations is difficult as hell. There are 15 expert missions which 
 you can select in any order (no story, just pick a mission and play!) , each of them vary from simple 
 build a base and destroy the enemy to stealth missions. I much prefer the original C&amp; C, but 
 this package provides an excellent challenge. The game is good fun too and makes you determined 
 to complete the mission once if you fail. However, although it's so far so good, C&amp; C the Covert 
 Operations provides no new units or structures and some missions just feel impossible no matter 
 how much you try. Only get this game if you are a fan of C&amp; C or an expert because some missions 
 make you feel so frustrated you just want to throw your PC out the window. Anyway, to recap, the 
 Covert Operations is a good little expansion but ONLY if you love C&amp; C or are an expert RTS 
 gamer.
  
  I play this through C&amp; C First Decade.

Review:  I first played this game at a friends house when I stumbled upon his computer. I asked him if 
 I could play the game and of course he said yes. He gave me the quick run down on the controls 
 and I took off from there. There were other friends there so my friends played together while I 
 played on the computer. It took me like 2 hours to beat the first level on the NOD side because 
 I was doing everything wrong. But things eventually got better and before I knew it four hours 
 went by in what seemed like only 4 minutes.
  
  Now the game seems like something back in the Stone Age, but the tactics used are basically the 
 same as in todays Command and Conquer games.
