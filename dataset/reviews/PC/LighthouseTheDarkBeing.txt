:::Review:::
Novices and wanna-be adventurers, beware. 

 The eerily rendered graphics, first-person perspective, and intricate time-traveling storyline of 
 Sierra On-Line's Lighthouse may invoke a minor case of Myst d&amp; eacute; j&amp; agrave; vu, but 
 the trip down memory lane will be short-lived for most. Lighthouse has exceeded the adventure bar 
 set by the overwhelmingly successful Broderbund hit, but the result will leave a lot of fans of 
 the genre more frustrated than fascinated as they explore a strange new parallel world and strive 
 to outwit the ominous Dark Being.  

 Set on the mysterious, murky Oregon coast, Lighthouse is the story of a young writer seeking to 
 unravel the mysterious disappearance of her physicist neighbor, Dr. Kirk, and the strange kidnapping 
 of his infant daughter Amanda. Her discoveries take her beyond the realm of the present and into 
 a mystical world full of strange mechanical gadgets and beings.  

 Graphically, Lighthouse is, at its heart, a moving picture book. Beautifully detailed structures 
 and landscapes intertwine with fluid video sequences (triggered by the player) to create a totally 
 immersive experience. From the shark-like submarine gliding effortlessly through the water to the 
 quirky Ornithopter (a flying machine) soaring through the air, each segment is spectacularly executed. 
   

 Unfortunately, the same does not hold for gameplay. The well-designed adventure entices the player 
 from one experience to the next with puzzles that test the mind, but the solutions to these teasers 
 are occasionally vague and obscure. For what is basically a point-and-click inventory game, it's 
 far too confusing to reason out what items can or need to be gathered. This mysterious feel may 
 intrigue some players, but most will quickly tire of having to click on practically every item 
 in sight. Also, many of the clues needed to solve the puzzles are so obscure that players may spend 
 more time scratching their heads than working towards finding the doctor and his child. For example, 
 if the player is concerned by a crying baby (who we're actually supposed to be taking care of) 
 and opts to follow a creature carrying that child into a portal, a tangle of frustrating gameplay 
 awaits him on the other side. The correct answer is to stay in the house, and let the infant in 
 your charge disappear - a solution that is almost completely illogical.  

 Completing Lighthouse is a formidable and lengthy quest for even a seasoned gamer. Novices and wanna-be 
 adventurers, beware. Most of the puzzles (the majority of which are mechanical in nature) are not 
 for the faint of heart, and require a hefty dose of intuition. At times the only reprieve will 
 be a peek at a walk-through or a query to the local user group.   

 With 14 solutions to this epic, it's obvious that Sierra has taken great care to craft a story it 
 hopes will provide gamers with days and even months of adventuring pleasure. Even so, with the 
 lack of some desperately needed direction, the average adventurer may decide the enjoyment is not 
 worth the effort - and the game's depth will never be fully appreciated or experienced. While the 
 complexity and lavish graphics of Lighthouse certainly raise the standard for adventure games, 
 it might be beyond the abilities of the audience captivated by Myst. On the other hand, the mighty 
 hard-core, adventure-loving gamer will probably see this title like any other adventure - a challenge 
 to conquer no matter how obscure it seems.

Review:  from the first level in the game, you can tell this game is going to involve a lot of clicking 
 and searching. You can also tell the s**t's going to get deeper. The game is extremely immersive. 
 You begin alone in your home searching for simple things to accomplish simple tasks, such as searching 
 for your car keys to drive to where you need to be. The graphics in this game were some of the 
 best around at the time. This helps add to the dark and eerie mood. This was one of my personal 
 favorite games growing up (i was about 7 or 8 when i started playing it) although i required a 
 good amount of help from my dad, who had completed the game a few times triggering a few of the 
 different endings (14 in total!) . this game brings back a lot of memories of being totally and 
 completely lost because i hadn't clicked on something a few rooms back.
  Overall a great game, and one of the most challenging puzzle-adventure games you'll ever play.

Review:  Wow, this game is what gave me nightmares! The whole, answering the phone to hear a creepy man's 
 voice telling you to do stuff, really doesn't make me very comfortable...
  
  Graphics - 9/10 ~ For the time, the graphics were pretty darn good! They had crisp edges, and overall 
 good looking items, and areas you need to go to.
  
  Audio - 6/10 ~ Nothing revolutionary here, it's just 'ok' nothing special.
  
  Gameplay - 7/10 
 ~ The gameplay was pretty interesing, though it is a point and click system, it had a scary element. 
 The great part about it was how the story intertwined with the rest of everything...
  
  Good game overall!

Review:  One the most captivating things in this game is the great and original story-line, The mouse clicking 
 may be boring some times but it's really great when start to get used to it, The game is filled 
 with many puzzles so be prepared to spend hours scratching your head in order to advance, then 
 when you finally find your way, you'll realise you have just entered another puzzle. However, one 
 of the bad aspects is that you'll just end up clicking everywhere until something happens or maybe 
 closing the game and go for something filled of action
  The music really nice, it gets you the feeling of the game's dark environment, it's also filled 
 with great graphics, pretty detailed and lovely landscapes.

Review:  Well ik think this game is not a Rip-off but not a Masterpiece too i like this game because the 
 areas you see is amazing (except the last area) .
  You first begin in your house on a rainy day and the answering machine got mail the first 3 are 
 junk but the 4 one is from your neighbour a scientist.
  He's going to tell you that he's going to a another world and that you must take care of his baby 
 (Amanda) after the message you will be going to the lighthouse restore power of the house and then 
 you take stuff in the house and then you hear the baby crying and then you go to the baby's room 
 and then you see a creature (Dark being) he takes the baby and go trough the portal. Then you have 
 2 choices you stay or you go to the portal both are the good choices. Well from this point i stop 
 telling so if you want find out how it ands you just need to bay the game.

Review:  I was unable to get this game to work on any of my systems until this last year. I finally play 
 it, bearing in mind the time in which it was developed, as it is an old game. Yes, linear games 
 were the norm at that time. This one is made so that if you have not undertaken a, you cannot proceed 
 to b, c, or d - more often than not. 
  
  It was a good story-line. A hermit scientist living in a light-house with his infant child suddenly 
 disappears and you, his closest neighbour, must investigate. He has accidentally opened the portal 
 to another world, or dimension, and thus discovered a creature of questionable intent. You must 
 follow the creature into this portal. 
  
  If you are not confounded at the base of the tower in the portal, give yourself an A+ on your gaming 
 strategy. Do not forget to pick-up absolutely everything that is not nailed down. Also, remember 
 to try to use everything available to you - and SAVE YOUR GAME often! 
  
  I found this one to be an exercise in frustration and futility that did not pay my brain back with 
 reciprocal stimulation. The scientific notes were choice and fascinating, but came to naught in 
 the end.
