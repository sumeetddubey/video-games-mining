:::Review:::
I thought Bridge Deluxe II would be a great way to start learning bridge. It's not. 

 "Whether you're a beginning bridge player or an advanced expert, Bridge Deluxe II with Omar Sharif 
 is the game you've been waiting for."  

 Hooey, I say. Hooey and hogwash.  

 I am a beginning bridge player with years of bidding games behind me. I play cards incessantly, 
 tune in to the nuances of partner games, stay well aware of what's been played in bidding games, 
 and almost always win. I thought Bridge Deluxe II with Omar Sharif - the bridge world's most famous 
 icon and columnist - would be a great way to start learning bridge. It's not.  

 Bridge is an incredibly complex game, where each card you lay should tell everyone else at the table 
 something significant about your hand. Permissible signals to your partner rely not only on what 
 you indicate to each other through the play of a card, but also on what the other team indicates 
 as well. There are so many variations and intricacies that whole books have been written about 
 them. Omar Sharif offers you 15 minutes of FMV chat and 20 pages of explanations, some scoring 
 guidelines, and a cute online bridge dictionary that defines things like "rubber" as "What each 
 side tries to win in rubber bridge. The first side to score two games wins the rubber." This may 
 be adequate and true, but it's not necessarily clear. Many web sites have much more lucid explanations 
 - and I often found myself turning to them, then returning to the game.   

 The introductory tutorials are by bridge expert Dr. Tony Sowter, and they introduce topics and explain 
 them so concisely that I'm left with exactly the same feeling of bewilderment as when I learned 
 algebra in 7th grade - the easy problems were so easy to figure out that I never learned the proper 
 way to figure them out; I just knew the answers. By the time I hit the hard ones I had no idea 
 how to do it. Same principle: The basics are explained, but their ramifications are explained badly. 
 By the time you hit the intermediate tutorial there are so many unaddressed issues that it can't 
 help but go badly.  

 In the tutorial's defense, it will allow you to make a bad decision, show you how the hand plays 
 out, then take you back to where you erred and allow you to play it out right. Also, during actual 
 games, you can save your game, then reload and replay it as many times as you want to see the various 
 ways the hand could play out or set up a hand to see the way a certain scenario might play out. 
 It's a nice touch.  

 A number of basic bridge conventions, like Jacoby Transfers, the Stayman Convention, and Take-out 
 Doubles, are available so you can customize the game to your usual mode of play. However, it's 
 only the basic bridge conventions that are available. For the rest you're on your own.  

 Gameplay itself is basic - click on a card to play it, skip to the next hand if you're really unhappy 
 with your cards. A completed trick will not clear from the table till you have looked at it and 
 clicked on it so the game itself never moves too fast. And, in fact, you can control the speed 
 of the game.  

 But Bridge Deluxe also claims to be the game experts are waiting for. While I'm no expert, this 
 certainly seems questionable. A huge part of bridge is knowing how your partner plays and forming 
 a kind of synergy so that the two of you read each other - and each other's hands - almost without 
 thinking. Obviously, if your partner's a computer, you'll have to forego a lot of the interaction. 
 Fortunately, you can play with three friends over the Internet. This seems to be the area where 
 it makes sense to buy the game. If you and your favorite bridge partners/opponents live far away 
 and can't get together for regular games, buying this makes more sense than joining an online bridge 
 club. Membership in an online club can run as much as $80 a year, where the purchase of this game 
 is a one-time $50 shot.   

 Computer card games work really well in two situations: When you don't have anyone to play with 
 and can hop on the Internet and find players (Microsoft Hearts for example) or when you simply 
 want to play by yourself, against the computer. In this case, Bridge Deluxe provides no place to 
 simply hop on and find friends to play bridge with and the learning/game improvement that could 
 come from playing the AI by yourself is seriously limited - unlike in a real game, there's just 
 not enough feedback. But if your friends are far away and you need a way to play, Bridge Deluxe 
 is a viable option. Too bad that's all it's good for.
