Over the Reich is a game for rarefied tastes. 

 Over the Reich is a game for rarefied tastes. If you don't have an interest in the "head game" of 
 aerial combat, the complexities of setting up attacks, deciding which maneuver to use, and exactly 
 HOW to approach an enemy pilot or fighter wing, then it will seem deadly dull. But if you can see 
 through the "twitch factor" of air combat to the nuances of move, counter-move, and reaction, then 
 you might want to take it for a spin.  

 Over the Reich is Big Time Software's follow-up to Flight Commander II, which offered a strategic, 
 turn-based game of modern air combat. OTR takes the system into the crucible of World War II and 
 its largely prop-driven fighters and bombers, much to its benefit. Much has been written about 
 these classic aerial engagements, particularly those in Europe, and they have been studied and 
 turned over by historians and WWII buffs for years. The planes themselves - the P-51 Mustang, the 
 Messerschmitt 262, the RAF spitfire - have entered the realm of legend.  

 It's familiar material to many, but it's never been approached quite this way, and in this lies 
 OTR's appeal. You can play as either British, American, or German pilots in European fighter missions 
 and campaigns from 1943-1945. (Big Time is working on a Battle of Britain game and possibly one 
 for the Pacific War.) The game is played in turns on a 3-D "battlemap" that represents a skewed 
 top-down view of the action, with a background of clouds or ground features depending on altitude. 
 Groups of planes move and fire guns or rockets or drop bombs in turn. Depending on the difficulty 
 level, you have a lot of leeway over how you set up an attack.   

 Your goal is to maneuver into position to deliver the killing shot or shots. To do this you can 
 bank, roll, perform complex maneuvers like immelmanns and loops, and change altitude. A panel with 
 a stick, throttle, and banking control runs along the bottom of the screen, giving you all the 
 information and controls you need to direct the plane. You're not controlling the plane in real 
 time as you would in a sim, but telling the pilot how and where to fly his plane, then ordering 
 him to execute that order. If you're in range, a cross-hair appears on the enemy with a "chance 
 to hit" number from 0-100. The result is more like a classic wargame than a sim, with each plane's 
 performance characteristics and weapons capabilities figuring into just how you attack. Do you 
 try a head-on strafing run? A turning gun battle? A slashing attack? It takes air combat out of 
 the realm of action and into the realm of strategy.  

 Dozens of classic, stand-alone historical encounters are included, most involving air-to-air combat 
 between opposing fighting wings, but also bombing strikes with heavies such as the B-17, anti-shipping 
 missions on D-Day, and tricky escort runs. (I found one mission that my father, a B-26 gunner/engineer, 
 had been involved with.) If you enter the campaign game, you have even more choices, assigning 
 particular pilots to various missions based on different skills and characteristics. Some have 
 better eyesight, are more likely to be heroes, or are better fliers. Just how these pilots are 
 used and what missions they're sent on is central to the campaign game, which is the real heart 
 of Over the Reich.  

 Game complexity is set depending on "rank," which you can choose at the outset. The higher the rank, 
 the more elements begin to figure into play, such as gun burst rate, altitude, banking, and so 
 on. I didn't care for this method of adding complexity, which also increased the difficulty level 
 of the game. You should be able to just turn options on or off individually, without regard to 
 overall difficulty level.   

 Some plane buffs have complained about the performance of various aircraft in OTR, but in most cases 
 I found it to be fine. One bug makes some opponents tougher than they should be, and this is being 
 fixed by OTR. But as regards subjects like turning radius and weapon strength, OTR seem to be within 
 the envelope more often than not.  

 Over the Reich is certainly not a game for everybody, and even many tactical wargamers will find 
 the often slow turns and complex moves somewhat boring. But true aviation buffs, especially those 
 fascinated with World War II, will find it a treat.
