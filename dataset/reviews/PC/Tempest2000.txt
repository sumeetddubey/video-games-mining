:::Review:::
Tempest 2000 offers older gamers a chance to relive the adrenaline rush of the arcade game. 

 
 Of all the "classic" arcade games of the early 1980s, Tempest is my favorite. I've always loved 
 the simple premise (shoot everything) , the never-ending parade of increasingly intense levels with 
 just enough time to catch your breath in between, and the odd combination of strategy and mindless 
 shooting required to advance in the game. So needless to say I was excited to hear that Tempest 
 had finally made it to the PC in the form of Tempest 2000, an updated version of the original. 

 Tempest 2000 adds a slew of new features to the original game, including wavy, fluorescent graphics, 
 a surprisingly good techno soundtrack, multiple power-ups, level warps, an "AI" droid who helps 
 you in battle, and a two-player battle mode in which you try to destroy your opponent. Those who 
 loved the original title just as it was will prefer the "Tempest Plus," mode, which is much closer 
 to the arcade classic. The configuration menu also offers a wide range of gameplay and display 
 options; you'll find the version of Tempest that's right for you.  

 Although the new graphic flares of Tempest 2000 are wild and colorful, they aren't all that impressive. 
 Explosions tend to be a collection of small square pixels flying across the screen, and power-ups 
 look clunky as they fly towards you. There's also a lot happening on the screen at once; display-hogging 
 printed messages like "Excellent!" and "Zappo" can cloud your view. All these explosions and messages 
 make it hard to see enemy fire coming towards you. If you own a Saturn or a PlayStation, consider 
 buying Tempest for your console system; either version of Tempest available for these systems is 
 graphically superior to the PC version.  

 Luckily the gameplay of Tempest 2000 retains the feel of the original with great success. A keyboard 
 or joypad is no match for the elegance of the original's paddle control, but after a few minutes 
 of practice you'll feel comfortable controlling your movements. Tempest 2000 offers older gamers 
 a chance to relive the adrenaline rush of the arcade game, and younger gamers the chance to discover 
 the beauty of a classic.

Review:  I'm about he biggest fan of Tempest that there is. I co-held the world's record for about 6 months 
 (1982) and even owned a stan-up machine for several years (should have never sold that!) .
  
  Anyway, the premise of Tempest 2000 is to port the Atari Jaguar title to the PC/MAC in all 
 its glory. Graphically, the PC version is very faithful to the Jaguar, and the controls are responsive 
 and clean. Play is pretty much ported over exactly too.
  
  My main (and extreme) gripe is that the software alsmost seems like it was not playtested after 
 about 40-50 levels. each level inrcementally increases the difficulty, to the point that at about 
 level 65 or so, it's IMPOSSIBLE to proceed. I mean IMPOSSIBLE. I went as far as using a variable 
 clamper (holding things like # of lives constant) and was unable to proceed any further. This took 
 what could have been an incredible experience and made it absolutely no fun. I ended up giving 
 up (and I don't give up easily) .
  
  Avoid this title at all costs unless you plan to collect it (and not play) .
