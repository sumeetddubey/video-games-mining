:::Review:::
There's no shortage of World War II strategy games on the market, and Moscow to Berlin does nothing 
 good to stand out from the pack. 

  Moscow to Berlin: Red Siege is the latest World War II real-time strategy game to roll our way, 
 and it comes with such a generic name that it's understandably easy to confuse with other recent 
 World War II games, such as Rush for Berlin and World War II Combat: Road to Berlin. There's no 
 shortage of World War II real-time strategy games, either, so a game really has to deliver something 
 cool or interesting in order to stand out. Unfortunately, that's not the case with Moscow to Berlin, 
 as it's yet another cookie-cutter real-time strategy game that's plagued with micromanagement issues, 
 dated gameplay, and equally dated graphics.  

          Moscow to Berlin is the latest World War II game to head our way, but at least this one 
 features the Eastern Front.     

  Moscow to Berlin is the latest World War II game from developer Digital Reality, responsible for 
 both D-Day and Desert Rats vs. Afrika Korps. This chapter in the series covers the eastern front 
 of World War II, a titanic clash of German and Soviet armies that resulted in the Germans almost 
 taking Moscow and the Soviets eventually smashing Berlin. In fact, the game's three campaigns cover 
 the major phases of the conflict, from the Germans invading the Soviet Union, the middle phase 
 that included Stalingrad, and finally the Red Army march on Berlin. The missions in each campaign 
 alternate sides, though, so you don't really get a sense of personality or distinct characters 
 throughout the game. In one battle, you'll lead a German tank attack on Soviet positions, while 
 in the next you may lead Soviet forces into battle against the Germans.  

  It all sounds quite epic, but it's not. Instead of commanding armies, you'll command a handful 
 of tanks and other vehicles, as well as squads of infantry in battle. This is a tactical-style 
 real-time strategy game, so there's no resource gathering or base building. Rather, you're given 
 a set number of units at the beginning of the mission, and you must accomplish your objectives 
 using them and whatever reinforcements that are programmed to arrive. The artificial intelligence 
 isn't really smart, and its job is mainly to sit there and wait for you to attack, save for those 
 moments when it's scripted to attack. The pathfinding is also dubious, and your forces will often 
 jam together, which can get you in trouble if your advance forces encounter the enemy while the 
 bulk of your troops are still trying to untangle themselves.  

  Moscow to Berlin also shares some of the micromanagement issues of D-Day. Basically, you're given 
 a lot of control over individual units, but most of that is worthless in the heat of battle. When 
 tanks can explode with just one or two hits, you don't have time to fiddle with each unit onscreen. 
 And this means that infantrymen are rather useless in the game, since they aren't grouped by squads 
 but rather by individual. So doing basic things such as loading up a troop transport requires you 
 to click on each grunt and give him an order to board the vehicle in question. It's easier to forget 
 the infantrymen anyway and just forge ahead with tanks, which have an unlimited amount of ammo 
 and blast everything in their way. They'll even use their main cannons to shoot at infantry, who 
 oblige the tanks by standing in the open.  

  On the easier difficulty setting, you don't have to worry so much about micromanaging everything, 
 since your forces are tough enough to weather most battles. However, the tactical skill in the 
 game is reduced to being able to drag-select a bunch of units, send them at the enemy, wait around 
 while the repair truck heals everyone, then repeat the process again. Finally, the multiplayer 
 in Moscow to Berlin is frankly weird, since the game's online matchmaking lobby is also shared 
 with the D-Day crowd. In fact, of the players that you'll find online, most only play D-Day, so 
 finding someone to play Moscow to Berlin with can be difficult.  

          Infantry are best in buildings, otherwise they're dead meat versus tanks.     

  The 
 graphics engine was already old in 2004 when it was used for D-Day, and two years later it's really 
 behind the times. It does have some nice features, such as the destructibility of the environments 
 and the way tanks explode in glorious fireballs, but the rest of the game suffers from dated and 
 grainy graphics. The sound has the obligatory voice acting with thick German and Russian accents, 
 and the music won't really inspire you or catch your ear. There's just not a lot to recommend in 
 Moscow to Berlin, not with so many better World War II real-time strategy games on the market. 
 So it's probably a bit fitting that this chapter of the series covers the end of World War II, 
 because it's run out of gas at this point.

Review:  Gameplay: Its the same thing over and over. Capture a bridgeand kill germans/russians. It just 
 gets a little harder of each mission. A bit of a hard game to learn. Tatics and thinking is how 
 you win this game. Lots of Unit Mico-Managment.
  
  Graphics: Horrible Graphics. But what do you expect from a budget title game? Choppy textures and 
 graphical bugs every were. U can barely tell the diffrence in a tree and a soldier. Detailed buildings 
 that are fun to blow up. Sound: Good sound. Weapons sound great and tanks and vehicles sound like 
 they really did. Overall amamazing sound for a budget game.
  
  Value: You can pick this game up for about 5 bucks at a big lots. You also get a cool poster and 
 a dogtag with it as well.
  
  The Good: Nice Sound, cool poster
  
  The Bad: Overall Bad game.
  
  The Ugly: Unexcusable graphical glitches.

Review:  I purchased this game even after reading the reviews which give it in the 5's or less. The game 
 is very entertaining and challenging and plays like Panzers Phase 1 &amp; 2 and Rush for Berlin 
 . The musical score is nice, lots of good accents German/Russian and very detailed battlefields, 
 equipment, buildings with nice tracer fire, smoke, explosions etc. If you liked any of the above 
 games then this one is for you as its the same flavor with updated graphics. There are some frustrations 
 like when ive sent units to cross a bridge and they are ingaged and a units strays off to get to 
 the point i selected thus usually being destroyed by the enemy. The AI is descent but seems to 
 be an older engine design compared to the new games of today. The system requirements are low and 
 is one reason i tried the game as the newer games are way to choppy on my 4 year old system.
  
  Overall if your interested in WW2 RTS the is a solid performer and takes the player into the 
 heart of Russia and back to Berlin for some hair raising battles. Give it a try it worth the money, 
 IMO.
