:::Review:::
There is actually very little in America that isn't taken straight from other, older, better real-time 
 strategy games. 

  America is a Wild West-themed real-time strategy game from German developer Data Becker. Although 
 the setting of the game is distinctive, and some of the specific mechanics of play are fairly interesting, 
 there is actually very little in America that isn't taken straight from other older, better real-time 
 strategy games. More specifically, America is a plainly obvious attempt at borrowing the successful 
 elements of the popular historical-themed game Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. Unfortunately 
 for America, its attempts to replicate the graphics, sound, gameplay, and balance of Ensemble Studios' 
 excellent strategy game simply don't add up.           In a historical reinterpretation, America's 
 outlaws subsist only on liquor    

 America isn't much of a history lesson. It lets you play as four different factions: settlers, outlaws, 
 Mexicans, and Native Americans. As in any typical 2D real-time strategy game, each of these factions 
 has some superficial and strategic differences and otherwise a lot in common. The game follows 
 the exact same pattern that's typical of the genre: You must use your workers to build a resource-gathering 
 infrastructure, gather a sufficient amount of these resources while expanding your territory, and 
 then build up a force of armed troops with whom you eliminate the opposition. The pacing of the 
 game is slow in the extensive resource-gathering phase and often much too fast once combat ensues. 
 Generally, the battles are won by whoever manages to bring along the most troops.   

  It's easy to compare America with Age of Empires II because America initially looks so much like 
 Ensemble's game. The isometric perspective, the earthy color scheme, and the tiny units are all 
 very similar. However, America's graphics lack a lot of the detail and polish of those in Age of 
 Empires II -- the various units and structures can be very difficult to distinguish from one another. 
 Yet while America doesn't look very interesting, it doesn't really look bad -- but it certainly sounds 
 bad. Each unit in the game has its own grating, repetitive catchphrase. These are often predictable 
 and silly -- the cowboys all say, "Hold your horses, man!" Also, in the single-player campaign, each 
 mission opens with a long-winded spoken monologue that's delivered in what's meant to be that particular 
 faction's dialect. The accents are so badly affected that it becomes impossible to take the game 
 seriously. As in Age of Empires II, the game's soundtrack relies heavily on percussion and woodwind 
 instruments, and as such it isn't nearly as bad as the speech.   

  The game offers a four-mission tutorial, plus four fairly short but generally very difficult single-player 
 campaigns for each of the four respective sides. There's a skirmish mode, a multiplayer mode, and 
 a fair number of maps to choose from for these. You can toggle the difficulty level of the computer 
 opponent, which explicitly seems to determine how aggressively the computer will build up its forces. 
 America even has a few extra frills, including prerendered cinematic sequences in the campaigns. 
 During the game, you have some convenient gameplay options that are lifted straight out of Age 
 of Empires II, such as the ability to queue production of units and research, to highlight idle 
 worker units, and to set formations. Of course, these options are only noteworthy because they're 
 typically omitted in most second-rate real-time strategy games.           The battles are too chaotic 
    

 Some of the gameplay elements in America are promising. You can produce livestock for food and money 
 as well as horses for your troops and for your wagon transports. Your units have morale (which 
 simply affects their combat skills) and can become stronger as they gain experience in battle. 
 Some of your units can mount horses at will, which typically makes them more effective in battle. 
 If your units are killed anyway, enemy forces may steal their mounts for their own. The game's 
 main resources include food, wood, gold, and guns. The first three are gathered like in Age of 
 Empires II -- basically you get them out in the wilderness -- while guns must be manufactured, bought, 
 or stolen. The settlers and the Mexicans later gain access to cannons. Native American warriors 
 can swim. The outlaws excel at thievery and also produce food in a most unorthodox fashion: at 
 distilleries. As the manual points out, "these tough guys live primarily on liquor." This may be 
 funny, but it doesn't say much in favor of the game's attempts at real-world authenticity.   

 
  Otherwise, there's really not much else to say in favor of any particular aspect of the game. 
 It has some technical problems and doesn't run smoothly on midrange systems. The campaign missions 
 do have changing objectives, but they're typically very straightforward and will be overwhelming 
 for inexperienced players. The multiplayer mode isn't much fun; there isn't a lot of variety and 
 you always have to start from the ground up. The game's graphics are uninspired and the sound is 
 awful, and those elements in the gameplay that are subtly different from those in other real-time 
 strategy games won't be noticeable to any but the most experienced real-time strategy players. 
 But regardless of how much experience you have with games of this type, you'll probably be disappointed 
 with America. It's too hard to play if you're relatively new to the genre, either because the missions 
 themselves are too tough or because all the graphics are too similar. On the other hand, if you've 
 already played and enjoyed similar games, then you'll find that America offers very little to draw 
 your attention away from any of these.

Review:  America has Mexicans, Outlaws, Native Americans, Americans that you choose to play for campaigns. 
 There are no gliches in this game cause everytime when i play the game i have no problem with crushes, 
 the game being to hard to beat or anything else. The game is historical because it shows you what 
 might have happened before the United Kingdom came here, when the Spanish had came to the Americas, 
 and had to deal with the outlaws in Texas. The Native Americans during then had the most land that 
 they had to fight for against the Spanish, Outlaws, Americans and the Britians. This game shows 
 that in the campaigns that you play whether its the Mexicans, Native Americans, Americans, or Outlaws.
