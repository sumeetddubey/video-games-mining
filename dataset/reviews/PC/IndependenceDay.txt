Loud, fast, and remarkably devoid of personality. 

 What was perhaps most startling to earthlings last summer was not the alien menace, but rather the 
 sad realization that it was really an invasion of corporate origin. Resistance is futile, humans: 
 consume or be consumed. As we celebrated our independence, we did so in a state of total surrender, 
 supine before the spectacle of mediocrity. It should come as no surprise, then, that Independence 
 Day, the game, has inherited all of the genetic attributes of its progenitor: It is loud, fast, 
 and remarkably devoid of personality.  

 Play commences on the second day of the invasion, "the day we fight back." With your wingman, Steve 
 Hiller (former Prince of Bel Air) , you will attempt to disable a series of motherships and take 
 out their primary weapons. With the completion of each subsequent mission, players advance to more 
 "sophisticated" cities - there is a noteworthy techno-epiphany in gay Paris, and Tokyo is cast 
 in a lavish wash of neon signage. Periodically, you may escape the scenic tableaux through a "Warpgate," 
 which transports fighters to a bonus match in several clandestine ports. Lush rendering aside, 
 the actual gaming changes almost imperceptibly throughout the day, and that is precisely what gives 
 this game its feeling of imminent mortality - July 4th becomes a sort of Groundhog Day to its captives, 
 who must live each level perfectly lest they be doomed to repeat it. While this provides a rousing 
 incentive to master the game, it seems dubious to credit the producers with a motivational victory 
 here.  

 The Fox team, in an effort to alleviate boredom, has buried a few surprises in the program to varying 
 effect. Bonus planes and special weapons serving as power-ups are hidden throughout the cityscapes. 
 Because the action is relatively fast, at times almost arbitrary, players may have difficulty employing 
 secondary weapons in a keyboard configuration. The visitors also have a maddening tendency to deploy 
 "Tumblers" (a weapon that causes an onboard systems malfunction) just as you approach crucial pickups. 
 What is perhaps most frustrating, though, is the creators' seemingly sadistic notion of reward. 
 After reclaiming cities as dignified as New York and Tokyo, can gamers really be expected to defend 
 Oahu?   

 In fairness to the developers at Radical Entertainment it seems important to note the high caliber 
 of visual and sonic information offered up by ID4. Fans of rudimentary flight simulation should 
 enjoy touring the masterfully rendered cities and shuddering beneath the awesome quake of the mothership. 
 At advanced levels the soundtrack improves commensurately, particularly in the foreign territories 
 where electronic music tends to flourish. The weapons systems, though not particularly advanced, 
 feature a generously true AIM-120 missile, which works wonders in a pinch. The machine guns, however, 
 appear to be virtually useless unless gamers are willing to play sacrificially.   

 Alas, no amount of garnish or spice can ever fully dispel the stench of a meat that is tainted, 
 and so Independence Day comes to evening like a well-wrapped gift holding nothing. Alexander Pope 
 once said, "No more the rising sun shall gild the morn," and so said to discriminating gamers, 
 "know it for what it is and not what it purports to be." Those seeking "our finest hour" would 
 be wise to delve back through the ages, to a more innocent era, where they might light upon an 
 oft-forgotten wonder known to the ancients as "Defender."

Review:  I got his game for a pretty good price and it was only a $1 at the dollar store. It's not a bad 
 pick for only a dollar. The game ain't half bad.
  
  Game play 9/10: The game play ships out like this: your a pilot from the movie and your mission 
 is to stop the alien threat to earth. Some of the missions are cool like some that range from blowing 
 up generators to defending the E-3 AWACS (recon plane) . The game plays like a 3rd person plane 
 arcade shooter.
  It's fun blowing up alien scum with missiles and shooting them down with the bullets of vengeance.
 
  
  Graphics 9/10: You'll notice at the start menu the cool movie footage/fmv. Well, anyways back to 
 the graphics: right away you will notice the big black saucer above your head which is awesome. 
 The planes look tight as well as the bad ass alien ships. The explosions in the game are pretty 
 nice and is similar to Fury 3's explosions.. The levels are pretty sweet like you'll be defending 
 Las Vegas and Tokyo. It's pretty cool.
  
  Sound 8/10: Theirs not much to say about it. But, the sound of the explosions and the firing of 
 your gun is cool. Then, theirs other pilots talking on the radio.
  
  Control 9/10: The controls are easy to pick up and play whether your using the keyboard or a joystick. 
 Either way it's good.
  
  Replay Value 8/10: Most of the time this game is pretty addicting and keeps you coming back for 
 more. I say you would play this about three to four times a week.
  
  Multi-Player 9/10: The multi-player is pretty sweet. You can either play over a network with your 
 friends or you can play head to head via split screen with one of your friends. I never would of 
 thought that I would actually see a pc game with a split screen multi-player. I like it, it's pretty 
 neat. In multi-player you can play death match with your friend (head to head) or friends (network) 
 which is pretty sweet.
