:::Review:::
If you've been looking for a solid title with replay value that keeps you coming back, Deadlock 
 is definitely worth a look. 

 Several years ago, Sierra attempted to combine the addictive building qualities of SimCity with 
 the proven world-conquering feel of Civilization in a space strategy title called Outpost. Promising 
 multi-player conflicts, scores of scientific advances for competitors to research, and an entire 
 planet as the prize, the rushed developers instead managed to release one of the most disappointing 
 titles of all time. Although it's been a long wait, Accolade has managed, with their new Deadlock, 
 to deliver the goods promised years before. Deadlock's premise is simple. Land on a planet and 
 claim it as your own, crushing any other races that might be stupid enough to get in your way. 
 In order to build better weapons and create more stable colonies, you'll need to gather the resources 
 on the planet and assign scientists to research more efficient ways of using them. Once you've 
 built enough cities (or wiped out your enemies entirely) you will take control of the planet and 
 win the admiration of your friends and family. (Okay, maybe that last part isn't entirely true.) 

 Although the game may not offer the economic complexity that fans of games like Civilization 2 have 
 come to love, Deadlock's simplicity works well within the confines of the multi-player arena. With 
 seven different races to choose from, each with their own advantages and disadvantages (the immense 
 Tarth are incredible warriors, but it's very hard to mask that kind of bulk when you're spying) , 
 the game lends itself easily to individual play styles. In the early stages of the game, you'll 
 spend most of your time gathering resources (such as food, wood, minerals, energy, and a few other 
 special substances) and researching one of the over 30 different technologies included in the game. 
 After you've uncovered the basics, you'll begin the real work of building up your existing cities 
 (there are over 30 different structures to create and more than 20 military units available to 
 defend them with) and using colonizers to expand your land holdings. Deadlock isn't the best strategy 
 game to ever shipthe relationships between the units are a bit too simple, and combat often 
 breaks down into a rock-paper-scissors contestbut its strong multi-player options, including 
 serial link, modem, LAN, and Internet play, make up for some of its weaknesses (although the lack 
 of support for Kali will incense many online gamers, and rightfully so) . If you've been looking 
 for a solid title with replay value that keeps you coming back, Deadlock is definitely worth a 
 look.

Review:  This game has many races to choose from which each have a whole story written about them and for 
 its day it had alot of neat sound effects and visuals going for it. I enjoyed the bonus song on 
 the CD which had a human soldier whining about being tricked by the recruiter to join the military 
 and fight lol The tarth in this game are GREAT they are brutes with fearsome warrior like attitude 
 but they seem like teddy bears in voice TARTH MAKE BEST STRUDDLE, THATS ALL! JUST STRUDDLE! lol 
 good times. Check this game out if your a history classic gaming buff and you'll love it.

Review:  This is one of my favorite games in the world! It's one of those old games you can play over and 
 over again. Basically this game is a strategy where you have to think a lot about your units, population, 
 army and other stuff. Its cool because every time you play it the computer generates new kind 
 of maps you are going to play. The computer in this game is very smart. So you have to make smart 
 decisions. The game play should last for a couple of weeks but probably later youll get bored 
 but thats ok youll return to the game very soon!

Review:  Through the ages I still look back on my first computer, an old powermac, and I think about the 
 games I use to play and occasionally try to return to my roots on this ol Windows XP machine I'm 
 running. A few games have windows conversions that I spend a good week hunting usually.
  I always return to this title, before I played Civ, I played this, this was the classic Turn Based 
 RTS, I loved it and I wish Atari would've done something more with this game. It seems abandoned 
 and lost in all the new graphics and gameplay that today's strategy games have, but the gameplay 
 is still amazing, and I can sit and play it for hours after hours on my own or over LAN with my 
 brother.
  The graphics were good for their time, and the races were lovable, from the basic berserking humans 
 to the insect-like Ch'cht, this game should never have been shelved and still lives on in the hearts 
 of the classic gamers. It was probably one of the few games I actually miss having a mac for...
 
  After coming back and running into this on Gamespot I'm actually gonna take a break from my MMO's 
 and my new RTS's and break down and relax, and return to Deadlock for a week or two, if boredom 
 overwhelms you, or if you just are tired of every current game, take a few steps back and return 
 to your roots, classic games like this one deserve respect.

Review:  Been going through all of my old games to find gems to replay, and had to drop this review even 
 though this game is "outdated". 
  
  Sometimes its fun to pick up and old game and replay it, or even reccomend it to a friend. Sure 
 it might mot be as pretty to look at graphics wise as the stuff out there today. But its engaging, 
 and you have to admit the "commentary" from the various races WILL make you laugh!
  
  If your looking for a gift to give the gamer on your list and he seems to have everything out there 
 at the moment, I reccomend trying to scrounge up a copy of this for them.
