No effort was made to make this pitiful affair the least bit interesting. 

 There's a new breed of computer games out there, and the folks putting them out are smart: They 
 wait until the summer months to release these rogue games, when most developers are feverishly 
 working on their big Christmas projects and there's just not a lot on shelves to catch the eyes 
 of weary summer shoppers. Fortunately, spotting one of these new beasts is easy. Just look for 
 a "simulation" of any single-player sport, pastime, hobby, or activity that carries a budget price 
 tag.  

 Bowling, tennis, biking, skiing, skating - we've seen so-called simulations of all these sports 
 this summer, thanks no doubt to ESPN2's coverage of the Extreme Games this past July (reason: there's 
 nothing else going on sports-wise this time of the year) . The sad thing about it all is that the 
 people most likely to wind up with these wretched products - and yes, they are almost always a 
 mere shadow of a true PC game - are ones who actually participate in the sport shown on the front 
 of the box.  

 For some reason known only to the higher powers at GameSpot, I've had the rare delight to play many 
 of these lousy games. There have been a couple that showed some signs of promise, but invariably 
 these wind up being deleted from my hard drive only seconds after the finishing touches are put 
 on the review. The latest in this long line of money-driven ventures is a curious little number 
 called Skydive! - and amazingly, it manages to delve into depths of pure awfulness practically 
 unrivaled by its predecessors. It literally makes me shudder to think what people who actually 
 skydive would think after trying their hand at this Quicktime-laden piece of garbage.  

 Perhaps the biggest selling point of Skydive! is that no experience is required - and I'm not talking 
 skydiving experience, either. Here's how it works. You choose an "exotic" location from a list 
 that includes Stonehenge, Moscow, Seoul, Groom Lake, and a couple of others; decide whether to 
 perform a jump for accuracy, slalom (flying through "rings" with scores displayed above them) , 
 or free fall (perform as many rotations as possible) ; then click a button and jump out and begin 
 your descent.  

 Once you've left the plane, you tuck or spread-eagle your body and then use the mouse to perform 
 flips or cartwheels, change your heading, or increase the speed of your descent. After that, all 
 your actions depend on the event you've chosen: You'll either start heading for the landing circle 
 while trying to move through those magical circles in the sky, or pull off as many rotations as 
 possible before opening your chute.  

 And that's it, folks - that's the whole enchilada. After earning the top score in two of the three 
 events, I didn't see much reason to ever play it again, especially after watching the triple-speed 
 animation in 3dfx mode. Go ahead, smash into a skyscraper in Moscow - it don't hurt none! No effort 
 was made to make this pitiful affair the least bit interesting. How about some nasty birds that 
 might get tangled up in your lines or an emergency situation where your ripcord doesn't work or 
 where a Russian fighter lines you in its sights... well, you get the idea. This just isn't a sport 
 that translates well to the PC; in fact, it doesn't translate at all.  

 So if you're a skydiving enthusiast or someone who has friends or loved ones who know you're even 
 remotely interested in the sport, here are two pieces of advice: First, don't buy this game. Secondly 
 - and most importantly - be sure to tell them that you don't give a damn about a skydiving simulation.
