:::Review:::
It's a wonkily-balanced game experience not quite challenging enough for the long-time adventurer 
 and not quite guiding enough for the newbie. 

 I wish I could remember who said it first: "It's like d&amp; eacute; j&amp; agrave; vu all over again." 
 Amazing Media has come out with another FMV-intensive action game, based on one of our great literary 
 icons, The Mummy. (They already did Frankenstein: Through the Eyes of the Monster, and presumably 
 we'll see something along the lines of Dracula before we're through.) And like last time, we have 
 a middling-to-large star presence in the gruff, icily civil nastiness of Malcolm McDowell, playing 
 the character he plays best ... which is the only character he ever plays, as a matter of fact. 

 In Mummy, you play a representative of a mining corporation, sent to an Egyptian site to deal with 
 the revolt of workers, who, ever since the discovery of a hieroglyph-covered box, fear a curse 
 lies over the mining site. With very minor changes, the navigation scheme here is the one from 
 Frankenstein, and the integration of the full-motion actors with the computer-generated backgrounds 
 is just as smooth and seamless (although the acting, with the exception of Malcolm McDowell, has 
 turned out quite a bit worse) . You'll spend your first game-scale day navigating the desert camp, 
 making acquaintances, and being followed around by the nosy and subtly threatening McDowell, who 
 doesn' like you very much. The static-frame navigation from the first game (for such is the way 
 I cannot help thinking of Frankenstein and Mummy as the "first game" and the "second game") makes 
 a little more intuitive sense, due largely to the much more rectilinear layout of the hangars and 
 barracks of the campsite. Mummy's puzzle-solving elements - including such tasks as repairing electrical 
 wiring, going behind people's backs to swipe confidential data, and locating secret doors hidden 
 since the WWII heyday of the Nazi base the campsite was constructed on - are definitely not brain-benders 
 in themselves, but a certain amount of common sense is required; you will occasionally find yourself 
 "solving" a puzzle only to find that it won't do you any good until you've discovered a critical 
 clincher. Nuff said.   

 Mummy has a minimalist feel to it, partly because of the spare graphics (scattered buildings and 
 one runway on a baking desert floor) , partly because of the relatively low population of the world 
 (under a dozen actual characters) , and partly because of questionable construction. The mine, where 
 the adventure ultimately leads, appears at first as little more than level upon level of pointlessly 
 large and empty caverns. While the player eventually uncovers secrets and new chambers (and along 
 the way, becomes acquainted with the supernatural entity in question via some of the cheesiest 
 acting imaginable) , it's easy to feel cheated early on, especially for less-than-hardcore adventure 
 gamers.   

 The overall result is merely an okay-looking, reasonably straightfaced, wonkily-balanced game experience 
 not quite challenging enough for the long-time adventurer and not quite guiding enough for the 
 newbie. It's a shame because the Mummy is, in many ways, a much more engaging character than Frankenstein, 
 with the potential for a deeper backstory and more mythical involvement. If you enjoyed and were 
 not overly daunted by Frankenstein, Mummy will be more like a light snack with occasional pits 
 you need to spit out or swallow with some resignation. Interplay hasn't strolled down the sidewalk 
 with this much of dog in some time, but it's weirdly reassuring to know that nobody's perfect.

Review:  Mummy TOTP consist of the following storyline. After finding a rare egyptian chest, strange things 
 have been happening around the mine site in Egypt. They say the box is cursd and the workers deny 
 to continue working, specially after rumors that a mummy is circling the mine. gulp...
  
  So they send you, Michael Cameron to see what's happening and you will solve a mystery consisting 
 of much more than a cursed chest and a mummy...
  
  Graphics are real-life, that is to say, characters are real live persons that act in front of you.
 
  
  Sound spooks you. Really...
  
  The best thing about the game is the sense of suspense and how your adrenaline pumps in your moments 
 of the game. So, if you want to have a good time, play it. Do play it.

Review:  The much-maligned genre of Point and Click adventures occasionally produces a classic game. This 
 however, is not one of them. Mummy has the potential to be really good: the premise of the story 
 is quite interesting, if a little familiar, and with a known acting quantity in Malcolm McDowell 
 starring in it, it has a good selling point.
  
  The problem is that it is too short, too obvious, and far too predictable. It is pretty obvious 
 what will happen from the very beginning, and it simply feels unoriginal. While stories involving 
 ancient Egyptian Mummy's tend to be reasonably similar, this game really takes the biscuit with 
 the clichd settings and story. A mining company that has accidentally stumbled on a tomb during 
 excavations, WW2 Nazi links, an obvious bad guy with a hidden agenda in charge of the operation, 
 the coincidence of meeting a former girlfriend on the mining site, ... I could go on. It's all very 
 clichd and predictable and sadly its all been done much better before.
  
  The puzzles in Mummy are very obvious too. Now while I loathe the ridiculously hard puzzles that 
 require impossible leaps of logic and make no real sense that are commonplace in many games of 
 this genre, Mummy annoys me by going in completely the opposite direction. Everything is so obvious 
 that there is no challenge to it. Yes, it is logical, and I applaud it for that, but come on, I 
 need some challenge!
  
  The acting is average, with none of the (remarkably small) cast doing a particularly bad job. All 
 the performances lack any real life though, - it seems that the cast realised that the script was 
 dud and so couldn't really motivate themselves to give it their all. In terms of sound, Mummy is 
 quite good - the effects are all realistic, and there is some good background music at times that 
 adds atmosphere to the game.
  
  Graphically Mummy is pretty good, considering that it was made in 1996. The effects all look pretty 
 convincing, and the computer-rendered environments and objects look believable. Indeed, I'd say 
 that the graphics are Mummy's strongest point... it is just a shame that the plot and gameplay aren't 
 up to the same standard.
  
  In all, this is an incredibly short and easy adventure. It proved to be no real challenge to me, 
 and thus was ultimately disappointing. The premise of the story is good, though plays out very 
 obviously and feels like a tired rehash of something that has been done many times before. Blissfully 
 you will probably be able to pick this game up very cheap nowadays, but still I'd only recommend 
 it to hardcore fans of the genre. There are a lot of adverts in the packaging for Mummy's predecessor 
 "Frankenstein", starring Tim Curry, however based on my experience with Mummy there is no way in 
 Hell I'm getting another point and click game made by these people. Mummy: Tomb of the Pharaoh 
 promises so much, but sadly delivers so little.
