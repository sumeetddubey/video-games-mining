:::Review:::
Proves that the PC is indeed a viable platform for fighting games. 

 The PC is at a loss for good fighting games - anyone interested in the genre by now owns a game 
 console such as the Sony PlayStation, feeds quarters into arcade machines regularly, or both. Once 
 in a while, however, a game hits the PC that disturbs the status quo and proves that the PC is 
 indeed a viable platform for fighting games, despite popular opinion. In this particular case, 
 that game is X-Men: Children of the Atom, an admirable and near-exact conversion of Capcom's 1995 
 arcade hit, which pits 10 Marvel Comics' mutant fighters against one another in a Street Fighter 
 II-on-cappuccino-style battle to the finish. The impressively fluid animation of the arcade title 
 is retained perfectly in the PC version, as is the audio and most of the gameplay. What's more, 
 X-Men retails for a fraction of the cost of most PC games and will work fine on just about any 
 modern machine.  

 The look of X-Men translates marvelously in the PC conversion - the vibrant color of the arcade 
 is completely intact, as is each and every lovingly hand-drawn frame of animation. However, the 
 game runs at an unpleasantly low resolution and the frantic speed of the arcade is somewhat lost. 
 Each sound effect and speech sample (the X-Men's voices are done by the same folks who speak their 
 parts in the Saturday morning cartoon) is present, while the upbeat synthesized soundtrack rings 
 loud and clear through redbook CD audio. X-Men: Children of the Atom is an aesthetically powerful 
 package.  

 Surprisingly enough, those who mastered the game's six-button mechanics at the arcade will have 
 a pleasant time using the keyboard alone. However, X-Men cannot be played seriously except with 
 a multibutton gamepad of some sort, through which it controls pristinely. Special moves can be 
 unleashed with surgical precision, and above all else, the game feels just like the arcade. And 
 yet, a terribly important facet is left unattended: the ability to string together multiple punches 
 and kicks into massive custom chain combos is conspicuously missing. And, to add insult to injury, 
 the computer opponent will use those chain combos on you without hesitation even though you cannot 
 use them to retaliate. A simple patch to fix this problem would make a world of difference for 
 arcade purists.  

 As is, X-Men: Children of the Atom serves up some killer one-on-one martial arts action that's more 
 than enough to tide over those looking for a quick fix of fists and foul play. Fans of the arcade 
 game will be disappointed by the missing chain combos, but others won't mind for even a second, 
 as they'll be enjoying X-Men's slick visuals and cool character designs and wondering all the while 
 as to why the PC doesn't enjoy more games of this category.

Review:  Indoctrination is and will become an important expression of modern controversies. While my bro 
 is playing the bopsides, I turn to reality with a big amount on my back. This is the former union 
 of great protectionism over the last decade. Don't you se that despite the journey of reflectionality 
 and formalities there are many other abilities that a multiproposable government lightly should 
 be responsible to express in different loyalties. This repercussion is strongly refused amongst 
 the course of obniloyal submissions that the pivot slightly turns about while the inhabitants are 
 integrating in to the internal peace of eternal bjeng. Butoreplacement must be concerned amongst 
 this unwilling matter of cahornyment.
