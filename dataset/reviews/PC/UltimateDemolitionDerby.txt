Ultimate Demolition Derby sucks all the fun out of its subject matter and replaces it with half-baked 
 driving physics, an ugly graphics engine, and a host of other problems. 

  In this day and age, the demolition derby has become something of a lost art. Though never an especially 
 popular pastime in the grand scheme of things, derbies still made for some good old-fashioned intelligence-free 
 entertainment in their heyday. Over the years, a handful of game companies have tried to take the 
 art of the demolition derby and turn it into a game -- though all with, at best, limited success. 
 Global Star Software and 3 Romans' Ultimate Demolition Derby is yet another failure in a long line 
 of subpar derby games, though the level at which this game fails is really something to behold. 
 It's hard to imagine a more dismally lifeless and uninteresting game based upon the concept of 
 fast cars wrecking into each other at high speeds, yet somehow Ultimate Demolition Derby manages 
 to suck all the fun out of its subject matter and replaces it with half-baked driving physics, 
 an ugly graphics engine, and a host of frame rate and compatibility problems that can, at times, 
 make the game nearly unplayable.  

          Broken driving physics, thy name is Ultimate Demolition Derby.     

  There are nine 
 cars to choose from in Ultimate Demolition Derby, including an old pickup truck, a hot rod, a jeep, 
 a slightly different looking jeep, something that vaguely resembles a Mini Cooper, and a hertz. 
 In the game's single-player mode, you'll have four basic race types to choose from, though some 
 are just variations of other races. Essentially, your options are to take part in a traditional 
 demolition derby, where your goal is to drive around wrecking into your opponents until the last 
 car is left running or time runs out and you have the highest score, or you can race against five 
 other cars in a basic demolition race or a stunt race, where you'll need to do flips and spins 
 to earn points. Each mode essentially just keeps going each time you win, until presumably you 
 either quit or completely lose your mind. The game does feature a multiplayer mode, but it can 
 only be played on a LAN. Maybe if the game weren't so horrible, this might seem like a good addition, 
 but sadly, this is not the case.  

  The bulk of Ultimate Demolition Derby's gameplay problems lie in its driving controls and physics, 
 which come across as pretty haphazardly put together. Ultimate Demolition Derby does support game 
 controllers, but a controller actually won't work in the game's stunt race mode, because the shift 
 key is required to spin your car when you're in the air. The game generally just controls better 
 on a keyboard anyway -- a digital controller felt much too squirrelly to be of any use, and analog 
 control wasn't much better. As for the game's physics, they're essentially nonexistent. Apart from 
 slower cars moving appropriately slower, and faster cars moving faster, essentially every car feels 
 pretty much the same -- awful.  

  Your car jerks around in disconcerting ways if you turn too sharply; pulling your hand brake just 
 makes you stop and doesn't allow you to slide (or do anything remotely realistic) ; and crashing 
 just doesn't seem to work right. Most times, if you run into a wall, you'll somehow manage to just 
 drive halfway up that wall rather than actually  crash  into it. Half of the hits you deliver to 
 other cars don't seem to register properly, and it's near-impossible to gauge whether other cars, 
 or even your own car, are on the verge of destruction or are doing just fine. There is a gauge 
 in the bottom left of the screen that is supposed to show where your car is suffering from the 
 most damage, but it doesn't do its job very well.  

  Topping all those problems off are the game's graphics, which, simply put, are terrible. The whole 
 game looks like it was designed in about an hour and a half, with only the most rudimentary concept 
 of texture mapping and animation in mind. Cars feature a bit of real-time damage modeling, but 
 none of it looks very realistic, or good, for that matter. Every environment, though different, 
 has the same flat, nasty look to it, and in addition, few if any of them make any contextual sense 
 in the game. One minute you're getting your derby on inside a large cave, and the next minute you're 
 inside some sort of nondescript building, complete with glass doors you can't wreck through. All 
 of these problems pale, though, in comparison to Ultimate Demolition Derby's mind-numbingly erratic 
 frame rate. On a high-end PC, complete with up-to-date graphics drivers, every single race mode 
 ran horribly, chugging along in such a way that you'd think your PC was literally about to catch 
 on fire. On a midrange computer, we couldn't get the game to load up at all -- it would just shut 
 off our monitor upon startup. The fact that a game could be released with such amazingly obvious 
 graphical problems is simply mind-boggling.  

          The game has the look of some sort of horrible homebrew project, and it plays just about 
 as well as one, too.     

  Ultimate Demolition Derby's audio is just about as grating as everything else in the game. Though 
 the engine noises are fairly adequate, everything else sounds awful. Crashes are bizarrely understated, 
 and they don't really give you the feeling that you've just wrecked into another car at top speed. 
 In-game commentary shows up from time to time, both from the arena announcer and from other drivers, 
 and all of it just flat-out sucks, thanks to some awful voice acting and equally bad dialogue writing. 
 There's also a sparse bit of music that plays during races, but it's all badly compressed, and 
 none of the tracks are the least bit memorable.  

  If Ultimate Demolition Derby succeeds at anything, it does manage to make you want to go out and 
 take part in a real demolition derby -- or, to be more precise, it may make you want to get into 
 a car and drive it into some manner of solid object at 100 miles per hour. It is just an awful 
 game through and through, and it won't be enjoyed by anyone. Simply put: Don't play this game.

Review:  not to long ago i ordered the game ultimate demo derby by 3 romans inc. I expected a high speed 
 high action racing game , I was disappointed. The racing is terrible, the damage sucks, and the 
 sound is as crappy as it gets. there is a bit of real time damage, but its very limited and thanks 
 to the horrible voice acting on the announcers part and the horrible graphics engine, its not fun 
 at all. The cars are not that bad, but there are only 9 and they all handle and sound the same. 
 The tracks are horribly animated and all feel the same. as for the frame rate, the game redefines 
 choppy-nes. The music is un licenced is is very boring for that matter. all the music is a combination 
 of bleeps and bloops. The engine noises are the same for each car. Tire squealing is o. k but the 
 smoke looks like pieces of gray paper coming off the back of you're car.

Review:  Ultimate Demolition Derby is a great game. This game has crappy sound. Ultimate Demolition Derby 
 has crappy graphics. Game play is boring, stupid and pathetic. You will not be playing this game 
 alot. If you bought Ultimate Demolition Derby someone should take away your wallet or purse for 
 the next ten years to keep your bad taste from growing. The only cool thing about this game is 
 it's subject matter which is not a big factor because every thing else about this game sucks. Ultimate 
 Destruction Derby is only a step above the saddest game of all time: Big Rigs Over the Road Racing. 
 This game sucks completly and is a waste of time, money, and sanity.
