:::Review:::
A mediocre shooter with repetitive and boring action. 

 Machine Hunter fits squarely into that has-been category of top-down, low-res, action scrollers 
 with chunky, 2D sprites.  

 If anything, this game's lengthy production cycle and numerous name changes should have been MGM's 
 first clues that Machine Hunter was a lost cause. It was originally called H. O. S. T (with no explanation 
 of the acronym) and was set for release a year ago, then the name was changed to HOST (no periods) , 
 then Droid Hunter (LucasArts probably would not have approved) , then Suicide Run (are we kamikaze 
 pilots now?) , and finally Machine Hunter.  

 What it ended up with was a mediocre shooter with repetitive and boring action, lame visual effects, 
 and weak sound.  

 The gimmick to Machine Hunter is that as you kill off droids, you become them and gain whatever 
 firepower they had. Of course, if you're able to kill these guys with your inferior firepower, 
 why do you need to "step-up" to theirs?   

 The game plays out in what MGM's marketing geniuses describe as a "multilayered 3D hell" but things 
 look mighty 2D to me. Even using the four different camera angles, it's darn hard figuring out 
 where walkways end and drop-offs begin. You walk under bridges but have no idea if you'll come 
 out the other side. You can bump into bad guys in those unviewable locations and get blown to smithereens 
 or they can shoot you from off-screen. While the enemy can leap wildly around and blast you from 
 multiple angles, your movement is very limited and you can aim only in 45-degree increments. And, 
 at any one time, you can have only two weapons at your disposal.  

 You have only two control options - keyboard or joypad - and the controls are very confusing. The 
 cursor arrows control movement, but their actions change depending on the camera angle: left and 
 right movement keys suddenly become left-turn and right-turn keys. Bizarre.  

 Gameplay takes place in (would you believe) a tiny 320x240 screen (that's quarter-screen, folks) . 
 Expanding to full screen simply enlarges the pixels. This is the only game I've played where the 
 manual states: "Preferably play the game on a small monitor." The graphics are proportionately 
 poor. Dying soldiers leave little circular pools of red paint and explosions are tiny translucent 
 yellow/blue balls. One animation of an about-to-be-rescued hostage, jumping enthusiastically up 
 and down, was reminiscent of my Apple II version of Choplifter. Pretty cool 15 years ago, pretty 
 weak now.  

 Besides human-looking soldiers and nine droids, you'll encounter numerous other animated objects, 
 including floating whelks and blue clouds. But you don't know whether to shoot, pick up, or ignore 
 them. There is no explanation anywhere as to their purpose.  

 With all the hype this game has encountered, you'd expect something worth critiquing. But as it 
 stands, Machine Hunter isn't even worth picking up from the discount rack.
