:::Review:::
While the Rogue Spear mission pack doesn't provide a huge quantity of new maps, it does include 
 a lot of different ways to play on them. 

 Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Rogue Spear Mission Pack: Urban Operations has got to be one of the longest 
 names in the history of gaming. At first glance, it seems as if the amount of new content in the 
 actual game doesn't prove equal to the large number of words jammed into the title. But spend some 
 time with Red Storm's first expansion for its popular Rogue Spear, and it becomes apparent that 
 while the mission pack doesn't provide a huge quantity of new maps, it does include a lot of different 
 ways to play on them.  

 Here are the raw numbers: four new weapons, two new mini-campaigns each featuring five maps, and 
 eight new multiplayer maps.  

 Red Storm's use of "mini" to describe the two new campaigns should be taken literally. The first 
 campaign, called Urban Operations, includes five new maps set in five different cities across as 
 many countries. While each of the environments is well designed and looks great, the campaign itself 
 has no real plot. It's essentially five unrelated levels covering all the standard Rogue Spear 
 mission goals except recon. It won't take you more than a few hours to complete them. In addition, 
 even though the description on the Urban Ops box stresses the fact that you'll be shooting at terrorists 
 while trying to avoid innocent bystanders, only the first mission actually includes any pedestrian 
 traffic.  

 Classic Missions, the second campaign, consists of five maps that were originally included in Rainbow 
 Six and converted to run under the Rogue Spear engine. Other than some graphical improvements, 
 the missions remain unchanged. Again, this campaign offers no story; it is simply a set of unrelated 
 missions that can be blown through relatively quickly.  

 The brevity of the two new campaigns would make Urban Operations not worth purchasing for single-player 
 gaming, if it weren't for the new custom-missions option. This feature lets you replay any of the 
 game's maps with different mission goals against up to 50 terrorists. The mission goals are the 
 five available in Rogue Spear (assault, lone wolf, terrorist hunt, hostage rescue, and recon) plus 
 a new one called defend.  

 Defend requires you to hold a position against an onslaught of Tangos, all of whom desperately want 
 to press the button you're guarding. Although the game's packaging claims that some enhancements 
 have been made to Rogue Spear's enemy artificial intelligence, the only place this is really evident 
 is in defend missions, where the terrorists display a nerve-wracking tendency to toss grenades 
 at your location. Defend is an excellent complement to the hunting style of the standard mission 
 types. It's tense and a lot of fun.   

 Not every map is available in every mode with the custom-missions option. The eight new multiplayer 
 maps can only be used for lone wolf and terrorist hunt, and defend can only be played on the five 
 Urban Operation campaign maps. But between the 18 maps included in the game, there are about 60 
 different missions that can be set up using the custom-missions option, adding a lot of single-player 
 replay value to the game.  

 Since there's no true map editor for Rogue Spear, user-created maps for the game are nonexistent. 
 With that in mind, Urban Operations' 18 maps are like gold for reinvigorating the online experience. 
 The eight multiplayer-only maps are all rather small, but none of them seems like a total dog. 
 One of the best ones, called "old train tracks," is set up like a paintball arena with two sides 
 separated by a bridge, each having lots of wooden uprights for cover.  

 The realistic bent of Rogue Spear kind of limits the amount of creativity and surprising features 
 that can go into any new weapons. None of the four new weapons shoots a metal ball that attaches 
 itself to a victim's throat, drains his blood, replaces it with formaldehyde, then turns him into 
 a zombie before causing him to explode. Instead, they offer slight variations in firing rates and 
 handling characteristics that will only excite hard-core Rogue Spear fans.  

 Urban Operations isn't a radical rethinking of Rogue Spear, but it packs enough new content in both 
 single- and multiplayer modes to be worth purchasing. And unlike some other recent expansion packs, 
 it's priced to sell at under 20 bucks. Hell, the excitement of two-player co-op defend is worth 
 that much.

Review:  This does just what Gamespot says - it adds on missions.
  
  You still get all the same stuff as in Rainbow Six and Rogue Spear. You should own those two games 
 before you buy this.
  
  So assuming you do own the previous two games, you want to know if it is worth buying...
  
 
  I need to check, but if the original Rogue Spear does not give you practice mission like Man Hunt, 
 then this certainly will - and it is this feature that keeps you playing for several weeks.
  
  At day of release it was a rip-off, but at todays price it is still worth buying as an ADD 
 ON
