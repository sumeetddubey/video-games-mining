:::Review:::
Particle Systems has successfully created the type of game that fans of the space sim genre have 
 been waiting for years to play. 

 When the first Independence War game was released in 1998, it was lauded for its original design 
 and innovative gameplay. Independence War's distinctive style justly garnered attention, despite 
 competition from then-recently released games in each of the Wing Commander, X-Wing, and FreeSpace 
 space-combat series. Yet while Independence War's novelty was refreshing, it wasn't infectious 
 enough to prevent space sims from declining so significantly in popularity over the past couple 
 of years that most major publishers have now abandoned the genre. So, like its predecessor, the 
 new Independence War 2 faces a battle for attention -- except this time it's a struggle to generate 
 enthusiasm for its forsaken genre. Fortunately, Particle Systems has once again crafted an impressive 
 game that deserves recognition.           Independence War 2 features impressive, high-resolution 
 graphics...    

  Independence War 2 is naturally similar to its predecessor in many ways, but the developer also 
 made some significant changes to the original's design. Instead of limiting gameplay to a linear 
 series of scripted missions, Independence War lets you take the role of a pirate who can freely 
 explore an expansive star system, looting merchants and destroying enemy factions. For years, space 
 sim fans have been looking for another free-form game like Elite or Privateer, and the only game 
 that's come close was X: Beyond the Frontier. Even that game's potential wasn't truly realized 
 until it was supplemented by an expansion pack, which was never released in North America, and 
 even then the game lacked an involving overall storyline. Independence War 2 provides both an elaborate, 
 open-ended environment and a meaty plot to unfold.   

  The game is set long after the war for independence that formed the basis for the plot of the original 
 game. The central government has lost much of its influence to large corporations that leveraged 
 their discovery of new technology to gain power. Independent settlements are being overrun by the 
 evil corporations, which are effectively turning most of the population into slave laborers. Your 
 character's desire to confront the corporations is primarily motivated by revenge, not altruism, 
 as one of the corporate leaders ruthlessly slaughtered his father. To avenge your father's death, 
 you'll have to gain a reputation through pirating and align yourself with various factions that 
 will request your aid. There are plenty of well-produced cinematics that advance the plot, including 
 an introduction that rivals the original game's opening in length, if not quality. The AI construct 
 of Jefferson Clay, a famous starship captain who also served as a mentor in the original game, 
 makes a welcome return, and your small group of companions has a lot of character. You can both 
 control how rapidly you advance the plot and the order in which you embark on a number of missions, 
 but the plot is occasionally cartoonish when compared to the civil war backdrop of the original 
 game. The main villain, in particular, is so unrelentingly malevolent in such an over-the-top manner 
 that he's dull. Still, the story is constantly engaging, especially near the end of the game when 
 all of your enemies are unveiled.           ... and an intuitive, effective onscreen interface. 
    

  The original Independence War was renowned both for having more realistic physics than most space 
 sims and for allowing you to pilot a larger craft than a fighter. Independence War 2 retains the 
 realistic feel of its predecessor's physics system, although the effects of inertia have been made 
 more manageable, and there aren't any annoying missions requiring you to overcome physics-based 
 puzzles. In Independence War, you were given control of a medium-sized corvette, and you frequently 
 had to switch perspectives between four different control stations. In the sequel, you still get 
 to fly some sizeable ships, but you'll initially be limited to steering less intimidating craft 
 than the original game's corvette. Ships also generally no longer have crews, as most ships are 
 now flown by a single pilot. All of the flyable ships have a streamlined, consistent interface 
 that lets you access the functions previously provided by the four different systems stations (command, 
 navigation, engineering, and weapons) from a single perspective. While it's still useful to switch 
 your view to an external perspective in certain situations, it's no longer mandatory to do so since 
 the third-person perspective of the original game's weapons station has been abandoned. The streamlined 
 controls are less effective at conveying the sense that you're in control of a sizeable vessel, 
 but they are much easier to manage.    

 In fact, the interface is much more polished than it was in the original game. There are still some 
 strange quirks, such as the fact that the default control bindings allocate three key joystick 
 buttons to energy and missile weapons and yet you still can't fire them concurrently, but the new 
 control system is generally both effective and unique. While combat in most space sims frequently 
 devolves into turning battles with combatants frantically circling to focus guns on similarly thrashing 
 opponents, battles in Independence War 2 play out differently. The controls borrow elements more 
 commonly found in first-person shooters. Adept players will commonly use side strafing, since one 
 of the best ways to maneuver to avoid missiles is to use side thrusters, and disable inertial-dampening 
 thrusters so that they can attack in one direction while they are traveling on a different course. 
 Battles can also occur at tremendous speeds, since you can constantly accelerate your velocity, 
 although exceeding the limits imposed by nearby stations invites additional grief from nearby patrols. 
 Fleeing to a less vulnerable position is also a constant tactical maneuver.           An encyclopedia 
 feature informs you of all the dozens of ships in the game.    

  Independence War 2 is perhaps the only space sim that effectively conveys the immense distances 
 involved in intra- and interstellar travel. The only manageable way to travel sizeable distances 
 is through engaging an LDS (or, linear-displacement drive system) , which lets you travel exponentially 
 faster. At high LDS speeds, your craft will speed by beautifully rendered planets and suns. If 
 you effectively use your LDS drive, you'll be almost unbeatable, since you can rapidly, completely 
 repair even hull damage -- but enemies frequently use missiles that will prevent you from engaging 
 your LDS drive, and all installations will also generate their own anti-LDS fields. You can also 
 travel even faster to certain destinations using jump gates called Lagrange points, provided that 
 your ship is equipped with a capsule engine drive. Stealth is also often important in certain situations -- there 
 are a number of ways you can adjust your power settings or otherwise configure your ship to minimize 
 the ability of other vessels to detect you.   

  While the heads-up display in the original game was relatively clunky, it's been significantly 
 streamlined and improved in Independence War 2. Whenever your ship is moving, grid lines will appear 
 on the screen to ensure that you can easily determine your ship's course. Your HUD also causes 
 nearby ships to produce contrails, allowing you to instantly establish where the vessels are traveling. 
 The grid lines and contrails displayed on the HUD work efficiently and don't obscure your view 
 as much as they did in the original game. Other than the predominately useless radar orb, the HUD 
 displays a great deal of information well and lets you focus on making tactical decisions.     
       You can dock at base to save your progress during missions.    

  While music was largely omitted in the original game, Independence War 2 makes extensive use of 
 its high-quality soundtrack. The graphics are crisp and colorful, and capable of being rendered 
 in very high resolutions -- although the HUD doesn't also scale, so it's less readable at sharper 
 resolutions. You'll get ample opportunity to enjoy the graphics as well, since you'll constantly 
 travel by different interstellar phenomena, and external views are useful in a number of situations. 
 The game also automatically changes to a third-person perspective "director mode" whenever your 
 ship docks, or otherwise interacts, with another object. The individual ships aren't quite as large 
 as some of the capital ships in other recent space sims such as FreeSpace 2, or at least they seem 
 less imposing because your ship is frequently traveling at tremendous speeds. But the ships are 
 rendered in great detail, so much so that you can actually zoom in to get a clear view of your 
 pilot. There are lots of other excellent graphical touches, such as the game's detailed explosions 
 and the stone chips that splinter off from asteroids just before they're blasted to rubble.   

 
  The trading aspects of the game are simplistic, and you can only acquire a small fleet of wingmen, 
 but it's still addictive to raid transports for items that let you improve your ships. Each item 
 you acquire can be recycled, used to better equip your own small fleet of vessels, or traded for 
 more useful items. There are dozens of different weapons, pieces of equipment, and other cargo 
 items that you can acquire or manufacture, and the more effective you are as a privateer, the easier 
 you'll find the scripted missions. It's worthwhile spending a significant amount of time acquiring 
 better equipment, since some of the scripted missions are very difficult.

Review:  I love space sim... I have played much pretty anything (Tachyon: The Fringe, Independence War 1, 
 Jumpgate) and I can tell you that this game is one of the best around...
  
  The gameplay of this game is difficult to the ones that just started with this game (especially 
 if you don't have a joystick) , but after some practice you learn how to control your ship, and 
 how to use the psychics in your favor, then it will be much more easier to play.
  
  the storyline, is really well placed, and it will give you a really nice experience and lots of 
 gameplay hours, and the freelance mode is really nice, and gets better (if you use some of the 
 addons that this game can use)
  
  the graphics, they are really nice up to this date (I have only seen Eve-Online match those starts 
 background) , and the colors of the suns and planets are just amazing.
  
  One thing that this game has that a lot of others doesn't, is the fact that you can add addons 
 and mods to this game, and enhance the multi-player and single-player mode, such as adding a buying 
 system to use in stations, enhanced graphics mode, etc... this game is the best of the best that 
 is around this places, and it's highly addictive

Review:  I was a big fan of the space-combat-fighter games, among them the X-Wing/Tie Fighter series, Wing 
 Commander series, and Freespace 2. This game came out when the genre had already fallen out of 
 favor. However, it's one of the best. It has a superb story. The controls are great. You also get 
 the freedom to fly around and do stuff on your own freely, mainly raiding convoys for profit. I 
 loved the music. I liked Independence War 1 quite a bit until I just got a bit frustrated because 
 it was too hard. But this game corrected the problems with IW and took it to new levels.
  
  You need a joystick to play this game, and I wouldn't want to play without one. Games of this type 
 are just not the same with a mouse or gamepad. My Microsoft Sidewinder was great, and there are 
 others. If you don't have a joystick, well I'd suggest you either get one or stay away from this 
 game. If anyone gave this game a negative review, my guess is they tried playing it without a joystick.
 
  
  I think the joystick issue is one reason why this genre lost popularity. For some reason, game 
 publishers decided that gamers didn't have joysticks any more, so they stopped publishing games 
 which utilized joysticks. After all, you can't port joystick games to consoles -- the two don't mix. 
 That's a shame because I miss games of this type. I wish they would let PC games be PC games and 
 stop insisting that things work cross-platform just because it's an action-oriented game.

Review:  This is the best space/adventure type game i have ever played. I have Star Trek Bridge Commander 
 and a bunch of other space games but none feel as involved and deep as this one. The only problem 
 I have with this game is some of the control settings. It is difficult to change the controls like 
 mouse function as I had to go into configuration text files and manually add lines in the text 
 file to accept the mouse axes and so forth. This is not a big problem but takes some figuring out... Il 
 put mine up (wish i found this)
  
  - Mouse controls the look direction while ASDW controls [left] [down] [right] [up]
  
  All you 
 got to do is go into the Game folder where ever it is /configs then open the keyboard_only file 
 with wordpad and delete everything replacing it with the fallowing then close and save the file 
 and in the game options select the keyboard only style: key;

Review:  Space sims are so hard to find. When I got hold of Independence War 2, that from a publisher like 
 Atari -- I was way too excited. To me, Space Sims are a completely different type of gaming experience. 
 Once you are hooked into a game -- that becomes an unforgettable experience.
  Given the Gamespot's rating, I expected nothing less from this game. The graphics looked good and 
 the game opened well. But when I started playing it, I started sweating with the controls. When 
 I thought I managed the controls -- I felt that I was going nowhere with the game. The space seemed 
 like infinity and I was floating aimlessly in the dark. So I quit and retry. I quit and start from 
 a different point. Whatever I do -- everything seemed aimless till I grew tired of trying. I realised 
 that I must have overlooked some of the controls and commands -- which led me to drive my ship aimlessly.
 
  But my point is -- a game should come in a package of easy set of basic controls. If its too hard -- 
 its not meant for me. I put this game in this category and shelved it for good. Too bad, I missed 
 the good stuffs inside.

Review:  Independence War was a true simulator where you were in charge of all aspects of a large hulking 
 starship. Unlike other space games at the time, you didn't just zip around dog fighting with enemy 
 fighters and making attack runs on capital ships. Instead you piloted a huge craft with intricate 
 systems that had to be monitored at all times. Your starship also came equipped with a command 
 module/flight deck that could detach from the main FTL drive section (like the saucer section of 
 the Enterprise) allowing you to perform more intricate missions. Perhaps the most unique aspect 
 of the original Independence War was the real life Newtonian physics of the game; mainly a well 
 known yet seldom used concept called inertia. Unlike other space fighter games where your ships 
 zip around the vacuum of space with amazing maneuverability, Independence War featured realistic 
 inertia. If your ship was moving in one direction it continued to do so until you altered that 
 course by rotating and thrusting your ship in the opposite direction, much like the classic arcade 
 game, Asteroids. Now, after three years, Particle Systems is back with the sequel to the original 
 space simulation that broke all the rules and became a cult classic. Edge of Chaos has been retooled 
 to play much more like all the other games out there. While it retains some of the concepts that 
 made the original great, it almost seems as if the designers caved in to the pressure to make a 
 consumer friendly fighter game rather than a diehard simulation. The game opens with an amazing 
 movie that rivals the CGI animation quality of Reboot or even Action Man. When the movie is over 
 you are put in the shoes of 12-year-old orphan, Cal Johnson. Your only friend is a computer replica 
 of Jefferson Clay, an ancient war hero who played a pivotal role in the first game. Clay now serves 
 as your mentor, residing in the upper-left corner of your screen dispensing advice in his creepy 
 electronic voice. He's almost like a demented Max Headroom.

Review:  If you're reading this, five years after the games release and well into the death of space sims, 
 you're probably wondering if you should purchase this game. As you've probably already assumed, 
 I'm going to say you should. You should. To put it simply... X3. Huge game. Lots of stuff to do 
 and fly. And yet, it feels sort of cold ... lifeless, if you will. Sure, the galaxy in that is 
 busy, but it just feels strange. In I-War 2, however, you see your cockpit gently rock with the 
 ships acceleration, the indepedent traders put slight spins into their maneuvers to maximize thruster 
 efficiency (realistically, you actually travel faster in this if you're flying at a tilted angle, 
 firing both your main engines and horizontal and vertical thrusters... i think you do, at least) 
 and the dissonant chords of multiple missiles slamming into a megafreighter's engines, disabling 
 it just as it's sister ship materializes from the LaGrange point, colliding, annihilating all of 
 the nearby craft in the explosion and leaving you with a small hoard of loot (MFreighters are HUGE) . 
 Things feel real in this. Where games like X3 deliver quantity, I-War 2 serves up a steaming batch 
 of quality.
  
  Oh, and the graphics are still excellent by today's standards. I have yet to see a game with better 
 explosions, and the stellar vista is comparable if not superior to that of Eve Online.
  
  The sound effects are very good in this as well; the sound effects are, as far as I can tell, largely 
 unique and not used in other games; the sound echoing in space effect is great- just listen to 
 your ship smack into another one, or a swarm of Harrower Missiles emit their distinctive pitch. 
 The music is absolutely amazing; It's a great blend of cosmic resonance a la Homeworld, with bass 
 string instruments thrown in for good measure. It's pretty hard to describe, but you'll be hooked 
 to it in no time.
  
  I'm giving this straight tens because it is, to me, a flawless package- a game with focus, polish, 
 and thoroughly baked goodness. It's even got a great slew of mods from the community. So many games 
 these days try to hit you with lots of great features, but they all lack cohesion; it's like watching 
 a good movie or reading a great book... this has a well defined plot, and nothing feels like it 
 was just tacked on either halfheartedly or uselessly. Along with TIE Fighter and Heavy Gear 2, 
 this game has held my attention longer than any modern epic .
  
  Make sure you have a tri-axis joystick with a POV hat, though; that's half the experience.

Review:  While space sims may not be my favorite genre, I do enjoy the occasional gem that comes along . 
 Tie Fighter was one of my first and favorite space sims, along with Descent: Freespace and Freespace 
 2, and yes, Tachyon: The Fringe (highly underrated game) . Independence War 2 is now added to my 
 list of great space simulations, and it is the best to come along since Tie Fighter, in my opinion.
 
  
  Upon loading the game, I was greeted with a slick interface. There are relatively few options, 
 so setting my preferences and starting a game was easy. Starting a game treated me to a beautiful 
 cutscene. By the way, the cutscenes in this game are breathtaking; they honestly look like something 
 a hollywood animation group would release.
  
  Gameplay is a little tricky at first, but if you have a joystick it becomes fairly easy after some 
 practice. It takes a little practice to master the controls, but after you do it actually becomes 
 a great deal of fun mastering your reletively large ship. Physics act in a realistic manner, so 
 if you are going 1 kilometer/second and make a tight turn, your momentum will carry you in the 
 direction you were going for a few extra seconds. This can put you at an advantage when engaging 
 hostiles because it acts as a strafing mechanism, or it can ruin you if you are heading into a 
 space station.
  
  The storyline does an excellent job of keeping the flow of the game going, and it offers many hours 
 of gameplay. The greatest attraction of Independence War 2 is the open-ended nature of the game. 
 Upon leaving your hangar, you can choose to either complete a mission, or fly around at your lesiure. 
 Some of the best moment were on piracy missions, where I would shoot the engines off of 2 fully 
 loaded freighters and then engage their 6 corvette escorts. Very exciting!
  
  Grahpics are amazing, even to this day. Flying through nebulae and literally dodging your way between 
 planets and suns when youre doing your "hyperspace" thing is not only exciting, but very beautiful. 
 I often found myself getting sucked into a bue-white star like a moth to the flame because they 
 were so good looking. Sound is also great, with excellent dialog and weapon and explosion sounds.
 
  
  One major problem that always sticks with me when I play this game is the difficulty of dogfights 
 and navigation. In order to navigate to a plant in another system, you must access a starmap and 
 then select the planet. Unfortunately, the game often doesnt tell you what solar system the plant 
 it in. So, while it will tell you what galaxy to travel to, you will need to search through dozens 
 of stars in order to find the specific planet or space station you need. Fortunately, there are 
 some excellent aftermarket mods that help remedy this situation by creating an easily-navigated 
 list of star system and planets. In addition to navigation, dogfights can be extremely hard. I 
 often found myself resorting to a couple cheats (namely the god mode cheat and the destroy targeted 
 enemy cheat) when I was close to dying. The problem is, there is no midflight save system (meaning 
 you must return to base to save a game) so while you only have 5 minutes left, you really dont 
 want to die 30 minutes into a mission so god mode becomes a really attractive solution.
  
  Overall, if you consider yourself a fan of space sims, or even just a flight sim fan with an interest 
 in sci fi, then this is a great game for you.

Review:  Sadly the game doesn't quite deliver on the promise of non-linear play. Rather it gives you the 
 impression that you're in total control of your own destiny while still maintaining a pretty linear 
 mission path. There are some choices to be made in the game , choices that will have a significant 
 impact on your future , but overall I still felt like the missions were all lined up and coming 
 at me one at a time. I found the whole economic side of the game to be a little underdeveloped.
 
  The story's a little ponderous and the control system is evil to configure.
  It's a big game alright but I'm not sold on the replayability of the single player campaign. Multiplayer 
 is fun.
  
  Graphics
  The game looks brilliant. The effects, models and textures are first rate and will definitely show 
 off your system.
  
  Sound
  Great effects and ambient music. The voice acting is pretty lame.
  
  Gameplay
  The non-linear 
 premise falls a little short. The physics model is enjoyable and unique but there's too much downtime.

Review:  "One hundred years have passed since the end of the first Independence War, and far from the riches 
 of Sol and the core systems, trouble is brewing.
  
  The Badlands Cluster: Eight barely habitable star systems populated by the flotsam and jetsam of 
 humanity who, after years of oppression at the hands of greedy corporations and ruthless marauder 
 bands, are ready to fight back.
  
  15 years after witnessing the murder of his father by the sadistic heir to a corporate fortune, 
 Cal Johnston plans his revenge. With the help of a small band of escaped prisoners - and a dead 
 war hero immortalised in silicon - his actions inadvertently become the trigger for rebellion.
 
  
  The stage is set for history to repeat itself, and force mankind once more over the Edge of Chaos.."
 
  
  
  
  The story is compelling, the music is austounding, the graphics are way above their time, The physics 
 are extreamly realistic and the many various weapons have a BANG fealing to them... This game feals 
 like you are playing in a movie. 
  
  There are parts in the story that have you on the edge of crying, You feal as if the characters 
 are real people and they all have a different personality. You can realate to the characters fealings 
 throught the story.
  
  Out of all the games i have ever expierenced, this one will go down as most memorable. This game 
 has won many awards because this is a truly spectacular game.
