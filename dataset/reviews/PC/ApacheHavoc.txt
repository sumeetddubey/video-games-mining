:::Review:::
Apache Havoc offers a great mix of realism and approachability, so that hard-core fans and novices 
 alike should find a lot to like in the game. 

 If you take a look at combat helicopter sims, you have two fairly distinct categories. On the one 
 hand, you have Longbow 2, a hard-core sim of the highest order that comes replete with excellent 
 realism, top-notch graphics, and a relatively steep learning curve. On the other hand, you have 
 games like Comanche 3 and Team Apache, which sacrifice varying degrees of realism in favor of fast-paced, 
 easier gameplay and (in the case of Team Apache at least) multiplayer action. Now, along comes 
 Apache Havoc, from Empire Interactive and Razorworks Studios. Where does this two-in-one sim fall 
 along the spectrum of helicopter sims? Right smack in the middle.  

 Apache Havoc offers a great mix of realism and approachability, so that hard-core fans and novices 
 alike should find a lot to like in the game. Not only do you get to fly either the AH-64D Apache 
 Longbow or the Mil Mi-28 Havoc B, but you also get to take part in three different dynamic campaigns 
 as well as some memorable multiplayer airborne deathmatches.  

 The game does not include an instant-action feature per se, but you can take off for free flights, 
 dynamic missions, dynamic campaigns, or multiplayer missions (co-op or competitive) . Free flight 
 is a good place to start for novices, as the game's flight engine is reasonably accurate and therefore 
 requires some practice to master. Most of the individual realism settings (wind, retreating blade 
 stall, and ground effect, among others) can be dialed up or down to accommodate your skill and 
 preference. Also, the game includes a basic three-level difficulty setting that affects the overall 
 challenge of the missions and campaigns.  

 The campaigns in Apache Havoc take place in three global hot spots: Cuba, the former Russian state 
 of Georgia, and the "Golden Triangle" of Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos. Each campaign is dynamic 
 and somewhat reminiscent of EF-2000 and F-22 Total Air War. The unique twist to Apache Havoc's 
 campaigns is that you begin with only one and a half hours on the campaign clock. That clock ticks 
 down as you fly missions - you gain some time if you accomplish a mission, and you lose extra time 
 when you fail (extra, meaning time beyond what you spent trying to accomplish the mission) . When 
 you run out of time, the campaign is over, and whichever side is closest to its objective goals 
 wins. A clock may not be the most exciting of motivators, but it works well in Apache Havoc.  

 
 One thing I didn't much like about the early stages of each campaign (dynamic or not) was that 
 the missions are all pretty dry. Recon, scout, and combat air patrol are the rule of the day, and 
 for a while these missions tend to come up empty in terms of targets, let alone excitement of any 
 kind. Even worse, when you complete some of the basic scout missions, the computer maps an insanely 
 long return route to a base several map grids away. The result is not only a boring mission, but 
 also a very, very long boring mission. The "skip ahead" feature from F-22 Total Air War would be 
 welcome in Apache Havoc. Still, once the campaign heats up a bit and you complete some of the simpler 
 hops, you'll have better missions to fly.  

 While the graphics in Apache Havoc are not quite up to the sheer beauty of Longbow 2 on all fronts, 
 they are exceptionally good. The unit models in particular are excellent and highly detailed, and 
 the weather and weapons effects border on spectacular. Also, the level of detail on the ground 
 is fantastic - particularly on airfields, where you can see all the other aircraft and support 
 equipment. The terrain can be a bit uninspiring at altitude, but you're not really supposed to 
 be up that high anyway (this is an attack helicopter remember) . Once you're down near the ground, 
 following rivers and popping up over tree lines, the terrain quality becomes very immersive.  

 
 The trees themselves are a touch disappointing, though, since they're just blocks of space with 
 treelike textures on them. And the colors can be a bit garish at times, but otherwise the game 
 looks great. This is especially true at high resolution (the game runs as high as 1280x1024) . Unfortunately, 
 the developers created cockpit graphics for 640x480 only. For invisible cockpit fans like me, this 
 is no big deal, but if you like to keep the cockpit graphics on while flying, the ridiculously 
 small, floating 640x480 cockpit on your 1024x768 screen might prove annoying. Also, Apache Havoc 
 can be a brutish resource hog - even on a Pentium II 450 with 128MB RAM and dual Voodoo2 cards, 
 the game chugged whenever I flew over an area with lots of buildings or ships.  

 The music in Apache Havoc is techno-pop, which seems out of place but quickly fades to repetitive 
 background noise after a few minutes. The sound effects, on the other hand, can be remarkable. 
 Though the radio chatter is jerky and occasionally cryptic, the vehicle sounds are excellent. Flying 
 low over a patch of trees looking for a column of enemy armor (which seemed to be actively trying 
 to hide from me) , I actually heard the tank treads below before I could spot the individual tanks. 
 Can you really hear tanks from inside an Apache cockpit? I have no idea, but it was damn cool in 
 the game.  

 Apache Havoc is a good all-around sim that impresses despite its odd assortment of quirks. While 
 the game is unlikely to make Longbow 2 devotees drop the Jane's classic, it is a solid addition 
 to the genre.
