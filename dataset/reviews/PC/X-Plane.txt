:::Review:::
X-Plane is essentially a rigorous flight simulator that simulates everything from helicopters and 
 small civilian two-seaters to jet spy planes and the space shuttle. 

 X-Plane has long been a labor of love for its developer, Austin Meyer. Originally sold as a commercial 
 product to companies testing aircraft designs (and with an attendant $200 price tag) , X-Plane is 
 now available at a regular game price as a boxed retail product. However, the move to more mainstream 
 distribution hasn't changed X-Plane's focus one bit, so fans of the game can rest easy: It's still 
 the most advanced flight simulation available.   

  X-Plane is essentially a rigorous flight simulator that uses an engineering process called "blade 
 element analysis" to simulate everything from helicopters and small civilian two-seaters to jet 
 spy planes and the space shuttle. In X-Plane, the focus is on flight simulation above all else. 
 X-Plane is not strictly a civilian sim, although it's definitely not a combat sim, as there is 
 no combat in it whatsoever. But combat aircraft are available, and the overall range of planes 
 in X-Plane is the most diverse of any sim you can buy: Cessnas, Lear Jets, airliners, the AV-8 
 Harrier, and even the X-15, which holds both the altitude and speed records for a winged aircraft. 
 If it flies, you can either find it in X-Plane, or you can build it with the Plane Maker and Part 
 Maker utilities included in the game. These are comprehensive tools for designing and building 
 your own aircraft, which you can then fly. It's a complete and powerful package, although one that's 
 not trivial to use.   

  The flight models are quite realistic, as you'd probably expect, and they drive home just how difficult 
 some of these aircraft are to fly. If you've flown the F-105 Thunderchief or F-4 Phantom in Jane's 
 USAF, a spin in the X-Plane versions should illustrate just how differently they fly compared to 
 those in the Jane's version. While X-Plane's manual acknowledges that even X-Plane's flight model 
 can't account for everything, it's still very apparent just how meticulously researched and developed 
 the product is.   

  The graphics in X-Plane are scalable to adjust for CPU and video card capabilities, but even at 
 the highest resolution and detail settings, X-Plane isn't going to compete with more established 
 flight sims in terms of looks. It's by no means ugly, but both the terrain textures and aircraft 
 models do look a bit dated. X-Plane also renders its 3D using OpenGL, meaning that video cards 
 based on the Nvidia TNT/GeForce chipsets will be best suited for running the game at high frame 
 rates. This also means that owners of video cards made by Matrox should exercise caution, since 
 Matrox's OpenGL drivers have always been problematic, and a test system we tried with a Matrox 
 G400 card and the latest drivers was unable to get an acceptable frame rate even with a CPU far 
 in excess of the minimum requirement. Of further note, X-Plane's simple sounds are nothing to get 
 excited about, although that's not a significant shortcoming.   

  Because the emphasis in X-Plane is on flight simulation, some parts of the game seem incomplete. 
 Thus, while the flight models are outstanding, the frills that you'd generally get with other commercial 
 civilian sims are missing. One of the great pleasures in games like Flight Unlimited and the Microsoft 
 Flight Simulator series is the ability to see familiar landmarks and terrain reproduced in detail, 
 making your virtual flying experience seem that much more real. In X-Plane, obstacles are simply 
 generic. However, in keeping with its do-it-yourself ethic, X-Plane includes a fully featured utility 
 called World Maker, which lets you create your own structures and textures for them. So if you 
 wanted to create the Transamerica Pyramid for X-Plane, you could try. Just don't expect to find 
 it already in the game.   

  At heart, X-Plane is a very flexible physics lesson. For instance, there is a feature that lets 
 you fly your planes on Mars. Of course, in the almost nonexistent atmosphere of Mars, aircraft 
 designed for Earth are useless. Fortunately, X-Plane comes with a couple of concept craft designed 
 for Martian excursions. And, as mentioned above, you can also fly the space shuttle. Austin Meyer 
 is constantly improving the game, and though we reviewed version 5.52, version 5.54 is already 
 available, and it includes new features such as a multiplayer mode. Fortunately, once you purchase 
 the game, subsequent upgrades are available for free from the game's Web site at  http://www. x-plane. com/ 
 .   

  X-Plane is really part simulation and part engineering tool. The Plane Maker and Part Maker utilities 
 are extremely powerful and are an integral part of the product, but it's likely that only a small 
 segment of flight sim enthusiasts will want to spend much time with them. Those wanting to fly 
 civilian aircraft with authentic cockpit replicas (the X-Plane versions are generic) in a well-developed 
 virtual world are better served by other available civilian flight simulations. However, if your 
 interest lies in seeing actual physical differences between aircraft, getting a sense of the different 
 flight characteristics of a wide range of planes, and really seeing what a realistic flight model 
 is, then X-Plane is unquestionably the best simulation available for you. Furthermore, if you're 
 inclined to tinker with new plane designs, and maybe see yourself as a budding aeronautical engineer, 
 then you should definitely own a copy.

Review:  X-PLANE is the most high tech flight simulator out there. Realistic flight models. the game even 
 comes with, plane builder, you can also build helicopters, Part maker for planes, world maker make 
 you own world to fly in, and weather briefer so if you click on this you can see what weather there 
 will be on the way to the places you choose, you can even change the planet you fly on. which one 
 will you choose MARS or EARTH. and the space shuttle comes in you can fly the space shuttle only 
 on earth but i think you can go up to space and fly around Earth, NOT SURE. but game is awesome.
 
  
  You can set yourself in a situation like, Land on a carrier, or put out forest fires and more. 
 THE BEST FLIGHT SIMULATOR OUT THERE
  
  Hope the review helped gamers
  
  PEACE
  
  
  Make sure you get this game new cause youll need the instructions for this game, thats for 
 sure. The best place to get this game new is eBay, type in x-plane pc that might help. and the 
 ones selling on eBay are really cheap so
  Again hoped the review helped. 
  
  PEACE Again
