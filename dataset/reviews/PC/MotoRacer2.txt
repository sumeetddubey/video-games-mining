Bigger and better than its predecessor, Moto Racer 2 offers more tracks, more bikes, and a custom 
 track-editing feature that seriously enhances the game's replay value. 

 Bigger and better than its predecessor, Moto Racer 2 from Electronic Arts and Delphine offers more 
 tracks, more bikes, and a custom track-editing feature that seriously enhances the game's replay 
 value. This is still not a true motorcycle simulation, but as arcade racers go, Moto Racer 2 is 
 one of the best.  

 Like the original game, Moto Racer 2 allows you to race superbikes or motocross dirt bikes on a 
 variety of tracks. There are eight different bikes in each category, each with its own ratings 
 for brakes, grip, top speed, and acceleration. As in the previous version, the quality of your 
 brakes is meaningless, because you rarely use the things. Top speed and acceleration are usually 
 the most important items to consider, though a good grip rating becomes vital in bad weather conditions. 

 One of the game's strengths is the sheer number of tracks available to you right at the outset - 
 a whopping 32. True, eight of these tracks are repetitive simple loops that are intended as templates 
 for the track editor (more on that in a second) , but the other 24 tracks still represent a refreshing 
 change from the usual "win on every track and we'll unlock one more" formula. The tracks are split 
 evenly between superbike and motocross courses, and the environments include city streets, a rain 
 forest, the desert, and the countryside of Brittany.  

 If the basic tracks aren't quite enough to satisfy you, the game also allows you to create and edit 
 your own tracks with a slick built-in editing tool. Beginning with a flat circle, you can add and 
 move control points, which allow you to alter the shape of the track. You can then raise and lower 
 control points to create hills and valleys. The editor warns you when you've created too sharp 
 a curve or too steep a hill, so you're pretty much assured of building a decent track every time. 
 Finally, you can select any one of the game's preset environments for your track, and the editor 
 will apply it automatically. It would have been nice to have more freedom in the placing of certain 
 scenic elements (such as tunnels and bridges) , but overall the editor is impressive. Once you have 
 a track built and saved, you can easily share it with other Moto Racer 2 fans - each custom track 
 file only takes up about 1KB of disk space. The track editor helps to keep the game playable even 
 after you've conquered all the default courses. Better yet, it brings back fond memories of EA's 
 Racing Destruction Set (for those Commodore 64 veterans out there) .  

 Gameplay is pretty much like the original Moto Racer. The game is not a motorcycle simulation, but 
 it does feel sufficiently different from most car-racing games. Also, Moto Racer 2 does a great 
 job of conveying the sheer speed of each race: When you top 150mph in Moto Racer 2, you really 
 feel like you're going that fast. The difficulty levels are well stepped so that you can win pretty 
 easily on the lowest setting but will be hard-pressed to place in the top three on the highest. 

 After playing Motocross Madness, some gamers may be disappointed by the limited - and relatively 
 tame - tricks available in Moto Racer 2's motocross mode. Some other gameplay elements are disappointing 
 as well, such as the fact that your speed drops almost to zero when you brush another bike - even 
 though that bike continues to fly along at its previous pace. Also, the hard-to-spot curbs along 
 the side of most tracks have the same deadening effect on your bike and will virtually eliminate 
 you from contention after a single bump on the highest difficulty setting. Rarely will you ever 
 crash in this game, unless you hit an obstacle during a wheelie (and then you might as well give 
 up, as the game waits for an excruciatingly long time before setting you back on your bike) . In 
 fact, if you hit a jump poorly during a motocross race and start flying off the track, an invisible 
 barrier will snap you right back in bounds, and you won't even lose control of your bike.  

 Obviously, the game was intended for fast-paced arcade action, and on that level it performs admirably. 
 So long as you're not looking for a pure motorcycle sim with realistic physics and tons of motocross 
 tricks to land, you simply can't go wrong with Moto Racer 2. With two racing modes, thrilling gameplay, 
 a ton of tracks, and a track editor, Moto Racer 2 offers a whole lot of action for any arcade racing 
 fan.

Review:  I bought this game so long ago. I loved the original, although I never owned it before. When I 
 got this, it was like woah. Motoracer 2 is bloody good fun. It still has great things about it 
 which have been lost in many more recent pc games. Like where has the absence of split-screen gone? 
 In arcade racing games, you have to have split screen. to set the scene, its you in the best seat 
 with the keyboard, and your mate on the dining room chair, using that gamepad that you bought but 
 never use. Its 1v1 with no AI, racing around your own custom map which you both just designed and 
 made in a matter of minutes. That gets me rolling onto my other point. Custom maps. The editor, 
 while not 100% customiseable, is actually extremely simple, and quality. You can change the tracks 
 corners, add bumps, change the height of everything. Then when you come to test it, you can change 
 the look of it during the test! Its so simple.
  A major glitch is that this wont run on XP anymore, however it can be patched at http://ramal. free. fr/mr2. htm
 
  Since this game is coming up to 10 years old, it is very dated. But when compared to games that 
 are from the same era, such as motocross madness, you can really see the difference. MXM has smooth 
 but unrealistic graphics, but it is slightly more fun than MR2, but as for the sounds, it is absurd. 
 Constant reving is not only fake, but very annoying. MR2 has perfect sounds, and a great rock soundtrack. 
 The perfect match for when you are racing around in a desert over a large track with 24 other motocrossers.
 
  Altogether, is is a very fun but dated game, yet it kicked arse back in 1998-1999. If your pc 
 is also dated, give this a try with a mate. As much fun as serious sam in Split Screen!
