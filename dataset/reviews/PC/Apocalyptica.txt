:::Review:::
Apocalyptica is terrible from top to bottom, suffering from bland, derivative gameplay, simplistic 
 level design, brain-dead AI, and a buggy graphics engine that chugs even at low resolution. 
 

  Recently, Konami quietly released Apocalyptica, a third-person-perspective action game for the 
 PC. The game was originally slated to ship for both the Xbox and the PC, but it doesn't take much 
 time with the PC version to understand why the console version was scrapped. Apocalyptica is terrible 
 from top to bottom, suffering from bland, derivative gameplay, simplistic level design, brain-dead 
 AI, and a buggy graphics engine that chugs even at low resolution.  

          Having the healing spell at your disposal makes the game a lot easier. But not any better. 
     

  The game's problems start right at the beginning, with the plot. Apocalyptica is set in the future, 
 a time of space travel and planetary colonization. Yet for some reason, your weapons consist of 
 swords and spells, much like in a fantasy-themed game, as well as a handful of firearms. And you're 
 not fighting against high-tech aliens as you might expect from a futuristic game -- the enemy is 
 the devil, or Neo-Satan, to be exact. He's unleashed his legion of demons and cyborg evildoers 
 upon the universe, conquering it planet by planet, and it's up to you and a small band of virtuous 
 do-gooders to stop him and send him back to hell. You'll take the role of a genetically reanimated 
 saint or martyr and team up with a few other holy warriors in a series of missions aimed at thwarting 
 Neo-Satan's dastardly plan for universal domination. Really. We can't make this stuff up.  

  Before the campaign starts, you'll choose from a menu of 16 different holy warriors, each with 
 different ratings in agility, melee attack, ranged attack, and spell proficiency. Ultimately, there 
 isn't a whole lot of difference between most of the characters. Those with high agility move faster, 
 while those with melee get a stronger sword to fight with. The ranged-attack specialists often 
 have an array of different guns at their disposal, but they must worry about finding more ammo 
 for their weapons. In practice, these stats don't mean a whole lot, because combat in the game 
 just devolves into a lot of button mashing. The exception lies with the few warriors who can cast 
 spells; they have the distinct advantage of being able to heal themselves as well as their teammates, 
 which can make the campaign much, much easier.  

  Apocalyptica's 18 missions are spread out over five different settings ranging from planet surfaces 
 to starships to hell itself. The mission types hearken back to Unreal Tournament's assault mode -- in 
 most cases, you and a small band of computer-controlled teammates must run a gauntlet of different 
 objective points, capturing each as you go along. Sometimes the game will mix it up by adding in 
 a timer, having you rescue prisoners or escort scientists, or including some other challenge. There's 
 even a boss enemy at the end of some levels that's only slightly tougher than regular foes. But 
 in general, it's just you and a few of your reanimanted martyr buddies against legions of hellspawn. 

  The game's AI, both for friend and foe, is highly unsophisticated. Your sidekicks and enemies alike 
 will often get themselves stuck on level geometry, and enemies never exhibit any behavior more 
 complex than running straight at you and attacking. You have the ability to issue simple commands 
 to teammates, either as a group or singly. These commands include "follow me" or "guard this area." 
 Unfortunately, these team commands are ineffectual, so your teammates will often ignore them to 
 go off on their own. In missions where you must capture and hold several points, you'll curse your 
 sidekicks' inability to follow orders as the mission degenerates into a game of musical chairs 
 where you can only hope to prevail by dumb luck.  

          Your teammates often get stuck on corners.     

  Unfortunately Apocalyptica's presentation 
 is no savior; it's just as bad as the gameplay. The game's graphics engine looks primitive, with 
 clunky character models, stilted animations, and dated-looking spell effects. Compounding these 
 problems is the fact that the engine is extremely slow. Even if you're playing at low resolution, 
 frame rates appear to dip into the teens when large melees break out, which can make precise aiming 
 just about impossible. We were also unable to play the game at any resolution other than 800x600 -- any 
 attempts to change the resolution resulted in graphical glitches, namely a flickering image and 
 ugly white lines drawn horizontally across the screen. Sound effects and music were similarly buggy; 
 both would simply cut out on occasion. When the sound did work, it wasn't particularly noteworthy 
 anyway.  

  The game does include 10 multiplayer maps for deathmatch and capture the flag. There are no active 
 servers to play online, however, and our few attempts to play over a LAN were thwarted by system 
 lockups or the inability to make a connection.  

  A visit to the game's official Web site to look for a possible patch took us to a blank site occupied 
 by a domain-name squatter. All indications are that Konami cares very little about Apocalyptica. 
 You shouldn't either.

Review:  This is quite a good game, let me tell you.... seen as I am the only one reviewing it (apart from 
 the dodgey review given by the gamespot team) I would like to say more positive things about it.....
 
  
  True... there are limited options available for you during combat (e. g. can only perform one, two 
 or three hit sword combos, gun shooting is not 100% effective, etc) but you have to consider the 
 nice side of things too!!!
  
  One of the really splendid things about the game is the storyline.... about this Neo- Satan (presumeably 
 the Satan we know today, only a re-vamped, juiced up version) who is trying to make ill-fated humans 
 turn towards him, to further wreak havoc on the already cursed earth.... those who succumb to his 
 wrath join his legions of armies to take whats out there.....
  
  However... all is not lost.... as there is always a reaction when an action occurs.... in this case, 
 it is the form of a group of religious-minded individuals who will do their upmost best to prevent 
 Neo-Satan devouring the remaining hope of humanity...
  
  You have a total of 16 characters to choose from.... there are four classes of warrior, and each 
 class has four warriors (hence 4 times 4 equals 16... ta da!!!!) Each has their own ability, strengths 
 and movement patterns.... my personal fave is Sister Celeste, as she is agile as well as swift with 
 her sword... although I need more practice with the gun!!!!
  
  Although I have not come across any as yet (I am only on rthe 3rd mission!!!) there are upgrades/new 
 weapons avaialbel throughout the game.... e. g. blaster guns and swords that yeild fire, as well 
 as alternate magic spells (woohoo!!!) ....
  
  The enemies are variable too... some are easily knocked out with a few swings of the sword... whilst 
 others have to be proper hacked and slashed until they become crabmeat!!! If they run away, you 
 can always shoot them out of their misery... providing your aim is good and they are not a mile 
 away!!!!
  
  The music is totally awesome... I especailly like the start screen music... it really fills you with 
 zest for the game.... there are also mini movies as you start each level, as well as a briefing 
 from your mission commander/s that are superbly rendered... and give you that cyborg/electronically-enhanced 
 human feel for the characters.......
  
  The only flaws for this game I suppose are as follows.... some mission objectives are a tad too 
 difficult... like the one where you have to guard this emblem to prevent it from going into enemies 
 hands and into their base; one or two of the bad guys are so swift, if you dont act fast, they 
 will happily run way ahead of you and leave you panting behind like you are on a treadmill!!! Another 
 flaw is, like I said before, the limited number of moves you can make.... if it was more of the 
 cae of Legacy of Kain; Defiance, or even Prince of Persia... then that would have been icing on 
 the cake... acrobatics, thats the word for it.... but hey.... at least the chacters move about, and 
 not just do the do like the plonkers from Silent Hill, Severance, or Archangel for that matter!!!!! 
 Finally, although minor, the graphics do tend to get at you... the game play is sometimes slow, 
 and when you are guiding people around the block, if they get stuck in a rut, thats it, you cant 
 escort them further.... also, frame rates are pretty slow someitmes... but you may have to fiddle 
 about with your game setting sto suit your computer/laptop...
  
  Overall tis is an enjoyable game, witha variety of missions.... so its not just a case of hack and 
 slash... theres more to it than meets the eye... SO COME ON REVIEW IT IF YOU HAVE PLAYED IT...... I 
 THINK IT IS A BREAK FROM THE NROM AND FANTABULOUS!!!!!
