:::Review:::
Although the game starts on a fun and promising note, Operation Trivia quicklycomes to resemble 
 one of Dr. Evil's botched plots to take over the world. 

 When Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery first hit theaters in 1997, not even Mike Meyers 
 could have imagined the cultural impact his film would have. Yet two years later, the impact of 
 Austin Powers is as powerful as ever. In fact, Austin's outlook on life has become a kind of catchall 
 expression of happiness and optimism ("Groovy, baby!") , while Dr. Evil gives words to our hidden 
 fantasies of revenge ("When Mr. Bigglesworth gets upset, people die!") .  

 With a totally shagadellic sequel in theaters, what could be a better time to unleash an Austin 
 Powers trivia game onto the world? Utilizing the tried-and-true style of its You Don't Know Jack 
 games, Berkeley Systems has hatched Austin Powers: Operation Trivia. Although the game starts on 
 a fun and promising note, Operation Trivia quickly comes to resemble one of Dr. Evil's botched 
 plots to take over the world. If you've already grown cynical about all the product tie-ins to 
 the new Austin Powers film, then this game will confirm your suspicions that Austin Powers has 
 become more about making money for the studio than having a good time.  

 At the start of the game, we learn that Dr. Evil is holding Austin captive and plans to take over 
 the world. Instead of simply killing Austin, however, Dr. Evil instead decides to hatch an "overly 
 elaborate game show" to decide the world's fate. Austin must take on Dr. Evil in a trivia contest 
 called "Win, Lose or Die." It's a promising premise indeed, and it's a real hoot to watch the game's 
 intro for the first time.  

 But unlike the Austin Powers films, which seem to get funnier with repeated viewings, Operation 
 Trivia loses its punch after just a few minutes of gameplay. Beyond the flaws in the design of 
 the game (more on that in a moment) , the first real blow hits home as it becomes apparent that 
 Mike Meyers was unavailable (or unwilling) to perform the majority of the game's voice-overs. Instead, 
 we're treated to the voice of an impostor who tries desperately to mimic the intonations of Austin, 
 but who instead comes off like a bad actor in a high school play. Just hearing the poor bloke give 
 it a try is enough to make your skin crawl.  

 In addition to the embarrassingly bad voice-overs, it becomes apparent that the movie's humor isn't 
 all that funny when separated from the movie itself. Hearing Austin Powers and Dr. Evil rattle 
 off their respective one-liners in a 90-minute film is one thing; hearing a nonstop barrage of 
 their comments over the course of ten minutes is quite another. Even worse, there aren't that many 
 of these one-liners to begin with, so after just one or two games, you've heard them all. The first 
 time Dr. Evil asks you to remind him what he "pays you people for," it elicits a chuckle; the second 
 time, a smile; the third time, a grimace; by the fourth time, Mr. Bigglesworth is starting to get 
 upset.  

 The game itself follows the familiar format of You Don't Know Jack, but this time the questions 
 are couched in a colorful, psychedelic environment complete with '60s music and Laugh-In-style 
 breaks between questions. One or two people can play, choosing from categories such as judo chop 
 suey and primate parts. Once a category is chosen, you are confronted with different types of questions. 
 There are good old-fashioned multiple-choice trivia questions; stop-'n'-go-go questions, which 
 require you to pick four correct answers while avoiding the three "impostor" answers; crazy-chain 
 questions, which bombard you with a series of related questions; and a spectacularly ill-conceived 
 question type called "keep away," which requires you to "keep" correct answers and "keep away" 
 wrong answers. These keep-away questions are so confusing to play that you'll be scratching your 
 head the entire round.  

 The questions themselves range from insanely easy (Who stole Austin Powers' mojo?) to insanely difficult 
 (picking obscure films that feature boxers in their plots) . In any case, you'll need to have seen 
 both movies to compete in the game. But overall, the game's trivia leans toward questions that 
 are too difficult. Unfortunately, there's no support for online play built into the game, which 
 would have at least added another dimension to the mix.  

 If you're having a swinging shindig at your house and you want to entertain a horde of die-hard 
 Austin Powers fans, then Operation Trivia will probably do the trick for a game or two. But after 
 a couple of hours, you'll most likely be ready to feed this game to any mutant sea bass you have 
 around your house.

Review:  Austin Powers Operation Trivia is not a good game. It is far from a good game. Someone at Sierra 
 decided that it would be a good idea to take the You Don't Know Jack format and wrap it in an Austin 
 Powers blanket. The two do not mesh well together. When I heard that an Austin Powers game was 
 being made, I figured a adventure game or a Deus Ex like game but with the flavor of Austin Powers. 
 Instead, we get trivia.
  
  The voices are not the real actors I think, and if they are they should be ashamed because it sounds 
 awful. If you are a real fan of Austin Powers, than maybe this will be your bag. My wife bought 
 it, and we both tried to play it, but it was painfully bad. Go with the You Don't Know Jack series 
 if you are looking for trivia. Stay away from this poor idea of a game.
