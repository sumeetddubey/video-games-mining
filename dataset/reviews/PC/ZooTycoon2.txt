:::Review:::
Zoo Tycoon 2 makes some real improvements, but it's still probably best suited for parents looking 
 to play games with their young children. 

  The sequel to Microsoft's surprisingly successful Zoo Tycoon makes some real improvements to the 
 formula established its predecessor, but it's still probably best suited for parents looking to 
 play games with their young children. Zoo Tycoon 2, like the original game, lets you build a zoo 
 full of different animal exhibits and challenges you to make sure everyone in it stays happy. If 
 you keep your animals happy, they'll remain healthy and entertain your guests. If you pay your 
 staff fairly, they'll remain happy and do an acceptable job of keeping the park clean and the animals 
 cared for. And if you keep your guests happy, they'll be more likely to make donations and purchase 
 refreshments or souvenirs. Succeed at everything, and you'll make you enough money to stay in business, 
 research upgrades (like additional shelters and animal toys for your exhibits) , and expand your 
 park. These are pretty much the same goals as in the original game, and Zoo Tycoon 2's campaign 
 mode is similarly straightforward. However, the sequel's enhanced graphics and sound make it a 
 good "sandbox" kind of game, and if you're a parent with small children who need to be entertained, 
 that might be all you need.  

          Zoo Tycoon 2 has campaign and challenge modes, but younger players may get the most out 
 of the sandbox mode.     

  Zoo Tycoon 2 offers three major play modes: a single-player campaign with 17 different missions 
 that get progressively more challenging; a challenge mode that lets you build up custom zoos, and 
 then offers various challenges to you over time (like making a certain amount of money) ; and an 
 open-ended sandbox mode in which you have unlimited funds and the ability to build more or less 
 whatever zoo you'd like. The campaign is relatively straightforward and should take most players 
 upward of 10 hours to complete. It generally requires you to juggle your budget so you can combine 
 the research and acquisition of amenities for your guests and animals with the construction of 
 visitor attractions and the maintenance of your park. Though, in at least a few instances, you'll 
 find periods of inactivity, as your animals, guests, and staff are completely contented, and you 
 simply sit there waiting for your money to increase, or for someone to get unhappy, or for time 
 to pass until the scenario completes. Making your animals happy is also much more straightforward 
 than it was the original game (in which you had to add and subtract trees, plants, and scenery 
 until your exhibit was just right) .  

  Unlike the first game, the sequel lets you jump into the game in a first-person view, as either 
 a guest or a staff member -- and as a staff member, you can manually clean up messes left by guests 
 and animals and save a few bucks on maintenance staff. You'll usually end up completing goals by 
 pausing the game and jumping back and forth between your animals, employees, and guests to make 
 sure their needs are being met. This information is presented in a series of icon-based menus that 
 are fairly easy to get the hang of (the game uses green, yellow, and red smiley faces to show mood, 
 and even offers specific recommendations to keep your animals happy) .  

  The challenge mode, which is intended for more advanced players, is also pretty straightforward, 
 though you can make it tougher or easier on yourself by changing the amount of money you start 
 the game with. The sandbox mode is, like the sandbox modes in other management games, open-ended 
 enough to let you make whatever additions you'd like to your zoo. Fortunately, this mode is more 
 appealing than that of the original Zoo Tycoon, thanks to the sequel's fully 3D engine, which lets 
 you raise and lower terrain, renders larger, more-animated animals and guests, and lets you freely 
 manipulate your camera to get a better look at your zoo. You can also build and modify exhibits 
 in a matter of seconds using the sequel's powerful updated editing tools, including a "biome brush" 
 that paints exhibits with specific wilderness environments (such as savannah or tropical rain forest) 
 that are appropriate for different animals, as well as a click-and-drag fence tool that lets you 
 enclose your exhibits.  

  The new game also lets you zoom in extremely close on any characters, animals, or objects in the 
 world using guest or staff mode, or the game's new photo view. This view, which is available in 
 all three game modes, lets you walk the grounds of your zoo and take photos of the park and animals. 
 Photo view is sometimes used for some of the challenge and campaign goals (for instance, you may 
 be required to take a photo of a cheetah using a scratching post to complete a campaign level) , 
 but it's mainly there to let you take photos of your animals and store them in a photo album that 
 can be shared online. Presumably the sandbox mode and the photo view option will be most appealing 
 to children and the parents who play with them.  

  Zoo Tycoon 2's cartoonlike 3D graphics are certainly a step up from the drab 2D sprites of the 
 original game. However, while the sequel's animals, exhibits, and characters are all large and 
 colorful, they're blocky and simplistic, and not particularly well animated. This is probably to 
 be expected, considering that the game is intended for play on a wide range of computers. Yet for 
 some reason, the game's performance wasn't all that great even on an above-average machine with 
 a 2.4GHz CPU, 512MB of RAM, and a GeForce Ti4600 graphics card, lagging constantly when we scrolled 
 the screen. The game runs considerably better on computers that far exceed the minimum requirements, 
 though.  

          The new 3D engine lets you zoom in right up close to your animals, but they don't look 
 all that great.     

  The game's sound is also extremely sparse. The opening screen plays a remixed version of the first 
 game's theme, and the animals and visitors make various noises, but there's very little in the 
 way of ambient music -- even though the game seems like it could have benefited from it. Until you 
 build up a popular and successful zoo full of many happy customers, the game itself is actually 
 eerily silent, and this doesn't seem to make much sense in a game about building up a bustling, 
 active zoo.  

  Zoo Tycoon 2's campaign and challenge levels should keep most animal lovers busy for at least a 
 little while. However, the game's real value seems to be in its sandbox mode, which, along with 
 the game's "zoopedia" (a reference guide powered by Microsoft Encarta that provides educational 
 animal facts) , seems like a great way for parents with kids on their laps to spend some quiet afternoons, 
 pointing out the tiger exhibit and maybe saving a photo or two.

Review:  (Before I start this review, I would like to point out that this review is solely intended to state 
 my opinion of the game. This review may prove offensive to some people who really like the game. 
 To those people, I will just say right here that overrall, Zoo Tycoon was a disapointment. If you 
 wish to see why I say so, read on)
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Tycoon games are a popluar genre. They are so popluar, that some people just buy games 
 instantly at first sight because they're tycoons. And since the Tycoon genre is so popluar, game 
 developers have been using this as a lazy excuse to make lousy games for quick cash, figuring that 
 it will be supported just by the title "tycoon" in it. And I have played ALOT of bad tycoon games 
 in my life, so trust me, I know this.
  
  
  
  
  
  I am one of the miserble victims that was seduced into ANOTHER bad tycoon game. I do admit that 
 I got very few fun hours out of it, but this inferior game of the first one isn't recommendable 
 to anybody who doesn't like animals.
  
  
  
  If you remember, Zoo Tycoon 2 plays much like the old one, but worse. As always, you build the 
 exbits, adopt the animals, forfill they're every desire, while trying to expand the zoo and keep 
 you ugly-as-hell guests happy at the same time. Each of the (about 12) animals act like The Sims; 
 They need food, sleep, hygiene, social, privacy, and mainly happiness. If you fail to forfill these 
 needs, they animal will either be locked up, or taken away from you, as well as not being able 
 to adopt any more animals for a short period of time.
  
  
  
  
  
  For starters, the graphics are so damn bad. The people, especially the female children with the 
 evil dreadlocks look horrible. The animals look ok, but you won't believe the buggy gameplay to 
 be much help.
  
  
  
  Place a wild animal like a wild bear next to a person, and guess what..... he won't even notice 
 til 18 seconds have passed. Then he screams the same screams repeatidly. The animals may attack, 
 but when they do, the person flies high into the air, lands, says "Ow, that really hurt!" in the 
 recent comment box, and just forgets it ever happened and walks away.
  
  
  
  
  
  Cool animals, like dinosours and Killer Whales, have been replaced with lame ones, like squirels, 
 turkeys, and pigeons, and maybe a few big animals. They animals are also high-society slut-like 
 slamagins; They have to have EVERYTHING PERFECT. THEIR EXIBIT HAS TO BE 100 MILES LONG, THEY NEED 
 TO HAVE 19 DIFFERENT TOYS, AND THEY !ALWAYS! NEED FRIENDS.
  
  
  
  Sorry to go on a rant there.... And the audio fares no better. As I stated before, the male and 
 female, children and adults, ALWAYS scream the same scream when an animal attacks them. And they 
 scream over and over and over again. The music, I don't remember much, but I'm sure it wasn't that 
 great either.
  
  Well, I know there are people out there who love this game, and I respect that, but merely, Zoo 
 Tycoon 2 was a letdown. The oringinal was better by a longshot.

Review:  This game is quite very good. It's one of the best games I bought on Pc. There are 2 modes you can 
 play the one that you have money and you need to finish misions and where evrything you buy is 
 free. Sounds good ha? For begginers I say you start withe the mode where everything is free and later 
 on start the normal mode.
  
  When you chose what mode you play you choose where your park want to be. I think you should start 
 with a small zoo. And the surface doesn't really matter. After you chose all those options you will 
 be directly send to your zoo. Ohhhh...... I forgot, if you are not confident about starting to play 
 directly you can choose the tutorial. It will show you everything how to buy animals, make babies, fences 
 ex.
  
  I think the coolest thing in this game is that there is a mode where you are like a real person. It 
 means that you can go in the animal fences and fill the animals fodd and water, wipe their poo (yukkkkk) and 
 other cool things.
  
  Thanks for reading!!!

Review:  The original Zoo Tycoon was a little of a success for kids. It increases a child's interest of 
 animals on how amazing their behavior is. Now, we get into Zoo Tycoon 2. First we seen trailers 
 of it on how it is improved then the original game of graphics, functionality and improvements. 
 When the game was released, the reception was mixed. When I first got the game in the late 2006 
 and early 2007, the game was pretty great. The gameplay is similar to the original but rather improved. 
 It's basically making a zoo to thrive your guests with wonderful animals of all their favorites. 
 Kids of all ages can enjoy the game with a wonderful experience of animals. The graphics can be 
 unimpressive of it's cartoonish-looks along with a poor performance on a mid and low-end computer. 
 If your child, that you love so much in the world, wants the game, this is a good game for you 
 to try out.

Review:  If you like tycoon games, you'll love this. Most tycoon games focus on one basic bottom line game 
 play area. Such as roller coaster tycoon being rides and mall tycoon being stores. But this game 
 however focuses on many different things. Of course the obvious one would be animals, but in this 
 game you can create unique habitats for your animals, also being able to put different animals 
 of the same biome in the same exhibit is very well designed, but don't put lions with zebras to 
 often. On the split side theres about the same amount of things you can build that attract, feed 
 and just plain entertain guests. With many different food stands and restaurants, you will have 
 to place them in the right position to satisfy your guests. Also, your able to build things that 
 amuse guests such as fountains and flowers and even playgrounds for the younger guests. All in 
 all this game will have you hooked the moment you look at the back of the box. Being very well 
 rounded and entertaining to the last, this game is a definite buy for kids and adults of all ages. 
 Now go build the worlds greatest zoo ever.

Review:  Virtual zookeepers return to their computer screens, to care for exotic animals and the people 
 who come to visit them, in Zoo Tycoon 2. With its "tycoon"-style business sim elements, its honest 
 and detailed approach to real zoology, and some nice promotion from publishing giant Microsoft, 
 Blue Fang's original Zoo Tycoon sold very well and remained on store shelves for an unusually longtime, 
 inspiring at least two expansion packs along the way. This sequel, from the same parties responsible 
 for the original, aims to recapture that winning mix, and present it with full 3D graphics.
  
  While players can still take an encompassing top-down view of their parks, they now can also 
 zoom in, to follow behind individual patrons as they explore the zoo or give up-close and personal 
 attention to an animal in need. As in earlier versions of Zoo Tycoon, creating good habitats to 
 house the animals will be central to a zoo's success. Players can consult detailed, in-game information 
 about each species they are considering adopting. Then, as in the first game, they can then modify 
 the climate and elevation of land on their lot, to create ideal conditions for the new animals 
 they plan to bring in.

Review:  This game wasn't all that great. Unless you really like animals and enjoy Zoo sims, this game is 
 boring as heck. This game starts off very fun. You build and construct your zoo. You make different 
 habitats for different types of animals. You then place your animals, place various objects around 
 the zoo to get people to come and to get them interested. There are many objects to place and many 
 animals to put in your zoo.
  Your animals will have happy or angry smileys above their heads showing their mood, and your zookeeper 
 will let you know if they need more space or anything else to be comfortable in their habitats. 
 You will also receive messages when a female is pregnant, when a peacock lays an egg and when the 
 egg hatches. graphics are good but sound effects are poor and repetetive. overall this game is fun 
 for the first few hours but for a long time it's boring.

Review:  The change from 2D to 3D is spectacular. Now elephants don't look like gray blobs walking. Building 
 enclosures is MUCH easier, there is no more annoying and pointless recommendations like There aren't 
 enough trees or There isn't enough dirt , you just put in as much as you want of anything.
  
  30 animals is NOT enough for a big zoo building game like this. I know that are lots of expansions, 
 but Blue Fang should put more in the original game.
  
  It's very educational in strangely fun way. The encyclopedia is very informative, interesting and 
 easy to use.
  
  It's annoying that you have to get objects in campaigns and challenges (like jungle themed objects.) 
 The star associated adoption system is really neat and helps you know what star rating you need 
 to adopt a specific animal.
  
  The graphics isn't to good, but you still can tell the difference between a gray blob and an elephant
 
  
  Overall it's fun, easy to learn, easy to use and great for all ages for it has G rating (in Australia.)

Review:  Zoo Tycoon 1: As zoo director, youll be in charge of the everyday management responsibilities 
 of your facility (hiring staff, placing structures, keeping animals and guests happy) , and the 
 overall aim of your zoo (building new exhibits and expanding earning potential) . Placing things 
 from pizza stands to building a new giraffe enclosure are just a couple of things to make sure 
 you can continue to put dollars in your pocket.
  
  These things along with a host of others will ensure that youll enjoy your time with Zoo Tycoon 
 on some level, but this game really lacks the addictive teeth that many other sim games seem to 
 have. Overall I thought this title was fun for what it was worth, but I didnt have a problem walking 
 away from it when the time came.

Review:  Zoo Tycoon 2 for the most part is your standard zoo sim, but there is also a lot of fun to be had. 
 If you dont want to play through mission mode, you can play free mode, where all of the available 
 buildings, terrians, ammenities, and animals are available from the start, you also have unlimited 
 money in this mode. Also included with the game is the Encarta animal encyclopedia, where you can 
 read up on the info on any of the animals available in the game. This game would be a good choice 
 for parents who want to play something together with their children.
  
  Gameplay 8- standard sim mechanics. you try to create the most popular zoo, while at the same time, 
 keep your visitors safe, and your animals happy.
  Graphics 8- the models are a bit blocky, but nicely detailed.
  Sound 8- take what you would hear 
 walking through a real zoo and listen to it while playing. the sounds the animals make are realistic.
 
  Value 8

Review:  This game wasn't all that great. Unless you really like animals and enjoy Zoo sims, this game is 
 boring as heck. Going from 2D to 3D wasn't the best idea. The 3D makes it much harder to deal with 
 the animals. Also 3D means you'll have to have a fairly new computer or it will be slow. Your staff 
 is dumb so you pretty have to use the new function to walk around and do stuff yourself. The photo 
 missions are fun and the graphics are pretty nice, but the game play is dull and gets old real 
 fast, plus the animals are so annoying!
  
  Bottom line, don't waste your money unless you really like animals.

Review:  It is what it is. Build a zoo with a lot of animals. The sequel has made a lot of improvements 
 from the first one. The interaction between you and the animal has improved greatly. You can brush 
 the animals, feed them, and even take pictures of them. Building the zoo is much easier now too. 
 You can theme your zoo and add shops and food courts. It's all pretty cool. The one thing that 
 sets this game way above number one is the challenges. Instead of just running around building 
 a zoo they actually give you challenges. Like get a picture of your mom bear with her cub. Or get 
 over 5,000 people in your zoo. That just adds a little something to the game. Basically if your 
 into tycoon or building games this is a definite must have

  i played it amm for a few time but it was to much comlicated
  it is much harder from the old 
 "zoo tycoon" because now with the 3 D
  its harder to see all the cages and food restaurnt's and the enter
  and until you are getting 
 to some where ther's a problem in aother place
  and just to make a cage its comlicated . . . . : /
  so i didn't realy enjoyed that game cus it 
 was little hard
  but maby you can enjoy it . . . . i dunno this is just my opinion

Review:  This game is both fun and entertaining. Granted, it can get a little on the slow side sometimes, 
 this game can steal a boring afternoon away from you. The graphics are kinda weak, especially if 
 you zoom in a lot, but you will get used to them after playing for a while. The staff is a bit 
 lazy and sometimes useless since you can pretty much care for your animals and zoo by yoursef using 
 the zoo guest mode. The sound can get repetitive after a while. Oddly addictive despite theses 
 flaws. Worth the buy if you want something to do after you were out your new copy of "Oblivion."

Review:  I absolutely love this game. It has everything in that was in the first one, just better.
  
  This new installment of Zoo Tycoon is really one of those unappreciated masterpieces. Zoo Tycoon 
 2 allows you to create your Habitats and buy some animals to put in all your cages just like in 
 the first one. But this time they just look a hundred times better. Zoo Tycoon 2 is a 3D game and 
 allows you to Zoom in and rotate the camera like you want. It is almost like the transision from 
 Sims 1 to Sims 2. 
  
  Then there is another neat feature. You can actually walk through your own zoo and see the animals 
 as your guest will see them. You can also go into the cages and to the tasks that the Zoo Keepers 
 are unable to do if they get to busy. This is a great feature to have because you can make sure 
 that your zoo is run perfectly down to every detail.
  
  The themed building, seats and carts are also great for creating that themed areas. Much more different 
 stuff for the customers to do, like takeing photo's Pony rides and ALOT more. 
  
  This is really a fantastic game. Get it please! You will not be dissappointed

Review:  Yes! What we have ALL wanted! A better and new improved Zoo Tycoon! Yay! Now I shall talk about 
 the game itself:
  
  Strong Points: It is very exclusive when it comes down to graphics! All new animals are introduced 
 to the game! It Has freedoms when it comes down to the tools! Downloading Downloads are easier!
 
  
  Weak Points: I STILL have trouble making waterfalls. I had to buy a graphic upgrade in order to 
 play the game which i spent about 30-50$'s! the game loads Very slow.
  
  Repay Value: Considerably good
  
  Glitches: None besdies the repay guest on. Wow, those zoo 
 tyccon people are not giving us ANY slack now are they?

Review:  There are a few things that come to mind with ZK2. First of all, the game is manage wise and playwise 
 an interesting improvement. With the added option of walking through the parks you create, watching 
 animals and people has a funny side to it all and i must admit that it is a nice relaxing game 
 to play on my laptop when i am just enjoying the comfort of a sofa with nice music in the background.
 
  
  It is also a great way for the kids to learn more about animals, but i think that it is more about 
 playing the guy behind the scenes. 
  
  My problem with this game is that the scenarios for the most are nothing more then direct copies 
 from the first game. Is there noone over there with the illuminating mind to actually come up with 
 new challenges? I must say that this was the best side of ZK1, and it is surely lacking here.
 
  
  So apart from better graphics, this game actually does not have that much to offer. What a shame, 
 because it had the potential to go a long way.

Review:  this game is fun building animals to entertain visitors you can build lots of animals fences and 
 shops. you can have free build with infinite money and you can have challenges with a special amount 
 of moneyand you have to get a visitor wanted level or you need to build specific animals to make 
 it a good zoo. the graphics are ok good sound and good gameplay. it is real time strategy and you 
 need to make sure animals do not escape to frighten visitors and make them run away . it can be 
 a bit violent but it still is fun and you can make animals fight if you put two different animals 
 in the same cage. it is also easy and quite long. the animals can also breed and make babys but 
 they can still die when they get too old. you can also replenish food clean up poo and you can 
 look at your park in first person veiw. so this is a good buisness strategy game and it is good 
 for the family.

Review:  I THINK ZOO TYCOON IS A BRILLIANT GAME.
  
  It has good graphics and is a really educational game wiht many facts about animals, their biomes 
 and their needs. The animals are much less demanding which in some people's gaming could be a disappionting 
 outcome. The guests come with names as do the zookeepers and the other staff. I like the way you 
 recieve awards for your endangerd animals breeding and having a certain amount of animals in you 
 zoo.
  
  Some of the glitches in the game are-
  
  +It slows down after a while 
  +A large zoo take a very long time to load
  +It freezes for a length of time when you receive 
 awards
  +The zookeepers alaways complain of not being able to reacgh an aminal or other object when they 
 are by the staff gates.
  
  Over all it is a good game for adults and children.
  
  I disagree with the reveiw that says after you make the zoo you cant find anything to do, they 
 cant of possibly had every animal in their zoo ahve off spring or recive all the possible awards.

Review:  Having played sim games since the original Populous, I discovered Zoo Tycoon 1 as a playable game, 
 with nice touches. I found Zoo Tycoon 2 on sale for a fiver, nothing to lose. It turned out to 
 be the best sim game I've ever played (better even than The Sims 2) . 
  
  I haven't played RC3 fully yet, and that looks *as* good, but the playability of Zoo Tycoon 2 is 
 spot on. The Keeper mode allowed you to explore your zoo, see into the eyes of the guests, and 
 keep your animals clean. This is the best bit, the layout and setting up of cages for the animals 
 is easy, it basically tells you what to lay, so not as finicky as Zoo Tycoon 1. 
  
  Keeping the guests happy is relatively easy too, and the way extra items come along as your zoo 
 gains star ratings is great too. I haven't even played the sandbox unlimited cash mode yet, the 
 challenges are enough fun!. The only bad points - it's pretty easy, and it's fairly slow. Well, 
 the second point you'd expect because it's a sim, and the first - well, I'd complain more if it 
 was too hard. 
  
  This game has a great 'feel good' factor, when you've created your zoo and everything's working 
 well. The graphics are great, first person mode is fantastic. All in all one of the best games 
 I've ever played, with appeal for all ages and sexes. This is definately one that slipped under 
 the mainstream radar as an all time classic. 
  
  Expansion pack out soon with more challenges and creatures. Let's hope they've shot the person 
 who suggested 'dinosaurs' eh?

Review:  I know what you're thinking: "Oh no, not another tycoon game!" Yes, it's true, the whole tycoon 
 thing does seem a bit out of control, but it doesn't surprise me, as it's a very well-liked type 
 of game.
  
  Just like The Sims and RollerCoaster Tycoon. Zoo Tycoon has taken the leap to the world of 3D graphics. 
 This means that now you can experience your zoo even more, and from a first person view too. Get 
 up close and personal with your visitors and enjoy the zoo via Zoo Guest mode, or come face-to-face 
 with animals while taking care of them in Zookeeper mode. You can even take pictures of the animals 
 in action and create a photo album (even share it online) by using the Zoo Photo Safari. 
  
  Zoo Tycoon 2 features more than 300 building and exhibit objects, themed buildings, guest attractions 
 and toys. With the new Habitat Builder tool you can create amazing exhibits featuring moats and 
 waterfalls for instance. The Biome Brush is the final touch on creating a new exhibit and it's 
 used to paint instant landscapes, from deserts to rainforests. 
  
  The game also offers downloadable content, including more building objects and animals to add more 
 variety to your game.
  
  Your animals will have happy or angry smileys above their heads showing their mood, and your zookeeper 
 will let you know if they need more space or anything else to be comfortable in their habitats. 
 You will also receive messages when a female is pregnant, when a peacock lays an egg and when the 
 egg hatches. 
  
  The way you design and build your zoo will determine how your animals perform and what animations 
 you will see, and these animations are really nicely done. You will see a peacock egg hatch among 
 a bunch of sparkles, a tiger climbing a tree, camels pacing to the nearest shade or a baby gazelle 
 hopping around like there's no tomorrow. They act like the real thing.
  
  There are 30 animals to "adopt": tigers, camels, pandas, hippos, chimpanzees, kangaroos, gazelles, 
 peacocks and many others that will definitely make the delights of your visitors.
  
  The Campaign and Freeform modes offer dynamic and random challenges which allow players to explore 
 deeper and more interesting gameplay scenarios. You can accept additional challenges, such as nursing 
 an animal back to health through random challenges presented to players during the course of zoo 
 building, or accept dynamic challenges which directly relate to the scenario you are currently 
 playing. There are 20 scenarios to complete, with different goals such as saving endangered species 
 (by breeding them) , release animals into the wild, and restore troubled zoos to their former glory 
 and taking care of sick animals.
  
  You can download the trial version of the game at the official site. This demo has limited content, 
 of course. You can only play in Freeform mode, it only allows you to adopt four animals (Bengal 
 Tiger, Thomson's Gazelle, Dromedary Camel and Common Peafowl) and it has a limited number of buildings, 
 amenities and scenery objects. You can't save your game in progress, but the demo provides the 
 overall feeling of the full version.
  
  And if you want Zoo Tycoon 2 to go, it's also available for mobile phones, and it can be used in 
 conjunction with the PC version to unlock new content. The mobile version includes two modes to 
 play, Freeform (with three or five exhibits) and Zoo Photo mode. If you complete all the goals 
 in the Zoo Photo mode, you unlock an exclusive download for the PC version. More about the mobile 
 version can be found at the following link: http://phoenix. labs. cybiko. com/zootycoon/index. php
 
  
  I only have one 'but', and that's with the sound effects. Although the animal sounds are truly 
 realistic, the guest sounds are how should I put this really retarded. No one I know ever let 
 out such sounds in admiration. And they lack in variety too, cheers and exclamations as the guest 
 view your animals get pretty annoying really fast.
  
  Zoo Tycoon 2 is something parents should play with their kids. There is a lesson to teach here, 
 how it is to take care of animals (since you can interact with them in first person to fill the 
 water/food bowls and groom them) , plus the instructive side of watching how animals interact with 
 one another.
  
  Overall, it's a pretty good game with the advantage of being educational. It's kind of like watching 
 the Nature Channel, but in a fun interactive way.

Review:  When playing the demo i found it very differnent from the first game, having to make it perfectly 
 how the animal likes it to the player choses most of it. I like the guest mode, cleaning out the 
 anial etc just like a zoo keeper. Everything is alot bigger and better in this game, i hope to 
 get this at christmas.
  
  The old games were annoying at times, with complaints, animals escaping and zoo tycoon 2 has changed 
 this making the player more free, just like a wild animal. It has more ways of pleasing both animals 
 and guests and explains more of how a real zoo works, with the old games donations just appeared 
 and animals would be cleaned out and given food in seconds by the zoo keepers.

Review:  Zoo Tycoon 2 is just as fun and immersive as the original. What really makes this sequel come to 
 life is the new 3D graphics engine used. 
  
  Gameplay- very good, no real complaints. The game runs smooth and everything in the UI is great!
 
  
  Graphics: the graphics are a great upgrade from the previous Zoo Tycoon game. The transition from 
 2D to 3D makes all the difference. It adds character to your animals and your guests.
  
  Overall, my experience with Zoo Tycoon 2 has been awesome. I do wish that I could make bridges 
 or elevated paths in my park and maybe even some safari type rides. But all of that will be coming 
 along with the Endangered Species expansion pack.

Review:  zoo tycoon 2 has enw features from the past ones such as the mode where you can walk around and 
 clean up poop and see things through a persons eyes, thats all well done but otherwise, thers not 
 much here. there are just some more animals to choose from, more targets to score and well... thats 
 it.
  
  you can play a sandbox game or the campaign. the campaign i think is very boring but the sandbox 
 is quite fun. that will keep you occupied. after youve played the tutorial, you can build your 
 own zoo and thats it. you just make it better, make sure your animals are happy and alive.
  
  this game is better than the one before, but otherwise its not all that good. if youre a big 
 fan of these types of games, then this is worth playing.

Review:  One thing to say, Zoo Tycoon 2 give you the chance to build the "zoo" of your dreams, however, 
 you can do only a little in it!
  
  Since, I'm really attracted to Tycoon games, and I played the first version of Zoo Tycoon, I didn't 
 think twice before getting Zoo Tycoon 2. I enjoy playing the game (at least till now!) . The thing 
 I mostly enjoy in tycoon games is the Sandbox mode, this is the mode where you really can build 
 the zoo of your dreams since you get an unlimited sum of money! But when I was finished building 
 and designing the zoo the way I like, I found out that I had almost nothing more to do in my zoo 
 other then watching my guests discovering the different areas in the zoo, reading their compliments, 
 adding the little details I forgot to add when building the zoo, seeing my animals playing, maitting 
 and giving birth every single minute (!) and then complaining about the small place in their exhibits 
 which the thing I mostly hate since I need to make the exhibit bigger and this will affect almost 
 the whole design of my zoo, and other small details that you will get bored of just after less 
 than an hour or two!
  
  On the other hand, you can always choose the Challenge/Campaign modes in which you need to fulfill 
 objectives in order to advance in through the different levels! BUT, in the challenge mood you'll 
 never get the zoo of your dreams that fast, this happens just after you complete all the objectives 
 and the levels (which is nor pretty hard) !
  
  Lack of animals' species:
  When I had to choose the land that I'm going to build my zoo on, I chose the largest land available 
 since I thought that I'll have lots of animals to add to my zoo, but after completing my zoo, I 
 was surprised to see that I have half of the land totally empty, I tried adding restaurents, gift 
 shops but this didn't take much space at all! So I really think there is a lack of animals' species 
 in the game! WE NEED MORE ANIMALS!
  
  Graphics:
  The 3RD graphics in the game are good, you see the animals well and the zoo view, in general looks 
 just fine, however when you zoom to see bigger details, the graphics are not that good! You can 
 switch to the guest mode so you can view the zoo like your guests do (I found it really cool!) . 
 The performance in the game is very bad! LONG loading times and a game that freezes for seconds 
 and comes back!!!
  
  Sounds:
  The sounds in the game are not that good! The music tracks are fine, however if your zoo in new 
 and doesn't contain lots of visitors, you can really feel the silence...!!!
  
  Zoo Tycoon 2 is a good game and makes a fine sequel for its original version, but it needs much 
 more enhancements considering that its a 3RD graphics tycoon game from the new age!
