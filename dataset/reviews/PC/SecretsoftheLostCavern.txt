Echo relies on its unique premise to compensate for an otherwise by-the-numbers adventure game. 
 

  When it comes down to it, your average adventure game usually boils down to either a murder mystery 
 or some kind of Indiana Jones-style unraveling of ancient, arcane secrets. So the sole fact that 
 Echo: Secrets of the Lost Cavern is basically about a young caveman learning how to paint sets 
 it apart from the usual fare published by The Adventure Company. The prehistoric setting and protoshamanistic 
 focus of the story unquestionably lend some unique flavor to the proceedings, but all this Stone 
 Age window dressing doesn't really distract from the fact that Echo is otherwise a by-the-numbers 
 adventure game... and a pretty short one at that.  

          Forget the wheel. This caveman just wants to paint.     

  After assuming the role of 
 a young hunter-gatherer named Arok, the story begins with a lioness attacking you and forcing you 
 to hide yourself in an old cave. Here you find ancient cave paintings that trigger a flashback 
 to an encounter that a younger Arok had with an aged painter named Klem, who was not only an accomplished 
 painter, but who also had the mystical ability to actually make the paintings animate on the walls. 
 Galvanized by this flashback, and armed with a special stone that will help him solve the riddles 
 of the cave, Arok decides that now is the time to find Klem, as well as learn his trade.  

  The storytelling in Echo is admittedly pretty clumsy. Thankfully, the game is pretty light on the 
 chatter, instead putting the focus on the puzzles you'll need to solve to progress. The puzzles 
 incorporate the whole prehistoric theme of Echo surprisingly well. You'll often have to gather 
 items you find in your environment to build simple survival tools, like slingshots, spears, and 
 waterskins, or even just to start a small fire. There are also a lot of puzzles involving the animated 
 cave paintings that Klem left behind, though you personally don't get to flex your artistic skills 
 as much as you might hope. Instead, the whole "moving paintings" thing sometimes comes off as a 
 bit of a contrivance -- an easy way to justify sliding tiles and other visual logic puzzles. The 
 variety of puzzles is pretty good, but the difficulty level seems to be all over the place. At 
 any rate, the game probably won't pose too great a challenge to the well-weathered adventure game 
 fans that still consider themselves adventure game fans. But, even if you aren't a hardcore adventurer, 
 chances are it'll take you well under 10 hours to learn the secrets of the lost cavern. And once 
 you do, there's little reason to go back and do it again.  

  Echo is a short journey that never gives you the sense that you're on any kind of a grand adventure. 
 However, while it's happening, it's not a bad adventure to look at, despite its reliance on ancient 
 prerendered visuals. There's a somewhat static look to the game, and the interactive pieces don't 
 always mesh well with their backgrounds. But as you explore the prehistoric world of the game, 
 which includes high plateaus, thick and brushy wilderness, and, of course, plenty of caverns, it 
 manages to convey a pretty good sense of place. Unlike many other adventure games, playing from 
 the first-person perspective eliminates the clumsy camera angles and the pacing issues caused by 
 having to watch your character bump around the environments.  

          Apparently, the secret of the lost cavern is that it doesn't take long to find.     

 
  There's a suitably tribal feel to the soundtrack that relies on lots of jangled percussion and 
 primal-sounding winds. On the other hand, the voice acting feels like it belongs in another game 
 altogether. It's admittedly difficult to write authentic-sounding caveman dialogue, and it's even 
 harder to sell it without sounding like you're playing it for laughs. But listening to eloquent 
 Cro-Magnon men throw around words like "lumberjack" and "palette" just takes you out of the experience. 

  There was definitely potential in Echo: Secrets of the Lost Cavern to break away from the standard 
 adventure game model, but it ultimately fails to explore the artistic elements of its premise. 
 Instead, Echo relies on its unique premise to compensate for an otherwise by-the-numbers adventure 
 game.

Review:  Echo: Secrets of the Lost Cavern has been on the store shelves for quite a few days. Boredom finally 
 convinced me to run around and pick the game up, and I am no disapointed. The game itself usually 
 runs around 21 bucks. The game does a great job immersing you into a world of neanderthals that 
 seem to have eaten one to many of those intelligence apples that adam and eve had. The game has 
 decent gameplay, a great sound score, and engrossing graphics.
  
  The first thing you notice as you boot up Echo is the gorgeus opening movie sequence. The developer 
 behind this sure did a great job with the scenery. The game's actual in game stills are quite breath 
 taking to look at, and sometimes makes the oddity of pixel hunting in adventure games less tedious. 
 The water, outdoor, and indoor enviroments all look equally majestic.
  
  After the initial introduction, you realize just how great the sound is, as something comes roaring 
 at you. I won't say what that is, as it might ruin it for some of you who haven't decided to pick 
 this up yet. The sound department did a great job of mixing ambience with regular background music, 
 creating a wonderful tapestry.
  
  The gameplay itself is very reminiscent to all other adventure games out there. Puzzle, story, 
 puzzle, story. No change really, except the puzzles can be really involving, usually requiring 
 you to "read up" on the history of the cro magnums in game. 
  
  Overall, the game is definitley worth the money. If you're looking for a decent strategy game with 
 good production values, look no further. If you're looking for a dark, and evil story........ well 
 you might want to go with Still Life.
