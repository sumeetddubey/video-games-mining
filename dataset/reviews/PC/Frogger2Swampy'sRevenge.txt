Frogger 2's 30 unique and detailed levels should provide many hours of entertainment for players 
 looking for traditional arcade action. 

 Frogger 2 is the sequel to Hasbro's 1998 3D remake of the classic Atari arcade game, Frogger. The 
 graphics, gameplay, and level design have all been improved over the 1998 game. The result is an 
 engaging arcade-style action game based on very simple controls and play mechanics that should 
 appeal to players looking for a traditional platform action game.   

  The game consists of more than 30 3D levels filled with enemies, obstacles, traps, and puzzles. 
 In each level, five frog babies are waiting patiently to be rescued. Your mission is to rescue 
 all five babies as quickly as possible in order to complete the level and move on to the next. 
 Along the way you can collect extra lives, power-ups, and gold coins - all as you try to avoid 
 the wide variety of mindless enemies and obstacles. In addition to the 30 basic levels, there are 
 bonus retro levels that can be unlocked by collecting every gold coin in a particular level.   
 

  The graphics are colorful and highly detailed, and the animation runs smoothly, even when there 
 are numerous moving obstacles and enemies onscreen. The camera follows you around at a good distance 
 and gently makes the transitions between a third-person view in the three-dimensional areas and 
 a top-down view in the flat areas. The sound is fairly simple, and while it isn't annoying, it 
 doesn't add much to the game. The music is upbeat and somewhat reminiscent of the electronic music 
 used in old arcade games. But sometimes it's less distracting to just turn the speakers off, if 
 only to avoid the added frustration of hearing the same noise and music as you try to complete 
 a level over and over.   

  There are three difficulty settings in the game: normal, which gives you a set number of lives 
 and unlimited time to complete each level; easy, which gives you more starting lives and more bonus 
 lives; and hard, which sets a time limit on each level.   

  The levels themselves are well designed and quite varied. Whether you're hopping through an ancient 
 temple filled with Indiana Jones-style booby traps or finding your way through a maze in a futuristic 
 lab, every level features several classic two-dimensional arcade-style challenges that are cleverly 
 laid out in a three-dimensional world. The levels are built around a simple tile-based movement: 
 You can move one space forward, backward, and to either side. You can also jump up and forward 
 at the same time.   

  These simple controls let you focus on the occasionally frustrating traps and puzzles. In story 
 mode, the game will automatically save your progress as you complete each level, and within individual 
 games your progress is saved after you rescue each frog baby. This system helps alleviate some 
 of the frustration that can arise after repeatedly trying to get past a certain level, since it's 
 often not necessary to replay the entire level up to that point. In addition, amidst all the chaos 
 and danger in each level, there are always havens where you can rest your fingers and plan your 
 strategy to complete the challenge ahead.   

  Frogger 2's 30 unique and detailed levels, along with the additional bonus levels, characters, 
 and features should provide many hours of entertainment for players looking for traditional arcade 
 action. The game is enjoyable on several levels: The story mode lets you progress through the entire 
 set of regular levels one at a time, but if you're looking for a quick game you can use the arcade 
 mode to jump to any individual level that you've completed in the story mode. In addition, a multiplayer 
 mode lets up to four players compete in a hot-seat match on the same computer. Advanced players 
 can also try to beat their best times on specific levels by finding shortcuts and alternate routes 
 and strategies to complete each level.   

  Frogger 2 improves upon almost every aspect of its predecessor and provides an up-to-date version 
 of the classic arcade game. Its basic premise is its greatest weakness, for by re-creating the 
 classic arcade game it has limited itself to a few basic controls and tile-based movement. Nevertheless, 
 the game will appeal to players looking for fast, simple arcade action, and the many new twists 
 on old puzzles will please fans of the original game.

Review:  Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge is a classic arcade game -one of the best- that's very enjoyable, with 
 many hours of playing. With a story of cute frogs, the babies get captured by Swampy the crocodile, 
 and it's up to frogger and lily-frog to get them back! With the many levels to complete, you unlock 
 secret characters and new levels. With many cool bonus features, Frooger 2 is an awesome game! 
 With immersing multi-player, you can also collect coins, and beat your old times, with an gold, 
 silver or bronze trophy! The music is lively and enjoyable, and graphics are pretty good. Better 
 than the first, Frogger is a game you should play now!

Review:  This game is WAY underrapritiated. It offers pure arcade fun, with some cool music.
  This isn't a childs game, it appeals to everyone and is very well done, and really holds the fun 
 factor bar up high.
  
  Graphics
  The graphics are nice and smooth, with crisp detail, they're not amazing but they are good.
  They 
 really fit the game mood and feel.
  
  Music
  The music is awesome, it ranges from Electronica to Trip hop and bubbely Hip Hop, and is created 
 by the Blitz team themselves. The songs are very catchy with a nice beat set to them.
  
  Gameplay
  This is just pure arcade here, I found it very enjoyable
  
  Overall
  This is a 
 SUPERB Arcade/Puzzle game, I think it is the best ones out there.
