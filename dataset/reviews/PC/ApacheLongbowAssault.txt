:::Review:::
Apache Longbow Assault is a game that doesn't do too much, but what it does, it does well. 

 
  Military helicopter sims are a rarity on the PC nowadays, so it's rewarding to see a game like 
 Apache Longbow Assault come along. It gracefully steers the fine line between serious sim and all-out 
 action game and features some attractive visuals and immersive sound effects. While Apache Longbow 
 Assault suffers from a no-frills campaign and a lack of other game modes, it still offers plenty 
 of exciting combat while letting you fly one of the most powerful helicopters yet built.  

          Bland text briefings don't do much to immerse you in the campaign.     

  Apache Longbow 
 Assault puts you in the cockpit of the US Army's famed Apache attack helicopter, in this case the 
 advanced AH-64D Longbow variant. The Longbow significantly improves on the radar/fire control system, 
 weaponry, and survivability of the original Apache to create an even more lethal helicopter. The 
 Longbow is fast, highly maneuverable, heavily armored, and bristling with advanced weapons.  

 
  The beauty of Apache Longbow Assault is that it lets you feel all that power right away. As soon 
 as you take off, you know you have a brutally powerful helicopter at your disposal. Admittedly, 
 hardcore sim fans will likely be disappointed with the way the game simplifies the radar system, 
 countermeasures, weaponry, and so forth. Still, Apache Longbow Assault lets you enjoy yourself 
 right away instead of having you work through a lengthy learning phase where you're always wondering 
 which buttons to push.  

  Either way, you'll get to enjoy the Longbow's famed speed and maneuverability, thanks to the believable 
 physics modeling. You'll also get to blast air and ground targets with a 30mm chaingun and Hellfire, 
 Stinger, and Hydra missiles and rockets. You'll get to launch countermeasures, switch to a night-vision 
 view, and launch illumination flares to assist ground forces.  

  You can control everything with the keyboard, though that's quite a handful, even with the streamlined 
 controls and optional simplified physics. Ideally, you'll want to use a joystick with at least 
 three buttons, a throttle, and a rudder twist feature. Then you can control everything with ease; 
 you'll only reach for the keyboard once in a while or grab the mouse if you want to manually aim 
 the flexibly mounted chaingun. You can have the targeting computer aim the gun automatically, too, 
 though it's hard to select the specific target you want from a group. It's also too bad that there's 
 no way to adjust controller sensitivity, only the dead zone.  

  Apache Longbow Assault offers just one gameplay mode: a linear, rigidly scripted campaign. You 
 won't find any instant action mode or multiplayer options, which the game just begs for. There's 
 no tutorial, either, though the missions at least tersely introduce some of the Apache's capabilities 
 as you go along. Despite these flaws, the campaign does offer 30 missions that you can tackle on 
 three difficulty levels. You'll fly at different times of day, in different types of weather, and 
 over varied terrain, from forested mountains to icy seas to sandy beaches. You'll assist ground 
 forces, attack convoy escorts, aid rescue operations, defend cities, and a lot more while going 
 head-to-head with enemy choppers, ground vehicles, AA batteries, and ships. While the missions 
 are mainly about explosive action, you'll need to think a little, too, by choosing an effective 
 weapon loadout before each mission and prioritizing enemies during battle so as not to run out 
 of ammo before knocking out mission-critical targets.  

  While most of the missions are entertaining, many are too short, lasting just three or four minutes. 
 The campaign as a whole also suffers from a bare-bones presentation. You don't get any voice-overs 
 or cutscenes, just some boring text briefings before each mission. The clumsy story about fighting 
 terrorists in Siberia and the Pacific is forgettable and suffers from an anticlimactic ending. 
 You mainly fly missions alone, and when you are joined by fellow pilots, you never hear any radio 
 chatter, so it doesn't even feel like they're there. The campaign just doesn't generate enough 
 emotional involvement or make you feel that you're part of bigger military operations. These weaknesses 
 undercut the genuine diversity of the missions, making it feel as if you're one lone pilot out 
 there mopping up a bunch of generic enemies over and over.  

  The campaign's presentation may be bland, but the in-mission graphics offer a lot of color. It's 
 true that cities look way too small, and buildings often look drab and simple. The terrain overall 
 gives you a good sense of scope, though, and features some attractive texturing. Atmospheric and 
 combat effects look especially nice, from flickering flares brightening the night sky, to the glow 
 of the rising sun, to a helicopter exploding in a ball of fire and raining debris after a missile 
 slams into it. You'll get to view all the action from five internal and external cameras. The Apache 
 itself is finely detailed inside and out, though the control panels are just for show; you can't 
 actually click on them as in some flight sims.  

          Attractive graphics bring the scenery to life.     

  Outside of the glaring lack of 
 voice-overs, Apache Longbow Assault features really solid audio, too. Whooshing missiles, buzzing 
 lock-on warning signals, and rumbling explosions all bring the combat to life. The electronic soundtrack 
 is a bit generic, but not too shabby overall.  

  It's a real shame Apache Longbow Assault doesn't offer a deeper campaign and more game modes. It 
 otherwise has some good things to offer: sharp graphics, solid audio, and lots of fast airborne 
 action. This is a game that doesn't do too much, but what it does, it does well.
