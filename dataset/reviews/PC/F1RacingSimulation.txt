:::Review:::
F1 Racing Simulation is an extremely well-thought-out simulation with driversof all abilities in 
 mind. 

 Driving simulations are usually somewhat unattractive to casual gamers because of the immense amount 
 of time required to become a competitive driver. You must spend hours practicing and learning each 
 circuit, then fine-tuning the car to be able to keep up with the pack. Although designer Geoff 
 Crammond (of Grand Prix and Grand Prix II fame) realized the importance of aiding you in these 
 areas, few other driving sims have followed suit. Considering the number and types of driving aids 
 F1 Racing Simulation contains, it's probably safe to say that there are some Grand Prix II fans 
 among the ranks at Ubi Soft.  

 From the opening screen, you immediately have the choice between realistic and easy modes. Choose 
 easy and a single race, and you're on the track, ready to roll. It's a straightforward arcade game 
 in easy mode - turn on auto-gear and auto-brakes, and you do little more than steer. But for the 
 true sim fan, realistic mode is the attraction - and F1 is pretty attractive indeed.  

 If you're new to racing sims or want to graduate from arcade-style racing to simulation, F1 will 
 accommodate you. Any racing sim fan knows that most of his time will be spent learning each circuit. 
 In F1's training area there's a demonstration option that lets you sit back and watch another car 
 run the track, letting you note the speed and gear of each turn before you get behind the wheel 
 yourself. After that, you can choose to enter driving school, which will place you on an empty 
 track with a ghost car to follow around (you can even save up to ten of your own ghost runs or 
 download others) . You can also turn on gear and speed recommendations until you learn them on your 
 own.  

 As you start to get more comfortable with the car and the circuit, you can start to toggle off some 
 of the driving aids, particularly auto-gear and auto-brakes. The realism continues to increase 
 from there. This sim is loaded with options you can toggle - there's anti-sliding (helps when exiting 
 a turn) , anti-skidding (helps acceleration) , ABS (antilock brakes) , and more.  

 However, as helpful as F1 is for the driver, it isn't as thoughtful for the engineer. As with any 
 racing sim, you're going to have to get your hands dirty and make a few adjustments to your car 
 before a race - especially if you set the game to allow variable weather conditions. The only help 
 the game gives you in the garage is some slim documentation about the F1 race car. There is a useful 
 chart that shows how adjustments on one area of the car might affect another area and to what degree, 
 but from there it depends on your own experimentation. To top it off, there aren't any preset configurations 
 in the game, although there are some for download on Ubi Soft's web site.  

 If you already know your way around open-wheel race cars, you shouldn't have much trouble in the 
 garage. A nicely functional telemetry system lets you examine your car's performance in many different 
 ways. You can choose up to eight different data sets to be plotted in the graph window for the 
 custom information you're looking for.  

 When you finally get into the race, expect to compete against some pretty crafty and aggressive 
 drivers. And as long as you stay on your line, you won't encounter too many computer-controlled 
 drivers plowing into your rear end. Car physics are also as good as in any other race sim, although 
 the car seems to experience an inordinate amount of drag when the wheels touch anything but asphalt. 

 F1 Racing Simulation is an extremely well-thought-out simulation with drivers of all abilities in 
 mind. With a midrange to high-end PC and a 3D card, the game looks spectacular, although users 
 of low- to midrange machines will pay the price when the number of cars onscreen can cause the 
 frame rate to bog down considerably. (Just experiment with the graphics options in a single race 
 to maintain a good frame rate before your first race of the season begins.) It would have been 
 nice if the game adjusted the graphics detail on the fly to maintain a certain preset frame rate 
 (as in Papyrus sims) .  

 Finally, the game only goes up to the 1996 season (it seems F1 demands a higher price for a more 
 recent license) . Other than that, there is little fault to be found. Fans of Grand Prix II should 
 delight: F1 Racing Simulation has all that made GPII a classic and more.
