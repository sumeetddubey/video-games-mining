:::Review:::
F/A-18 Korea is an exacting portrayal of the twin-engine F/A-18C/D Hornet dual-purpose fighter. 
 

 It's refreshing to see that relative newcomers to this somewhat entrenched industry still have a 
 shot at stealing success from the perennial heavyweights. Take, for instance, Texas-based Graphic 
 Simulations Corporation, and its recently released F/A-18 Korea air combat simulation - one of 
 the most impressive and realistic combat simulations ever engineered for the home market.   

 As you've no doubt surmised, F/A-18 Korea is an exacting portrayal of the twin-engine F/A-18C/D 
 Hornet dual-purpose fighter and strike aircraft, which, as it happens, is the most versatile multimission-capable 
 aircraft currently in service with the US Navy. Every facet of the carrier-launched aircraft has 
 been painstakingly modeled - from the highly detailed instrumentation clusters and sensors to the 
 supersophisticated weapons and delivery systems - and gleaned from an assembly of declassified 
 sources and from combat pilots who have logged thousands of hours flying the actual aircraft. In 
 fact, a former US Marine F/A-18 pilot is credited with having written the exhaustive documentation 
 included in the game.   

 There, I've said it. Although I've just gone on record and categorically stated that F/A-18 Korea 
 is a "game," that's a bit of a misnomer of sorts. F/A-18 is, in actuality, an air combat simulation 
 of the highest magnitude, similar in scope to the type of near-realistic virtual combat simulators 
 the Department of Defense routinely uses to train and test its fledgling pilots. In fact, once 
 you probe beneath F/A-18's gorgeous, all-new 3D-accelerated veneer, you'll find the heart of a 
 lion, encased in an incredibly detailed yet eminently credible environment authentically replicated 
 right down to the Fresnel lens and arresting wires. To the uninitiated, the bewildering array of 
 information, pre- and in-flight mission-management charges, and near-infinite number of keystroke 
 combinations could easily become overwhelming, frightening off all but the most dedicated players. 
 Fortunately, newbies and veterans alike can learn the ins and outs of naval aviation from the pros, 
 thanks to the inclusion of a robust, fully narrated, digitally enhanced set of tutorials. These 
 interactive training tapes discuss everything - in exquisitely detailed fashion - from obtaining 
 clearance for taxi and departure (on land and at sea) to recovering carrier-launched aircraft and 
 interpreting the many digital displays. You can then take to the skies over the Hawaiian Islands 
 on mock runs, honing your skills while putting the responsive, system-redundant F/A -18 through 
 its virtual paces.   

 Although F/A-18 is set in modern-day Korea, no serious attempt has been made to create an artificial 
 conflagration in the region, postulating a hypothetical long-term campaign between the ever belligerent 
 North Koreans and the UN forces stationed south of the DMZ. As a result, the set of stand-alone 
 missions portrayed in the simulation are somewhat disjointed, merely serving to illustrate the 
 combat capabilities of the F/A-18 aircraft and its direct role in the overall scheme of battle 
 should a conflict ever erupt. Finally, you can put your flying acumen to the ultimate test of endurance, 
 squaring off over a network against up to three other human players over the parched desert floor 
 near Fallon, Nevada.  

 Compared to F/A-18 Hornet 3.0, F/A-18 Korea features vastly updated 3D-enhanced visuals while maintaining 
 good frame rates even while running on a typical midrange machine equipped with a 3Dfx Voodoo or 
 Voodoo Rush-based 3D accelerator card. A mad frenzy of atmospheric effects is stunningly depicted 
 including haze, lens flares, sun glare, and cloud layers, which are set off against a near photo-realistic 
 rolling countryside illuminated by eerie dynamic lighting. A full-featured mission editor has also 
 been designed expressly for F/A-18 Korea, which you can customize to create your own combat missions. 
 About the only thing missing from the game is a foldout keyboard reference card, an unfortunate 
 omission especially when you consider what it takes just to get this ferocious war bird airborne. 
   

 Make no mistake, F/A-18 Korea is a daunting air combat simulation, requiring vast amounts of time, 
 patience, and hands-on experience to be completely understood and fully appreciated. Despite its 
 somewhat tardy start, Graphic Simulations Corporation has, nevertheless, managed to catch up with 
 the rest of the field in one ingenious catapult launch, unleashing an awe-inspiring simulation 
 that ably and accurately models one of the most lethal yet versatile airborne weapons platforms 
 ever to be conceived. F/A-18 Korea not only teaches you how to handle the US Navy's vaunted F/A-18 
 Hornet under the most demanding operational conditions, but makes a convincing argument regarding 
 the resolve and commitment of one of the most underrated gaming houses around.
