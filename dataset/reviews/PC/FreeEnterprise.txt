Free Enterprise is a SimCity wannabe that doesn't come close to achieving itslofty goal. 

 Free Enterprise is a SimCity wannabe that doesn't come close to achieving its lofty goal. The 
 object is to start and successfully operate a business in an economic climate that reflects real-world 
 issues. With my perspective as a former publishing company marketing director and operations manager, 
 I can tell you Free Enterprise is so far off the mark it's more like a lesson in how not to run 
 a business.  

 First, the game lets you select a city in which to establish your company, then you find a building 
 to rent; only then do you decide what you're going to manufacture. You determine how much money 
 you'll start your company with, from $400,000 to a million. (The larger the sum, the more strings 
 attached.) Finally, you equip your building with production machinery, offices, and people. Once 
 set up, you start the clock and watch what happens. You'll receive memos letting you know if the 
 employees are disgruntled over low pay, whether you're forecasting a positive cash flow, and if 
 some areas of the business are overworked and need additional staffing.  

 The problems come in the details. The city selection is a joke; what you want to find is a location 
 with minimal competition, plenty of raw material suppliers, a strong but not too expensive labor 
 force, and accumulated demand for your product. So why not use the power of the computer to analyze 
 all the cities? Instead you have to click on each city, one at a time, and go through a laborious 
 process to gather less-than-informative data.  

 You'll need to go through a similarly tedious and unrewarding process to select your product line, 
 which is always a very narrow niche like bowling balls or weed whackers. You must pay employees 
 what they demand or the whole company shuts down. And gathering information on why sales have suddenly 
 slumped or which employees are doing well and which are goofing off is nearly impossible.  

 Occasionally your daily activities are interrupted by televised reports on changing business conditions. 
 These video snippets look horrendous. Tsunami uses ancient black and white generic business clips 
 or pathetic color videos that have virtually nothing to do with the stories. For instance, an electrical 
 storm has fried most of the area's home electronic appliances creating a huge demand - but the 
 video shows looters ripping off Huggies disposable diapers.  

 Free Enterprise gives minutely detailed information on its employees' capabilities, from mathematical 
 aptitude to typing skills. But this micro-management knowledge has no value in light of the game's 
 other minimal controls and information. Not only that, but according to Tsunami, a worker who smokes 
 creates many more problems than a drug abuser. And here's a new flash from the game manual: Did 
 you know accounting skills are "good for an accounting type to have"?  

 With all of Free Enterprise's drawbacks, it has some potential. But to reach any level of effectiveness 
 this product needs a thorough tutorial and several step-by-step scenarios. With the right supplemental 
 material it could work well as a grade school or high school business education tool, but as a 
 game it falls flat.

Review:  Gameplay: It was difficult to start first, but when the money starts streaming in, it becomes easier.
 
  Graphics: Simple, but I think they where ok for 1996 standards.
  Sound: Few sounds in the game... and there is barely any music either.
  Value: Well it can be 
 funny for a few hours. But I dont think any longer then that.
  
  I would like to see a more modern version of this game! And with an better A. I, I have always more 
 marketshare then the A. I has. Though I like the detailed reports and when you are the biggest company 
 in the region :) .

Review:  This is a game i adore, its the first of its kind (but not the only one) that lets you be the boss 
 of a factory and build it the way you want it to look. Plus its very challenging yet easy to play. 
 But the main thing is it is a good game and its fine for those of us who like to manage things. 
 Sim games are definitely not like this, And should try something like this. They might do good 
 in this field. But it has it's draw-backs, its old and needs some work... But it is a very addicting 
 game to those Play "businessmen" out there.
  I give it a 9.0

  Plus its free :) at someplaces.

Review:  When I spent my hard-earned cash on this "game" it seemed like it might be fun. Only it really 
 wasn't. It seemed to have some kind of bug that when you built too much in your factory - the game 
 simply crashed. This happened on 3 separate machines. 
  
  In the game you start out to make some sort of manufacturing business. You look at a map and determine 
 what products are in demand in which city. You also compare average warehouse rent by cost per 
 square foot. Then you select your location in the city by size and rent price and begin to hire 
 your working class stiffs. Next you go to the trouble of building offices, setting up machines 
 and conveyor belts - only to find yourself policing who is in the break room. I bough this game 
 imagining how I would do things different than my boss in the real world not imitate him in my 
 leisure. After a little while you get a decent work force (after going thru the biggest slackers 
 I've ever seen) and BAM! - the game crashes.

Review:  Honestly, I had to consult an online manual just to figure out what I'm doing wrong with this game. 
 The game has no instructions or tutorial on how to "play" it what so ever. So you're pretty much 
 just flying blind since it ends up being a horrible mess anyway.
  
  The only thing I found enjoyable was being able to mess with my employee's skills and personality. 
 But sometimes not even that makes any sense in the game. I had a drug addict who abused alcohol 
 and had no social skills whatsoever work relatively well in the office. On the other hand, some 
 of my other perfect employees would be stressed out and all of a sudden come in one morning and 
 shoot up the place.
  
  That's another thing - the employees just don't want to really work. If they aren't paid enough, 
 or if the environment isn't right - it's always something and before you know it - you've got the 
 police coming in after a violent shooting incident.
  
  The graphics are really nothing to speak of; I could draw better graphics on paint in a few minutes 
 for what's in the game - just a few basic sprites. The sound is basically non existant as well 
 - which is probably a good thing.
  
  As for Gameplay - there's not much of that. You can set up your office building and hire some employees 
 and then set the timer on a day, a week, a month, or a year and then sit back and watch it all 
 happen. You don't need to intervene in any way at that point.
  
  When I finally figured out how to really play the game I did moderately well and focused my business 
 on selling computers.... till the market crashed - hard! Out of the blue the demand for computers 
 dropped and I was left holding the bag.
  
  Now if you think it's easy to even produce computers you're wrong. There are tons of specialized 
 equipment and supplies you have to have in order to manufacture them and the factory and workers 
 have to be set up just right for it all to flow.
  
  When I went from selling millions of them a month to a few hundred - my company went bankrupt cause 
 at that stage in the game you are so focused on one item that selling off all your used equipment 
 and starting over is pointless - you might as well start a new game!
  
  So in the end, I will say I had some fun with it for a while. But ultiimately it's too frustating 
 of a game to figure out let alone play. I wouldn't recommend getting this at all!
