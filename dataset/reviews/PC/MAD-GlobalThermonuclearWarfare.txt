MAD is reminiscent of classic board games, because of its simple dynamics, and of classic arcade 
 games, because of its hectic pace. 

  Set in the year 2040, MAD brings the world's nuclear nightmare to life. Advanced satellite defense 
 systems orbit over arsenals of nuclear warheads just waiting for new targets. Dubbed an "arcade 
 strategy game" by its designers, MAD (mutually assured destruction) combines a basic real-time 
 strategy formula with some first-person action. While the real-time strategy elements will be immediately 
 familiar to fans of the genre, MAD is probably more reminiscent of classic board games, because 
 of its simple dynamics, and of classic arcade games, because of its hectic pace.           The 
 object is the nuke the world    

 The game divides the globe into 16 territories, split between you and the computer or between you 
 and another player. Your goal is to annihilate all enemy territories with nuclear weapons before 
 you're met with the same fate. Each territory produces two resources to power your way to victory: 
 The first of these is cash, which lets you build missile silos and launch pads on the ground and 
 put space station modules into orbit over each territory. These stations provide research facilities 
 for developing new technologies, and they act as orbital defense platforms bristling with rockets 
 and beam weapons for intercepting enemy missiles. Research is divided into seven basic categories 
 like nuclear missiles, kinetic weapon research, or commercial applications to garner more cash. 
 Your other resource is uranium, used to launch missiles. MAD plays so quickly that you're unlikely 
 to get a lot of research done or have to worry much about resource balancing before the game is 
 over.   

  To manage your territories, structures, and research, you're presented with ground-level and low-orbit 
 views of the earth. You'll find yourself frequently switching between both views, since you need 
 to see your structures directly to access their functions. To help with this management, you're 
 presented with a minimap, though its small scale at higher resolutions lessens its usefulness. 
 What's more useful is the readout that lists your territories along with icons showing what structures 
 you have in each of them and what station modules orbit above them. With this readout, you can 
 jump directly to the structure or module you want by clicking the appropriate icon.   

  This is particularly important for quickly accessing your defensive systems. While they work independently, 
 they're somewhat more effective when you operate them manually in first-person view. This arcade-style 
 element helps spice up gameplay, but it's a bit difficult to aim the guns because of the high and 
 nonadjustable mouse sensitivity. You also manually target your nuclear missiles, but illogically 
 enough, the more quickly you aim and fire, the more accurate the strikes are. The accuracy doesn't 
 really matter much anyway since you only need to be roughly near the target. The whole feature 
 seems superfluous.           Orbiting satellites do the dirty work    

 It's also difficult to keep track of each territory's remaining strength percentage. You can see 
 it when you move the cursor over a territory in the orbital view, but it would be much easier if 
 these percentages were indicated all together in one of the interface panels. Fortunately, most 
 other information is readily available through text warnings at the bottom of the screen when an 
 important event occurs, coupled with an appropriate sound effect.   

  While these sound effects aren't numerous, they're colorful and set the mood well. Rumbling missile 
 launches, wailing air-raid sirens, and static-distorted voices from mission control are lively 
 and memorable. However, the sounds can quickly become repetitive when the action heats up, since 
 each event seems to use the same effect over and over. The musical score is also sparse, but the 
 appealing symphonic tracks are appropriately grandiose.   

  MAD's visuals aren't stellar, but they have a certain charm. The menu interface uses a blocky, 
 old-fashioned computer font, and the graphics as a whole have a nostalgic, cartoonlike look. In 
 some ways, this throwback visual style is appropriate to the game's material, which seems as if 
 it came out of the late Cold War.   

  In fact, MAD seems to be something of a spiritual descendant of the early arcade classic Missile 
 Command. There's a clear emphasis on action, not merely through the manually targeted weapons but 
 through the basic gameplay. You'll have to work extremely quickly to win as you rapidly jump between 
 viewpoints, which can detract from the game's strategic elements. These are fairly limited from 
 the start, despite 10 scenarios of varying difficulty levels that start you with different numbers 
 of territories, structures, and so forth. Still, if you don't approach it like a sophisticated 
 real-time strategy game or full-fledged action game but more like a fast-paced computerized board 
 game, MAD can be a fun diversion.
