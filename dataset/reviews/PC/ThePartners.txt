:::Review:::
It's an interesting attempt to create a soap opera with The Sims as a model, but the fact is, The 
 Sims was already a great little soap opera on its own. 

 It's clear the developer of The Partners thinks of its game as a cross between the TV show  Ally 
 McBeal  and the smash-hit PC game  The Sims . All this means is that they've taken The Sims, interface 
 and all, and placed it in a lawyer's office. It's not a bad premise -- after all, every Sims fan 
 has probably wondered what his or her sims do all day at work. But if The Partners is any indication, 
 their lives at the office are pretty much the same as at home.           As in The Sims, you must 
 manage relationships.    

 The Partners adds a strategic wrapper to The Sims, giving you more-specific goals and even a bit 
 of work to do. But otherwise, it's primarily the same game. You are in charge of an office full 
 of lawyers. You help shape their relationships, and you buy items to make their time at work more 
 productive and more enjoyable. And it's especially important that the workplace be pleasing to 
 your little computer people, because these lawyers never, ever leave the office. To be fair, The 
 Partners makes some slight changes to The Sims formula. For instance, you don't have to worry about 
 sending your lawyers to the bathroom, but you do have to worry about their need for sexual contact. 
   

  There are three different scenarios you can play. Each requires you to shape the lawyers' relationships 
 to meet the goals. The scenarios take place in three different law firms, and the overall goals 
 include things like terrorizing coworkers and avoiding flirting. There are more-specific goals 
 as well. A new lawyer might join the firm, and you must help him win his first case in order to 
 stay on board. Winning a case is usually easy -- your chance of winning the case is represented by 
 a percentage, and you can raise that percentage by selecting a lawyer assigned to the case, clicking 
 on a desk, and then selecting the "work on cases" option. Harder cases require more work, which 
 means repeating this process over and over again. The cases themselves are occasionally amusing, 
 but the work element of the game is fairly slight.   

  As in The Sims, you build your relationships by forcing the workers to interact. There are a variety 
 of interactions, and making good choices will make your coworkers become friends or even more than 
 friends. Each lawyer has a need for love that can be addressed by developing an office romance 
 or by using various objects that satisfy that need. For instance, one of your lawyers can attempt 
 to woo a coworker, or he or she can just read a romance novel. You can have your lawyers offer 
 diamond rings to their love interests, buy flowers for them, and use all sorts of other courting 
 techniques (all on the company dime, strangely enough) . Lawyers also have a need for sex, and they 
 can likewise look to their coworkers or the magazine racks for satisfaction. This is one of the 
 stranger elements of the game, as occasionally one of your lawyers will crawl under another's desk 
 to "tickle feet."           It's not what you think.    

 The objects available help satisfy your workers in different ways. Exercise equipment will help 
 them when they're feeling sporty, while paintings will help them when they need a bit of culture. 
 Your lawyers walk around and look at stuff, and they barely ever work unless you tell them to. 
 The workplace scenario seems entirely tacked on, and there's no real simulation other than earning 
 money for winning cases. You don't have to manage payrolls or hire new people -- you just have to 
 get them to tickle each other's feet, or avoid tickling if the scenario demands it.   

  And this may be the biggest problem with the game. The Sims was interesting and fun primarily because 
 it gave you so much freedom with developing the personalities and relationships between the various 
 characters. The Partners gives you much less freedom. Certain characters will just be mean, and 
 others will flirt constantly with everyone. You will need to keep one lawyer from flirting with 
 another, or help two of them hook up. It's an interesting attempt to create a soap opera with The 
 Sims as a model, but the fact is, The Sims was already a great little soap opera on its own. The 
 Partners does contain a mode that lets you play without constraints, but it seems pretty pointless 
 when there's another, better game almost exactly like it that most people already own.   

  The Partners also misses the charm of the game that inspired it. The music is decent, consisting 
 of a sort of ongoing sit-com-inspired soundtrack that isn't overbearing. However, the dialogue -- the 
 same sort of nonsensical mumbling found in The Sims -- is less charming, if only because it sounds 
 like someone grunting into a poorly placed microphone. At least The Partners looks fairly good, 
 especially the skyscraper offices that allow you to scroll past the walls and look down on the 
 streets far below.   

  It's a sad truth that great success leads to imitation. That imitation can pave a road from Doom 
 to Half-Life, or from Dune II to Starcraft, but there are plenty of Chasms and Conquest Earths 
 along the way. It's a sure bet that there will be countless Sims clones in the next few years. 
 The Partners is one of the first, and it could turn out to be one of the most blatant. That's not 
 to say it's a bad choice for someone who absolutely loves The Sims. There are enough variations 
 to make it mildly different, and, if nothing else, you can pretend you're seeing your sims at their 
 day job. But chances are you'll want to get back to their home life before too long.
