If you're looking for an adventure game that'll deliver your money's worth, you ought to check this 
 one out. 

 I'll have to admit that when I first saw the ads for Normality, I was a little put off: making the 
 hero of an adventure game a "grunge-head" seemed like just a clever marketing ploy aimed at grabbing 
 the 17-25 market share. Well, maybe it is a clever marketing ploy, but I couldn't care less. Because 
 the truth is that Normality's a very good adventure game -- and, surprisingly enough, it was not 
 designed for novice adventurers. Some of the puzzles here are definite hair-pullers even for veteran 
 gamers, though part of that difficulty can be laid at the feet of some extremely sublime hints 
 and clues. In other words, there's a logical reason for the things you do, but whose logic and 
 how it was arrived at is subject to debate.  

 Set in the dull, polluted city of Neutropolis, Normality casts you as Kent (the aforementioned "grunge-head") , 
 who's just been released from jail and locked in his apartment for some prolonged therapy in front 
 of the ol' idiot box. While he was in the pokey, though, someone slipped a note under his cell 
 door that hinted at a group of "like-minded people" (read: slackers) wanted him to join their ranks. 
 Your immediate goal is to escape from your apartment; the ultimate goal is to uncover the conspiracy 
 that keeps the citizens of Neutropolis dull and downtrodden.  

 You play from a first-person perspective ("like Descent, fool" as it says on the back of the box) , 
 using the cursor keys or mouse to move about and look up and down. To perform the usual adventure-game 
 commands -- Look, Use, Talk, Open, and Pick Up -- you can either call up the Kent "Voodoo Doll" 
 and click on the appropriate body part, or position the icon over an object and use a hot-key command. 

 Getting used to the first-person movement takes a little time, but once you've gotten the hang of 
 it you'll be exploring just as efficiently as in a traditional 2D graphic adventure. My only complaint 
 is that you can get confused as to when you should select certain commands; at one point you climb 
 onto a toilet by simply walking into it, then a little later you have to select the Use command 
 in order to climb onto a conveyor belt. That's a pretty minor quibble, though, and overall the 
 interface works very well.  

 There are several 3D-modeled characters to interact with (there's also some non-interactive 3D scenes 
 as well) , but it's nothing to write home about: usually the characters simply bob and sway like 
 automatons as they talk. Traditional 2D animation would probably be better suited to creating distinct 
 personalities for these characters, but at least the voice acting is good. And while he gets on 
 some player's nerves, I personally think Corey Feldman, who does the voice of Kent, may have finally 
 found his true calling. It's nice to hear Corey enthusiastically yell, "I have it!" and "Now it's 
 mine!" when you pick something up; you can tell the guy's a real actor, and if he should get on 
 your nerves you can always turn him off.  

 Make no mistake: there are a lot places in Normality where you can get stuck. Fortunately, there 
 are all sorts of sites online where you can get hints and tips (including the Interplay Web site) , 
 so there's no need to be stuck forever. If you're looking for an adventure game that'll deliver 
 your money's worth, you ought to check this one out.

Review:  I have great memories from playing this game as a kid, the outline of the story is that there is 
 a conspiracy by the government which makes not being "normal" illegal, normal being that you can't 
 be happy, you can't laugh, joke, listen to music or do anything that has the slightest chance of 
 disrupting the dull, dark, monotonus atmosphere of the city. There is a constant smog above the 
 city that is so thick that it obscures the sun entirely, the situation has been going on for so 
 long that any entertainment centres have been out of service for decades, parks and playgrounds 
 for children are fenced off with gates so old they are rusted shut. The sun itself is almost a 
 myth, a story that crazy grandparents ramble on about. There, that is the mood of the game, now 
 the game itself will lead to your character doing all he can to break the monotony of the city, 
 which is ofcourse, against the law. You will carry out many tasks which range from setting off 
 crates of fireworks from a boarded up novelty store to sneaking a music video tape onto a television 
 broadcast. The puzzles are obscure but not impossible, unlike many other puzzle games which get 
 you to solve puzzles regarding the environment or information, NORMALTY will have you interact 
 with people in ways such as persuading a NORM officer to leave his post temporarily to take a much 
 needed respite in the bathroom. 
  Although the graphics may be enough to make you spew in days with games like DOOM3 and Myst V the 
 environments are still quite interesting, the theme of the game has a lot in common with Half Life 
 2 except the populace doesn't realise they are being suppressed & therefore do nothing about it 
 (another Conspiracy) , if you ever get that urge to play something old school and remember the god 
 old days where developers could be really creative and inventive without worrying about losing 
 a heap of cash then pick up this game if you can.
