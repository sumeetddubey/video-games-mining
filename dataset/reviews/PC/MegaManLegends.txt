:::Review:::
Mega Man Legends is an unembellished port of a forgettable 3-year-old PlayStation game. 

  Mega Man Legends is an unembellished port of a forgettable 3-year-old PlayStation game. If you're 
 a big Mega Man fan, chances are you own a PlayStation and, therefore, have no compelling reason 
 to buy Mega Man Legends for the PC. Those who aren't familiar with Capcom's Mega Man series can 
 also skip this game, because it's very old and not especially fun for the 35 long hours it takes 
 to finish. In closing, while there are still many issues that divide us, this is not one of them. 
 Thank you and good night.           Legends is the first 3D installment of a classic series of 
 side-scrollers.    

  To match the amount of effort Capcom put into the port, that's really where the review should end. 
 Unfortunately, although there isn't too much more to say about Mega Man Legends, the review must 
 continue. All the previous Mega Man games have been side-scrolling shooters. Legends, however, 
 attempts to expand the series by being a 3D action/role-playing hybrid in the spirit of Legend 
 of Zelda for the Nintendo 64. It tells the story of Mega Man, his sister Roll, his grandfather, 
 and their pet monkey. They crash-land their airship on an island called Kattelox. While trying 
 to repair the ship, they become embroiled in an effort to save the island from attackers. Ultimately, 
 they end up learning a lot about the origins of Mega Man and a few valuable lessons about the power 
 of friendship and getting bigger guns attached to your robot arm.   

  In the strict tradition of these types of games, you walk around sections of the environment and 
 talk to everyone until somebody finally tells you what to do next. After you do it, a new area 
 might open up, though you may have to talk to a few more people and complete a few more tasks first. 
 In between, you can purchase new items for Mega Man at various shops. As in most console role-playing 
 games, there is a dog that says "woof" when you try to talk to it, and many people have lost things. 
   

  The "action" part of "action/role-playing hybrid" refers to the combat system. Enemies attack in 
 simple patterns, and you have to shoot them. Many of these battles take place in underground tunnel 
 areas in which the control scheme makes aiming difficult. Instead of adjusting the controls to 
 take advantage of the PC mouse, the game utilizes a cumbersome system whereby you use a gamepad's 
 shoulder buttons to turn. In fact -- even though you shouldn't bother anyway -- if you don't have a 
 gamepad, you really shouldn't bother with Mega Man Legends. Though there's a button that supposedly 
 locks your aim on to enemies, it doesn't work very well, as the lock is lost as soon as an enemy 
 scoots off the screen.   

  The environments are colorful, and, though geometrically simple, they display a surprisingly deep 
 view distance. Unsurprisingly, though, the graphics that weren't noteworthy in 1998 haven't gotten 
 better with age. Three years and the migration from your forgiving television five feet away to 
 a high-resolution monitor eight inches from your face have not been kind to Mega Man Legends' visuals, 
 and the developers made no attempt to improve them.           There's no real point to this lackluster 
 PlayStation port.    

  The frequent cutscenes are integrated seamlessly into the game, since they're rendered using the 
 engine. Unfortunately, either something went wrong with these scenes during the conversion to the 
 PC, or they never worked right in the first place, because the dialogue is completely decoupled 
 from the graphics. You'll see one character begin talking while the voice of another character 
 is still playing on the soundtrack. At first it's confusing, but eventually it becomes sort of 
 ineptly charming. So you can consider that something positive about the game.   

  Mega Man Legends is a product for people who want a little action with their adventure or a little 
 adventure with their action, but not too much of both -- or either one, for that matter. It also 
 represents the worst type of publisher shovelware. No attempt has been made to improve it any way 
 for the PC, and it shows. Many much, much better games exist in the same genre. In fact, Capcom 
 has subsequently released both a prequel and a sequel for the PlayStation. And you can play all 
 of them right now on your PC using Bleem.

Review:  I remember first playing this game on PS , I really loved it, a couple of friends also played it 
 so we were really just, going underground and see who gets the best items, money etc. also, this 
 game is a good adventure game, you get to enhance your busterweapon into whatever you like, speed, distance, power 
 so if you play it right you can always have the upper hand in combat.
  
  Megaman legends also is a quite lengthy game, that is, if you want to get the best of everything 
 and do everything. A great game, worth a lot more than a 3.6 !

Review:  Back in the days of old, when I was a bit younger, I remember playing this game non-stop. Since 
 the game is unembellished for the PC platform, there has been little to no change in the the style 
 of the game itself. The game brought about new elements to the series such as: the semi-free roaming 
 environment, the three dimensional characters, unique bosses, voice actors, mini-games, sides quests, 
 buster weapon upgrades, to name a few. To call this game "lackluster" on any platform is, in my 
 opinion, a reflection of poor taste. This game brought "RPG nerds" to its fan base (being one myself 
 I speak from experience) . The game was lacking in the difficulty department as well as the graphics 
 and level design, but what can one expect with the limited capabilities available when the game 
 was produced? For me this game gets 10's all across the board because of its distinctive style 
 that set it apart from others in the series.

Review:  This Game is seriously one of my favorites. Its like MEGAMAN RPG.. GREAT story and great interactive 
 movements and stuff. Trust me not the ratings on this one this game is seriously the best MEGAMAN 
 game i have ever played. If you dont believe me go out and get a copy yourself. Its worth every 
 penny!!! PLEASE DONT BURRY THIS GAME!! ITS THE BEST IN THE MEGAMAN SERIES!!! Besides why would 
 they make a part 2 of a crappy game if there wasnt money that was made behind this game. Think 
 about it??? As i say again GIVE THIS GAME A CHANCE!! i loved this!

Review:  People are afraid of this game I guess and think that since it is in the third dimention it of 
 coarse is not worth playing since it was meant to be played in two dimentions. Well people that 
 is just being prejudice against this game. Megaman Legends is a fun game. It took the old megaman 
 shooting and added a new level of gameplay to it. As long as you keep that two dimention mindset 
 out of your head then you can have fun with this game. I must admit the voice acting was CHEESY 
 at points and there were some bugs but for the most part once u got used to the game it was maddddd 
 fun. I found it very hard to beat at first but if u get that final weapon you are invincible. So 
 to all you people give this game a chance it wont disappoint.

Review:  The game was okay. The Graphics were pretty good. The controls sucked pretty badly. When I was 
 walking around I felt like it was more real than some of the other games like this. The controls 
 were rather annoying (this is the same for most PS games for the PC) . The game didnt lose anything 
 in transition to the PC. The effects werent touched up so I cant give it to many points. In my 
 personal opinion the game is pretty mediocre, but what do you except out of an original Play station 
 game? So all in all its a good mediocre game as long as you dont mind bad controls.
