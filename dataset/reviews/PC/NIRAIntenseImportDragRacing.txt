:::Review:::
It turns out that this is little more than an add-on pack for Hot Rod Championship Drag Racing designed 
 to run as a stand-alone product. 

 When I first heard about NIRA Intense Import Drag Racing, I was pretty jazzed. After all, it was 
 created by Bethesda, which gave us Burnout - one of the best (and one of the few) drag-racing simulations 
 ever for the PC. And I naturally assumed that Bethesda would have used the time between Burnout 
 (which was later renamed Hot Rod Championship Drag Racing) and NIRA Intense Import Drag Racing 
 to rectify everything that had kept Hot Rod from being a Grade A product - like providing native 
 Windows support, making the manual more user-friendly, improving the interface, and beefing up 
 the game's VCR features.  

 However, it turns out that NIRA Intense Import Drag Racing is little more than an add-on pack for 
 Hot Rod Championship Drag Racing designed to run as a stand-alone product. I'm thankful that Bethesda 
 at least kept the sticker price low ($19.95) , but the bottom line is that everything that had kept 
 Hot Rod from introducing drag racing to the gaming masses is still alive and kicking in this latest 
 incarnation.  

 The only real difference between NIRA and Hot Rod are the cars. Instead of rails, funny cars, and 
 souped-up stock cars, you get to drag race imported cars like a Mitsubishi Eclipse, Toyota Supra, 
 Honda CRX, Acura Integra, BMW M3, Porsche 911, and a couple of cars that were apparently taken 
 from NIRA teams. It's beyond me why someone would want to race these cars on a drag strip - it 
 seems as though they'd all be better suited to a type of racing that would take greater advantage 
 of their handling capabilities - but apparently some people are into it or there wouldn't be an 
 NIRA in the first place. There are only ten cars total in NIRA, but as the old saying goes, you 
 get what you pay for; on the upside, there are 20 tracks featured in the game, a few of which were 
 sites of 1998 NIRA events.  

 Some modifications have been made to the Hot Rod game engine to reflect the sort of setup options 
 made available by these types of cars. Just as in the first Bethesda drag-racing game, the number 
 of ways you can tweak your car's performance is vast to the point of being overwhelming to all 
 but the most savvy mechanics and drivers. To be fair, the manual does touch on all the bases, but 
 no attempt at all has been made to make the manual more accessible: The instructions have the same 
 turgid prose and reams of complicated information that almost made me comatose back when I played 
 Hot Rod.  

 Where NIRA really shines is out on the track, and while figuring out the complexities of drag-racing 
 rules and coming up with that perfect engine and chassis setup can take a while, you'll be rewarded 
 with some extremely intense action against some very strong computer opponents. But you'll eventually 
 get the itch to race against human opponents. Unfortunately, the fact that this game isn't Windows 
 95-native means the only way to find competition on the Internet is on that old workhorse, Kali. 
 Bethesda is throwing support behind the Simulated Hot Rod Association, and there's even a Kali 
 site specifically for SHRA. However, it's still disappointing that a racing sim released in 1999 
 doesn't offer the option for direct TCP/IP connections; instead, it asks you to spend an additional 
 $20 for a gaming network whose reason for existence passed with the arrival of DirectX's multiplayer 
 support.  

 Other areas that remain unimproved include the game's flaky control setup and limited VCR functions. 
 I lost count of the number of times I assigned important functions to a joystick button (the game 
 only recognizes four-button controllers, by the way) only to enter a race and find that it may 
 or may not work. Watching replays is pretty fun, but it'd be a lot more exciting if you could hear 
 the sounds of the engines or rotate, pan, and zoom the view for the best angle of a major crash. 

 I learned to live with all of these same annoyances in Hot Rod and wound up enjoying the game enough 
 to give it a fairly high score. And of course there's something to be said for the NIRA's low price 
 tag and the fact that you can race import cars. But if you're just a casual drag-racing fan, you're 
 better off picking up a copy of the original Hot Rod Championship or waiting on Bethesda's upcoming 
 IHRA Drag Racing.
