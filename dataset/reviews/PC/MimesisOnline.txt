:::Review:::
Mimesis Online has a long way to go before it is worth your bandwidth, your time, or your money. 
 

  Online role-playing games have a reputation for launching with significant problems. Last year's 
 best online RPG, Dark Age of Camelot, was praised for being well designed and entertaining but 
 earned equal praise for being playable from day one. Mimesis Online, from Polish developer Tannhauser 
 Gate, has more in common with last year's messy Anarchy Online than with Dark Age of Camelot, and 
 unfortunately, the comparisons don't stop at the science-fiction theme. Mimesis Online isn't so 
 much a game as an engine, featuring very little variety, not much to do, and huge portions of the 
 game missing from the current version.           The only thing to do in Mimesis is run around 
 and fight things.    

  The manual features a lengthy expository story that attempts to explain the somewhat incomprehensible 
 history of the world. This history manages to include almost every science-fiction trope imaginable: 
 There was a great plague, some mysterious transporter things, and some sort of tentative alliance 
 between humans and some alien races after several realities were somehow combined. The nameless 
 world on which they all coexist is a mysterious, hostile place, and its origins are unknown. It's 
 now the year 5692, and your job is to go out and explore that world. Tannhauser Gate has promised 
 that the story will be a major part of Mimesis Online, but this is not at all evident in the game's 
 current state. Mimesis Online includes only a few missions and no nonplayer characters, but it 
 does include guides that explain the basic rules when you start out.   

  You have a choice of three character types: human male, human female, or the unisexual hirudon. 
 The latter is an interesting-looking alien species, built like a skinny, hairless ape with the 
 skin of a snake and John Merrick's head. Humans are your standard fighter types, with good strength 
 and dexterity, while hirudons have high perception and intelligence, making them more adept at 
 psionics.   

  Psionics powers are the equivalent of a magic system in Mimesis Online. Or at least they might 
 be. The generally uninformative manual makes many references to psionics and specifically mentions 
 a psionic power called "paralyze." None of this means much, because there are no psionics in the 
 game. Playing a hirudon is akin to playing a camel with fins. They look neat, but they serve no 
 purpose. Hirudons are inferior in combat, and that's all there is to the game.   

  The only thing that you can do in Mimesis Online is buy equipment, run around, and fight. The combat 
 system is interesting. There are a good variety of melee weapons, and ranged weapons are slowly 
 being introduced to the world. As you use a certain class of weapon, you gain experience with that 
 class and gain access to new attacks. As a fledgling fighter, you'll have access only to rudimentary 
 armor and crude weapons, like axes that look like TV antennas assembled from scrap metal. As you 
 gain experience and cards, the currency of the world, your options will open considerably, allowing 
 you to wield impressive-looking swords, shields, and axes.   

  Though the combat system is interesting, combat itself is not. To attack a creature, you target 
 it and then right-click on the attack you want to perform. If you keep right-clicking on the attack, 
 your character keeps chasing the monster around and whacking on it. There aren't many creature 
 types in the world, and many of the "different" creatures, like the many variations of things called 
 inim, are identical except for their strength and names. You'll likely grow tired of fighting the 
 same creatures over and over before you even gain your first level.   

  And gaining your first level will take a long time. Actually, you'll be gaining your 11th level, 
 as characters in Mimesis Online inexplicably begin at level 10. Leveling is remarkably slow and 
 combat so repetitive that advancement in Mimesis Online isn't very interesting. There's no grace 
 period for low-level characters, so you'll lose experience when you die, straight from the start. 
 At least gaining a level makes some significant changes to your character. When creating a character, 
 you choose what percentage of your experience will go toward advancing different statistics, which 
 is an interesting means of making your character's progression somewhat unique.           Hirudons 
 aren't good at fighting things.    

  While the combat system seems somewhat solid, most of Mimesis Online seems unfinished. The manual 
 makes reference to stealing and other character skills, none of which are actually available. The 
 interface seems like a placeholder, with unlabeled buttons and strange icons. Character control 
 is sluggish, and turning while running feels like a fairly accurate representation of steering 
 a Lincoln Continental underwater. Mimesis Online does have some interesting ideas, like the fame 
 rating, which causes your reputation to decrease as you kill other players or increase when you 
 kill players with bad reputations. Player killing is reportedly a problem, but it wasn't an issue 
 during the course of this review.   

  Mimesis Online may be a good game someday. It looks good, and the alien architecture and monsters 
 are both unique and well designed. But there's not much to do, and it takes a long time to do it. 
 There are very few players, which is not surprising considering that the game would seem barren 
 for a beta, let alone a game that is supposedly ready for the public. Even though downloading it 
 is free and the monthly charge is relatively low, Mimesis Online has a long way to go before it 
 is worth your bandwidth, your time, or your money.

Review:  Clearly as many of you might allready know, this game lacks practically every quality that makes 
 a MMORPG fun. It lacks in graphics, sound and gameplay so heavily that you wont want to play it 
 more than 2 hours. Please, dont play this game. You will be dissapointed by it. If you even see 
 it in a bargain bin, please do not bother. I have written all tehre is to say about this game. 
 If you buy, you will be sadly dissapointed by it. Not much more I can say about it exept dont get 
 it at all, ever. 
  
  Also, you will hardly find any people playing on the servers. They are completely empty sometimes 
 which, in a way, kills the whole MMORPG gameplay. What fun is a MMORPG without any other players.
