It's just sad that the best part of this campaign is what made the original one disappointing: its 
 brevity. 

 Die by the Sword seemed like your typical third-person action game, but its unique play mechanics 
 allowed for a flexibility of control that few games can match. You didn't just hit a button to 
 slash the enemy, but could move the hero's sword arm in any direction, thereby allowing you to 
 invent your own moves on the fly. The game modeled damage according to the momentum of your swing 
 and let you dismember your foes, so with practice you could behead your enemies with a couple of 
 well-placed strikes. It wasn't easy to get used to the control, but most of those who did found 
 Die by the Sword to be rewarding and enjoyable as long as it lasted.  

 Unfortunately, though the original Die by the Sword campaign was pretty sweet, it was very short. 
 Some of the more memorable moments had the loudmouthed hero Enric quaffing a shrinking potion to 
 navigate through Kobold tunnels, fighting while dangling from a rope trap, sabotaging a Dwarven 
 mining laser, and leaping across giant clockwork gears. The new Limb from Limb quest, which stars 
 Enric's aptly loudmouthed mate Maya, offers no such excitement, comprising nothing more than long 
 stretches of cavern and dungeon interspersed with the rare but always banal block puzzle. To make 
 matters worse, the quest isn't even any longer than the original, there are no cinematics, no ending, 
 and really just a lot of repetitive combat that seemed much more contextual in the original game. 
 Sure, you'll fight a few new enemies including a minotaur and a big beetle, and you can play the 
 campaign as several different characters, but so what? The Limb from Limb campaign feels like it 
 was hacked together, with no new texture maps and no new architecture. Maya's got about a half 
 a dozen speaking lines, and you'll hear them all a thousand times if you don't turn the sound off. 
 It's just sad that the best part of this campaign is what made the original one disappointing: 
 its brevity.  

 Limb from Limb isn't all bad. Most of Die by the Sword's lasting value came from its arena combat, 
 where you could pit yourself against one or several opponents of your choice and duel to the death. 
 Limb from Limb expands the arena with several new battlefields and lets you play as the new monsters 
 in addition to multiple versions of returning characters (with different skins and weapons) . There's 
 a new king-of-the-hill mode, as well as the fairly amusing ogre hockey, in which you try to smack 
 a subservient kobold into the enemy player's goal. Now that there are more scenarios and characters 
 to choose from, arena battles in Die by the Sword can be especially fun.  

 But improved arena play hardly justifies the clumsy quest, which will make this add-on intolerable 
 for all but the most die-hard Die by the Sword fans. An ideal add-on makes a good game bigger and 
 better, smoothing out rough edges, adding complexity, and enhancing graphics, sound, and overall 
 presentation. Die by the Sword may be bigger with the Limb from Limb add-on, but rest assured that 
 this supplement only dilutes the original, creating the illusion of volume at the cost of quality.

Review:  Okay, I'm going to say it plain out - the arena ad ons and the extra campaign I personally do not 
 think is worth buying the expansion seperately, unless you really want to expand the arena matches. 
 It is however, a nice little expansion if you manage to get them bundeled together. I'll apologize 
 right now for any spelling errors, I'm not good with this laptop keyboard.
  
  Anyway, as Die by the sword did, Limb From Limb allows you to use the mouse as your sword or the 
 VSIM keyboard (obviously, seeing as LfL is its expansion, duh) to have 'complete freedom of combat' 
 Unfortunately, it isn't as responsive or easy to use as some would think, but it is still a neat 
 control config. The game is hard, punishing you with a very difficult campaign. But there is always 
 fun to be had with the arena... muhahah.
  
  IF you are in to swordfighting games, looking for something different and difficult, track down 
 die by the sword and perhaps this expansion and give it a try. You'll enjoy it
