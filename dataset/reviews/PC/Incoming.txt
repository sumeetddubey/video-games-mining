:::Review:::
Incoming is a fine game and a definite must-have for arcade fans looking to fill up their hard drives 
 with remakes of the classics. 

 There are a couple of themes that have wormed their way into the blood of game designers. The first 
 is the need to go 3D, which, depending on the game, can be a good or bad thing. The other is the 
 need to go retro. Many new games coming out have usurped their gameplay from classics and redirected 
 the feel of the game altogether (not unlike a certain monster movie at a theater near you) . You 
 can balk if you like, but in the end, Incoming is a game that has embraced these themes and struck 
 back with intensity and graphics to make any button-slapping alien-buster turn his head.  

 The story is simple and to the point. Aliens are invading Earth, and you must stop them. To do this 
 you get behind the gun sights of a host of offensive and defensive weaponry to annihilate them 
 in an intense War of the Worlds fashion.  

 At the heart of all this is a strong yet slightly flawed game design that definitely pulls you in, 
 but leaves a little to be desired as far as keeping you there. Campaign gameplay progresses through 
 ten scenarios, and these are broken down into a series of phases in which you switch positions 
 from vehicles and defense posts in opposition to the invaders. Instructions from your commanders 
 range from the mundane, "Destroy enemy bomber," to the captivating-in-comparison, "Move to waypoint 
 marker." However, if you play the game through the tactical campaign, certain phases have you acting 
 as commander and directing your forces against targets. From this point, the level of intensity 
 is comparable to a 3D version of Missile Command that switches back and forth between first-person 
 and commanding roles. If you opt for the arcade option of gameplay, you're given a choice of craft 
 and tested as to how well you can pick up power-ups to defeat the swirling horde of enemy fighters 
 that comes after you. Included in the game are also a few varieties of multiplayer, which definitely 
 add an enjoyment factor but don't really add any extra game depth. Although the producers of Incoming 
 don't try to make you believe that there's anything more to the game than this simple formula, 
 what they have presented gets tiresome quickly.  

 What Incoming does present is some of the finest intensity in visuals and sound of any action game. 
 The lighting effects and explosions are worthy of any Fourth of July celebration. The land and 
 sea textures are rendered beautifully, and the game worlds themselves look as good as Battlezone. 
 The audio component adds even more to this through the use of surround sound that makes you grind 
 your teeth as your craft takes some hits. Each weapon is given its own impressive effect and really 
 gives you the sense of playing a first-person version of Raiden. For those of you with your stereo 
 systems connected to your audio boards, you're going to want to crank this baby up.  

 All in all, Incoming is a fine game (with an equally fine game manual) and a definite must-have 
 for arcade fans looking to fill up their hard drives with remakes of the classics. What it lacks 
 is a realization that computer games have moved beyond this simplistic style of gameplay, not only 
 because processor speeds have gotten faster, but also because there's more out there than the next 
 wave of aliens descending on your base.

Review:  I dont really remember if this game was easy or hard, its just the memories of the experience that 
 makes me think how much gaming has evolved since Incoming. The graphics were amazing just like 
 the shooting. It always looked nice kick to the sh**s out of the alien tanks and aircraft. Dont 
 be mistaken that Incoming is a game that you should play now for a great experience, no, Incoming 
 was a game you should have played a long time ago for great experience! The rating i gave this 
 game is coz the thrill of sitting back and thinking of it as a top-notch old-school and so on....... 
 You get the point. 
  
  Incoming is a classic 
  
  I think most of you who have played it see it as an old-school classic too, but if you dont, dont 
 talk crap about old memories like this one!!!

Review:  I really like flying and destroying everything, principally those technologic things that deal 
 with aliens and science. mHAuhahahh!
  
  Incoming it's a dynamic game with great visual effects, sounds and gameplay. A perfect game, based 
 in the factor to have been created in 1998.
  
  Mixed reactions, literally. Hwo knows, in 2008 to 2009 aliens of the crab nebula invade Earth? 
 It would be soo crazy!!!
  
  Coming back to the main subject, i admire Incoming as a fantastic game, BUT, really, like all other 
 games, it's normal to get sick of it.
  
  Great! Fantastic, and boring at the same time. I recommend to stop playing for some time and begin 
 a new game with a harder difficulty.

Review:  This is a very good action game, where saving the world is the main objective.
  
  Game-play: Really addictive. You have to destroy and destroy all aliens that attack your base. 
 The best missions are in planes and helicopters, the way it was designed was really good, and it's 
 much like a flying simulator. But there are missions that you can't move or you just have to get 
 something and leave it in the base, this make most of the missions boring. Other thing is that 
 you have to take care of your health, because it's not sufficient, and I'm sure you will have to 
 save minute after minute.
  
  Graphics: Good, I think they could do it better.
  
  Sound: Don't have a lot of sound, just special effects and things like that. 
  
  Value: By 
 the time, the missions get repeated, and there are about 10 missions per level, and I say about 
 5 levels...... If you've got time to play, you can take it to the end.
  
  My Tilt: Finally, I like this game. Shoot, destroy, explode; that things makes me want to play 
 more and more. But if it's your first action game, I don't recommend it.

Review:  I loved games where you can fly, or destroy flying vehicles, especially flying vehicles that were 
 occupied by aliens. I saw the game and I was overly excited.
  
  Gameplay: You can control a turret, shooting down flying crafts, and destroying ground vehicles; 
 while avoiding shots; or be in either a jet or helicopter, going to different missions and destroying 
 the enemies. At times you'll have friendly's to work with as well, who aren't really much help 
 since they're not very smart. At first this flying, driving, and defending business while shooting 
 is pretty fun.
  
  Graphics: Not bad, I like.
  
  Sound: Nothing to brag about here, it have a high variety in sounds.
  
  Value: I'd be surprised 
 if you sit through the missions the first time, some people might have the interest and patience. 
 But second time, I would highly doubt it. There are different difficulties though, for those who 
 wants a challenge.
  
  Tilt: The game did good, but if it was able to get more variety and if all the missions didn't 
 feel like the previous sets of missions, this game would've been great. It was just a good game 
 gone wrong, but it's still worth a look at, at least.

Review:  I loved games where you can fly, or destroy flying vehicles, especially flying vehicles that were 
 occupied by aliens. I saw the game and I was overly excited. After playing it for the first time 
 at home, I was satisfied, to say the least, for at least the first several levels. Eventually it 
 just got horribly repetetive. So here's the breakdown:
  
  Gameplay: You can control a turret, shooting down flying crafts, and destroying ground vehicles; 
 while avoiding shots; or be in either a jet or helicopter, going to different missions and destroying 
 the enemies. At times you'll have friendly's to work with as well, who aren't really much help 
 since they're not very smart. At first this flying, driving, and defending business while shooting 
 is pretty fun, but eventually you'll get really tired of the same old stuff.
  
  Graphics: It's not the greatest PC graphics, but it's also nothing you can't recognise.
  
  
 Sound: Nothing to brag about here, it could be better though with more variety in sounds.
  
  Value: I'd be surprised if you sit through the missions the first time, some people might have 
 the interest and patience. But second time, I would highly doubt it. There are different difficulties 
 though, for those who wants a challenge.
  
  Tilt: The game did good, but if it was able to get more variety and if all the missions didn't 
 feel like the previous sets of missions, this game would've been great. It was just a good game 
 gone wrong, but it's still worth a look at, at least.

Review:  At first glance Incoming seems like a fun arcade style game. However after putting a few hours 
 in you will quickly get bored of playing repetitive missions that focus on the same or similar 
 objectives and by the end of the relatively short campaign you'll be downright bored. Sure the 
 game has solid graphics, a decent sountrack, good gameplay mechanics, tight controls but it just 
 isnt' all that much fun. The frantic pace will excite you at first but soon you'll se that it's 
 just a coverup to conceal how little depth the missions have. Multiplayer is not bad and can be 
 fun with a few good friends but still won't catch your eye for long. So the conclusion is that 
 Incoming just isn't a game that will provide you with anything special.
