If you could find someone to play it with, the multiplayer mode could offer a few mindless thrills. 
 

 Funcom's third-person action game No Escape is a bloodless entry in the arena deathmatch subgenre 
 of shooters. It's ostensibly aimed at kids, but since the action is all about gun battles, it actually 
 appears to be pitched at a specific niche of pacifists who hate the sight of blood but still enjoy 
 shooting people. If you fall into that group, and if you're not a stickler for interesting gameplay, 
 then you might like No Escape. Everyone else should probably avoid it.   

  The first thing you'll notice about No Escape is its unusual graphics. The combat takes place on 
 the surface of a series of small, spherical arenas. Consequently, the entire world and everything 
 in it is sharply curved, so the horizon drops off a short distance in front of you. The effect 
 is both unique and striking, but unfortunately it's the game's only notable feature.   

  As in id Software's popular Quake III: Arena, the single-player game in No Escape is a simple series 
 of ladder matches against computer-controlled enemy bots. You pick one of eight cartoonlike characters 
 and control him or her from a third-person perspective through 18 levels. The rules are a variant 
 of the typical shooter's deathmatch mode. The winner is the contestant with the most money after 
 a certain period of time. Packets of cash are strewn throughout the arena. They can be picked up 
 by running over them, while taking damage causes characters to drop some of the cash they're holding. 
 Killing someone ("knocking them out" in the semantically nonviolent world of No Escape) makes him 
 or her drop a large wad of loot before respawning. Of further note, players who might have been 
 frustrated with the limited save system in shooters such as Aliens vs. Predator will be shocked 
 to learn that there's absolutely no saving permitted in No Escape's single-player game. You start 
 with five lives. You lose one every time you're "knocked out" or fail to place first on a level, 
 and you gain a life for every half a million dollars you grab. When you run out of lives, the game 
 ends.   

  The arsenal in No Escape is a relatively unimaginative mix of conventional shooter weapons. There's 
 the default pea-shooting zapper, a plasma cannon, a rocket launcher, a bazooka, a beam gun, and 
 a couple of types of grenades. These vary in power, but they all share a similar lack of precision. 
 The game provides a targeting reticle, but its movement is sluggish and inaccurate, even after 
 tweaking the mouse sensitivity. The inexact aiming system, combined with the restricted view distance 
 that's a consequence of the closeness of the horizon line, results in a combat system based seemingly 
 more on luck than skill.   

  The levels are all laid out as a series of open areas connected by mazelike trenches. Most of them 
 have only two elevations: ground level and the tops of the trench walls. Although 18 arenas are 
 included, the only major differences between them are the textures applied to the walls, sky, and 
 floors. Virtually every level plays exactly the same.   

  The sheer simplicity of the single-player experience suggests that No Escape was meant to be primarily 
 a multiplayer game. To that end, it appears relatively complete. There are seven game modes, including 
 no escape (the money-collecting deathmatch variant from the single-player mode) , team no escape, 
 knockout match (deathmatch) , team knockout match, tag, capture the flag, and countdown. Countdown 
 is an interesting twist on deathmatch in which a time bomb is strapped to the back of each player. 
 When the bomb's timer reaches zero, it explodes, but you can add time to the counter by shooting 
 other players. A built-in game finder is included with No Escape, but unfortunately, after repeated 
 searches, we found no online servers up and running. On the other hand, the utter absence of other 
 players should make it much easier to rocket your way to number one in the worldwide ranking service 
 Funcom packaged with the game. There's an option to play against bots, but even at the hardest 
 skill level, they tend to be very easy to beat, and they can often be found ignoring important 
 power-ups or simply standing around while you shoot them.   

  There really isn't much reason to recommend No Escape. It simply seems like a cool visual effect 
 in search of a game. Even so, if you could find someone to play it with, the multiplayer mode - 
 and countdown in particular - could offer a few mindless thrills.
