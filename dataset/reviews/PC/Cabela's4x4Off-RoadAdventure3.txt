:::Review:::
Cabela's 4x4 Off-Road Adventure 3 is simply too quirky, too slow-paced, and too repetitious to be 
 enjoyable for most racing fans. 

  If fast cars, intense competition, and thrilling bumper-to-bumper action are your idea of a rollicking 
 good time, Cabela's 4x4 Off-Road Adventure 3 might not be for you. In fact, the game actually penalizes 
 speed. In the tradition of its predecessors, including last year's 4x4 Off-Road Adventure 2, the 
 game requires players to cautiously guide their various 4x4 vehicles over terrain so craggy and 
 unfriendly that they may as well be negotiating the rocky surface of the planet Mars. Yet even 
 though the latest edition of 4x4 Off-Road Adventure makes improvements to the previous game, it 
 is simply too quirky, too slow-paced, and too repetitious to be enjoyable for most racing fans. 
         A broken truck, minus a front wheel, spins its rear tires in a vain attempt to get moving 
 again.     

  The game's general concept is unique and outwardly quite appealing. You take the wheel of one of 
 several 4x4 vehicles and try to conquer a variety of very different driving-related challenges. 
 One moment you're testing your skill over a primitive obstacle course, and the next you're searching 
 for a lost child or helping another driver repair his vehicle. All the while, you're up against 
 a terrain model so challenging that the slightest wrong move could send you hurtling end-over-end 
 down a the face of a cliff or into the nearest body of water. It doesn't take long to see that 
 Off-Road 3 isn't all it's cracked up to be. Despite its seeming variety, the game is really a series 
 of repetitive and completely solo forays that are made difficult by the game's annoyingly brittle 
 vehicles, cumbersome menu system, and occasionally faulty gameplay. At times, playing Off-Road 
 3 can seem more like work than entertainment.  

  The troubles begin when you first load the game and realize you don't know what you're supposed 
 to do. The menu interfaces are pretty enough and far more sophisticated than those of the previous 
 game -- with lots of nifty graphics and a convincing 3D garage environment -- but they provide little 
 instruction. The game's documentation offers plenty of specific on-course details, but it never 
 really walks you through the critical preparation procedures. It's easy to see you have a "drive" 
 option, a "driver's club" option, and several other choices, but you don't why you should select 
 one over another -- in fact, it isn't even clear how to do elementary things like save your game. 

  In 4x4 Off-Road Adventure 3, game designer Clever's Software Development has constructed a gameplay 
 model that is more complex than the one featured in the previous game. The new game offers a series 
 of "quests" that range from simple navigational tests to obstacle courses, checkpoint-to-checkpoint 
 stints, search-and-rescue missions, and even a few instances where you'll exit your truck to walk 
 about and shoot at various targets. Furthermore, each individual environment is linked with the 
 others to form an impressively large world that delivers a real sense of continuity. However, if 
 you simply follow the compass or map indicators to your next goal, you're safe. It doesn't really 
 matter whether you're picking up a hitchhiker or changing someone's flat tire -- the basic mechanics 
 are basically the same. You merely drive from one spot to another, guided by directional indicators, 
 and then wait for the game to give the OK to move on. How you do it and how fast you do it does 
 not seem to matter.  

  The only serious errors you can make while behind the wheel are driving too quickly or not paying 
 enough attention to the road. As mentioned, the game's landscape is downright nasty, filled with 
 harsh bumps, sudden dips, and unimaginably steep grades, so driving carelessly can damage or even 
 upend your realistically fragile vehicle. However, Off-Road 3's physics engine is so frustratingly 
 inconsistent that it sometimes lets you scoot up and over a seemingly impassable grade, but then 
 slams you viciously onto your roof for simply driving too quickly over a bit of bumpy road. Even 
 when driving at a snail's pace, your vehicle will quickly become damaged, so you'll frequently 
 be seeking out the nearest garage to make repairs. The game does offer an impressively intricate 
 garage mode that lets you replace parts, install upgrades, and purchase new vehicles, but you'll 
 visit it far too often.  

  The only way to succeed in Off-Road 3 is to maintain a bare minimum speed and exercise a ridiculous 
 amount of caution when navigating even relatively easy stretches of road. As a result, the game 
 ends up seeming much more like a laborious job than a fun-filled game. And the game's interface 
 makes matters worse: If you end up lodged in cracks and crevices, you'll need to use the "winch 
 me out" command to get yourself out -- but in order to access this option, you'll need to cycle through 
 two menu screens. On missions in which you need to help repair another vehicle, you'll need to 
 deal with a series of tedious mouse clicks, and you'll also have to wait for each damaged part 
 to be repaired. And, for whatever reason, Off-Road 3 displays congratulatory and instructional 
 messages onscreen at various points in the game, causing the game to pause briefly. Often, these 
 messages will appear while you're trying to negotiate a difficult terrain obstacle, throwing off 
 your timing. It also doesn't help that the game doesn't always register successfully completed 
 missions -- sometimes you'll have to approach a certain checkpoint several times at different speeds 
 and from different angles just to move on to the next one.  

          Signs and roadways mark the entrances to new quadrants.     Graphically, Off-Road 3 is 
 miles ahead of its predecessors. The new game has a series of believable environments that feature 
 translucent water, pliable foliage, moveable objects, roaring waterfalls, and soaring eagles. The 
 inevitable degradation of your truck is particularly impressive. In fact, the entire vehicle appears 
 to be transformable, from the top of its roof to its doors, windows, and tires. You'll often find 
 yourself motoring along with a missing door, a cracked or shattered windshield, a crunched bumper 
 or hood, a smoking motor, or a flattened tire.  

  Moreover, the game offers a wealth of visual options and adjustments. Whereas the previous game 
 provided only the most basic modifications, Off-Road 3 lets you specify such detailed minutiae 
 as grass distance and the degree of shadowing. The game's audio is adjustable too, although you'll 
 want to keep these levels as high as possible in order to hear all the excellent audio effects. 
 From the calls of nearby birds and the howls of awakened wolves to the crunch of sand and the rattle 
 of your undercarriage, Off-Road 3's sound is quite impressive.  

  You might find Cabela's 4x4 Off-Road Adventure 3 intriguing if you're looking for extremely slow, 
 methodical exploratory driving and if you have no desire to battle side by side with other drivers. 
 The new game certainly looks and sounds better than its predecessor, but it may not appeal to fans 
 of the high-speed races in more-traditional driving games.

Review:  I go to store, i saw this games, I look at the cover of this game, and see some gameplay picture 
 on back of game. I thought it was cool game, so I buy it then install it on my computer. Then feel 
 exciting to play it, but I relazied that it was very stink game. Handle was just suck. It is fun 
 to search the mission, but it was too hard to handle the truck. Handle was very suck. I turn my 
 wheel BIT, and the truck turn fast and flip. It was too suck games. I high suggest all of you, 
 dont buy this game. Because this is suck game. Thanks.
