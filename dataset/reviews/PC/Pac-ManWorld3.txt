:::Review:::
Pac-Man World 3 is a platformer, characterized most notably by its fusion of classic Pac-Man moments 
 and generic platforming gameplay. 

  Pac-Man World 3 doesn't reinvent the platformer; in fact, in its adoption of so many previously 
 established platformer features, it manages to include some of the genre's most inherent flaws. 
 It does, however, provide an entertaining, fully E-rated experience that's been conspicuously missing 
 as of late. Though it's most notably easy and family-friendly, Pac-Man World 3 has just enough 
 depth to make it more than just a kid's game. But, if the rating or the difficulty level isn't 
 a selling point for you, then there are probably other games that will be more worthwhile.  

           This isn't your Billy Mitchell's Pac-Man.     

  In the 25 years since Pac-Man hit 
 the scene, he's gone from a slightly pixelated, 2D-puzzle star to a fully 3D action platformer. 
 Though the majority of the gameplay consists of the latter, you'll be able to experience 2D and 
 3D versions of classic Pac-Man gameplay in each of Pac-Man World 3's levels. The balance of these 
 three types of gameplay is one of the game's strongest aspects, providing just enough variety that, 
 when combined with an interesting arsenal of pickups, manages to keep the gameplay fresh, despite 
 how easily you can breeze through it.  

  When the story begins, Pac-Man is about to celebrate his 25th birthday, but then he is suddenly 
 teleported out of Pac-village into a mysterious and sinister world. With the aid of reformed-ghost 
 and technical-mastermind Orson, Pac-Man learns that he must stop the doings of the evil Erwin and 
 save the world, again. The story isn't terribly enthralling, although Pac-enthusiasts might be 
 happy to see that Orson has worked out the kinks in his Toc-Man design, enabling more functional 
 (but still not quite fun) mech mechanics. You'll also band together with former nemeses Clyde and 
 Pinky to help rescue Inky and Blinky from Erwin's stranglehold -- so as to, of course, restore the 
 proper order of Pac-Man/ghost interactions. The game, although very light on the cutscenes, does 
 include a fair amount of dialogue to propel the story along. But like the story of the Pac-Man 
 animated series, it will appeal primarily to a younger crowd.  

  In the distorted world that Pac-Man is forced to explore, he'll encounter a number of Erwin's grunts, 
 though they can usually be defeated by Pac-Man's two default attacks. He can either punch at his 
 enemies or butt-bounce on them, and it's usually clear by the location of the enemy's armor which 
 method is required. If the two basic attacks aren't enough, there are special power pills located 
 throughout the game, and they'll do things such as infuse Pac-Man with special butt-bounce oomph, 
 replace his punch with an electrical shock (which is particularly effective against mechanical 
 enemies) , or trail a deadly ribbon behind him. Since these generic fights aren't overused, and 
 since the new pellets are kind of interesting, the basic level of combat makes for a nice diversion 
 from the platforming aspects of the gameplay.  

  The platforming in Pac-Man World 3 borrows heavily from the pioneers of 3D platformers, and unfortunately 
 as a result, some of the genre's greatest pitfalls accompany it. This is particularly problematic 
 on the PC, which has never been a safe haven for platformers. Most notably, there are some pretty 
 dramatic frame rate problems in the larger, more heavily animated levels, and the camera, although 
 fairly maneuverable, can get stuck behind world objects or flip around wildly at the most inopportune 
 moments. Furthermore, the control input is awkward with the default keyboard, and only marginally 
 better if you have a PC gamepad. But you're unable to remap the keys, which unfortunately removes 
 any possibility of you making the best of the dire control situation. The visual presentation is 
 slightly better than that on the console versions of the game. The levels are distinct looking 
 and surprisingly unique, given the game's other major pitfall. For the most part, the maneuvering 
 lacks originality (at least from other games in the genre) , and almost everything you do is derivative. 
 Your major abilities include wall-jumping in enclosed areas, rev-rolling (or morph-balling, if 
 you will) up and down ramps, bouncing off trampolines, and butt-bouncing on switches placed randomly 
 throughout the levels. Whether you're shimmying across a ledge, sliding down a pole, or climbing 
 up a fence, you'll get the very distinct feeling that you've done it all before. You'll break open 
 boxes in search of collectible objects such as fruits, health wedges, and extra lives. Once per 
 level, you'll find a galaxian pickup, which will warp you to a classic 2D Pac-Man maze that is, 
 ironically enough, one of the most original things about the game.  

           The platforming gameplay is simultaneously classic and derivative.     

  Still, there 
 are some aspects of gameplay that are uniquely Pac-Man, one being the ability to use the ghosts, 
 Pinky and Clyde. At certain designated stations, you can switch control over to the ghosts, whose 
 seeing ability in the spectral world allows them to locate hidden platforms and knock over barriers 
 that Pac-Man alone wouldn't be able to. There's also a matter of the 3D Pac-Man puzzles in which 
 Pac-Man must fight against spectral monsters by chomping on classic power pills, which, while he's 
 under their effect, allow him to eat the monsters. These moments are enhanced by the classic arcade 
 game's sound effects, whose use throughout the game truly taps into the nostalgia cortex. Aside 
 from voice acting, which is mostly hindered by the script, the sound in the game is quite good. 
 Enemies have distinct sounds, and you'll be treated to classic sound effects whenever possible. 

  Given that so many recent platformers have departed from a focus on maneuvering and jumping between 
 actual platforms, Pac-Man World 3 is a refreshing reminder of this type of gameplay. Unfortunately, 
 given that it has been poorly converted to the PC, you will probably spend a good deal of time 
 fighting with the controls and camera when you should be fighting enemies and platform puzzles 
 instead. As a complete package, Pac-Man World 3 will be very appealing for younger gamers who are 
 bound by the E (not even E10+) rating. Despite how easy it is, there are enough hidden pickups 
 and collectibles to provide a fair amount of depth, but not enough to satisfy people looking for 
 more interesting or challenging endeavors.
