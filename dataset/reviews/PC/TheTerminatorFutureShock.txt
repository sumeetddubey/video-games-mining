:::Review:::
Even if you have somehow avoided the hulking mass of first person shooters until now, you should 
 consider checking out Terminator for its variety of play styles and its overall quality. 

 To make a video game that continues the tradition of the hard-hitting, multi-million dollar Terminator 
 movie series, you have to combine engaging action with mind-altering special effects, gratuitous 
 violence, and a solid storyline. Bethesda Softworks pulls together all of these elements and spits 
 a few more in your face in Terminator: Future Shock.  

 Terminator: Future Shock is a TRUE 3-D shooter that combines three types of action: walking, driving, 
 and flying. Of course, in every scenario your main objective is to blow away hordes of mechanized 
 horrors. The post-apocalyptic world you explore is filled with fires, half-buried cars, and incredibly 
 detailed robotic enemies, including the dreaded Terminators. The game world itself is well thought-out; 
 you can enter nearly every building to search for weapons, ammo, and med canisters as the familiar 
 adrenaline-pumping Terminator soundtrack echoes in the background. As you face off against this 
 army of the future you'll access an arsenal of weapons ranging from Uzis, plasma rifles, and grenades 
 to the always satisfying shotgun.   

 The graphics, music, and sound effects are superb. You can hear Raptors (one of the most prevalent 
 types of robot) sneaking up in packs behind you. The creepy image of a Spiderbot prancing your 
 way should be enough to shake up even a veteran action fan.  

 Looks aside, the real beauty of Terminator: Future Shock is its smooth control system. Using a keyboard/mouse 
 combination, you move quickly and aim accurately as you navigate through Los Angeles. In the driving 
 and flying modes, you're even able to travel in one direction and shoot in another, a feature that 
 comes in very handy when you're running away.  

 Terminator: Future Shock is a game that should not be missed. Even if you've somehow avoided the 
 hulking mass of first person shooters until now, you should consider checking out this title for 
 its variety of play styles and its overall quality. Cover me, I'll be in here for a long, long 
 time.
