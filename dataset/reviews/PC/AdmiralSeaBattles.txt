:::Review:::
Deadly slow pacing, overly difficult missions, no individual scenarios, mystifying approaches to 
 victory, and frankly, lean gameplay make this one a non-starter. 

 At first glance Admiral Sea Battles is one of those games that make you think, "Hmm, maybe they 
 got it right!" It has handsome graphics, a good interface, a diverse mix of ships, and great cut 
 scenes. But after a few hours of frustrating play, it becomes clear that ASB can't sustain these 
 favorable first impressions.  

 Admiral Sea Battles is a game of naval warfare in the great Age of Sail, when fleets of wooden ships 
 bristling with cannon vied for control of the world's oceans - the key to any empire - and fought 
 to suppress bands of pirates. It's a swashbuckling era that holds a lot of appeal and is rich in 
 gameplay potential. We've seen it portrayed successfully before, in games as diverse as Pirates!, 
 Sun Tzu's Ancient Art of War, and even Avalon Hill's Wooden Ships and Iron Men (well, kind of) . 

 ASB starts out well. There's a choice of three different campaigns for a total of 18 missions, as 
 well as head-to-head play over LAN or the Internet. Game graphics are good if not extraordinary, 
 and the side-panel interface buttons are simple and easy to use. You start a campaign with a set 
 mission - for example: Move to the northeast and build a fort in a certain area, sweep the seas 
 of the enemy, or (more frequently) build ports. To accomplish these missions, you will have to 
 buy different kinds of warships, from small, shallow-draft brigs up to massive battleships. Some 
 are fast and light, others powerful and heavy. Only a fixed number of ships will be available in 
 the course of the campaign, so you'll have to protect them and use them wisely. The rules for setting 
 up your fleet are poorly explained and somewhat cumbersome, but just assume that you need a lot 
 of ships.  

 The problems begin when you start playing (and endlessly REplaying) the missions themselves. The 
 game has a very flat, static, boardgame feel to it - not necessarily a failing if gameplay is done 
 right. You must move your warships across the maps, protecting smaller ships needed for mission 
 completion (such the transports needed for building a fort) . Ships move slowly, and are apt to 
 be blown back across the board by sudden storms. Eventually, you'll run across enemy ships and 
 coastal forts, and then have an option to fire a broadside. If you come up next to an enemy ship, 
 you can send a boarding party over to fight for control of the ship.  

 All this unfolds at a painfully slow pace. When you finally do get down to firing on an enemy, it's 
 rather underwhelming: Click a button and fire. Repeat until you or enemy are destroyed. Period. 
 Boarding parties are the same: You click, the men board, and they fight it out with results that 
 are pretty much predetermined by the size of the party. Missions are incredibly difficult to complete 
 successfully, and there doesn't seem to be any applicable strategy.   

 In a good combat game, you can use your knowledge of history and the properties of the available 
 units to form a cohesive strategy. In ASB, however, there is no real room for strategy. Instead, 
 each mission is like a puzzle with only one answer, which you can find only by playing the mission 
 repeatedly, using trial and error, and not through brilliant admiraling.   

 Deadly slow pacing, overly difficult missions, no individual scenarios (you must play campaigns) , 
 mystifying approaches to victory, and frankly, lean gameplay (you do little more than click to 
 move and click to fire) make this one a non-starter. Wait for Ship of the Line.
