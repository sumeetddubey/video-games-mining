:::Review:::
Corralling livestock is a fun new way to solve puzzles, but some agitating quirks will push the 
 impatient away. 

  You can diminish almost any game to a laughably low level by reducing it to its bare essentials: 
 Harvest Moon's focus is manual labor, Brain Age is portable homework, and Animal Crossing is about 
 paying rent. These games defy their lame concepts and successfully maintain an interested fan. 
 Similarly, while herding livestock may sound like a thankless chore, Flock's delightful style and 
 brilliant puzzles will charm and engage folks willing to game outside the box.  

           Flock is ridiculously cute and cuddly.      

  As a colorful flying saucer, your job 
 is to corral hordes of lovable livestock to the suspiciously named Motherflocker, a towering UFO 
 that does who-knows-what to the collected creatures. Each of the wee beasts reacts differently 
 to your hovering menace, but Flock does a solid job of teaching you their properties as you progress. 
 The easily spooked sheep do their best to keep away from you; cattle will knock over fences in 
 a stampede if you follow too closely; chickens can glide across gaps but are reckless and unpredictable; 
 and the roly-poly pigs frequently stop to roll in piles of impassable poop (yes, really) . Their 
 qualities are simplistic, but nothing in Flock is as straightforward as it seems.  

  Navigating your herd across Flock's 55 single-player stages in a quick and orderly fashion earns 
 you medals. But each of the brief brainteasers has a hook, trick, or secret to be uncovered in 
 order for you to achieve a perfect abduction score. One level in the latter half of Flock can be 
 completed in 10 seconds flat, earning you a shiny gold prize, but perfecting it requires you to 
 herd the massive number of extra animals that are isolated on a half-dozen islands. Another puzzle 
 requires you to scare off nighttime predators with illuminated objects, but running the gauntlet 
 and rushing your flock to the mothership without doing so can save substantial time. Rallying a 
 group of animals together creates a flock, and huge herds yield massive multipliers, adding a coating 
 of strategy. Yes, Flock is accessible, but succeeding requires a bit of brain-scratching.  

  Thankfully, Flock does a good job of training you one step at a time. You'll gradually learn 
 new gameplay mechanics that keep everything feeling fresh. Just when you've figured out how to 
 knock obstacles down, you'll start launching animals over them. When you're used to shrinking woolly 
 beasts with water, allowing them to pass beneath fences, you'll have to force them to blindly follow 
 a female. You'll also learn to plug holes with hay bales, crush fields to create crop circles, 
 and build bridges to avoid dangerous, unguarded cliffs. These nuances periodically come together 
 in a sort of final exam stage that implements everything you've learned to that point, forcing 
 you to efficiently use your abilities together to solve an especially challenging area. It's a 
 satisfying buildup, and you'll have a sense of fulfillment when you complete a milestone stage. 

  This pace keeps up throughout. Flock consistently rewards you with well-built puzzles with cleverly 
 plotted paths, as well as tangible items for use within the level editor. Ideas for levels will 
 constantly flow from you as you advance through Flock's solo mode, but properly implementing them 
 into a map, which you can upload and share with others, is a taxing process. Adapting to building 
 on three vertical planes, each complete with its own identifying color and grid lines, takes patience. 
 But the payoff is proportional for those willing to put up with the learning process and clunky 
 controls. Combining perilous pitfalls, piles of poop, and pinball bumpers in a way that rivals 
 the developer's puzzles will require an understanding of how the game's physics work as well as 
 what makes a level fun to play. Don't be surprised if you invest an hour into a massive stage full 
 of failed ideas before buckling down to create a puzzle with substance. It's an unnecessarily unwieldy 
 addition that nonetheless holds a lot of potential.  

           If a chicken gets this close to the edge, it's already dead.      

  Unwieldy editor 
 controls aren't the only thing that can get under your skin in Flock. For instance, like designing 
 a level, learning the creatures' behavior requires patience. Frustratingly, the occasionally unpredictable 
 animals can occasionally be seen inexplicably jumping to their watery death, getting hung up on 
 obstacles, or ending up stuck in corners. Losing track of your herd or watching it die unfairly 
 results in some seriously annoying situations when your fast track to a gold medal comes to a grinding 
 halt. You'll also endure repetitious music and chirping animal noises, so keep your personal playlist 
 and a pair of headphones close by when you're repeatedly retrying flubbed abductions.  

  Surprisingly, the cooperative mode is the least appealing part of Flock. There's no online support, 
 so you're stuck sharing a screen with your partner in a local multiplayer mode that, even overlooking 
 that, simply doesn't live up to the standards set by the single-player game. Cooperatively moving 
 rocks and lifting gates on maps specifically designed for co-op doesn't compare to the intelligent 
 level design and challenging requirements you'll experience elsewhere in Flock, and the regular 
 levels are needlessly off-limits to partnered players. The entire addition of co-op feels tacked 
 on, and is barely worth the 30 minutes it takes to complete.  

  Flock's single-player puzzles are fun while they last, but around three hours after your first 
 successful abduction you'll almost certainly be finished. That lack of solo longevity, along with 
 the limited multiplayer mode and unwieldy level editor unfortunately make this quirky and entertaining 
 puzzler a tough sell at $15.
