:::Review:::
Originating from a small programming team in Russia, Chasm: The Rift is a standard 3D shooter that 
 falls technologically in between Doom and Quake - and scarily enough, isn't that bad. 

 With the industry up to its neck in 3Dfx-enhanced, Pentium-required 3D shooters, it's not that big 
 a shock that a value-priced software company would take aim at 486 users with a lower-ended Quake-alike. 
 Originating from a small programming team in Russia, Chasm: The Rift is a standard 3D shooter that 
 falls technologically in between Doom and Quake - and scarily enough, isn't that bad.  

 You've heard the story before: another dimension has opened up, and nasty mutated critters have 
 bounced through to wreak havoc, steal beer, and be a general nuisance. Enter You, the Faceless 
 Soldier, who must clean up those nasties, close the rift, and restore order. You accomplish this 
 by battling through a multitude of mazes, picking up bigger weapons, and throwing switches to open 
 doors in the standard Doom fare.  

 Chasm's engine isn't the latest or greatest, and the gameplay is solid but ultimately derivative. 
 A handful of small touches boost the atmospheric content - the rain effect in the outdoor environments 
 is pretty spiffy, and you can blow out windows and destroy light sources, which darkens the surrounding 
 environment. Levels are spread out over military bases, alien installations, and Egyptian pyramids, 
 and each mission begins with a briefing from your superiors, who look like polygonal versions of 
 the "talking heads" from the Wing Commander games.  

 But the stars of the show are the monsters, which actually have a higher level of detail than the 
 ones in Quake. In the first few levels of Chasm, you'll run up against gas-masked Nazi-esque stormtroopers 
 who come in all shapes and sizes, and best of all, you can actually blast off their limbs. One 
 or two well-placed shotgun blasts will remove a random appendage - but instead of dropping dead 
 and bleeding to death, the enemy keeps coming at you with whatever's left. Unfortunately, one limb 
 is all you're allowed to take off - you can't pull a Monty Python and leave your armless opponent 
 hopping on one leg. Pity. While you have a full arsenal to wage your war with, most of the weapons 
 seem like they were ripped right out of Terminator: Future Shock. Aside from the rapid disc launcher, 
 the selection is pretty dull.  

 Since Chasm was obviously optimized for slower systems, there are some very visible restraints on 
 the engine, limiting the "true 3D" environment. It's impossible to look straight up or down as 
 in Quake, so taking aim at shorter bad guys can be a bit of a chore. There's no support for any 
 type of 3D acceleration, and deathmatching over the Internet is limited to Kali and Mplayer. And 
 even though the level design works well within the confines of the engine, you still get the sensation 
 of playing yesterday's game.  

 In the long run, Chasm is another cookie-cutter 3D shooter, but it might be of value to 486 users 
 or other gamers with a few bucks to spend before Quake II comes out. Most gamers will feel Chasm 
 is a case of been there, done that - but if you've been lagging behind on the hardware upgrade 
 front, this might be a worthwhile chance to play something that feels more like what you're missing.

Review:  Chasm: The Rift plays like any other FPS run and gun game around it's time you go around and shoot 
 anything that moves while going to a point to finish a level. The game's weapon selection feels 
 rather uninspired, the only innovative weapon in the game would have to be the Blade Gun that shoots 
 out discs in a high rate of fire. The game did have one awesome feature that stands out from any 
 other FPS, you can shoot off an enemy's limbs which is not only useful for disarming enemies, it's 
 a lot of fun and barely any games have this feature. Another great element of the game are the 
 graphics, released in 1997 the graphics are truly something to behold despite the fact that the 
 game is designed to run on older computers. The sound feature of the game is also good, weapons 
 sounds like they should be, monsters sound creepy, and the soundtrack just adds to the detailed 
 atmosphere, the only drawback would be the that the voice acting is a bit off but still passable. 
 Despite these great features Chasm: The Rift's gameplay suffers from confusing level design and 
 broken multiplayer.
  
  Multiplayer may sound on a game like this one but the deathmatch levels suffer from so many bugs 
 and glitches along with dull and boring gameplay.
  
  Just to make matters worst, re-play value in Chasm: The Rift is scarce due to a short length of 
 16 single-player levels added to the frustrating level design.
  
  If you plan to pick up this game for the multiplayer feature your better off with Quake. Overall 
 The game is decent but only worth a rent.

Review:  Its telling that every time I try to recall a specific level or area from Chasm, I think of one 
 of my favorite encounters from the original Quake. Chasm played like a decent true-3D shooter (like 
 Quake) constructed on top of an older 2.5D engine (like Duke) . The ability to look freely in any 
 direction was limited and the talking-head cutscenes were static and poorly written, but the action 
 found in the game itself was on the exact same level as ids early masterpiece.
  
  Try as I might, Chasm does not work on my XP-driven P4 rig. I still have a copy of the game installed 
 on my old Pentium 2 and played it briefly this past fall. At the risk of repeating myself, Ill 
 say again: Chasm is like taking a turn on a particularly good total conversion of Quake, one which 
 allows for such low-poly-count delights as detachable limbs and some nicely differentiated weaponry. 
 Armor, power-ups, and small groups of minimally-detailed but well-designed monsters tend to pop 
 out from behind sliding walls. Chasms damage model is appreciably tough on the hard setting, but 
 I was never desperately short on ammo. All of the above characteristics should be familiar to anyone 
 who traversed Quakes dark and grotty realms.
  
  There is nothing wrong with designing a me-too product that replicates all of the better parts 
 of a big, well-known title. After all, Shadow Warrior, Redneck Rampage, and even Blood were just 
 variations of Duke 3D. They all used the Build engine, of course, but they also contained many 
 of the same features and combat scenarios. Although Chasm doesnt use the same engine as its seminal 
 cousin, it feels so much like Quake that my own memory often cant tell them apart. Anyone who 
 can still find a working copy of Action Forms competent first endeavor might do well to give Chasm 
 a try.

Review:  Best described as a Quake clone, Chasm also features dark 3D environments like abandoned military 
 bases with a plethora of strange enemies to combat. However, although the demo promised this one 
 to be a contender it quickly went downhill when playing the full game. Level design was confusing 
 and frustrating. The action was ok, with the added bonus of shooting limbs off of the enemies, 
 but it would often get stalled while you got stuck looking for some tiny switch somewhere in a 
 corner of the map.
  
  There were some good moments in Chasm, but on the whole the game could have used more polishing 
 and some more interesting levels to play. As it stands, it is an interesting historical effort 
 from a small time Eastern European developer, but not much more.
