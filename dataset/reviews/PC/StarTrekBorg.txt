:::Review:::
Borg is infuriating not only because of the lousy gameplay, but also because ofthe potential of 
 this absolutely lame FMV-fest. 

 In Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive's Star Trek: Borg, you're a green Starfleet Academy cadet, logging 
 training hours aboard a Federation starship... and haunted by the memory of your father's death, 
 at the hands of the Borg at the battle of Wolf 359. When the dreaded Borg suddenly show up on a 
 beeline course for mother Terra, your ship is selected to join the battlegroup which will engage 
 them, and all trainee personnel are ordered to evacuate. The Borg are a nasty, formidable enemy, 
 and Starfleet Command doesn't need any new fish wet-ends like you panicking at the wrong moment 
 in a battle where every action and second counts. The fact that you have reason to want to stay 
 and fight - the fact that your father was killed at the Wolf 359 massacre, aboard the ill-fated 
 USS Righteous - means jack-all to the high command. You can leave and like it... or you can just 
 leave.  

 As you bitterly pack your meager cadet's belongings, the infamous alien entity known as "Q" (played 
 by John DeLancie) appears in your stateroom and offers you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: With 
 his help, you can travel back in time to the bridge of the Righteous, moments before the ship was 
 lost, and wreak a little vengeance. And maybe - just maybe - save him and change the future for 
 yourself and for everyone else. Borg has it all: time travel; the smarmy, omnipotent Q; the scariest 
 alien race ever to populate the Star Trek universe; and an angry, orphaned cadet's passionate (and 
 very un-Federation) wish for brutal retribution. It's a promising broth very difficult to spoil. 

 Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive evidently has many, many cooks at its disposal.  

 Borg is that most dubious of game prospects - an "interactive movie." Initially whisked aboard the 
 bridge of the Righteous as a Christmas Carol-esque presence nobody can hear or see, you are witness 
 (via full-screen video) to what may be the final moments of the ship (and your father) all over 
 again - and then you are given the opportunity to directly interact with the past as the Borg invade 
 the ship and attempt to drop the shields of the Righteous. At various times during the continuously 
 playing movie that is 99% of the game, the player is given the option to solve puzzles, attack, 
 or analyze people, objects, or Borg (which are, strictly, neither) with a modified tricorder provided 
 by Q. Virtually every decision point in the game, if not every decision point, is a try-and-die 
 affair, resulting in a short cut-movie with a rawthuh disappointed Q telling you what a moron you 
 are, or giving you a condescendingly patient (and, I must admit, rather insultingly cool) primer 
 on how to use the mouse on your computer.   

 Borg is infuriating not only because of the lousy (indeed, almost nonexistent) gameplay, but also 
 because of the obvious tremendous expense and potential of this absolutely lame FMV-fest. The talent 
 involved could have gone to good use, somewhere. As the irritating, haughty (and ever-so-slightly 
 swishy) Q, John DeLancie gives a superb performance that's wasted here. (In one spectacular, skin-crawling 
 death-sequence, he stares at a Defense Systems panel, his eyes wide, shouting, "THE BORG ARE FIRING, 
 WE'RE GONNA DIE!" Then - all the mock terror dropping from his face in an instant - he leers knowingly 
 toward the camera and, with a horrible grin, whispers, "And it's your fault," as the ship and your 
 father get blown to bits around him.) Ditto the dialogue and story elements - all fine in themselves, 
 wrapped up in a quick-pick-a-path mess with the budget of a motion picture and the gameplay of... 
 well, a motion picture.  

 (And despite my usual stance on this sort of thing, I don't even feel bad about blowing any plot 
 points or particular surprises. I figure I'll just end up saving you the trouble of buying this 
 dog.)  

 A few words to Trek enthusiasts: No matter how many times some game company out there does something 
 like this to you, just close your eyes and keep repeating to yourself: Interplay's Starfleet Academy 
 is coming. Starfleet Academy is coming....

Review:  I admit, I'm a bit of a Star Trek fan. I'm a huge fan of The Next Generation and Enterprise, but 
 the rest I don't like so much. This game came out around the Next Generation Days, so needless 
 to say, I was hyped. So, enough of the prologue, let me tell you where the problems start ...
 
  
  As a young teenager, I was excited to receive this Star Trek: Borg game. A bit let down that there 
 were no actual starring cast members in the game, but satisfied that John De Lancie would be playing 
 his role as "Q", I begin to install the game - there's where the problems begin. First try around, 
 it wasn't reading one of the discs correctly, so the installation wouldnt finish. Persistent as 
 I was, I restarted several times and tried about a dozen times. Finally the game would conclude 
 it's installation process. It's all good, right? I'm going to play the game and have a happy ending 
 ... ya? That is entirely incorrect. The game suffered from some crashing problems during certain 
 cutscenes. See, the game isnt really a game, it's more of a movie. The movie plays, pauses, and 
 then poses a question, and presents you with a number of courses of action for you to choose from. 
 Unfortunately, there is no way to use logic to arrive at the proper conclusion. It's more of a 
 guessing game. guess right, and you move on; guess wrong, and you die and have to start again. 
 
  
  Apparently about 50% of people who owned this game had installation and crashing issues. I recall 
 a patch being released, so eager to downlaod and install the patch to continue playing this game 
 and hopefully have a better experience, I get the patch. As installation progress, the patching 
 process warns me I dont have the right language version of the game to be patching. See, I did 
 indeed get the right patch. Even tech support said so. 
  
  I abandoned all hope for this game. Somewhere down the line maybe 6 months or so, I buy a few new 
 parts for my computer, so I do a format and installation of the new parts. New operating system, 
 half the computer is new including a new cd drive, why not try again? I'm a sucker and I can admit 
 it. The game installs fine. The patch installs fine this time. Only this time, I play the game 
 all the way through. Problem? It sucked so bad it was hardly worth the effort. Other than the sometimes 
 humourous acting of John De Lancie, I was thoroughly let down by this game.
  
  If you are considering finding this game and trying it. Pay for the postage and I'll send you mind. 
 I highly recommend you look into Starfleet Academy instead if you havent yet played it. FAR better. 
 Do no play this game.
