The bottom line is that you won't find anything extremely tantalizing about Sanctum, but it does 
 offer some fun gameplay at a more than reasonable price. 

 It was only five short years ago that Richard Garfield designed the first collectible card game, 
 Magic: The Gathering. The success of that franchise spawned a horde of play-alikes. In light of 
 this popularity, it's surprising that collectible card games are just now beginning to become available 
 online. The first of these online-only versions was Chron X, a collectible virtual card game set 
 in a dark future. This past summer saw the release of Sanctum, a game with plenty of the right 
 moves but still lacking much of the accessibility of the tabletop versions.  

 The game system revolves around constructing decks, with a minimum of 30 cards, from a randomized 
 selection of spells. The number of spells at your disposal is dependent on how many booster packs 
 of cards have been purchased. The game's 228 individual spells provide a broad range of abilities 
 for you to choose from and are categorized into 12 houses of magic representing different philosophies 
 of spell usage. For example, the house of War spells affect your warriors' combat abilities. The 
 house of Mind, on the other hand, uses the powers of manipulation to disrupt your opponent's strategies. 

 Once decks are constructed, you find opponents on Digital Addiction's online chat forum. The games 
 begin with each player controlling a fortress (the titular Sanctum) on opposite sides of a randomly 
 generated board, made up of terrain squares that include towns, plains, forests, mountains, and 
 water. You then send out your minions to take control of towns and do battle against the opposing 
 forces towards the ultimate goal of taking the enemy's Sanctum.  

 On a basic level, the game plays much like Heroes of Might and Magic. You take turns casting spells 
 and moving troops across a board. The major difference is that once decisions are made for the 
 turn, actions take place simultaneously with an initiative system deciding whose units act first. 
 Of course, the other major difference is that you have a random hand of cards that determines your 
 available spells. While all this works very well and is indeed very enjoyable to play, there are 
 still some important elements lacking, reducing Sanctum to "just another good card game."  

 With many card games, it is necessary to play a few games against a seasoned opponent who's friendly 
 enough to show you the ropes and point out some strategies. Unless you have some friends who have 
 already begun playing the game, with Sanctum you're pretty much fending for yourself online. Sanctum's 
 biggest rival, Chron X, actually has a trainer AI, which will play some trial games against you 
 before you venture out to challenge others. Strategy in Sanctum can easily overwhelm new players, 
 and the lack of a training feature really hurts anyone unfamiliar with card games.  

 The other main disappointment is the lack of multiplayer games for more than two players. This is 
 one feature that could have made some big points for Sanctum seeing as how no other collectible 
 card game on the PC has this. Seasoned Magic players will tell you that when more than two players 
 get involved in a game, the gameplay moves to a different, sometimes political, level. The fact 
 that Sanctum forges no new ground on this front also weakens its ability to impress fans who already 
 have enough trouble keeping up with other games.  

 But, if you're a gamer on a budget, the main lure for Sanctum is the price. For the price of a regular 
 computer game, Digital Addiction offers you 40 booster packs, which adds up to 600 cards in all. 
 For the price, this is an amazing value, especially when the same number of booster packs (with 
 the same number of cards) for Magic: The Gathering will run $120.  

 The bottom line is that you won't find anything extremely tantalizing about Sanctum, but it does 
 offer some fun gameplay at a more than reasonable price. If you're new to card games and would 
 rather try a bargain version before heading to the store to buy a tabletop card game, Sanctum is 
 definitely a good option. However, if you're already knee-deep in collectible card games, you might 
 try sticking to those before taking the average offerings online.
