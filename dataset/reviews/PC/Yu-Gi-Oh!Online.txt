:::Review:::
Yu-Gi-Oh! Online does just enough to please the devoted Yu-Gi-Oh! fans that are already out there, 
 but not much more. 

  Yu-Gi-Oh! Online is basically the best thing that Konami has done with Kazuki Takahashi's dangerously 
 popular, tween-focused franchise since it started cranking out lo-fi Yu-Gi-Oh! games some six years 
 ago. The ability to play the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game against other Yu-Gi-Oh! enthusiasts over the Internet 
 is the only thing that separates this game from the seemingly hundreds of thousands of Yu-Gi-Oh! 
 card-battling games released before. For established Yu-Gi-Oh! fans, whom this game was tailored 
 almost exclusively for, it will be enough.  

          Yu-Gi-Oh! Online is... well, Yu-Gi-Oh!, with online play.     

  Yu-Gi-Oh! Online is 
 not a terribly inclusive game. It makes a lot of assumptions about your familiarity with not just 
 the overall card-battling philosophy, but also with the mechanical minutiae of the Yu-Gi-Oh! card 
 game, and the smattering of in-game assistance is largely limited to helping you navigate the interface. 
 There is some online explanation of how the game is played, but this quasitutorial comes off as 
 dense and convoluted. If you don't know how to play Yu-Gi-Oh!, but you at least have experience 
 with another collectible card game, you can reasonably assume that you'll pick up the specifics 
 as you go. However, if you have no collectible card game experience whatsoever, you're better off 
 picking up one of the older, offline Yu-Gi-Oh! card games on the cheap, as the competition is downright 
 merciless online, and the suspicious pricing model doesn't really encourage trial by fire.  

  But if you already know what's up, Yu-Gi-Oh! Online makes it easy for you to quickly jump into 
 a game. When you first create your account, you're given a random deck of 40 cards and then you're 
 dumped into a lobby, where you can either directly challenge another player, or just let the game 
 match you up with another player. You will be matched up with other players of the same level, 
 but since those level designations are inexplicably reset at the beginning of each month, it stands 
 to reason that you're most likely going to face a more evenly matched player at the end of the 
 month than at the beginning.  

  The game doesn't really bother with too many interface flourishes, and as such, it ends up looking 
 kind of lean, with more of a focus on functionality. The usual faux-Egyptian flavor that Yu-Gi-Oh! 
 has been peddling for nearly a decade now is present and accounted for, and the melodramatic orchestral 
 music that's peppered with some vaguely Middle Eastern instrumentation generally complements the 
 look, though the music does get repetitive quickly. Even by the relatively modest standards of 
 other card-battling games, the visuals in Yu-Gi-Oh! Online come off as stripped down.  

  The duel interface itself is pretty standard Yu-Gi-Oh! fare, but there are some odd quirks to other 
 parts of the interface. Every time you load up the game, it requires you to agree to the Terms 
 of Service, log in with your username and password, select the specific player account you'll be 
 using, select which language-defined region you'd like to play in, and then it has you choose your 
 lobby. It's not really a lengthy or arduous process, but it's something that could've been easily 
 streamlined. Similarly, there is an in-game chat function, as well as one for the lobbies, but 
 the implementation is clunky when you're actually dueling. Any time you want to chat, you have 
 to pull up a chat window that obscures the actual game. And when you don't have the chat window 
 open, the only indication you have that the other player has typed anything is a tiny, easily missed 
 flashing light in the upper right-hand corner. Also, the language filter seems to have been implemented 
 by either a crazy person or someone who is extremely paranoid. Most genuinely offensive language 
 is easily filtered out, but so are more innocuous words like "dumb, "or in the most mind-boggling 
 case, "Japan."  

          The gameplay is exactly what fans have come to expect from Yu-Gi-Oh! games over the years, 
 but some interface and pricing issues hinder the package.     

  But the pricing structure in Yu-Gi-Oh! Online is probably the biggest quirk. Instead of just paying 
 an up-front fee, or suffering a recurring monthly fee, Yu-Gi-Oh! Online basically splits the difference. 
 The software itself will run you around $10, and it comes with a 10-point "duelpass." Each of these 
 points represents a single duel you can play against someone else. So after you play through your 
 first 10 duels, you'll need to pony up for another duelpass. As of this writing, you can get a 
 150-point duelpass for about $15, making it about a dime per duel. When you do the math, the price 
 to play Yu-Gi-Oh! Online isn't totally unreasonable, but it doesn't seem terribly beneficial to 
 players looking to go for the long haul, and the mere idea of having to pay for each duel you go 
 into just makes it feel like you're being scammed.  

  The game comes with a host of caveats, not the least of which includes a gameplay model that's 
 not terribly inviting to beginners, as well as an unconventional pricing model. However, by nailing 
 the core mechanics of the card game and marrying them with a functional online component, Yu-Gi-Oh! 
 Online does just enough to please the devoted Yu-Gi-Oh! fans that are already out there, but not 
 much more.

Review:  this is the only game that to describe it would take an entire book of about 300 pages (small letters.) i 
 like this game because it has a nice front part. so many Yu-Gi-Oh games, but this one is worth the 
 try. if i tell you what the game has really it will be considered spoilers so buy it first then 
 it is not a spoiler. nice gameplay, it feels as if you were actually inside the game. ( that is what 
 i felt.) the game actually is a master piece, that is what i think. when i saw it the fist time i 
 thought, i have to play it. i can tell you that it must have more than 2000 cards by now. this game 
 may be good but not perfect. it has tiny details which i did not like.
  
  almost all games of Yu-Gi-Oh are worth the try but if this is the first time to buy one of the 
 games, i recommend you to buy this one first then you can find the others.

Review:  I' ve playd a lot but the thing is that theyr are a lot of scammers!! They say they trade DuelPoints (DP) 
 for cards, if u give them the cards they log out !!!
  and theres the gm scaming high lvl players say they are gms and if u would like to work for konami 
 they ask about your password and account name, if u give them the pass and acc they'll say that 
 u must log out and log on in 30 min or so, by that time they've changed your pass and stold your 
 acc!!
  
  Inspite of the scaming its a nice game ,to bad theyr are a lot of cards baned like Pot of Greed, Change 
 of Heart ......
  
  inspite of all that its the best game in its series!!
  
  Have funn and dont let yourself be scammed!!!

Review:  This is a great little game I found hidden in the bargain bin of GAME. Like any other mmorpg you 
 are only as good as your gear, which is your cards, and the hugest criticism of this game is the 
 costs but theyre not as bad as you think - Ive played it all day and its cost me $1 at worst. The 
 game has a huge item base on ebay for trading cards and the actual game is extremely addictive. 
 The client is as good as it needs to be for a card game, no frills - simple music and some lag 
 issues but nothing worth quitting over. It takes a while to get into but the free practice servers 
 are up for most of the day and you get 10 free turns as a free trial if you visit yugioh-online. net 
 (client download availible) . Theres more than enough people on and it (in the western world, not 
 just japan) and Im loving it at the moment. A must-try game for people into collectables and skill 
 based games like poker.

Review:  you can win twice to complete the match duel ,hence 2 duel pass points is cost, but if you lose 
 1 duel in this match duel you still pay that 1 pass point- 1win/1point/1loss/1point/1more win-yup -- 1more 
 piont. So you can eat up the points very quickly. when down to few or zero points you will need 
 to but another $10 box of yugi online for the 90 duels or buy them online useing your credit card (good 
 for adults not children) to buy a $15. duel pass. Do the math and you will see that someone might 
 be getting rich off this -- maybe???!!??. So every duel -win or loss cost a duel point. Duel as much 
 as 500 times is like shelling out $50. You can see that some people dueled tens of thousands of 
 timesBut I ask as a player and duelist who made many friends across the states and across the globe,, is 
 it worth it. I guess you have to just judge for yourself until things change or they bring out something 
 better.. O. K. my fellow duelist' STAY FROSTY!!

Review:  YU-GI-OH! Online for the Pc Is all in all a pretty good Idea. But just an Idea. After all it's cheap 
 enough in price ,$10.-Right??- Nope.$10. is just the begining for your basic 1 box with yugis' 
 face on it and 1 downloadable CD rom for your Pc and 3 plastic monster duel pass cards with a code 
 under a scratable layer same as an lotto ticket. Each duel pass contains 30 duel pass points giving 
 you a total fo 90 duel pass points, and when you first bootup this game you will get a compliment 
 10 duel pass points free. O. K. Now that you get into it and duel people from around the globe, yes 
 world wide, you will find that each duel cost' a duel point, each match duel will cost you from 2 
 or as high as 3 duel pass points. 
  
  
  For example you can win twice to complete the match duel ,hence 2 duel pass points is cost, but 
 if you lose 1 duel in this match duel you still pay that 1 pass point- 1win/1point/1loss/1point/1more 
 win-yup -- 1more piont. So you can eat up the points very quickly. when down to few or zero points 
 you will need to but another $10 box of yugi online for the 90 duels or buy them online useing 
 your credit card (good for adults not children) to buy a $15. duel pass. Do the math and you will

 a duel point. Duel as much as 500 times is like shelling out $50. You can see that some people dueled

Review:  The whole idea is great! I mean, online would be wonderful. But the huge downside, and horrid truth... 
 you DO have to pay for it. The first ten games are free, but after that, its about 0.50$ a game! 
 Think about it, after 40 games, there is 20 dollars. Wow... Sure, you could keep making more user 
 ID's but all that would REALLY happen, is that you would keep the same cards, and play... over, 
 and over, and over again... you basically need to spend a good amount of money to get any decent 
 cards. Annoyingly fun
  
  By the way, the graphics were alright, and the music was rather cinematic

Review:  As a big fan of the game ) and no i am not 12 years old :) i really liked the game.
  The drive to keep you play in this game is the trade and the random drops of cards.. this makes 
 you wanna play alot and get your favorite set together.
  
  I played this game alot (when it was in beta stage) but when i heard about the payment system i 
 was in shock.. I dont see my self walk out of the gameshop every week to walk out with a bag full 
 of "dualpasses'" as i want to play this game alot.
  
  also the censored system is to strict to have a decent conversation as loads of words are censored..
 
  
  but the game is really nice and addictive if your fan of the series or game.

Review:  I played this game and I didn't had a great time with it at all.
  
  Gameplay: You can challenge your friends in a duel but you need money and when you are out of money 
 then you can't play anymore. And that took out all the experience.
  
  Graphics: The graphics are actually beautiful. The cards are cool and the players are nice.
  
 
  Sound: You get this yugioh sound in this game but that is it. There isn't any music in this game 
 beside that.
  
  Value: If you are good at yugioh then you can play for hours and hours. If you aren't then you 
 can play for only 5 minutes. The gameplay is very short and that takes all the experience out.
 
  
  Reviewe'r tilt: Overall this game is another crappy yugioh game and I am not recommending you on 
 buying it or even renting it.
