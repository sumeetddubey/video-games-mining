:::Review:::
The game is about as lifeless as the zombies it hurls into your path. 

 If you're a horror fan, you might think that a game featuring a horde of hungry zombies, a vast 
 arsenal of anti-zombie weaponry, and a 3D graphics engine couldn't possibly be bad. Well, you'd 
 be wrong. SegaSoft's Flesh Feast offers all of these things and more, but despite a few positive 
 points, the game is about as lifeless as the zombies it hurls into your path.  

 Flesh Feast is a third-person action game viewed primarily from a top-down perspective, similar 
 to Mageslayer and Take No Prisoners. The game includes 14 levels in which you must lead three teams 
 of humans through a vast army of zombies, who trudge along after you and rise up unexpectedly from 
 the ground. Apparently, something has gone horribly awry at the island headquarters owned by Nutrition 
 Applied Science and Technology Inc. (NASAT) , where people are mysteriously dying and returning 
 to life as zombies. Your three teams must stop these creatures and put an end to the crisis.  

 
 The basic game design is simplistic but with a pretty good difficulty stepping built into the framework. 
 The levels are split up into three sectors with each one being the responsibility of a different 
 team. Also, each sector represents a level of difficulty, so you can gradually build up to the 
 final level by making your way through each sector in order (which is not required) . Starting out 
 in a graveyard, an airport, and a dockyard, you'll eventually hack and blast your way through a 
 variety of locales, including a mall, a hotel, a laboratory, and of course, the NASAT factory, 
 which seems to be the root of all this rampant evil.  

 You begin each level with a team of three humans, one main character and two others. How you are 
 supposed to keep all of them alive is a mystery. In fact, there doesn't seem to be much point in 
 trying, as the game is one hell of a lot easier if you sacrifice the supporting cast and concentrate 
 on arming your main characters to the gills. Weapons, ammo, and the occasional power-up can be 
 found lying all over the level maps, and you can home in on them using the game's radar display. 

 The game provides two methods for controlling your characters: strategic or direct. In strategic 
 mode, you point to a location or a zombie, and your character will move or attack. This mode, like 
 the concept of team survival, does not seem to have much purpose in the game. Direct mode, where 
 you control every move and action yourself using the keyboard, is much more effective for getting 
 anything done. If nothing else, your characters fight like a bunch of inept wimps in strategic 
 mode.  

 Though the game utilizes a 3D engine with Direct3D support for hardware acceleration, the graphics 
 aren't anything to shout about. For one thing, the game's fogging effect seems to take effect far 
 too close to the player, though I'll chalk that up as an effort to simulate poor visibility at 
 night. Also, the player and monster models are low-polygon, rudimentary shapes at best. It is true 
 that many of the zombies move and shuffle along in fine fashion (some dragging a bent foot behind, 
 some with their hands held out, some with no hands at all) , but they all tend to look the same 
 after just a little while. The game does convey blood and gore fairly well - though with a name 
 like Flesh Feast you'd have to hope they'd get that part right.  

 The gameplay itself is not too bad and can be fun at times. The level design, on the other hand, 
 is downright annoying. There isn't much complexity to most levels - just find weapons, locate keycards 
 (or some equivalent) , and kill zombies while looking for an exit. The problem is, these levels 
 make you run all over the place trying to figure out the proper way to exit. The first few maps 
 aren't so bad, but third-sector levels border on the ridiculous. You'll end up running from point 
 A to point B, then to C, back to A, over to B again, and then back to A before heading over to 
 C one last time. Gee guys, it might be nice to include an in-level save feature if you're going 
 to design "memorize the path" levels.  

 Flesh Feast does include a decent array of multiplayer options, including cooperative and deathmatch 
 play (where you can "eat your friends") . Two to eight players can participate over LAN and Internet 
 links via HEAT. net. The only trouble is, the game crashed every single time we tried to test multiplayer 
 support - and this was after installing the 1.02 patch that was supposed to fix some of the multiplayer 
 issues. This patch also made the game a lot less stable than it was out of the box, as we encountered 
 frequent crashes at random spots during solo play as well.  

 Simply put, Flesh Feast is a game that had some potential as a quick-fix action game where you could 
 take out your pent-up aggressions on a horde of undead zombies. Instead, it makes an unsuccessful 
 effort to combine action and strategy, throws a poor graphics engine in your face, and asks you 
 to memorize a bunch of uninspired level maps. The game's multiplayer problems and inherent instability 
 are just thrown in for good measure. Now, where did I put that copy of Resident Evil?
