:::Review:::
The Nations takes the familiar Settlers gameplay and manages to not screw it up in any meaningful 
 way. 

  Computer games are ultimately a form of escapism. It's certainly just as legitimate to sit at your 
 computer and manage a simulated ant colony, kill an evil dragon, or fly an F-16. Apparently, some 
 players also like to use their computers to build communities of tiny, imaginary people and watch 
 over them as they perform various mundane tasks. This subgenre of strategy gaming, focusing on 
 community building and resource gathering, has been defined by Blue Byte over the course of its 
 long-running Settlers series. In 1994, Settlers was an engaging, original idea that combined elements 
 of Civilization and SimCity. In 2001, the blueprint for games in this subgenre -- games like The 
 Nations -- is still more or less exactly the same and just ends up looking like an idea that various 
 companies have milked to death for the past seven years.  

          The Nations looks distinctive...     

  The Nations is firmly rooted in the tradition 
 of Settlers series. You're presented with a rudimentary settlement, and you must direct its inhabitants 
 to develop it by building schools and roads, by researching new technologies, and trading with 
 neighbors. The game includes three races: amazons, pimmons, and sajikis, who have different priorities 
 and lifestyles, and this adds a bit of variation (although most of the structures are identical) . 
 There is some combat, but for the most part, the languid pace of the game combines with the music 
 to induce an almost hypnotic state that discourages combat. Another term for this state is "boredom." 

  Units in The Nations have a variety of needs and attributes, such as health, vitality, motivation, 
 hygiene, and so forth, and these needs must be met and maintained or their performance will suffer. 
 All the units are individuals with unique statistics (and names) , and the result is a bit like 
 a game of The Sims played on a SimCity map. This is very similar to the recent Cultures, which 
 did the same thing with a Viking theme.  

  The Nations does a much better job than Cultures at creating a lively game atmosphere. JoWood has 
 really exerted its creative skills in the game's visual design, as well as its inherent European 
 expertise in producing engaging cartoons and trance-ambient background music, and the inclusion 
 of three races and some interesting artwork succeeds in making the whole thing visually attractive. 
 The problem is in the gameplay.  

  More specifically, the problem is that while Settlers-style gameplay was interesting a long time 
 ago, it really hasn't changed in almost a decade. If that's still not a problem for you, you'll 
 probably enjoy The Nations.  

          ... but plays just like every other builder game.     

  The Nations is essentially a 
 Settlers game with the addition of individual unit personalities. And the problem with  that  is 
 that it really amounts to absolutely no personality at all, because even though all the characters 
 are named and do cute little animation things, it doesn't make a bit of difference. All the units 
 do basically the same things, and apart from the unit portraits, they look and sound the same as 
 well. This completely undermines the illusion of individuality of the citizens. In a similar attempt, 
 Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim by Cyberlore Studios got this part completely right by distinguishing 
 its citizens on the basis of character stats that can be improved through quick, straightforward 
 tasks. You become attached to the characters because some of them can actually do things others 
 can't, and protecting them so that they can perform other tasks keeps you interested. But in keeping 
 with the Settlers tradition, The Nations is not very task based, which works fine in general but 
 doesn't fit well with the attempt to include individual characters.  

  The game has some minor technical issues, the most annoying of which is that zooming the view out 
 to display as much of the map as possible causes the game to slow down. This doesn't seem to be 
 intentional, as the effect is jerky and erratic. For the most part, though, The Nations is a polished 
 game that really looks like it has a lot to offer. And it actually may, depending on how many other 
 games like it you've played over the years.  

  Fundamentally, The Nations takes the familiar Settlers community-management gameplay and manages 
 to not screw it up in any meaningful way. If you're not crazy about these sorts of games, though, 
 it'll only make you wonder why, after four iterations of the Settlers engine, plus numerous offshoots, 
 we keep getting almost the same exact thing over and over.

Review:  Quite fun, easy to learn but hard to master, complex economics and quite enjoyable characters to 
 play.
  
  I think is quite better than settlers series, thought is based on them. Threee races, each with 
 its characteristic building and fun histooes and stories that will make your day.
  
  Surely you will be laughing about this game for hours and hours.
  
  It is a pleasure to play, 
 you dont have to be worried and nailed down to your computer, is a game to observe and enjoy, a 
 peacefull one, more worried about economics and population than war and destruction.
  
  Play it and look for yourself.

Review:  When I first bought this game, I thought ' Great! ' but when I played it, it was extremely annoying 
 and hardly understandable. If you could tell your people what to do like ' Age of Empires ' it 
 would be perfect but you can't so they're always unhappy because they haven't got jobs, yet there 
 is, say, a tavern right next to them. It's stupid! Plus it is way too slow, even with 4x speed, 
 it takes about 3 days to build something and you can only get one person working on the building 
 at any one time! I really think it let me down. I know this is a short review but I don't want 
 to talk about this annoying game anymore lol.
