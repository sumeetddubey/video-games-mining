Card games lend themselves well to Internet play, and this one is no exception. Just stay away from 
 the solo play, and you should be entertained. 

 Growing up I played cards every night with my father and brother. When we started, Dad always won 
 and we begged to stay up later for one more game. By the time I was 14 or so, Dad was keeping my 
 brother and me up late on school nights to play "just one more hand" - so he could try to catch 
 up. Stakes were high - we played for frozen yogurts, car privileges, and Sunday chores (there was 
 nothing quite so satisfying as having Dad do my dishes, wash the dog, or mow the yard) .  

 Games People Play: Hearts, Spades, Euchre, the new card game from Westwood, brings back a lot of 
 those memories, particularly of hearts and spades. What it doesn't do, however, is provide you 
 with competent opponents. To be sure, each of the games is called "Internet Hearts" or "Internet 
 Euchre" so the presupposition is that you'll play over the Internet. You can play solo against 
 the computer, but there are no varying levels of difficulty and it's shamefully easy to win - consider 
 the solo play a tutorial.  

 So the Internet is the focus of gameplay - which means that there should be plenty of action on 
 Westwood Online. The hearts lobby was decidedly empty - I went there numerous times and never so 
 much as found a single game - but there were usually a dozen or so folks playing spades. Euchre, 
 however, always had a game open and available and dozens of people around. And although there were 
 some partnered teams, there was always a loose player up for a game. The same could be said of 
 spades about half the time.  

 House rules were available to some extent, predominantly in spades. Bags, point limits, the ability 
 to bid one or zero, and playing partnered or solo are all options you have. What you don't have 
 is the option to play with three people in either spades or hearts (with the extra card either 
 being placed face up each hand, discarded altogether, or left face down each hand and given to 
 the person who takes the first spade/heart trick) . And in euchre, there's no way to play screw 
 the dealer, which makes the game significantly easier. With screw the dealer - which I never knew 
 fell under the rubric of house rules; I thought it was a fundamental rule - the dealer must call 
 trump, regardless of how bad his hand is, if everyone else passes. It forces people to play a little 
 more aggressively. With Westwood's version of the game, if everyone passes, a new hand is dealt. 
 Weenie... you could conceivably just pass and pass until you got the perfect hand.  

 Which brings me to another point - the Westwood AI plays entirely defensively. Bid nil in spades 
 and instead of tossing out a two to force a trick on you, the AI will throw an ace to ensure that 
 it makes its bid. And if you try to force a trick on someone going nil, the AI will still throw 
 an ace, thwarting your plans and taking a trick at the same time. Attempting to set a player with 
 nil is not particularly complex strategy - this is basic play that the AI is missing. Not to mention 
 how many hearts the AI players will swallow up long after any chance of shooting the moon has been 
 shot. Argh. But I already mentioned how bad the single player is, didn't I?  

 Players crashed periodically during play - oh the problems of having a T1 while others are still 
 working from a 14.4 - but generally games ran without a hitch. There's a ranking system that assigns 
 you a numeric rating depending on your win vs. loss ratio, following standard online gaming procedure, 
 and if you don't have a partner, whoever's hosting the table will seat you. You can play with any 
 combination of live/computer players in a match (don't partner yourself with the AI) , so you never 
 have to be without a game. And you can chat easily with the other players through a simple, unadorned 
 dialogue box beneath the playing table. Be warned, however, that the same kinds of things that 
 can temporarily stop a regular, real game can also hold up online play - I waited while partners 
 chased dogs jumping the gate, changed diapers, and periodically got sick (he was playing euchre 
 while home suffering from the flu) .   

 Card games lend themselves well to Internet play, and this one is no exception. Just stay away from 
 the solo play, and you should be entertained.
