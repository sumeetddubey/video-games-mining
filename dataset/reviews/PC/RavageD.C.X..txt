:::Review:::
When will the world tire of rail-shooters? 

 Ravage, D. C. X.: Evil, inhuman forces of unknowable intent are at work. Our souls are being sucked 
 dry right before our eyes, humanity has no choice but to watch and obey, and the current state 
 of Earth's considerable technology seems unable to help us. I'm not talking about the story premise 
 of Inscape's Ravage D. C. X.: I'm talking about the game design itself.  

 When will the world tire of rail-shooters?  

 Inscape, in what appears to be a desperate attempt 
 to convince the world that they're not all The Dark Eye, Drowned God and (shudder) Adventures of 
 the Smart Patrol, have rolled out this booming, cinematic, largely camera-driven shooter. In Ravage 
 D. C. X., a badly bungled goverment experiment has opened a transdimensional gateway, and has attracted 
 the attention of The Necron, advanced, exoskeletal aliens in need of a serious chat with their 
 collective inner child. The Necron immediately stomp through said gateway and commence to butt-kickin' 
 in a series of different "dimensions," or levels, including a desert temple strongpoint surrounded 
 by sitting-duck combat forces just begging to be smart-bombed, an alternate Mars and Moon, the 
 inevitable ice realm (serving as a Necron naval base) and, ultimately, Washington, D. C., where 
 a climactic battle is staged after all six alien dimensions have been mopped up and shut down. 
 (No, there isn't a "lava level," but there might as well be.) The player takes the role of a modern-day 
 soldier, part of a rebel resistance base that teleports him from dimension to dimension as the 
 game progresses. Once in the battle, players can choose to conduct combat on foot, vehicle to vehicle, 
 or from the air. Missions include smooth and dizzying canyon-trench runs like something out of 
 Star Wars (complete with thundering soundtrack and a camera that occasionally whips around behind 
 you to let you pick off targets you might have overshot) , "Panocube" views (a kind of snappy, QuickTimeVR-like 
 panoramic engine) , and good old on-foot mayhem in the vein of Virtua Cop except that the enemy 
 is one heck of a lot uglier. Various cut scenes provide transition between different modes of combat 
 (such as the player ditching his shot-down fighter in favor of a land cycle) , advance the story, 
 and provide updates on the progress of the war storyline.  

 Looking at the list of gameplay claims on the box, you'd think Ravage was the end of the world in 
 more ways than one: "GROUNDBREAKING - Totally redefines the action/shooter game!" (Inscape made 
 this one up) ; "seamless cuts to and from gameplay to allow infinite replayability" (a yo-yo, too, 
 has just this sort of "infinite replayability") ; "attack from all angles! Panocube engine enables 
 an amazing 180x360 range of view" (just don't plan on getting off that rail) ; "Ravage's actual 
 gameplay graphics look better than most cut sequences" (okay, they got me there, although it can 
 be argued that the entire game is a cut sequence) ; "YOU'RE IN CONTROL - set the difficulty level 
 to create your own challenge" (Easy, Medium, and Hard! Yow!) . But here's the truth: Ravage D. C. X., 
 like Microsoft's Deadly Tide, is just another pretty rail shooter that's good for some initial 
 movie-style twitch-and-kill, but loses its charm exponentially not long thereafter.

Review:  This is the first PC game I played, that means a lot, before that, I only catch a glimpse of C&C 
 and that is what I think PC game is, I even imagine this to be a STG game when I buy it in Jan 
 1997.
  
  Well after some hard work, I get the game running and I find out it to be a shooting game, first 
 person view, fixed angle, kick some alien bad ass, and be the lonely solider to save man kind.
 
  
  The graphic, OK I might not have opened my eyes those days but I think this one is OK, I can give 
 it a 8.5, since it looks better than Virtual Cop of the arcade.
  
  The music is good for me , I kind of like the orchestra type music, so I can give it a 8.5
  
 
  The difficulty hold me back for a while, if you haven't destroy all the targets within limited 
 time, game over, especially the fixed angle mode only give you a few chance to see the targets; there 
 are times when you can control you view, but the mouse movement is tricky and you are surrounded 
 by enemy. But I managed to make it, and see to the end, lowest difficulty of course.
  
  Not a good game and I like the review of GS of this game, still, a memory of my early days.
