:::Review:::
Even if you think this stuff is fun the first time around, there's no way any event in the game 
 can hold its appeal for more than a few go-rounds. 

 Remember those track and field arcade games back in the '80s? You know the ones: gameplay consisted 
 entirely of pounding two buttons as rapidly as humanly possible to make your character run faster 
 before hitting a third button to make him jump, toss a javelin or discus, begin a pole-vault attempt, 
 and so on. Those games were pretty popular for a little while, but they soon faded into the mists 
 of video game history. The reason? They were fun for all of about 15 minutes.  

 But someone at HeadGames Publishing and developer Cat Daddy Games must have been pretty impressed 
 with the tap-tap-tap action of those mindless affairs, because Full Strength Strongman Competition 
 works almost exactly the same way - and it too wears out its welcome in extremely short order. 
 In fact, the action is so lame that it's quite possible someone on a lower-end system would spend 
 more time installing the game than actually playing it.  

 Full Strength Strongman Competition features six luminaries from the American Federation of Strength 
 Athletes: Magnus Ver Magnusson, Flemming Rasmussen, Riku Kiri, Wayne Price, Heinz Ollesch, and 
 Manfred Hoeberl (who just happens to be founder and president of the recently formed AFSA) . Of 
 course, only serious fans of Strongman events (or insomniacs who turn to ESPN2 in the wee hours 
 of the morning) will recognize these names. After choosing one of these six guys as your onscreen 
 persona, it's on to the events. There are eight of them, and all are pretty bizarre at first glance 
 - but half the fun of watching a Strongman competition is puzzling over who came up with the idea 
 of seeing who can flip a car over and over again the fastest or toss beer kegs an insane distance 
 in the air. Other oddities include the Showgirl Lift (repeatedly lifting a bunch of bikini-clad 
 babes sitting on a platform) , the Atlas Carry (hauling boulders from point A to point B) , and the 
 Tire Toss (these guys are so strong they'd probably throw a discus around the world!) .  

 This stuff is pretty fun to watch on TV, especially compared with traditional weightlifting, but 
 it doesn't translate into much of a gaming experience. In the Truck Pull and Farmers Walk, all 
 you do is tap two keys as quickly as you can; the Keg Toss and Tire Toss have the same simple mechanics 
 with the added thrill of hitting the action button to hurl the object at the right moment. The 
 Atlas Carry also uses the same two-button design, except you also have to hit the appropriate button 
 to make your character keep his balance. The Showgirl Lift and Car Roll are basically the same 
 game - you hit the action button to stop a moving green ball as close as possible to the middle 
 of a horizontal bar - and in the Super Yoke you guide your strongman through an obstacle course 
 as he staggers under the weight of two engine blocks.  

 Even if you think this stuff is fun the first time around, there's no way any event in the game 
 can hold its appeal for more than a few go-rounds. Oh, wait - there's also a multiplayer mode, 
 complete with a feature to search for games on the Internet. But even if you could find another 
 unfortunate soul who somehow wound up with the game, the only satisfaction you'd derive from victory 
 is the comforting knowledge that you can tap keys faster and more accurately than your opponent. 

 But I'm not going to berate Cat Daddy Games for the simplistic gameplay, because there's simply 
 not much else you can do to simulate the events in Full Strength Strongman Competition. And I'd 
 never dream of making fun of the athletes who signed up to be featured in the game - they probably 
 had no idea their sport would make for such a lousy PC game. HeadGames, on the other hand, deserves 
 a tongue-lashing for releasing yet another spiritless game that exists for one reason and one reason 
 only: to make as much money as possible on the smallest possible investment.
