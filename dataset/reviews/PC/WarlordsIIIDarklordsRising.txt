:::Review:::
SSG has done a great job of giving fantasy wargame fans a game worthy of the Warlords name. 

 
 Last year, Red Orb Entertainment released Warlords III: Reign of Heroes, the much-anticipated sequel 
 to Warlords II. And although Warlords III was a great game, some of the best features of its predecessor, 
 such as the excellent army editor, weren't included. With Darklords Rising, Red Orb has filled 
 in some of the gaps, and reaffirmed the Warlords franchise as one of the best strategy series around 
 in the process.  

 In Warlords III, you're positioned as the commander of a fantasy army at war. You gain power by 
 capturing cities, which provide you with both the income and the ability to produce more armies. 
 Along the way, you command heroes that seek out quests to uncover magic items or beastly allies 
 to aid you in the conflict. There are even mercenary armies and heroes who can join your cause, 
 as long as you have enough gold to pay for their services.  

 Veteran Warlords enthusiasts will find almost all of the features that made the deluxe edition of 
 Warlords II such an enjoyable game. Included in Darklords Rising are 31 new armies, five new hero 
 types, a scenario editor, a campaign designer, new skills and spells for heroes, new options before 
 and during gameplay, nine new game types, new victory conditions, new scenarios, new campaigns, 
 and new terrain types. This horde of features gives Darklords Rising almost endless replayability. 
 Strategy gamers who have yet to check out the Warlords series will find themselves occupied for 
 hours upon hours just experimenting with all that this gem has to offer.  

 The story follows Reign of Heroes, but this time you play your foe from the previous game, Lord 
 Bane, who has come to reconquer the lands of Siria. Throughout the campaign, you'll have to deal 
 with old allies and enemies in almost a reverse plot of Reign of Heroes in which you led the knights 
 of Siria. While this story isn't explicitly original, the chance to play with evil armies and watch 
 them gain experience more than makes up for it. In addition, the other campaigns give you the chance 
 to play the armies of other races besides the ghastly undead or honorable knights. Although they're 
 considerably shorter than the main one, the orc and dwarven campaigns allow for some variety.  
 

 As for the graphics, they're pretty much the same as in Reign of Heroes, giving you the overhead 
 view of the landscape with realistic terrain. The land features (trees, mountains, hills) don't 
 have the cartoonish quality of Heroes of Might and Magic II, with the exception of water and lava, 
 which are brighter than is to be expected. The realistic terrain in Darklords Rising makes for 
 more believable battlegrounds than are found in its competitors. The new scenarios and game styles 
 in this version are also a great asset. Common game types such as "king of the hill" and "capture 
 the flag" are included, along with others that highlight some of the unique features of the Warlords 
 playing style. Heirs to Ancient Power and Battle of the Titans will appeal to those who enjoy Heroes 
 of Might and Magic, where controlling individual heroes and their armies is the key. In Heirs, 
 you're provided with a powerful magical artifact, and in Battle, you're given a highly advanced 
 level-ten hero. In this manner, the focus of the game is directed more towards building armies 
 around your hero.  

 Darklords Rising gives you both a scenario editor and a random map generator, and the amount of 
 detail you can put in your custom scenarios is truly amazing. As long as you stay within the standard 
 Warlords rules, you have complete control of the major elements of the game. The only drawback 
 is the lack of an army editor. The Warlords II Deluxe Edition featured such an editor, which allowed 
 you to create any type of army, including sci-fi and World War II ones. They gave you premade armies 
 ranging from the realistic, such as the Civil War set, to the fantastic, such as the elemental 
 beings set. This great feature made Warlords more than just a fantasy wargame, promoting it to 
 the realm of a "wargame creation program." Sadly, this feature has not been included in Darklords 
 Rising due to the difficulty of allowing you to animate your custom armies.  

 If you're looking for something to tide you over until the holiday rush, Warlords III: Darklords 
 Rising is highly recommended. In fact, you might even forget about the games you've been waiting 
 for. In this update of Reign of Heroes, SSG has done a great job of giving fantasy wargame fans 
 a game worthy of the Warlords name.

Review:  I played this game ages ago, and I'm currently trying to find a way to make it play on my Vista 
 system. Yup, that's how good this game really is.
  
  Gameplay: One of the best turn-based strategy games ever.
  
  Story/Campaigns: VERY ADDICTIVE. 
 VERY INTERESTING.
  
  Graphics: For a game made that long ago, it isn't bad. To today's standards, the gameplay will 
 certainly make up for it.
  
  Sound: Music is good, unit sounds fit, and the overall sound quality is OK.
  
  Re-playability/Value: 
 Top-notch.
  
  Difficulty: It is easy to learn the game mechanics once you're done with the tutorial (only takes 
 around 30 minutes) . If the game itself seems to be easy, don't worry, you can easily change the 
 settings to make it very difficult.
  
  So, should you be looking to buy this game? If you can find a copy, get it at whatever cost! It 
 is certainly something that you shouldn't miss. Right now I'm studying video game programming, 
 and once I'm though with that, I'd love to work on a game similar to this one.

Review:  This game is amongst one of the greatest games I have ever played. I personally think that the 
 Red orb should have sent out a bunch of advertisements out for this game, because they could have 
 raked in some money. Unfortunately this game was not advertised and just disapeared. No one knows 
 about this game which I find disapointing because this game is just awesome. The game did great 
 with the turn-by-turn gameplay. It is a perfect strategy game. It has revolutionary graphics for 
 its time (my opinion, no one can change it) , the soundeffects matched and were put in where it 
 belongs, the gameplay was simply magnificent. This game is amongst the few games that belong to 
 be called Mother of Games because this has set the bar for strategy games so high that when I look 
 upon other games I am just amazed at how crappy it was compared to this game. If you can find a 
 computer that can play this game, my suggestion is buy, buy, buy this game and play it. I promise 
 you won't be disapointed. Check the tech info for what kind of computers you can play this masterpiece 
 on.

Review:  I love this game it provided me many hours of gaming fun. Very easy to learn. the graphics are 
 very basic but it has an old school gaming type of fun. It is very easy to catch on to this game, 
 it won't long to get this game completed. I think it you will have a few great hours of fun in 
 the proccess. I would say that it is a must for true adventure gamers and game collectors. I just 
 wish that it had more levels to keep on going. I completed this game in about 50 hours of play 
 but I took my time and I got my butt kicked by the computer a few times......
