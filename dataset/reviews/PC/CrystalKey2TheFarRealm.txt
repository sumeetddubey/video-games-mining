:::Review:::
While Crystal Key 2 sure isn't a stunner, it's still a fairly solid adventure game that has its 
 charms. 

  When the Myst-style adventure The Crystal Key was released back in 1999, it received a ho-hum reception 
 at best and was quickly forgotten. Given that history, it might seem odd for The Adventure Company 
 to bother releasing a sequel five years later. Against the odds, it turned out to be a wise move -- or 
 at least not a foolish one. While Crystal Key 2 sure isn't a stunner, it's still a fairly solid 
 adventure game that has its charms.  

          Call is saddened by his people's fate, but the game doesn't help you to care.     

 
  One big thing that holds Crystal Key 2 back is its writing. You play as a youth named Call. Your 
 father saved your homeworld of Evany from an evil menace in the original game, but the expected 
 peace and prosperity never came. Instead, Evany's citizens shuffle around like zombies, with only 
 Call spared thanks to fortuitous timing.  

  The game opens with a scene of a morose Call sitting on a deserted street in Evany. A mysterious 
 woman suddenly appears and tries to talk to him, but she is quickly dragged off by masked soldiers. 
 She drops her notebook, from which Call learns that other worlds have been affected by the same 
 stupefying pall that afflicts Evany's people. He naturally decides to seek her out and save his 
 people. To do so, he'll have to travel to a distant world by stepping through a portal that opens 
 with the eponymous crystal key (which is otherwise of absolutely no bearing on the game) .  

  The big problem here is that you never actually see what's happened to Evany, so you never feel 
 its plight. It can be hard to care about a problem when you can't see and relate to the people 
 affected by it. You barely even see the bad guys, either; instead, you mostly just hear about them 
 second hand from the game's characters. Those characters are bland and few and far between -- here's 
 yet another adventure game populated by about eight people. On top of that, the characters might 
 look like aliens, yet they talk and act just like ordinary humans. (Some of them even look like 
 ordinary humans, improbably enough.) Just as hokey, dialogue is minimal and usually repeated verbatim 
 every time you try to talk to a different character.  

  In other words, the gameworld isn't well fleshed out at all. Crystal Key 2's story is neglected 
 during much of the game, anyway, where you feel like you're just solving puzzles for the heck of 
 it. To top things off, the ending feels muddled and anticlimactic.  

  Even if the writing is clumsy and bland, Crystal Key 2 does some things quite well. The interface 
 is simple and straightforward. Using inventory items or operating objects is a breeze. Even better, 
 getting around requires mercifully little walking. You'll get to use boats, a submarine, a jetpack, 
 and other modes of transportation that quickly shuttle you to the main areas you select by clicking 
 on a map. Each of those areas is reasonably small and can be quickly explored on foot, so even 
 though the game requires some backtracking, it rarely feels burdensome.  

  The game's puzzles are its best feature. They smoothly ramp up in difficulty and tend to be challenging 
 enough to provide a sense of satisfaction, but not so hard as to leave you frustrated. They're 
 pretty diverse, ranging from simple deliveries to memorizing and playing back a short musical passage 
 to figuring out how to lure some glowing bugs into a dark passage.  

  Just as importantly, the puzzles tend to give you some insights into the gameworld (even if that 
 world is pretty lame) and enable you to test your powers of observation instead of just hitting 
 you with some arbitrary math problem or ridiculous Rube Goldberg machine. For example, early in 
 Crystal Key 2 you play a board game with a fruit vendor's son. At the time, it just seems like 
 a pleasant way to fill you in on part of the story as the boy explains the local legend on which 
 the game is based. Later, you see that it also offers some vital clues to one of the game's more-involved 
 puzzles.  

          Traveling far is easy: just click on the destination and away you go.     

  The puzzles 
 mostly feel unified in style and thoughtfulness, but Crystal Key 2's presentation is all over the 
 map. The locales range from sandy beaches to a village high in the trees to dank caves to an abandoned 
 space port, and they feature some neat architecture from time to time. Each area is discrete -- you 
 move from one area to another with mouse clicks -- but you can pan the camera in any direction within 
 each area. The graphics engine is limited to 800x600 resolution and flubs a lot, often displaying 
 characters as blurry messes from afar, causing the backgrounds to jiggle as you move the camera, 
 or revealing black, jagged seams in the scenery. The audio works well enough, with some subtle 
 music (but also some cheesy music) and competent but uninspired voice-overs.  

  If you like solving well-constructed puzzles in a reasonably attractive gameworld, Crystal Key 
 2 can be fun. The game's writing is mostly a bust, though, so it's not a gameworld you're likely 
 to care about. Crystal Key 2 is also short -- you can finish it in two or three evenings -- and offers 
 no replay value since it lacks puzzle-difficulty options, multiple endings, or the like. Still, 
 for a short, traditional adventure game, you could do worse.

Review:  I've had this game sitting on my computer for some time now and I've never bothered to keep playing 
 it. Now I remember why.
  
  Gameplay: Myst ripoff. Or so Ive heard. I've also heard that the first game won awards. What kind 
 of people liked it? This new one is absolutely disastrous. The addition of people you can talk 
 to adds nothing special. Theyre all ugly and the script is freakin horrible. "Hello. My name is 
 Call. What's yours?" SHUT UP.
  
  SIDENOTE: The first time I started playing it, there was a place there called Nehli. Now there 
 isn't. Its gone. It has DISAPPEARED. It has ceased to be. It is not on the map and I have to reach 
 it to get to the next part of the game. IM EVEN USING A WALKTHROUGH I PRINTED UP and its STILL 
 NOT HELPING. 
  
  The Graphics are gli-t-ched. This game would have been better if you could just walk around either 
 in third person view or in first person view. No. Dreamcatcher games wouldn't let us have a great 
 game like that.
  
  ANOTHER SIDENOTE: Dont bother to go to them for help. They have no contact info and I doubt they 
 will give it out.
  
  Sound: Whatever. Reused and recycled portions from the first game. Like I said, the characters 
 voices are beyond zero intelligence. They just repeat the same thing over and over when you TRY 
 to talk to them. 
  
  Value: Forget it. EB Games and Gamestop wont take this thing back. 
  
  Tilt: Broken.
  
  My overall opinion: smack your grandmother if she got you this game. If 
 you wanted money on it like I did (and I bought mine used) , then I hope your receipt is fairly 
 new. After 30 days, they wont take it back.
