Monopoly Casino takes an upbeat approach to traditional casino games. 

 Monopoly Casino is an enjoyable casino simulation that includes a wide variety of games, all based 
 on a lighthearted Monopoly theme. The game has an easy-to-use interface that lets you participate 
 in more than 40 games, including old favorites like slot machines and blackjack, and more obscure 
 games like Omaha Hold 'em and the Monopoly Money Wheel.  

 The game's interface is clear and intuitive, and it provides a clear overview of the different betting 
 options available at any point during the game. It keeps track of your winnings and gives you the 
 option to play on higher-limit tables and even participate in tournament play.  

 The Monopoly theme may turn off serious casino-game fans, but it does create a cheery, lighthearted 
 atmosphere and gives the game a well-integrated look. The money on the table becomes Monopoly money, 
 in your mind; you'll even get to choose a traditional Monopoly token - such as the racecar or the 
 top hat - as your playing piece. The casino floor is organized around a Monopoly board and lets 
 you simply point and click on the game you wish to play. And the manual provides clearly written 
 rules and instructions if you're not familiar with the games.  

 The casino floor offers a wide variety of games. There are 16 slot machines to choose from, each 
 with a slightly different Monopoly-based theme - and some have variable payouts for double- and 
 triple-credit bets. In addition to slots, the casino includes blackjack, craps, keno, pai-gow poker, 
 traditional poker (five-card draw, seven-card stud, Texas hold 'em, Omaha hold 'em, and a number 
 of hi-low and lowball variations) , roulette, and video poker. Though Monopoly Casino is missing 
 a few games like Caribbean stud, baccarat, and let-it-ride, it still has more than enough choices 
 to satisfy all but the most discriminating casino gamers.  

 The background music consists of generic but tasteful jazz tracks, and the sound effects are appropriate, 
 though there isn't as much cheering and ruckus around the craps table as there should be. Fortunately, 
 the game lets you adjust the volume of the music and sound effects independently so that you can 
 tailor them to your personal preferences. One feature that would have added to the ambience is 
 background casino noise. The slot machines ring their telltale bells only when the player is involved 
 in a slot game, and casino chatter is completely absent.  

 Monopoly Casino's graphics are hardly revolutionary, but they are clean and cheerful. The animations 
 are adequate and don't get in the way, and they actually add some variety to the game's otherwise 
 utilitarian interface. Mr. Monopoly - the character with the top hat and moustache - appears throughout 
 the game; he's in the opening sequence; he's the dealer in card games; and he acts out a bankrupt 
 player's shameful exit from the casino, complete with security-guard escort.  

 Monopoly Casino takes an upbeat approach to traditional casino games. While the graphics and sound 
 are by no means groundbreaking, they are clean and unobtrusive, and the use of the well-known Monopoly 
 art style helps create a family-oriented atmosphere. The interface is easy to use and lets you 
 learn and participate in a wide variety of casino games in much the same way you would in a real 
 casino (without the crowds and monetary loss) . The tournament play and network connectivity add 
 to the range of options, and complete a well-rounded and lighthearted casino game.
