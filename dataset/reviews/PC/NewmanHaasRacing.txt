:::Review:::
Even with all the flaws, Newman/Haas can be fun, if you're a beginner and haven't tried any other 
 racing games. 

 Given Newman/Haas Racing's video-game heritage, it's not surprising that it doesn't offer the  
 physics modeling found in games like Grand Prix II and Grand Prix Legends. But no one ever said 
 that a racing game couldn't be fun if it didn't have a physics model that would make NASA proud. 
 Newman/Haas almost makes up for its deficiencies in the realism department by offering a great 
 lineup of licenses, beautifully rendered cars, and a game engine that creates a jaw-dropping sensation 
 of speed and acceleration.  

 You'll notice, however, that I said almost. Thanks to a host of poor design decisions and perhaps 
 the most absurd interface ever seen in a racing game, Newman/Haas Racing manages to be only a briefly 
 amusing diversion, instead of what it could have been: a thrilling arcade-style racer with a veneer 
 of authenticity.  

 You play vicariously as one of 16 real-life CART racers - kinda fun, but it means there's no way 
 to see your own name listed among racing's elite at the end of a race. You'll find a lot of stars 
 from CART here - Andretti, Fittipaldi, Pruett, Herta, Zanardi, Luyendyk, De Ferran, and Vasser, 
 to name some of the most notable - and for each, you can read their highly detailed bios that cover 
 every career milestone. There's also quite a bit of in-depth history for each of the game's eleven 
 tracks. Newman/Haas Racing shines brightest in the way it convincingly creates the sensation of 
 incredible acceleration and maximum speeds. A CART racing car can go from zero to 100 and back 
 to zero again in something like four seconds; in most games the only way you know that is by watching 
 the speedometer, but in Newman/Haas you actually believe it's happening. The Direct3D car graphics 
 are first-rate - definitely on a par with anything I've seen in a racing sim recently - and the 
 terrain and trackside graphics are more than good enough to set the scene for some serious IndyCar 
 action.  

 Unfortunately, Newman/Haas starts earning penalties before you can even get out of the pits. One 
 of the biggest snafus is the game's interface, an incredibly unwieldy affair that probably works 
 just fine on a PlayStation but is a mini-nightmare for gamers using a joystick, gamepad, or a pedal-and-wheel 
 combo - and that covers most of the people playing racing sims on the PC. The problem is that this 
 is a half-baked conversion of a PlayStation game, and no effort was made to make it user-friendly 
 on the PC. Everything's OK before you start a practice session, but getting back to the main menu 
 is a labyrinthine process of keystrokes and button presses that'll have you pounding your desk 
 in frustration. Simply put, it's harder to exit a race in progress than it is to grab the pole 
 position. In a move stemming from either cheapness, laziness, or a complete misunderstanding of 
 the PC racing-sim market, Studio 33 designed Newman/Haas with no option to reconfigure the inputs 
 on your game peripherals. And don't think you can get around it by programming the buttons on your 
 wheel-and-pedal combo; once you choose the analog device to activate your pedals, certain functions 
 (like shifting gears) can no longer be handled with keystrokes, and choosing keyboard commands 
 deactivates the input from wheels and pedals. Acceptable? I say not.  

 After you toss out obvious stuff like driving aids and transmission type, the car setup options 
 are rather limited - you can adjust wings, choose tire type and adjust pressure, determine fuel 
 load, change the stagger, and set the springs. That's pretty skimpy compared with full-blown sims 
 like Grand Prix Legends or Grand Prix II. What's more, you've got only minimal control over the 
 options that are available. You must pick generic settings like low, medium, or high downforce, 
 for instance, rather than setting the wings at precisely the angle you want. And unlike most racing 
 sims, you can have only one car setup saved at a time. But the most maddening thing about setting 
 up your car is that the only way to get to the garage is from the main menu. Start a race of any 
 type, and you're all set to practice as much as you like - but if you find you want to adjust something 
 after a few laps, you've got to exit completely, all the way out to the main menu, and that means 
 starting (and exiting) from the practice, qualifying, and the actual race. This isn't just unrealistic, 
 it's downright silly - like taking a walk around the block to get to the other side of your house. 
 Things don't get a whole lot better out on the track. There's no option to turn on a racing line, 
 and a miniature track map that's superimposed on the left of the screen is more of a hindrance 
 than a help. The racing commentary is sometimes completely out of synch, with the announcer raving 
 about how fast you're going when you're crawling along after hitting a wall. Speaking of hitting 
 walls, I'll bet you didn't know that CART cars automatically pop into first gear when they brush 
 up against a wall, did you? Or that you have an out-of-body experience whenever another car tags 
 you - you see your vehicle from an overhead rear view for a good two or three seconds. Sadly, this 
 is the way things work in Newman/Haas Racing.  

 Even with all the flaws, Newman/Haas can be fun, if you're a beginner and haven't tried any other 
 racing games. But for seasoned gamers looking for an exciting combination of realism and action, 
 this is definitely not the place to begin the quest.
