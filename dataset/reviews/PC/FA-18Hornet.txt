F/A-18 Hornet 3.0 continues the noble tradition of creating a great sim andforgetting to put a game 
 inside of it. 

 F/A-18 Hornet 3.0 continues the noble tradition of creating a great sim and forgetting to put a 
 game inside of it. Failing to see the forest for the trees seems almost inevitable when you're 
 busy creating an incredibly detailed avionics suite and flight model, but in the wake of Back to 
 Baghdad (also known as "Back to Babbages") and A-10 Cuba!, it is getting a little wearisome.  

 
 Hornet 3.0 is a PC port of the classic Mac sim (stop laughing!) from GPS, and in many ways it is 
 a superior piece of work. The last real F/A-18 Hornet sim for the PC was Fleet Defender from MicroProse, 
 even though the Hornet does make a guest appearance in Jetfighter III and US Navy Fighters. A frontline 
 multirole aircraft with a shaky reputation, its role as a carrier aircraft is part of its appeal 
 to sim fans looking for a different challenge. That is, for sim fans who like smashing into a tiny 
 carrier deck instead of landing on a nice stable runway.  

 As a pure sim, Hornet is superb. The avionics suite is meticulous, with nicely implemented HUD, 
 MFDs, standby gauges, and digital display indicators. Air and ground radar modes are some of the 
 best in town, with GMT, SEA, MAP, and EXP1 modes for air-to-ground, and RWS, VA, STT, and TWS for 
 air-to-air. Scan elevation, scan azimuth, range, antenna elevations are all modeled. An air-combat 
 maneuvering mode sets antenna scan patterns automatically for wide, vertical, gun, and boresight 
 acquisition. This is how radar modes should be done, and there are absolutely no complaints here 
 at all.   

 The flight model is also tops, with a few quirks that seem to have been sorted out in a subsequent 
 patch. Handling in both normal and high-G flight, fuel consumption and drag from external stores 
 all feel about right. Damage assessment and stalls seemed a little off in the initial release: 
 The same damage was incurred repeatedly, and stalls were either too severe during engine loss, 
 or not severe enough during lower speeds. There was also no visual cue for missile hits (no shuddering) . 
 These issues have all been addressed in version 3.0.1, as has the inconsistent AI. Wingmen and 
 enemy AI are decent, with fair responsiveness and no really stupid mistakes observed.  

 Graphically, Hornet is plain-Jane polygons, which is either good or bad depending on your preferences. 
 Frame rates at resolutions up to 1024x768 are fluid and graphics are clean. For the hard-core crew, 
 this is often preferable to the messy textures of better-looking sims, and it does make spotting 
 targets and reading the situation easier. As for the rest of the game engine, it's a bit cumbersome. 
 The cockpit-style main menu is a bit convoluted and hard to navigate. On the positive side, there 
 are 90 minutes of video tutorials covering every aspect of the sim and the instruments. This is 
 welcome since the manual is woefully insufficient, poorly laid out, and has no index.  

 All of these fairly positive comments lead up to the largest failing of Hornet 3.0: missions and 
 campaigns. There is a grand total of 28 missions in a single Persian Gulf campaign. These missions 
 are doled out four at a time, with you selecting the one you want to fly, then going on to the 
 next (whether you won the last one or not) . This happens seven times and culminates in a nuclear 
 interception. You can go back and play the campaign three more times to get to the remaining 21 
 missions. None of these missions are dynamically linked, and the structure is rather unsatisfying, 
 with transit times that are too short and a battlefield that doesn't feel realistic at all. It's 
 not that the missions are easy, in fact, they're often pretty tough. But you don't get that Longbow-like 
 sense of being part of a large operation. A few Hawaiian training missions and stand-alone quick 
 combat scenarios flesh out the action, but not enough.  

 This, coupled with the paltry number of missions and no mission editor, is a crippling strike against 
 an otherwise excellent simulation. Hornet has some real things to recommend it - certainly more 
 than Back to Baghdad and A10 Cuba! As a pure recreation of F/A-18 flight, it is the best on the 
 market. But as a unified, satisfying gaming experience, it needs work.

Review:  I recently pulled this game out of the closest and I installed it on my laptop. After a few tries 
 to get back in the groove I was off and running. Playing this game was like old times, but is still 
 great as the day I got it 10 years ago. Using the network feature game is fun because if you get 
 really into it, you can set the AI to really hard and you and your teammates can try to break the 
 defense with only guns.
  
  I only had the problem that the AI and the games play was just a tad unpredictable and that objects 
 would register as ground items though I had air targets selected, I still had a good time.

Review:  I've owned every upgrade for this awesome title since it was first released in the mid-nineties. 
 While it's obviously showing its age, it still remains one of my favorite games. I dig realism, 
 variety and challenge in flight sims and this little gem's got plenty. Hornet has a high learning 
 curve and you know you'll have your hands full when you confront the 150 page manual. I actually 
 enjoyed the fact that it took me months to execute a decent carrier landing. But when I did, I 
 felt a real sense of accomplishment. Big points for challenge and realism.
  
  The flight model is very sophisticated and takes hundreds of hours to master. Console games have 
 their place, and there're some fantastic ones out there -- but a true flight sim needs all the power 
 and key strokes a desk top computer can offer.
  
  Then there's the Mission Editor. Man, you can come up with any scenario you want. You can set all 
 other planes, choppers, bombers, ground forces ,anti aircraft gunnery, surface to air missiles 
 and just about every thing you want to exacting specifications. This game makes my Top Gun list 
 for variety in a combat sim.
  
  And let's not forget about head-to-head play. In the days before everyone had dsl or cable, we'd 
 haul our computers over to each others' houses and hook up manually. Live pilots! Woo-hoo! Take 
 THAT Red Baron!
  
  Gameplay: Flawlessly smooth. I don't remember a crash (computer crash that is -- I've augered the 
 plane in about a thousand times) .
  
  There are two down sides to this game and are the reasons I didn't give it a higher rating. The 
 first is minor and the second is significant:
  
  First: Compared to what's out there now, graphically ol' Hornet's just not looking as razor sharp 
 as say, Falcon 4.0 or Battle of Britain. Minor. Second: In my first graph I said I've owned every 
 up-grade -- that's not true. I could not bring myself to give them money for their latest installment, 
 "Operation Iraqi Freedom." I consider it to be a tip of the hat to U. S. jingoism and a thinly veiled 
 attempt at propaganda. Significant.
  
  Outside of that she's cherry.
  
  I strongly recomend the the Mac version and a decent multi-button programmable flight stick.
 
  
  Hornet One's bingo, RTB....
