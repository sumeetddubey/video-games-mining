:::Review:::
Centipede is at times frustrating, but for the most part, it's a welcome update of a classic shooting 
 game. 

 Hasbro has jumped on the remake bandwagon again, and as with Frogger, it's delivered another game 
 that clings to the spirit of the original while diverting just enough to make the game feel new. 
 The resulting game is at times frustrating, but for the most part, it's a welcome update of a classic 
 shooting game.  

 While this may seem like a game for kids, there's some solid gameplay that is at times akin to a 
 mixture of a first-person shooter and the original coin-op Centipede. The game has two gameplay 
 modes. The first is the classic arcade shooter played from a top-down view with the attacking centipede 
 descending upon you. In the adventure aspect of the game, you navigate through levels populated 
 with mushrooms and civilian structures. The civilian buildings must be defended by destroying the 
 oncoming centipede and its allied bugs. Certain mushrooms provide power-ups that give you new weapons 
 and defenses. The mushrooms also serve as obstacles, and you have to maneuver past them or destroy 
 them outright. What further complicates things is that, as in the original, when you shoot the 
 centipede, it drops segments that transform into mushrooms, thus hindering your progress.  

 The most important function of gameplay, control, is acutely debilitated. The mouse allows you 
 to control your rotational turning while the keyboard allows for forward, back, and strafing movements. 
 The only problem is that the mouse also has forward and back motion input, and there's nothing 
 in the control setup that allows you to change this. When it comes time to do some platform jumping 
 as is the case in almost every level, the forward motion of the mouse disrupts you as you're trying 
 to turn. Most of the jumping occurs over some lethal hazard, and as a result, many deaths can occur 
 simply from an unintentional mouse movement. These problems are eliminated through the use of a 
 gamepad, but the necessity of using a peripheral input device when this simple problem could have 
 been solved with some mouse tweaking really makes for some frustrating moments.  

 The viewing modes are another major problem. There are three viewing modes: first-person, over-the-shoulder, 
 and finally, a top-down look on the playing field. The game is at its most intense in the first-person 
 view. The over-the-shoulder view is nice as well but doesn't show the keen technical display of 
 the cockpit. The last mode is the top-down view that removes you from the intensity of the playing 
 field but seems to be the only real way to do well at the game; keeping your backside free from 
 possible dangers is just as important as taking out the foes in front. This basically makes the 
 first two views useless except as eye candy for those of you eager to watch the bugs up close. 

 Apart from these concerns, the levels themselves are sometimes a bit confusing. After defeating 
 a round of centipedes, there is usually a portal that opens into a new area, but the direction 
 of this is not always obvious. And at times, the boss levels require you to eliminate a time-wasting 
 horde of weak foes in order to get to the main boss area. So if you die while fighting the boss, 
 chances are you have to wade through some busy work before you face it again.  

 While this review may sound really negative, the game, when not frustrating, is really a lot of 
 fun. Killing the bugs and gathering power-ups is quite invigorating and makes good use of its arcade 
 and first-person-shooter roots. The levels are colorful and don't get repetitive.  

 Remakes such as Centipede recall a time when genre had little meaning and the path to an arcade 
 hit was really a shot in the dark. Despite some control problems associated with the levels and 
 a lack of useful playing views, the game is enjoyable. If you're a gamer with some patience and 
 a capacity to forgive some oversights, Centipede will reward you with some exciting moments. But 
 if you're a stickler for hard-core rocket-launcher action, better leave the bugs to themselves.

Review:  New improvement to an all time classic. Better 3D than 2D but also conceptually. Rebuilt from an 
 era that will never die. Creative new levels to fight in. This game truly brought a classic back 
 to life and better. That should be as technology gets better. Don't nobody tell that to the movie 
 industry. Take it from someone who was a young teen when the first game console (Atari) came out. 
 A time where you would spend you allowance in the arcade room (aka Mr Arcade) . You have to play 
 the original then play this to fully grab the essence of what they accomplished. Most people never 
 do better than the original but kudos to those that did. If you dont believe me then come to my 
 house and find out for yourself. The games are free but the lessons are a killer. I only take cash 
 please but for Game Spot user I can make an exception.

Review:  A very good game if you are a arcade junkie like me... I love almost all the remakes because I 
 am a fan of the classics... If you have never played centipede before, you are in for a treat... 
 It includes updated 3-D version of Centipede so if you want practice, just play that... The main 
 game is very hard but it's very rewarding to beat... I beat it and I loved the ending, but I also 
 loved the intro... Some features I love are the powerups as well as the views for the gameplay... 
 The have overhead and first-person and others... The bosses are a little hard and so are the swarms 
 and traps, if your not careful you might be eating dirt...

Review:  I bought Centipede with high expectations - I played the demo and the concept seemed really cool 
 - take the 2D shooter and make it 3D.
  
  The transformation went extremely well. The game is interesting and very playable. The levels are 
 interesting and engaging. The game has "sections" that you finish with sets of challenges for each. 
 The game starts well, and is challenging like the old Centipede. I found the experience (Graphics, 
 sound and playability) extremely strong, especially compared to a lot of "updated" or revisioned 
 arcade adaptations.
  
  I felt that the game's pacing and difficulty were perfect..... until about 80% through the game. 
 At that point, I think the developers decided that it'd be easier to just drop you in scenarios 
 you would most likely not be able to handle. That decision sucked the fun out of the game. I was 
 able to win, but felt that there was no play balancing at the end.
  
  The ending is pretty satisfying, but I cannot recommend the game due to the bad balancing near 
 the end. If you have a slowdown program or a tool to lock game variables, then you can make it 
 without getting too angry.
  
  Centipede wa enjoyable, but beware.

Review:  Gameplay:
  The gameplay is pretty good, but it could've been better if the shooter had more balance and jumping 
 height. But the shooting controls are really accurate and so are the special weapon controls.
 
  Graphics:
  In almost all of the arcade remakes, the graphics are always one of the best improvements. The 
 3D environment made the game more broad and spectacular instead of dull and boring. Also, with 
 the 3D environment and 3D textures, you could go whereever you wanted. The mountains and snow texturing 
 were the best.
  Sound:
  Sound is also one of the best improvements of Centipede. The music tracks fit perfectly into the 
 different worlds. For example, the Infernium soundtrack sounds eerie and scary, just like the world. 
 The Frostonia music was the best.
  Overall:
  Its a great remodification of the original arcade game. The arcade mode was made into 3D. The game 
 world was also made into cool 3D. The soundtracks were also marvelous. The only flaw is the game 
 control and the still-too little amount of moves that you can get. But besides that, its a great 
 game!
