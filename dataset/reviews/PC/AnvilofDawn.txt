:::Review:::
This title walks the line between the combat and puzzles genres very delicately, and most adventurers 
 will find the game maintains an enjoyable balance throughout. 

 It's been a long time since the release of Westwood's Lands of Lore, but most gamers will recognize 
 its obvious influence on the design of Anvil of Dawn, New World Computing's beginner-level RPG. 
 Even so, originality isn't everything, and the company has done a commendable job of combining 
 solid graphics and animation with the successful play style of Westwood's classic.  

 Players start the game by choosing one of five characters, each with their own special gifts in 
 qualities including strength, agility, and magic use. Once their identity is sorted out, players 
 will use the game's pleasingly simple first person, turn-based interface to move through Tempest, 
 a war torn world that (as usual) requires a hero (or heroineand I commend New World for their 
 inclusion of two female player characters) to sort things out. As the game progresses, characters 
 will face dozens of enemies, all of them unique, not the typical Tolkienesque denizens of most 
 RPGs. Weapons range from commonplace items such as spears, bows, axes and swords to magical armament 
 that enables players to stand up against some of the game's more powerful opponents. Twenty-five 
 spells are also available in seven different disciplines (Earth, Wind, Fire, Water, Lightning, 
 Flesh, and Void) for characters wily enough to learn them. This title walks the line between the 
 combat and puzzles genres very delicately, and most adventurers will find the game maintains an 
 enjoyable balance throughout.  

 There's no doubt that Anvil of Dawn reformulates something that's been done before, but in the end, 
 it's a pretty good rehash. The game's entertaining storyline, easy-to-understand statistics, and 
 functional game balance earn it a place on any beginning RPG fan's shelf. On the flip side, those 
 who are looking for an RPG with depth of play and characters that can be highly personalized will 
 probably walk away from this title disappointed.

Review:  Now, where should one start to describe a masterpiece? I can't think of anything about the game 
 that could have been done better. If you don't understand it by now, the game will receive a score 
 of 5 - without ANY doubts whatsoever! 
  
  You are one of five heroes called forth to rescue a kingdom from total destruction. Your choice 
 of character will affect the story of the game. You might not notice these small changes at the 
 beginning of the game, but they will be more noticeable at later stages. There are, for instance, 
 completely different endings for each character. This brings us to the next aspect of the game: 
 playability. Is the game worth playing five times in order to see the different endings? The short 
 answer would be Yes. As RPGs go, this one scores incredibly high on playability. You are free to 
 go anywhere you please. Maybe you want to go directly to the top of the Ancient Tree, before going 
 anywhere else (just to get the magic branch that will help you greatly in your quest) , or maybe 
 you want to free the King of the orange gorillas and gain his support against the Warlord. Perhaps 
 you want to follow the book and do as the Old One tells you (go straight to the Dark Lantern and 
 consult the mage that dwells within) ... The choice is yours. Whatever you choose, the task will 
 not be simple. 
  
  But what could possibly hinder you? 
  Well, enemies of course. All the enemies you meet are either colourful (the tree-men) , fantastic 
 (dragons) , massive (orange gorillas) , realistic (Scots complete with kilts) , difficult (fire-breathing 
 stone statues) , annoying (knife-wielding snakes) or all of the above. The ones mentioned here are 
 just a small percentage of the actual creatures you will meet. The way to beat the different monsters 
 will be to memorize their attack patterns. Every abomination will have its own way of attacking, 
 so you need to have a good memory. Don't worry. It's not too hard to learn. Other than things to 
 kill, you will also meet things to speak to; so-called NPCs. These are as special and diverse as 
 the monsters are varied. Some will have items they want to give you, some might give you clues, 
 and some might just be frustrating, but none of them is boring! The thing that repeats itself, 
 however, is that most of them want you to help them in some way. A thing I really like about the 
 talking in the game is that you can watch the facial expression of your character in the picture. 
 The dialogues are truly masterpieces, as each sentence has been carefully carved into a state of 
 perfection! The plot in the game derives from these conversations, and so the plot becomes deep 
 and alive because of these interactions with the different NPCs. Lastly, there is a third group 
 you will meet from time to time: the other four heroes. Depending on the character you chose, their 
 tales will be different. And you will meet them all over the land. 
  
  How would you fight the many dangers in this world? 
  With weapons, magic and lots of healing 
 potions! There are numerous weapons available in the game. These fall under different categories: 
 hacking, slashing, thrusting and ranged. You train yourself in these categories, so you will need 
 to make the best of both your abilities and your weapon (s) . Each weapon is also carefully made 
 and they all look great! They also have different damage scores. Just like a pen-and-paper RPG, 
 these scores are listed as, for instance, 2d8 (meaning two eight-sided dice added together) . The 
 way you fight in the game is simple. You left-click to use the item/weapon in your left hand, and 
 right-click to use your right hand. Since the weapons are so well-made, the game's creators had 
 to do something special about the magic as well. They solved it by having the character draw different 
 symbols in real-time in order to cast a spell. This creates a unique effect and also makes your 
 character seem more alive. All the spells belong to different classes and have different symbols 
 and they also come with a shortcut on the game's interface. How could it be any simpler? As for 
 inventory, you have infinite pockets. Just remember that more weight will make you tired more quickly. 
 Fatigue means you lose strength and agility. Not something you would want before an important fight. 
 As the game progresses, you will come across sacks and chests that will greatly help you organize 
 your inventory. And before I forget it: Do NOT underestimate the value of rocks and boulders! These 
 are used as weights on different scales all through the game. 
  
  The game is divided into two worlds: the dungeon-inspired sites (where all the fighting will take 
 place) and the travel map. The rendered backgrounds for the travel map are extraordinary. Take 
 a look at the screens on the right. 
  
  I could go on all week about this game and its greatness, but I won't. Look at the screens and 
 download it at once. It is without a doubt THE best RPG I have ever played!

Review:  This game is an oldie, but when it came out, it trumped the other major RPG that was out at the 
 time, Stonekeep. The graphics are very dated now, but back then 3D was just taking off, and not 
 many people had video cards that did true 3D. This was the age when 3D processing came on a seperate 
 card that you ran your real video card through. If you like old school RPGs like Dungeon Master, 
 Ultima Underworlds, and Eye of the Beholder though, this game is still worth a look. My review 
 is not to compare this game to the games of today, rather it is to compare this game to the ones 
 that were out at the time. So don't expect to go into it with high expectations for the graphics 
 and sound. But the story is still decent, and the game is still fun. Check it out. Those baby/spider 
 things still give me the creeps.
