:::Review:::
An extremely realistic bowling title, complete with some of the best big-money bowlers in the world 
 today. 

 Bowling. A sport that depends more on talent and raw wrist power than actual physical conditioning. 
 A sport that can be so laid back that there's even a section of it that involves buying beer. While 
 THQ can't bring you a six-pack should you throw a strike on the seventh frame, it does manage to 
 deliver an extremely realistic bowling title, complete with some of the best big-money bowlers 
 in the world today.  

 To start, you can create your own bowler or simply choose one of the 13 Brunswick Pro Staff bowlers 
 in the game. Each bowler has a little video clip (similar to THQ's wrestling game, WCW Nitro) that 
 proclaims how much of a badass he is. These clips provide the most hilarious gaming moments in 
 recent memory. Each video is chock-full of bad reads, funny-looking bowler types, and poorly conveyed 
 braggadocio.  

 There are a few different gameplay modes to choose from. Exhibition games get you going quickly, 
 with no strings attached. Just pick a bowler and get on with it. Other modes include the skins 
 game, the tournament, career mode, and cosmic bowling, which turns the lanes into a discotheque. 
 The lane is realistically oiled, which forces you to move around the lane and vary your rolls as 
 conditions change, but this doesn't really make the game terribly hard. Expect to bowl around 150 
 within your first two games.  

 The graphics are much more than you'd expect from a bowling game. There are tons of different camera 
 angles, which are automatically selected on each roll of the ball. The players look like their 
 real-life counterparts and are fairly well animated. The music in Brunswick is surprisingly good. 
 The music changes on each frame. The sound effects are also very well done.  

 All in all, Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling is a pretty good game. It isn't the type of game you'll 
 play every day, unless you're some kind of bowling nut. Even if you aren't a bowling fan, and couldn't 
 care less about this game, you really should see the video clips at least once. They're incredibly 
 funny.

Review:  Nowadays, the words "bowling video game" pretty much mean bad news. Sure, there are some free bowling 
 games online, but for those of you looking for a nice, solid bowling game for your computer, that's 
 bigger and more detailed in graphics and gameplay than the free online flash games, well your options 
 have been kind of limited. So, here's a game that's 8 years old, and surely it's not perfect, but 
 it's probably the best computer bowling game on the market. 
  
  The game modes are pretty simple. You've got exhibition, which is the normal bare bones bowling. 
 You get skins games, where you play for money, tournament mode which is basically the bowling equivalent 
 to the console sports games' season modes, and Cosmic bowling, which adds all kinds of pretty colors. 
 There's also a character creation option which is pretty good for a game of it's time, but nothing 
 truly great there. I prefer to just play as the real pro bowlers.
  
  The bowling gameplay itself is pretty simple, but addictive. It mostly works like golf games. You 
 take aim, choose which ball you want to use, choose whether you want to put spin on the ball, and 
 if so, how much spin. And then you let 'er rip with mouse clicks on a meter that moves back and 
 forth. One for speed and one for accuracy. Simple. When the ball gets there, the pins all animate 
 with tremendous realism. It'd probably be hard to get pins to move in a more realistic fashion 
 even after 8 years. 
  
  Putting spin on the ball is a skill that takes practice to learn, but after you've learned it, 
 it helps you knock the pins down. But there's one big flaw with the gameplay. You don't need to 
 ever put any spin on the ball. If you just send it straight down, a little bit off so it doesn't 
 go directly in the middle, it's easy to either strike or spare most of the time, which isn't very 
 realistic. 
  
  As for the graphics, they're pretty much standard, and what you'd expect from an 8 year old PC 
 game. The highlight is the pins' animation, as I mentioned before. The pins never go down in the 
 same way twice, and the effect looks very good and real. The rest of the graphics haven't quite 
 stood the test of time. The character models look horrible by today's standards, and the crowds 
 look like someone took photos of a bowling crowd and just put it right in the game in 5 minutes. 
 The balls and lanes look better than the player models, but they aren't amazing either. Also, the 
 game has pretty long loading times, especially when you're playing a game with more than one bowler, 
 as there's a very long load time when switching between bowlers. When you're playing with only 
 one bowler, this load time isn't there though.
  
  The sound is pretty much par for the course. There's the sound of the ball rolling down the lane, 
 and there's a few different sounds for the ball hitting the pins, depending on how hard the pins 
 were hit and how many were knocked down, and the crowd claps, but that's it. There's no voice clips 
 of any kind, and the music is extremely limited. 
  
  But despite the uninspired graphics and sound, the actual bowling gameplay is good enough to stand 
 on it's own. This game is the kind of game you'd play for a few days, then put it away for a few 
 months. But then come back again some day when you're in the "bowling mood". As such, this game 
 definitely will not appeal to someone who doesn't like bowling, and it's much more suited to the 
 die-hard bowling fans, as casual fans would probably be perfectly satisfied with one of those free 
 online flash games. 
  
  I personally really enjoyed this game though. It's a lot of fun if you're into bowling, and it's 
 fun trying to beat your best score. Getting a 300 game is nearly impossible in this game, but it's 
 fun to keep trying. In the end, Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling is one of the best bowling games 
 available, and is sure to please any fan of bowling. The video clips of the bowlers basically making 
 themselves look like they're trying to be bad professional wrestlers is also a very fun bonus, 
 and it's good to add some light-hearted laughs to this game. If you love bowling, go find this 
 game somewhere. It's 8 years old so I imagine it'd be pretty cheap.
