:::Review:::
I may live to regret admitting this, but I had a blast playing MTM. 

 I'll admit that when first assigned Microsoft's Monster Truck Madness, I wasn't too eager to break 
 open the box. Having never attended an actual Monster Truck event, I imagined fairground stadiums 
 with their typical patrons - beer swillin', tobacco spittin', hicks from the Midwest - who love 
 anything with big tires and lots of horsepower. I didn't expect a game based on the sport to be 
 any more sophisticated.   

 I may live to regret admitting this, but I had a blast playing MTM. Seeing the water and mud fly 
 off the studded tires as I plowed through rivers and tore down roads while racing against some 
 of the greats like Grave Digger and Snake Bite brought out my racing alter ego. When I soared through 
 the air and returned to earth with several body-jarring suspension-testing bounces, I practically 
 jumped from my chair from the impact. One unamused co-worker commented on my uncharacteristic hollers 
 as I rolled my rig and missed a critical checkpoint.   

 MTM is truly a Monster Truck experience. With a choice of 10 famous Monster Trucks and the legendary 
 Monster Truck announcer Army Armstrong providing the racing commentary from the starting line to 
 the checkered flag, MTM seems pretty close to the real thing. But where actual Monster Truck events 
 are limited to races in coliseums on muddy tracks lined with crushed cars, MTM action includes 
 routes that traverse rivers, canyons, and highways. And since you're not required to stay on the 
 road, the driving surface seems to go on forever (gravity and grade permitting) .   

 MTM also boasts an impressive list of options. Giving you the ability to customize your vehicle 
 based on the track's condition, participate in four different events, view the race from at least 
 half a dozen angles, and compete against up to eight other players for a coveted first place in 
 the Hall of Fame, MTM never fails to have all the right racing stuff.  

 Graphically MTM falls a bit short in a few areas. While the background scenery is well-designed 
 and impressive, quirky graphic glitches appear when backing up in close to immovable objects (track 
 railings and hills) , and from some angles the vehicles look blocky. (Although when you're flying 
 over a gulch and bracing for the landing, you'll hardly notice ...)  

 MTM performs like the vehicles it showcases - larger than life, lots of action, and big fun. And 
 although I still don't plan on attending an actual Monster Truck event, pretending to take the 
 wheel of one of these babies was downright entertaining. Anyone got a beer?

Review:  MTM holds a special place in my gamer's heart because it was the first PC game that I had ever 
 played. The humbling part is that this was as recently, as the summer of '05 (busy life) .
  MTM lets you run single player or multiplayer (2) and has innovative (for an older title) online 
 play options. There are three modes of racing: Circuit, Rally, and Drag Of the three, I found the 
 circuit races to be the most gratifying, although Rally mode lets you parade around some pretty 
 cool landscapes.
  There are 10 monster trucks to choose from, many of which are not racing anymore or have been reinvented 
 in some way, i. e., 'Bigfoot'.
  Imo, MTM really shines in the physics department. The racing is top notch offering the player several 
 modes of difficulty to choose from. With some practice, you will find yourself moving up to 'Professional' 
 racing against a decent computer A. I. There are fantastic jumps and unique tracks to race on for 
 the willing racer. The only thing missing from the racing is a lack of damage modeling, which would 
 have improved the overall effect. But, for its time, MTM was one of the better racing games overall. 
 
  Pick up a gamepad, better yet, a wheel, and get into the madness!

Review:  When this game came out, it was the best thing I ever played. Really. I spent days on end trying 
 to break my records. My Brother would come and set new records, and I would obsess in beating it.
 
  
  The Graphics at the time was great. The movement of the Cars seem to be real for then. Now however 
 the game does not compare even close to what is out. But I will write this as if it was 1998 or 
 whatever.
  
  This is an awesome game!! I love the trucks. Every truck has a different way of handling terrain 
 and they really look super. The tracks are great as well with enough to keep you busy for a long 
 time. The Graphics is really good. The scenery is good too. I would definitely recommend this game 
 for people who love truck games.
  
  Back to 2006. If you want this game, get it, but don't look to hard for it. There are better Monstertruck 
 games out there for us new generation gamers, and I am sure there will be loads more on the way.

Review:  i suppose that it is for how old it is, obviously the graphics are very poor - so it the sound 
 but it is still a fun, addicting game, there are lots of monster truck to choose from and it can 
 be challenging when playing the computer some times... the courses are long, and you can overtake, 
 or be overtaken at any time, and if you make a slip, you can loose where you are and loose the 
 race, i think that the game is still OK, but i would still advise you to borrow or rent it fist, 
 because you might be very unimpressed by the graphics, otherwise it is OK, and i do not regret 
 getting it, although that was quite a long time ago...
