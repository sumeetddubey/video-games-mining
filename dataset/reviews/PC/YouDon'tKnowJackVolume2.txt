:::Review:::
You Don't Know Jack Volume 2 brings back everything that was exciting and fun about the original. 
 

 If you're into computer trivia games, you're probably already familiar with Berkeley Systems' amazingly 
 popular You Don't Know Jack title. With its irreverent humor, entertaining questions that tested 
 players' knowledge of both random trivia and pop culture, and simple party-style play controls, 
 You Don't Know Jack achieved not only critical success, but also a great deal of commercial success 
 as well. Enter the sequel. You Don't Know Jack Volume 2 brings back everything that was exciting 
 and fun about the original, and throws in a host of new questions, along with plenty more jokes 
 and music, without ever threatening the title's fantastic balance or playability.  

 If you're not familiar with the original, You Don't Know Jack Volume 2 will be a welcome treat. 
 Basically the game is set up like a television game show with the players gathered around the computer 
 acting as contestants. Using an assigned key as a "buzzer," each player tries to be the first to 
 answer each of the trivia tidbits that pops up on the screen (a game can consist of seven or 21 
 question rounds) . The questions, while always somewhat bizarre in their presentation, are both 
 intellectually challenging and entertaining, and run the range of pop culture silliness, drawing 
 parallels between the Brady Bunch and Shakespeare or Charles Manson and television theme songs. 
 Throughout all of this, the host provides quick-witted and surprisingly humorous off-color commentary. 
 Although this smart-ass commentary may turn off more conservative players, most normal folks will 
 find the constant patter to be amusing and realistic enough to never get irritating.  

 New features have been included - there's new question categories like: DisOrDat, in which players 
 separate words at high speed into two or more classifications; Celebrity Collect Calls that summon 
 up weird stars (Dennis Miller and Phyllis Diller have been included, so relax) to deliver 
 bizarre questions; and Picture Questions (the only new category that Berkeley was unable to trademark) 
 that add a visual twist to the typically sound-oriented game. New songs have also been added to 
 introduce each question number, but continue in the original's tradition of poking fun at nearly 
 every category of past or present music.  

 If there's any real fault in You Don't Know Jack Volume 2, it's that there's not that much difference 
 between it and its predecessor. Yes, there are a bunch of new questions, and yes, all of the patter 
 has been replaced, and granted the new counting songs are really funny, but in the end, those changes 
 are all superficial. Even so, as the old adage goes, "If it ain't broke don't fix it," and for 
 once it looks like somebody had the sense to leave a winner of an idea alone. A must buy for fans 
 of the genre.

Review:  As far as trivia games go, this is one of the better ones. The You Don't Know Jack series is one 
 of the best trivia series out on the market. I haven't seen many other editions come out, but the 
 2nd one is one of the best.
  
  The game allows for three players at the same time. You answer trivia questions of various point 
 values and have the opportunity to screw someone into answering a question. The host has a humorous 
 way of asking the questions and can get down right insulting. He kind of sounds like David Spade, 
 but funnier.
  
  There is a limit to the number of questions and extended play will allow you to have an edge when 
 the questions repeat themselves. Either way, it is a fun multiplayer trivia game, or you can enjoy 
 trying to get a high score.
