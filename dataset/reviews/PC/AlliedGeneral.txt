:::Review:::
The gameplay is surprisingly addictive when compared to other games of this genre, and should appeal 
 to both wargamers and non-wargamers alike. 

 Allied General is basically a rehash of Panzer General but this time you command the Allies in their 
 quest to evict the Third Reich from North Africa, the Steppes of Russia, and finally Fortress Europe 
 itself. The game features familiar hexagonal grids and turn based play, so fans of traditional 
 wargames will feel right at home with the basics of its interface. The emphasis in Allied General, 
 like Panzer, is on the strategic deployment of men and material on the battlefield. As in a real 
 war, you must pay close attention to logistics and troop deployment to emerge victorious. The game 
 is divided into 3 campaigns, each composed of a series of strategic battles that must be completed 
 successfully. The units you have available for each individual battle is based on your performance 
 in the previous scenario, a feature that adds greatly to the overall realism of the game.   

 The artificial intelligence used in AG is adjustable, so you can control just how magnificent 
 Rommel really is. Unfortunately, I found that once you have mastered a particular scenario, the 
 same strategy seems to work time and time again. This is not as serious as it might sound, however, 
 as there are enough individual scenarios to keep even George Patton busy for weeks.  

 Graphics and sound are adequate for a game of this genre, but fall short of the newer benchmarks 
 set by Steel Panthers. Units are represented by icons that occupy spaces on the grid, and when 
 combat erupts, small animated windows pop open to depict the action. AG also contains some of the 
 most authentic looking cutscenes (in the form of pseudo 1940's propaganda films) ever included 
 in a wargame. In the sound department, AG also performs adequately with sound effects that are 
 crisp and well done, if a bit spartan.   

 In all, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Allied General. The point and click interface and adjustable 
 difficulty settings allow beginners to jump right in, while still providing a challenge to the 
 experienced armchair warrior. The gameplay is surprisingly addictive when compared to other games 
 of this genre, and should appeal to both wargamers and non-wargamers alike. Recommended.

Review:  I was digging through my older collections in my closet and I found this, and again, I know I did'nt 
 finish it at the time I bought it!! So I hooked up my older computer and gave it another try, boy, 
 did it bring gack the memories!!!
  Panzer General games were a life-saver for me, they were fun and challanging at the time, something 
 from WW II that I could play around with besides building models and painting them up. I'm still 
 a little rusty on the gameplay, I have already reloaded many times to get a "perfect" game, but 
 I hav'nt found it yet. I'm on the therd battle for the U. S. side in Africa. It is really fun to 
 play with the prestige, as well as the experience cap to get the most out of your units. You know 
 you just have to start over when your favorite unit gets killed, after nursing it along, feeding 
 it some of the weaker units that it kills to gain that one more extra star.
  
  My planes seem to be the ones that take the most hits and gets killed off, so I have to start over 
 again, the German air is just to strong sometimes, compared to other units.

Review:  I thought this was a tactical /strategic masterpiece. In a lot of ways the General series really 
 was in 1996. I was fun to play and scrutinize. I learned a lot I didn't know about WW2. I spent 
 many hours tweaking my units and coming up with the best logical plans. This was a very successful 
 series at the time. There was a lot of recognizable features for folks that played table top strategy 
 games, such as the hex squares and the movements counters, and the way your units went up in rank 
 as they became more veteran. The whole generals series I found very enjoyable.
