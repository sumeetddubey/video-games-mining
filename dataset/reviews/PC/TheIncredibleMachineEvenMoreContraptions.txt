:::Review:::
Like its predecessor, Even More Contraptions is an excellent puzzle game that is sure to please 
 amateur inventors and puzzle game fans alike. 

  The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions gives you exactly what its name implies -- more puzzles. 
 The game is essentially identical to last year's Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions, 
 but it includes more than 250 new puzzles divided into several different difficulty levels. Like 
 its predecessor, Even More Contraptions is an excellent puzzle game that features humorous Rube 
 Goldberg-style machines, and it is sure to please amateur inventors and puzzle game fans alike. 
           The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions is appropriately titled.    

  Each puzzle in the game has a set objective that can be anything from feeding cheese to a mouse 
 to lining up different types of balls in a cage. To accomplish these feats, you must place different 
 items into a partially assembled contraption. The game offers more than 100 machine parts that 
 include simple items such as bricks, bowling balls, rope, and pulleys, and more complex parts like 
 lasers, timers, miniature blimps, explosives, toasters, and fans. There are also a number of humorous 
 and unusual parts, like an ape-powered motor, a mouse-powered motor, an alligator, and a miniature 
 person. Each puzzle has a limited number of specific items, and you must try to place them in the 
 correct positions to complete the chain reaction that will achieve the desired result. A puzzle 
 might require a ball to fall onto a lever, which pulls a rope attached to a spring-loaded match, 
 which lights the fuse to a rocket, and so forth. What makes the puzzle challenging is that only 
 a portion of the items are in place at the beginning, and it is up to you to complete the contraption. 
   

  To avoid unnecessary frustration, the game includes hints for all but the most difficult puzzles, 
 and it encourages a trial-and-error approach to puzzle solving. Once you get a setup that you think 
 might work, just press the start button and see what happens. There are no penalties for failed 
 attempts -- in fact, most puzzles can be solved in multiple ways, and even incorrect solutions are 
 often entertaining. In addition, failed attempts will often yield clues to a correct solution. 
 The freedom with which you can position items, the multiple solutions to each puzzle, and the game's 
 use of Newtonian physics give the game a sense of realism despite its apparent outrageousness. 
 Balls bounce the way they should, ropes and levers work as they should, and while antigravity pads 
 don't actually exist in real life, they operate in the game as you would imagine they should.  
          The hundreds of new puzzles offer plenty of fun and variety.    

  In addition to the wealth of single-player puzzles, the game includes a complete tutorial, more 
 than 60 head-to-head puzzles, and a puzzle construction set so you can create your own puzzles 
 and share them with other players over the Internet. The game's point-and-click interface is intuitive, 
 and while the game's two-dimensional graphics won't impress players who are used to the latest 
 3D technology, they do a good job of representing the contraptions in a colorful cartoon style. 
 The music in the game is upbeat and enjoyable, although it can get old after you've been working 
 on a puzzle for a long period of time. The game's sound effects are effective -- dynamite explodes 
 with a bang, balloons pop, and the ape on the treadmill growls and yawns. In addition, all of the 
 game's objectives and instructions that appear in text on the screen are read out loud by the host. 
   

  Overall, The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions gives fans of the previous game a whole 
 new set of challenging puzzles, and it is also an appropriate game for puzzle fans who haven't 
 tried the previous games in the series. Like its predecessor, it is sure to appeal to amateur inventors, 
 fans of Rube Goldberg, and puzzle game fans of all ages.

Review:  Well well well, guest what? i ve been playing this cute game since primary school, yet that time 
 still in DOS Mode version ! Until Last week, i wanna find something for the kids, suddenly i remember 
 about this game. And, surprisingly, i found a windows based incredible machine ! What a cheer.
 
  
  It might not suitable for me now as in my age, but for a kid, this is what we call science, or 
 galaxy, or even education for them. Most of all, this game really give us a big imagination world. 
 Just a simple tool like a ball or a brick, u can fill a mission impossible! does it sound great 
 ?
  
  Its difficult for us to describe the habitat of this game, as it never happened before in other 
 type of games! its a new way to for us to play a mind blower game. Hope that all of u enjoy it 
 !!

Review:  They started making the Incredible Machine a little more than 10 years ago. This is the latest 
 installment, so unfortunately Sierra hasnt made one of these since 2001. ARE YOU LISTENING SIERRA? 
 MAKE MORE INCREDIBLE MACHINE! If you like puzzle games or games involving logic, you will love 
 this game. What will happen is you will be given a series of parts to create a complex machine 
 to perform a simple task. If have ever heard of a Rube Goldberg Machine, or if you have seen 
 the breakfast machine at the beginning of Back to the Future, you know what Im talking about. 
 Just go to this website to see some more examples: 
  
  http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg
  
  Anyways, there will be a Rube Goldberg machine 
 with the vital parts left out. Your job is to finish the machine. There will be more than 200 of 
 such scenarios called contraptions, and they range in difficulty from pathetically easy to impossibly 
 difficult, so anyone can pick up and play this game. The gameplay is solid and the only setback 
 to this game might be that the graphics are a little dated and the sound isnt phenomenal (usually 
 I just turn the music off and play something of Windows Media Player) . You can also do two-player 
 multi-player, which can get pretty crazy when both of you have different ways of solving the contraptions. 
 You can also create your own contraptions, and you used to be able to share them over the internet, 
 but Sierra shut that site down. WHY DID YOU DO THAT SIERRA? Anyways, this is a great game and is 
 worth the $5-$10 its going for on Amazon and eBay. So what are you waiting for? Go to Amazon/eBay 
 and get The Incredible Machine Even More Contraptions. You wont regret it.
  P. S. This is one of my first Reviews so I would REALLY like it if I could get some feedback on 
 this. If you could, I really appreciate it if you would send me a message if there is anything 
 wrong with this. Thanks.
