:::Review:::
The best pinball games have hidden levels, animated beasties, and plenty of surprises. Balls of 
 Steel has all the above. 

 The Bally table king of PC pinball sims is Empire's Pro-Pinball: Timeshock! With its realistic look, 
 visceral feel, and dynamic lighting, plus the customizability of its one deeply entertaining table, 
 it's without peer. But Balls of Steel gives Timeshock! a run for its money, even bettering it in 
 some aspects.  

 To be sure, this is a narrow PC gaming niche. But fanatics seeking the ultimate PC pinball experience 
 abound, and an accessible and enjoyable game like BOS may draw in some new players. What gamers 
 want is something equal to and ultimately greater than what electromechanical tables can provide. 
 They're looking for true physics and a proper table presence: Can you make a "dead catch" with 
 a flipper; does the ball look like it's rolling, rather than flying like a Frisbee; and do the 
 rails, bumpers, and targets react realistically? In addition, does the PC sim bring in elements 
 that only a PC game can include? There should be more to the game than simply racking up points 
 by keeping the ball in play. The best games have hidden levels, animated beasties, and plenty of 
 surprises. BOS has all the above.  

 Each of its five tables has a theme, from barbarians slaying dragons to space commandos on alien 
 search-and-destroy missions. Those themes play out gradually and it may take hours before you see 
 the entire retinue of a table's features. Hit the right target sequence and you can set off a horde 
 of scurrying ants that, when rolled over, squish with a satisfying "splat." In other circumstances 
 you may have to complete a series of events: Defuse a bomb threat by shooting your ball up the 
 airport ramp several times to "load the buses," then send the ball up the freeway ramp to escape 
 before detonation. This variety puts BOS a cut above Timeshock! in playability.  

 And like many modern-day electromechanical tables, BOS also offers a dot-matrix graphic display 
 that presents minigames, like a variation of five-card Monte or a space alien shooting gallery. 

 You can display the table in one of two ways: full screen or scrolling. Unfortunately neither is 
 completely satisfying. The scrolling mode's graphics are finely detailed, but you might as well 
 be a deaf, dumb, and blind kid to play it. When the flippers are in view your targets typically 
 are not. The 800x600 full-screen mode looks fine, but a lot of the graphic detail is lost in the 
 compression. And both displays pale in comparison with Timeshock!'s multiple, isometric, full-screen 
 views that display at up to 1280x1024 in 24-bit color. In addition, BOS doesn't come close to the 
 superb lighting effects used in Timeshock!'s illuminated bumpers and elsewhere on its table.  

 
 Other drawbacks include a plunger that generally has no variable pull-back distance. In some instances 
 the opening roll is too strong, and the ball always misses a target that would come into play if 
 you could make a small adjustment. The sound effects and music are both OK, but nothing spectacular. 
 You can "nudge" the table from the left, right, and center, and that may affect the ball's movement, 
 but there's virtually no visual or aural feedback. The table image remains rock steady. And while 
 you can vary gameplay from novice (the ball saver is active for several minutes) and standard five-ball 
 play to three-ball arcade games, there's no other table customizability. Like Timeshock! you can 
 record your high scores on a web site (Worldscores. com) for all to see.  

 If you're looking for the ultimate in PC pinball sim realism, BOS won't satisfy you. Rather, where 
 BOS succeeds is in its fun factor. As you'd expect from a game that includes a Duke Nukem table 
 ("I have balls of steel") , there's fun to be had here. Couple that with online bragging rights 
 (some gamers have managed to keep a game going for ten hours, rolling up scores in the billions) 
 and you have a game worthy of the Pinball Wizard moniker.

Review:  I love pinball games for the computer. Bring them back! I don't know what happened. There was a 
 boom in the mid '90s and then all of a sudden, they stopped. Millions of tables were released, 
 most of which were entertaining... until you played one better. Balls of Steel was purchased simply 
 because of the Duke Nukem table. I loved nothing more than to listen to Duke talk smack while I 
 ran though an FSP the wasn't the greatest graphics wise, but a ton of fun to play. That sums up 
 this game; not the greatest graphics wise but a lot of fun to play. 5 tables were included and 
 4 of the 5 were rediculously addicting. The thing that I liked the most about these tables is that 
 the themes were handled almost perfectly. On top of that, you could always count on at least one 
 or two multiball sessions in each round. If you were good enough, you could achieve a five ball 
 multiball session. Theroughly entertaining. I haven't had a good pinball game come along in a long 
 time and due to my limited computer knowledge, I have been unable to get BOS to run under windows 
 XP with and success. If you know how to get it to work or have an older machine, I reccommend the 
 game. I miss it tremendously.
