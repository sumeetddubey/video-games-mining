:::Review:::
The developers have stayed true to the Sinistar's arcade roots, somewhat to the detriment of the 
 final product. 

 When Williams released Sinistar in 1983, the game had an unprecedented and brutal pace. You were 
 forced to simultaneously navigate an asteroid field, mine elusive crystals, and evade and destroy 
 fast enemy fighters, while keeping track of drone ships as they labored to construct a doomsday 
 machine. Trying to do all this while balancing a lit cigarette above the two-player start button 
 proved to be too much for the gamers of the era, and, as a result, Sinistar wasn't a huge success. 
 It's remembered today for one thing: The Sinistar itself, the most pissed-off boss monster in the 
 history of gaming. The gigantic Sinistar's ultimate goal was unclear. Its immediate goal, eating 
 your spaceship, was accompanied by a memorable anthology of hysterically shrieked catchphrases 
 including "Beware, I live!" and "Run coward!" and "Run! Run! Run!" THQ's Sinistar: Unleashed attempts 
 to bring Sinistar forward into 1999. Rather than significantly alter the structure of the original 
 game, as Activision did with its Battlezone remake, the developers have stayed true to the game's 
 arcade roots, somewhat to the detriment of the final product.  

 Sinistar has no plot. Or rather, like many pure arcade games, the plot is just a description of 
 the gameplay itself: You're a spaceship pilot. Your spaceship is in an asteroid field. Enemy drones 
 extract crystals from the asteroids and transport them to a huge, egg-shaped warp gate. When they've 
 delivered enough crystals, the gate opens and Sinistar comes out. And he's angry. Like the drones, 
 your ship can also mine crystals, which provide necessary energy for your shields and weapon systems. 
 You can delay the appearance of Sinistar by attacking the gate with crystal-powered sinibombs. 
 The longer you delay the opening of the gate, the weaker Sinistar is when he finally emerges and 
 the fewer sinibombs you'll have to employ to destroy him. Impeding your attacks on the gate is 
 an armada of heavily armed fighters. However, if you can delay the construction long enough, the 
 gate blows apart, ending the level without your having to actually fight Sinistar. This routine 
 is repeated over and over again at an escalating degree of difficulty.  

 Both the original and Sinistar: Unleashed share this "plot." GameFX Technology has added an assortment 
 of new weapons and power-ups, elevated the graphics to modern standards, and replaced the two-dimensional 
 top-down viewpoint of the original with a fully three-dimensional flight model. The Sinistar of 
 1983 used nothing more than a joystick and two buttons, while Sinistar: Unleashed features no fewer 
 than 48 separate controls. Many of these can be safely ignored, but enough remain important to 
 make playing the game with a standard gamepad effectively impossible. You'll either need to use 
 a decent flightstick (at which point you'll still be reaching for the keyboard) or a combination 
 of the mouse and keyboard. The control is overly complex for a mindless shooter and could benefit 
 from some streamlining. For instance, there is no way to simply scroll through your available power-up 
 items and choose one, as you can with weapons. Each of nine possible item slots is assigned a separate 
 key with another set of keys used to access specific types of special items, of which there are 
 seven. That's a total of 16 keys for choosing power-ups, making it impossible to assign this important 
 function to the joystick. It's a simple oversight, but one that has a real effect on gameplay. 
 If you're developing a fast-action arcade game, and the control scheme can't be stuffed into a 
 ten-button joystick, it might be time to rethink your design.  

 Once you get past the control's built-in frustrations, Sinistar: Unleashed is fun for a while. Its 
 problem is that it slavishly adheres to the repetitive nature of its predecessor. GameFX has tried 
 to mix things up a little by making every fourth board of the game's 24 a "bonus level" in which 
 you perform some task other than fend off the Sinistar. These levels are basically timed dogfights 
 that involve either destroying or protecting a particular object. They're a nice break and a good 
 test of the piloting skills you've been developing in the gate boards. There's also some variation 
 with regard to the Sinistar itself. Instead of a single design, as seen in the original, each of 
 the standard boards houses a unique Sinistar with its own attack style and weaknesses. However, 
 this leads to another of the game's frustrations. Saving is only allowed between levels, yet beating 
 each board is a time-consuming process that often takes as long as 20 or 30 minutes. To make matters 
 worse, you're allotted only one ship with which to complete each level. Dying usually occurs late 
 in the board while trying to discover a particular Sinistar's weakness, at which point you must 
 restart the level and play it for ten minutes until the Sinistar reappears. Rather than the "just 
 one more try" enthusiasm a great arcade game should cultivate, the length of each mission makes 
 the requirement of replaying it often seem like an epic chore.  

 Where Sinistar: Unleashed succeeds is in its graphics, which are unquestionably beautiful. The asteroid 
 field in which you play is dense and colorful. The game's well-rendered enemies die in impressive 
 explosions that leave chunks of space debris streaming by your ship. Unfortunately, the game's 
 aforementioned lack of variety proves to be a graphical liability as well. Once you've seen the 
 first gorgeous board, you've seen all the gorgeous boards. The background bitmap and some characteristics 
 of the lighting change from level to level, but after the first few you won't be expecting any 
 surprises. The sound effects are serviceable but not spectacular. All of Sinistar's classic dialogue 
 is intact and sounds great except for his death scream, which is oddly and inexcusably missing 
 and makes killing him not nearly as satisfying as it once was.  

 Sinistar: Unleashed is too complex and frustrating for the casual gamer, yet not deep enough for 
 today's hard-core player. With a little simplification, the game could have worked as a fun, mindless 
 time waster. Instead, it's merely a fabulous-looking example of why they don't make games like 
 Sinistar anymore.
