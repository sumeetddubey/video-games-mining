The real shame of it is there is a fine, fine flight simulator at the core of Aggressor. 

 Sometimes when I'm cleaning my ears I push the Q-tip just a little too far in, and it hits something 
 that hurts like hell. It kind of hums for a while and then settles into a dull ache. The thing 
 is, I can experience this sensation all I want for about a quarter cent per tip, whereas Bethesda 
 would have me pay upwards of $40 for relatively the same sensation. That throbbing in the brain, 
 that jabbing pain in the head: That's about what I took away from Bethesda's first attempt at a 
 flight simulation, F-16 Aggressor.  

 British flight sims are like the British: They may have one or two good bits, but it always goes 
 to hell when you get to the teeth. In the case of British sims, things always go to hell when you 
 get to the controls. They wind up assigning simple commands like "fire guns" to Alt + Ctrl + ~ 
 and so forth. Let's face it: There has never been a British sim that was worth a damn out of the 
 box. DID took two years to get EF2000 up to par, and Total Air War still isn't exactly burnin' 
 'em up. Rowan seems to assign controls by having a chicken pick at three successive keys and binding 
 all three to a common command like "raise flaps." And now we have GSI, composed of former employees 
 of DID, and their brainchild F-16 Aggressor. Their key assignments aren't as baroque as in other 
 games, but they've managed to commit the Unholy Trinity of sim no-nos: no key mapping, no joystick 
 configuration, and, stunningly, no keycard included in the packaging. It's almost like they want 
 to make your brain hurt.  

 F-16 Aggressor has puzzling aspirations. The designers actually set out to re-create Strike Commander. 
 Remember Strike Commander? It was going to be Origin's flight sim version of the Wing Commander 
 format, a narrative-driven mercenary flight simulation. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out quite 
 right. It was incredibly late, pretty buggy, and just not all that impressive. So of course it 
 makes perfect sense to emulate it. And then, to really nail the lid down, GSI emulates it badly. 

 The real shame of it is there is a fine, fine flight simulator at the core of Aggressor. GSI has 
 modeled the F-16's flight properties with commendable detail. The funky handling of the rudders 
 at certain speeds, tough landings, speed bleeding, and other things related to flight are all smack 
 on. It's a flight model worthy of the best F-16 sims, poised to offer the hard-core crowd everything 
 it could demand... until you get to the systems modeling. These are more on par with a Novalogic 
 game. The complex instrument modeling of Falcon 4.0 and other true hard-core sims is only hinted 
 at in Aggressor.  

 This is not a problem for a midlevel sim, but Aggressor has pretensions of hard-core greatness - 
 pretensions that crash to the ground due to grossly simplified radar controls. A sim has two prime 
 components: the modeling of the flight of the plane and the modeling of the systems. On one count, 
 the developers succeed at realism, and on the other, they fail. In the end, they scuttle all their 
 good programming by failing to offer any realism or difficulty switches whatsoever. The flight 
 model is set to its full realism level at all times. When you have a very realistic flight model, 
 an unrealistic set of sensors, and no ability to change the complexity of anything, you have some 
 truly schizoid problems.  

 Graphically, while F-16 is quite good, if at times mind-blowing, it's true that there are better-looking, 
 better-performing sims out there. The terrain is a bit patchy, but object modeling is good. Cockpits 
 look very good and have effective dynamic animations for throttle and stick. HUD overlays and quick-view 
 keys provide excellent perspectives on the instruments. In another stunning lapse, however, GSI 
 has failed to include a padlock view. This makes situational awareness well nigh impossible and 
 deals another serious blow to the sim.  

 Possibly the most baffling aspect of F-16 is its alleged "mercenary flight sim" nature. You would 
 expect to have to fly missions to earn money to pay for weapons and upkeep on your planes. That 
 was the plan in early specs for this game, and there are traces of it left. You still fly for money, 
 but the money is merely used to rate your performance. It has no other function. As for the "mercenary" 
 element, it's mainly limited to mission structure and some cursory background info. Missions range 
 across Africa and include a fair selection of strike and dogfighting action. Without any in-game 
 mission statements or target priorities, it's often hard to remember just what you're supposed 
 to be doing. The quick-start missions allow for some custom dogfighting configurations, but there's 
 no mission editor. As for the AI, it's OK, but nothing special. Wingmen (when you have them, which 
 is rarely) aren't much help, and enemy pilots aren't all that aggressive. At least Aggressor has 
 multiplayer, which compensates for these failings only slightly.  

 Aside from a very good flight model, there really isn't a lot for which to recommend F-16 Aggressor. 
 For a company to create a sim with not only no key mapping, but also no key assignment card, is 
 just mind-blowing. (You can find the key assignments buried in a 200-page manual.) This feels like 
 a game that started out really good, with some strong elements and good design intentions. But 
 then it got delayed over and over, features were dropped, sections removed, and finally it just 
 shipped. You know, like most computer games.

Review:  "British flight sims are like the British: They may have one or two good bits, but it always goes

  .. So only British flight sims have poor controls?
  
  Re-map the keys then.
  
  (if possible) .
  
  The teeth remark.. why.. that's just stupid, 
 and how no bearing on a gaming review.. most British teeth are of a high standard, maybe it wasn't 
 like that in yesteryear. but this is today, maybe your reviews would be more accurate if you stop 
 using poor analogy's and concentrate on the review.
