:::Review:::
Anacapri has more in common with the ancient gameplay of early '90s adventures than anything modern, 
 but even as a pseudo-nostalgia piece, it's no fun at all. 

  Someone needs to tell S&amp; G Software that it's no longer 1993. Creating games with photographs 
 and video clips in place of digitally created images is about as culturally relevant today as a 
 new Coolio CD, so it's hard to see what the developer was thinking when it made Anacapri: The Dream. 
 This throwback to the era of The 7th Guest may include thousands of photographs of one of the most 
 gorgeous vacation spots on the planet, but it plays more like something you found at a yard sale 
 than a game you pulled down from the new releases shelf.  

  The line between games and movies is sort of blurred in the structure of the game. While the play 
 style holds tight to the point-and-click adventure template, the game is constructed solely with 
 still photos that give your jaunt the vibe of an indie film. So even though you play a stereotypical 
 sleuth looking to solve the mystery of the ancient Obsidian Disk on the island of Capri, the atmosphere 
 is quite different from the sorts of adventures you might be accustomed to. Thousands of photos 
 depicting everything from seaside vistas to cobblestone roads, to the many quaint shops lining 
 the narrow streets of the titular town of Anacapri, give you the impression that you've embarked 
 on a real trip to the exotic Mediterranean locale. The gameworld is absolutely massive, so it frequently 
 feels as if you're really exploring all of the crooks and crannies of the island.  

           Gorgeous pictures? Sure. But didn't this style of game design go out of vogue about fifteen 
 years ago?      

  However, there are prices to pay for this type of presentation and the sheer size of everything. 
 Many of the most potentially picturesque outdoor shots are blurry or strewn with artifacts, presumably 
 to keep picture size reasonable. Oddly, the most sharply detailed pics are the dull ones that show 
 a shopkeeper behind his counter or an old man sitting on a bench. Regardless of quality, there 
 is an air of absurdity to the whole affair because of the use of multiple shots of people during 
 conversations to give the illusion of movement. Done more subtly, this might have been a good idea, 
 and might have nicely added the illusion of movement to what is otherwise a breathless game. But 
 all of the changed poses and expressions given to Anacapri residents are wildly exaggerated, so 
 encounters with them come off like some sort of bizarre mime show. Finally, there are some technological 
 issues in the install process due to the high number of photographs. There are so many photos included 
 as single, high-resolution files that the installation takes almost as long as a flight to Capri 
 itself. You might want to brew a pot of coffee for this one, as it takes a good two hours for all 
 seven gigs of picture files to be transferred from the DVD to your hard drive.  

  Unfortunately, this time isn't well spent. The game amounts to little more than a great selection 
 of somebody else's vacation snaps. Gameplay lacks structure, due largely to the sheer size of the 
 island. The game itself is such an afterthought that it feels like something hacked together at 
 the last minute to justify writing off a vacation to Capri. Although you're assisted by a hotspot 
 system that highlights key locations on each photograph, it's ridiculously easy to get lost because 
 the entire island is open at the start of the game. Make a wrong turn, or simply get befuddled 
 over the game's many vague clues, and you're soon off on an unintentional sightseeing tour. Although 
 it's relatively easy to work your way through most in-game situations by doing some careful pixel 
 hunting, closely following all of your instructions, and continually checking the city and island 
 maps to see where you are, you still need a walkthrough to figure out how to get where you need 
 to go.  

  Adding to the confusion of Anacapri is a plot that values nonsense about the nature of reality 
 over the virtues of an easy-to-follow narrative. As if the real-world island wasn't hard enough 
 to figure out, you regularly have to chug dream syrup that sends you off to explore surreal lands 
 populated by ghosts and mythological monsters. Set-piece puzzles that bypass the absurdities of 
 the plot are the only strength here, and there aren't nearly enough of them to compensate for the 
 awfulness of everything else. Most don't even show up until near the end of the game, such as the 
 nifty series of sphinx riddles, and the tile puzzle that is one of the final barriers to the Obsidian 
 Disk.  

           Although you may not want to finish Anacapri the game, at least the snapshots will give 
 you some ideas for your next vacation.      

  Horrific voice acting and scripting, along with some truly weird musical choices, sprinkle extra 
 strangeness into everything. Strangers stop to talk as if they were long-lost friends, and the 
 topics of conversation often seem nonsensical until you start looking back on things and putting 
 together the big picture. All of the characters in the game are voiced by a handful of terrible 
 actors making lame attempts to change their voices with bad accents, which makes even real-world 
 interactions with people shimmer like hallucinations. The dialogue is universally overwrought, 
 characterized by lines such as "That disk will remain a dark stain on our past and humanity forever," 
 spoken with all of the passion of a fast-food counter jockey asking if you want to supersize your 
 value meal. Music is frequently jarring, and bounces all over the place between poppy lounge music 
 and driving guitar. It's like you're being stalked by somebody with a xylophone on wheels and Yngwie 
 Malmsteen, respectively. Thankfully, there are frequent, long stretches of silence.  

  If it were a relic from the early 90s, Anacapri: The Dream might be worth a play for the nostalgia 
 factor alone. A "so bad it's good" vibe also creeps into the adventure through the voice acting, 
 almost giving you the feeling that you're reliving some fond memory that hasn't aged particularly 
 well. But you're not, and considering that the longing for a bygone day is the only possible reason 
 for playing this backward game, you'll soon get tired of flipping through photographs and move 
 on to something more modern and more competently designed.

Review:  I haven't spent a lot of time on this game but I think there are better ones available. My friends 
 said it was great, but it turned out to be kind of boring. I'm a little annoyed because they said 
 they were giving me a deal by only charging me 80 bucks, but now I've got it and I go over to their 
 house they won't let me play Conan or even the old GTA4 until I finish Annimamundi. Unfortunately 
 I keep falling asleep when I try, so I may be stuck with it. Alternatively, I could save my allowance 
 and buy another game. 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789

Review:  The beautiful scenery of Capri island forces us to return to the series with brand new storyline 
 and characters. A Quiet Weekend used many real photographs, and this one continues the method to 
 bring you the rest of the island. You will gradually discover the diversified fauna, the damaged 
 castle and some rather hidden places like Blue Grottos and Green Grottos.
  
  The story opens with one of two people: Nico - a famous inspector with thorough knowledge of ancient 
 civilizations or Doctor Fredi - a researcher of the relationship between man's dreams and state 
 of mind. You will spend most of your time on many small paths in the island to discovery the mystery 
 of the game. Its whole beauty can not be seen right at the beginning. Different from A Quiet Weekend, 
 you don't travel on foot but by bus with a small ticket price, or telpher. After visiting a place, 
 you can return there using your map. Besides, it is fun to meet and talk to other characters in 
 the game, many of whom are imaginary or only exists in legend. Hence, deciding who can be trusted 
 is sometimes difficult. Another content that is developed in the story is finding Opxidian in oysters' 
 shell, which can grand power to whoever possesses it, but also brings about other misfortune.
 
  
  Puzzles are various and original. One of them requires you to run around to fix the bus ticket 
 selling machine. Before it's done, you can't use the bus so the area you can cover is very restricted. 
 Many others require speed and accuracy. Items will not appear or become usable until you talk to 
 the right person or enter a specific zone. But once the appear, they will be highlighted since 
 it's difficult to find them in such an immense environment otherwise. To figure out where to go 
 and how to use items is challenging. The difficulty of puzzles is even raised when the game proceeds. 
 To solve them, you normally need some knowledge of arts and a good memory. For example, you are 
 to win Scopa card game, assemble a torn-apart picture... Every detail of the quest should be considered. 
 To make up Limoncello, you must remember the location where you found its recipe, the ingredient, 
 and find out how to make it. Fortunately there is no time limit at all, so you do not have to be 
 hasty. 
  
  Game play of Anacapri: The Dream has been modified to use only several simple control operation 
 like pointing and clicking with mouse. It only takes a small amount of time to get used to this, 
 which is one of the reason why the game looks more like a tour. Like A Quiet Weekend, this version 
 offers Exploration Mode for those who want to have a look around before the adventure or do not 
 really want to play but only go sightseeing. In this journey, you will contemplate the whole island 
 with a woman voice introducing the spot in front of you. Music will start at important location 
 of the game: Red Beard's Castle, Palazza a Mare, Walkway of the Forts, Villa San Michele, Marian 
 Piccola and Grotto of Ferns (Grotta delle Felci) . The most special and romantic scene belongs to 
 Walkway of the Forts with the only path stretching through the flowery garden, very typical of 
 Carpi. However, there are some places you can see in this mode but only while playing the game 
 like the lower part of the fort which is surrounded with walls. In fact, you can not travel to 
 these places by bus or telpher.
  
  Anacapri: The Dream uses many photographs to convey the beautiful scenes in the island. There are 
 3 options for resolution: 1024x768, 1280x800 and 1440x900, in which large photos of a whole areas 
 is displayed on your screen. Sometimes it's necessary to move left or right to observe everything 
 or double click your mouse to adjust scrolling speed to a desirable one so that you do not miss 
 anything.
  
  Commonly speaking, this is a non-violent game that suits people who like to have relaxed, pleasant 
 feeling of tourism. If you have already been fed up with fighting action, why not giving it a try.

Review:  This game looks like the author went to holiday, took some pictures with 1mp camera, put them all 
 together, invent a story and there you are: anacapri - the dream. During the 5 minutes of playing 
 (i couldn't resist more) i got the feeling that i was looking at some friend's pictures from his 
 last holiday. No gameplay feeling, nothing. I don't know about the storyline because i didn't play 
 long enough, but who cares? I am a very big MYST (which is also made from images) fan but comparing 
 Anacapri with Myst feels like a very bad joke. I gave this game the score 4 for the authors' effort 
 to put so much pictures all together. With video cards like the 8th series from nvidia for example 
 this game becomes a huge disappointment. One more thing: the uninstall process took more than 30 
 minutes.
