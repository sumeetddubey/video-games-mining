Arcade racing fans looking for a change of pace may very well be intrigued by VR Sports' new Powerboat 
 Racing. Unfortunately, the game suffers from so many flaws that it barely stays afloat. 

 Arcade racing fans looking for a change of pace may very well be intrigued by VR Sports' new Powerboat 
 Racing. After all, most games in the racing genre plop you behind the wheel of a landlocked car 
 while this game lets you take on a series of complex canal-like racecourses in a sleek, offshore 
 racing watercraft. Unfortunately, the game suffers from so many flaws that it barely stays afloat. 

 Like any decent arcade racer, Powerboat Racing offers a variety of gameplay modes. Arcade mode is 
 your basic run around the course against human or AI opponents, while championship mode offers 
 a string of arcade runs that form a "season." Shootout is an elimination tournament in which the 
 last place finisher is booted after every race (until only one racer remains) , and challenge is 
 a one-on-one, two-lap race. The game also offers practice, time trial, and slalom modes, each of 
 which can help you learn the controls and the tracks - and believe me you'll need this practice 
 time if you hope to do well in the game.  

 Powerboat Racing can be controlled with the keyboard, joystick, gamepad, or steering wheel. VR Sports 
 recommends the steering wheel, and I would have to agree. Every other control option is pure lunacy. 
 A gamepad, which is any sport and driving game fan's "old standby" controller, is far too sensitive 
 for this game, and you'll be bashing your boat into the walls all too often if you use one. Joysticks 
 are worse, as they are simply ill suited for controlling a boat and are often more sensitive than 
 the gamepads. If you're one of the many gamers not yet fortunate enough to own a nice steering 
 wheel rig, the keyboard is your best bet. But even the keyboard is a royal pain, as the steering 
 is extremely sensitive. Oversteering is common, and that leads to overcorrecting, and so on, and 
 so on.  

 Worse yet, these controls are not configurable. You can't adjust the sensitivity and you can't modify 
 the functions assigned to any buttons or keys. This was just plain irksome, especially for those 
 gamers (like me) who prefer the "push a button to accelerate" method over the game's default "push 
 forward to accelerate, push left and right to steer" control setup.  

 As if the controls themselves weren't difficult enough to master, the game also throws a series 
 of extremely challenging courses in your face. Considered in a vacuum, the complex courses in Powerboat 
 Racing would be a plus - we all appreciate a challenging game, after all. In fact, many of the 
 courses have shortcuts, mobile obstacles, and other objects (like larger boats and multiple jumps) 
 that really liven up the action. But if you're not yet an absolute master of the game's heinous 
 controls, the courses will only prove incredibly difficult and frustrating.  

 On top of this, you'll find that the game's AI is very good - too good, in fact. Unlike MicroProse's 
 Ultim@te Race Pro, which offers a great range of AI skill levels, Powerboat Racing starts off at 
 hard and gets progressively harder. In most cases, the AI boats all leap off the starting line 
 and leave you in the dust. In a normal game, this wouldn't be a problem as you could gradually 
 work your way back to the front of the pack. In Powerboat Racing, however, falling behind early 
 means that you have little chance of seeing those other boats again (until they lap you, that is) . 

 The game's graphics engine is decent, but not nearly as good as it thinks it is. Despite some impressive 
 effects for water transparency and surface reflection, the graphics in Powerboat Racing are decidedly 
 average. The rise and fall of the water is pretty weak when compared with a game like Psygnosis' 
 Shipwreckers, for example. The 3D "weather" seems to be limited to intense fog effects, which in 
 turn seem to be used to hide the less-than-stellar landscapes surrounding each course. Also, the 
 boats throw cheesy splash bitmaps when they turn - a far cry from some of the cooler 3D rain and 
 water effects we've seen in games like Ubisoft's F1 Racing Simulation and others.  

 The game has a number of other annoying flaws, including the archaic name-entry system that you 
 must go through before each and every race: Names are limited to three characters and are entered 
 using a scrolling, arcade-style alphabet. Hey, this is a $2,000 PC guys - it has a keyboard and 
 it can handle names with four, five, even (gasp!) six characters at times.  

 Powerboat Racing supports IPX for multiplayer races and allows up to six players to participate. 
 You can also have four players racing on the same PC, using a split-screen mode. This might be 
 fun for those gamers with four daisy-chained gamepads, but only if they have a huge monitor.  

 
 But first you have to find three other people willing to suffer through this game's poor controls 
 and uninspiring gameplay. If you really need your water-racing fix, you'd be better off with the 
 hybrid Jet Ski thrills of Jet Moto. Otherwise, stick to one of the upper-tier car-racing games 
 and just imagine it taking place at sea... at least until a better boat racer comes along.

Review:  OLD SCHOOL, NOT MODERN,.... it hasn't got nice graphs. it's a pretty short game. Its not even good 
 enough for cornflakes game! we played a few times with several years between. it was my first "game", 
 so didn't know how bad it could be!!! I mean, now i play WoW, what a difference! ok one good point, 
 I like the black boat lol =D But it has got a nice cover XD. Lets talk about the music: I know, 
 it's a game of 1998, but they did not use good themes in the game. The music is very versatile... 
 NOT!!!! TIP: If you see this game in a store (don't buy it) put it behind another one!!! 
 
   buy WoW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
