A more full-featured, technically competitive version of Golden Tee Golf could earn a place alongside 
 the best of the field. 

 That Peter Jacobsen's Golden Tee Golf is a huge arcade and bar hit proves one thing: Drunks are 
 pretty forgiving about what they'll pay 50 cents to play. Ranked as one of the most-played coin-op 
 games for almost two years running, it has finally made its way to the PC, only to land amid a 
 cutthroat and crowded field of entrenched PC golf franchises. Several of the coin-op original's 
 strengths have translated well to the PC, but there simply isn't enough to carry the game when 
 your competition is EA, Access, Microsoft, and Accolade.  

 The first impression of Golden Tee Golf is of a game that feels and plays pretty well. Its main 
 appeal is a superb control implementation. Like most recent golf sims, Golden Tee Golf offers a 
 dynamic mouse swing interface, dubbed Trackswing. In the coin-op version, this is done with a trackball. 
 Here, it's done by pushing your mouse at variable speeds and angles to finesse the ball the proper 
 distance and direction. There is no three-click or two-click powerbar offered at all, but the Trackswing 
 is so well done you don't miss it. It's one of the best mouse swings we've seen, giving you a real 
 feel for just how the ball is going to fly. By stepping the difficulty up through five levels, 
 the control becomes gradually more challenging, and accuracy becomes more crucial. Ball physics 
 and weather modeling are here in rather simplified forms and won't necessarily convince hard-core 
 golfers.  

 This superb control is the heart of the game, but unfortunately little else about Golden Tee Golf 
 measures up, starting with the visuals. The courses are all very colorful, maybe a little too colorful. 
 Resolutions up to 1024x768 are supported, and redraw rates are very fast. Several cameras can be 
 onscreen without really slowing things down. From the tee, everything looks pretty sharp, but once 
 you're out on the course it all comes apart. Get close (like within 15 feet) to any piece of scenery, 
 and it pixelizes like a mother. I'm not talking slight pixelization; I'm talking big ol' fist-sized 
 pixels that you can count. After Links LS 1999, it's a harsh throwback.  

 The feature set is also pretty lean. For starters, you can only play as Peter Jacobsen. Though Peter 
 changes shirts and has a few comical gestures, he's missing a few dozen frames of animation, making 
 him look like a bad flip book whenever he moves. There are no AI golfers whatsoever, and the only 
 way to play someone else to is find a prerecorded game on the Net or make one yourself. There are 
 only two modes of play (skins and stroke) and three courses. Fortunately, Internet play via Golden 
 Tee Net is smoothly integrated. Combined with the fast redraws, this makes online play fairly strong. 
 Of course, everyone you play will look just like you (or just like Peter) since there is only one 
 animated golfer. A live chat feature has been implemented that allows you to simply hold down the 
 Control key and talk into a microphone during head-to-head games.  

 There's no doubt that Golden Tee Golf will appeal to gamers looking for a more casual approach to 
 the game. Its swing interface is smooth and fun to use. Hit a ball into the woods or try to play 
 against someone else, however, and you'll start running into its limitations. Incredible Technologies 
 has laid a foundation for an entry into the PC market if it wants to continue to tweak and enhance 
 this game. While it falls short of the mark in several areas, a more full-featured, technically 
 competitive version of Golden Tee Golf could earn a place alongside the best of the field.
