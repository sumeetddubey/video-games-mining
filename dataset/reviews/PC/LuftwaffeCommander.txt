:::Review:::
Luftwaffe had the makings of an interesting, offbeat sim. Indeed, with some serious patching and 
 a complete reissue, it could still become one. 

 It's always frustrating to see a promising game ruined by a premature release, but it happens again 
 and again. The game at hand is SSI's Luftwaffe Commander, which could have been an interesting 
 sim offering a unique take on the World War II air war. Instead, it's just a shadow of what could 
 have been.  

 Luftwaffe Commander is the latest installment in SSI's ongoing Digital Combat series, which includes 
 Panzer Commander and the forthcoming Su-27 2.0. The series offers deep simulations of both contemporary 
 and period sims, with the customary SSI attention to detail. Luftwaffe Commander takes on the World 
 War II flight sim genre from a very specific angle: that of the German Luftwaffe throughout the 
 entire eight-year course of the war. Unlike its big-budget competition - European Air War, Combat 
 Flight Simulator, and WWII Fighters - it concentrates on this one area in great depth. There is 
 only one career available in campaign mode: that of a German pilot. This career takes you from 
 the first trial by fire of the Luftwaffe in the Spanish Civil War, through the French, British, 
 Russian, and West Front campaigns. There are ten planes altogether: four versions of the Bf-109, 
 the He-51, and the Me-262; plus the Allied planes I-16, Spitfire, P-39Q, and P-51, available only 
 in quick and single missions.  

 The novel approach of creating a German-specific sim allows the developers to create a feel for 
 the unique missions, tactics, and history of the Luftwaffe. They've even included first-person 
 accounts from German pilots. There are 50 missions in all, encompassing the entire historical range 
 of the German air war. The missions comprise the campaigns, and since they're scripted they are 
 generally very tight and interesting. A custom mission option lets you create simple aerial encounters, 
 but I'm damned if I could figure out the purpose of the "fly now" button, which simply drops you 
 into the air with some threats without giving you a chance to select an aircraft or opponent type. 
 There's no true mission editor, so the game is limited to the included missions.  

 Luftwaffe had the makings of an interesting, offbeat sim. Indeed, with some serious patching and 
 a complete reissue, it could still become one. But judging by the unceremonious dumping of this 
 game onto the marketplace in an obviously incomplete form, that's not likely to happen. The problems 
 start right away. The game simply doesn't look all that great compared to the three other WWII 
 games. Terrain is inconsistent, with nice rolling hills and ghastly looking patchwork areas. The 
 plane models are decent, but have few damage effects, and they pale in comparison to WWII Fighters. 
 Gunshots look splotchy, and explosions and smoke effect are about a year out of date. Cockpits 
 and views are OK, though more external-view selections should have been included. There are no 
 blind spots and the padlock works well, though it holds a lock on a plane even when the target 
 is clearly out of view. While the 3D cockpit has a smooth action, it's rendered useless by the 
 lack of functioning gauges. Considering the mediocre graphics, the game doesn't even run all that 
 smoothly.   

 The flight models are generally quite strong, with good spin and stall modeling and a wide array 
 of dynamic damage effects. There's little to complain about in the way these birds handle. They 
 feel just right. However, the problems begin to mount once you get flying. Numerous bugs prevent 
 missions from ending correctly or prevent you from getting full credit. Some collisions leave absolutely 
 no damage to the aircraft. This is not necessarily a bad thing, since collisions are maddeningly 
 frequent due to horrible AI problems. Both friendly and enemy craft seem to have little or no collision-avoidance 
 routines. They regularly run into you or the ground during maneuvers. Enemy AI in dogfighting is 
 pat and predictable, while wingman AI is simply hopeless.   

 The single-player game is generally stable in terms of hard crashes, but the multiplayer sessions 
 are hard to get running and crash pretty often. With three strong WWII sims out right now, there's 
 enough aerial-period action to keep you flying for the next year. Luftwaffe could have been a worthy, 
 and even unique, addition to this set of sims. Even the spotty graphics could have been overlooked 
 since the flight models are strong and the missions quite interesting. But you can't overlook the 
 overall impression that this is a boxed beta.
