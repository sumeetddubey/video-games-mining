:::Review:::
This should truly be awesome... and it is - if you have the recommended Pentium 166. 

 The idea of a sequel to The Need for Speed should make many folks happy. After all, who didn't enjoy 
 the thrill of racing down some of the most beautiful stretches of road in the world - roads made 
 for cool sports cars that would fulfill our need for speed, even if that darned state trooper in 
 the Mustang got in the way.  

 Yep, Need for Speed II should surely be a treat. And with the promise of a faster 3-D engine, courses 
 with 50 percent greater detail, customization and performance setups, and a number of other new 
 options, this should truly be awesome.   

 And it is - if you have the recommended Pentium 166. Anything slower forces you to set the resolution 
 low (forget that frazzled medium setting that EA recommends) and maybe turn off the horizon to 
 get an acceptable frame rate. Even so, the ground textures start to synchronize at higher speeds, 
 taking away the feeling of velocity on long stretches of open road. It may be that 50 percent greater 
 detail comes at some performance cost, or perhaps that cost is the result of developing for Windows 
 95 only.  

 Although each track locale can be guessed by its name - Pacific Spirit, Mediteraneo, The Outback 
 - and they are certainly places that you would want to drive one of these dream machines, they 
 don't look like any road on my planet. Sure, you get the twists, turns, peaks, and valleys like 
 you would expect, and of course there is some embellishment to make them more interesting. But 
 what was truly enjoyable in the original was the balance between surreal and real roads. Most of 
 the roads in NFS II are so outrageous that they seem to belong in Monster Truck Madness, not a 
 simulation of cars with relatively little clearance and stiff suspensions that don't perform so 
 well over cobblestones and jumps.  

 Even the cars this time around are way out on the fringes of familiarity. Unless you've been to 
 an auto show recently, you have probably never seen any of these machines. Admittedly, they are 
 fun to drive, but none of them are what most of us would consider within reach, which interferes 
 with what the original NFS did so well - provide a sense of immersion and the suspension of disbelief. 
   

 Some might also be disappointed to find that the cop (and thus the radar detector) has been taken 
 out completely, and all of the tracks are circuits - there are no more linear roads with checkpoints. 
 These were features that made the original game more realistic - and unique.  

 There are two racing modes to choose from, Arcade and Simulation. The Arcade mode improves handling 
 considerably, but Simulation doesn't give the proper sense of realism. Handling any of the cars 
 in Simulation mode can be a harried affair, as the controls are jerky when steering and breaking. 

 What makes it push towards the sim side of the spectrum is the varied performance of the different 
 cars and their engine (and horn) sounds. Lacking a true-to-life physics model, however, makes it 
 very arcade. NFS II is plagued by some of the same problems that make it difficult to call this 
 series a driving "simulation." It sort of fits snugly between, say, Virgin's Screamer 2 and any 
 of the true racing sims on the market.

Review:  Need for Speed 2 is a racing game. The graphics aren't very good but the gameplay is very simple. You 
 can choose cars from three classes and race against different opponents. While racing you'll encounter 
 traffic cars and different scenary objects. I recomend this game for racing amateurs and those who 
 have weak computers. WARNING! You can't play this game on Windows XP!! Only on Windows 98 or older!! There 
 aren't any patches for the game to run on XP.
  Tired winning all the time against the AI? Why not try playing with a friend on split screen? You 
 can play the game with a friend on split screen, on different racing types. And if you want to increase 
 the fun, add some AI's and race!

Review:  Need for Speed II  is the second installment of this racing genre, its game-play is the same as 
 any other racing game thats where you choose a car and fight it out on the track, to be the faster 
 is the winner.
  The controls are laid out easy enough for new players to get use to such as the arrow keys are 
 used to turn left and right and the other assigned buttons for your breaks and acceleration, turning 
 corners are all smooth no bad physics action going on and as for the cars they move the way a 
 Car should move
  For graphic wise Need for speed II has a lot to offer, the environments affect is great from the 
 evening look to the snowy road side of the hill, tends to bring out the realism in the race tracks. 
 The car structure are also realistic, but sometimes the color reflection and the deep colorings 
 of the car tends to make the cars look like they are made from plastic
  What I can say is that Need for Speed II is a Good game loyal to its genre lots to look forward 
 for in the gaming experience, pretty short game and lest reply value , but what can you expect 
 from a racing game.

Review:  geez i think this was my first racing game I ever played on the pc? and well the first time I played 
 I thought it was alot of fun. Of course looking back from now, it would be very different. 
  Its been a while since I played, but its still fun even if the graphics are outdated. Theres plenty 
 of cars to chose from, and the controls are very simple as its only the arrow buttons . However 
 somtimes you may feel that the cars are pretty similar to each other, as in controling wise, and 
 it takes the realism away from the game. 
  There are also enough tracks to keep you occupied for a while, and the soundtracks aren't bad either. 
 
  Its more fun if you played double player, but you would hafta stick with the split screen, which 
 makes everything look about squished.
  Overall I enjoyed this game it was fun , and its worth it in some ways as it actualyl gives you 
 slideshows, facts, and vids of every car.

Review:  This game is a riot. It does not have enough cars, but the rest is good. The track graphics are 
 really great but they lose some appeal when they are played on a slow computer. Graphic squares 
 appear and on a 133, the game loses points. There are two things to unlock: a Hollywood track (Really 
 nice) by winning in knockout mode and a Racing Ford for when you complete the Championship mode. 
 The nice thing in Championship mode is that you can choose in which order you play on the track. 
 You make the difficult tracks at first and it gives you an edge. In conclusion, this game should 
 be watched but I strongly propose to buy the SE version. It really is a little better than this.
