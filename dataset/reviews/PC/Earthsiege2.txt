:::Review:::
The sight of a flaming hulk in this game is surpassed in grim beauty only bythe sound the flames 
 make. Even if the term "Cybrid" makes you break out into a rash, it's hard to go terribly wrong 
 with big, battling hunks of walking metal that occasionally get reduced to big, burning hunks of 
 twisted metal. (The sight of a flaming hulk in this game is surpassed in grim beauty only by the 
 sound the flames make.) The terrain and buildings in this battle-mech sim are presented courtesy 
 of the Sierra/Dynamix' 3DSpace engine, and look just as good as the much-hailed Silent Thunder 
 which uses the same scheme. With graphics quite a bit cleaner than those in, say, MechWarrior 2, 
 ES2's 50-plus missions are just that crucial bit more challenging, and the addition of an air-capable 
 HERC called the "A-10" - er, ahem, I mean the "Razor," - makes the overall combat action all the 
 more hectic. Like in the first game, players can outfit and customize their HERC units between 
 battles, and those missions involving Razor air strikes are tantamount to pretty decent little 
 flight sims in their own right. If I were forced at gunpoint to point newbies toward one battle-mech 
 game, EarthSiege 2 would probably be the one.

Review:  When Earthsiege 2 was released it had to compete against a very serious contender in Mechwarrior 
 II. Although both games captured giant robot fighting they took different approaches. While Mechwarrior 
 II held an advantage with its beautiful 3D engine and original mech designs, Earthsiege instead 
 offered a coherent and gripping storyline without the clan nonsense and instead focused on a more 
 traditional man vs. machine battle on planet Earth and ultimately the moon. The story would then 
 continue in the mech game "Starsiege", the two "Cyberstorm" tactical strategy games and ultimately 
 into the "Tribes" series.
  
  Earthsiege also added a strategic element in which the player got to outfit up to 8 "HERC" mechs 
 by salvaging battlefield debris and using the scrap to build new chassis and weapon types. One 
 design also allows the player to build a fighter plane which added a fresh view from above instead 
 of constantly slugging it out in a walking heap of metal. I recently finished replaying the game 
 out of nostalgia and can still conclude that although its production values are a bit dated it 
 is still a very satisfying experience. Two thumbs up!

Review:  Earthsiege 2 is not that great on gameplay and graphics, or sound. It's about this dude named thermethious 
 (or something like that) who sends an evil army of giant robots to wipe out humanity. It's your 
 job too destroy those robots in your own special robot and save humanity. oh boy. If you've ever 
 played any other kind of shooter whatsoever, then you'll find absolutely no pleasure in this game.
 
  
  GAMEPLAY 7/10
  Nothing special. You walk around diffrent terrains and shoot robots. The only upside of the gameplay 
 is that you can mindlessly blow up things. When I first played this game, I was eight years old 
 so I thought it was great at the time. lol. Now I hate it.
  
  GRAPHICS 6/10
  The graphics suck. No ifs, ands, or buts. They absolutely suck. I can honestly say I've nevver 
 played a Sierra game with good graphics, so I'm not gonna complain too much about them.
  
  SOUND 6/10
  The only sound in this game is the background music (which sounds like elavator music) , 
 and big explosians. In other words, don't buy this game for the sound. In fact, don't buy this 
 game at all.
  
  OVERALL 7.8/10
  The only reason I scored it so high is because this is the first video-game that I've ever played, 
 and I adored it at the time. Anyone that's older that ten would think this game realy sucks so 
 don't even bother buying it. Realy, don't waste the five bucks on such a crappy game. If you have 
 any questions or comments concerning this game or this review, please feel free to contact me.

Review:  This game is relatively good... it just needs a few fixes. If you buy it, buy it for its gameplay, 
 not for an immersing story or anything.
  
  This game is set far in the future, where war is rampant and tanks are made obsolete by giant walking 
 robots with shield generators and big guns. The story takes place in a time where robots are trying 
 to destroy humanity. The evil computer-controlled robots (called "cybrids") in the game are fighting 
 for the master computer, called Prometheus. The humans must survive an enormous onslaught of these 
 cybrids. They just barely escaped the first attack (hence Earthsiege *2*) , and are falling. The 
 cybrids are massing on the far side of the moon and are putting Earth under a sort of siege, and 
 you must command one of your robots (called Hercs) and 3 squadmates to defend humanity.
  
  Thats about all there is to the story.
  
  The battle environments are sometimes interesting, 
 but lacking any real detail other than a few huge machine-building-things sticking out of the ground. 
 The game's terrain is quite low-res and the pixels are large enough to mistake them for some kind 
 of dull tile floor. Environments hardly change, other than the brownish color for a temperate climate, 
 red+black for a volcano environment, white+gray for snowy environment, dark grey for 
  lunar environment, etc. No trees, and only a few boring looking buildings.
  Missions range from 
 defending, attacking, scouting, and not much else, leading to major Earthsiege deja-vu (didn't 
 I just defend that base in the LAST mission?) . Hardly any voiceovers besides that of your squadmates, 
 mixed with no "sudden" mission changes, and this game's missions can lose your interest quite quickly.
 
  
  Other than that this game is AWESOME. The game provides a series of cool, powerful, and impressive 
 weapons in the herc bay. Weapons have their own attributes, and are even produced realistically. 
 Lasers range from 100gW to 500gW, autocannons range from 50 mm to 100mm, etc. Some weapons can 
 do specialized things, such as electron flux. The electron flux isn't just a one-shot weapon. The 
 player can hold down the firing trigger for an extended period and "click and drag" the weapon 
 to destroy multiple targets in one salvo. Other weapons such as the Electromag-pulse fire two shots 
 instead of one, and weapons such as the all-pwnz0r Plasma Cannon have the ability to track the 
 target and destroy any small herc in one hit.
  
  The gameplay is pretty slow until you meet an enemy herc. The sounds are awesome. Explosions are 
 satisfyingly high base, the bullet against armor sound is quite realistic. Explosion graphics are 
 cooler than many new games. Wait... the explosion GRAPHICS aren't good; the way the explosions are 
 sequenced and the way the hercs break apart is cool. Blow the top off a herc, the missile pods 
 and weapons fly in all directions, and the whole chassis catches fire violently. Blow the leg off 
 of a herc, it falls to the ground, damaging itself severely, occasionally blowing up pieces of 
 it's torso. Buildings explode into huge pieces with a pungent KA-KRAMM and catch on fire so impressively 
 it would make James Bond jealous. This game goes for being immersive by sheer noise. And, depending 
 on the size of your speakers, it works. You will be surrounded by kabooms, bullet sounds, and autocannons 
 firing. 
  
  This game is pretty easy, until you get five enemies on you at once, in which you realize how fragile 
 your herc really is. It has stability problems once and a while. This would be a totall addictive 
 game, but it's lack of a good environment and a good story keeps it from being of interest for 
 too long.
