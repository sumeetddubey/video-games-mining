With the Wages of Sin mission pack, fans (and detractors) of the original game can see a bit more 
 of Sin at its best. 

 We all know about the problems Sin had when it was first released. At least the mammoth patch fixed 
 most of them, helping the game to deliver on its potential as a very good, pure first-person shooter. 
 Now with the Wages of Sin mission pack, fans (and detractors) of the original game can see a bit 
 more of Sin at its best.  

 Wages of Sin is very much like the original Sin in most ways (but without the game-stopping bugs) . 
 The gameplay is exceedingly uncomplicated - see bad guys, kill bad guys, heal, repeat. Forget all 
 comparisons to games like Half-Life or Thief - Wages of Sin is not going to revolutionize the genre. 
 On the contrary, this mission pack is a throwback to the grand "old" days of Duke Nukem 3D, complete 
 with corny one-liners and bikini-clad women. This time around, with the evil Elexis Sinclair seemingly 
 out of the picture, mob boss Gianni Manero is using SinTek scientists to create an army of mutants 
 that he can use to take over Freeport. Once again, you assume the role of ultramacho protagonist 
 John Blade as he hunts down Manero and tries to thwart the criminal's evil schemes. Smart-ass sidekick 
 J. C. supplies you with mission objectives and important intelligence data, as well as the occasional 
 put-down.  

 In all, the add-on pack offers 17 new missions. The level design for these ranges from good to excellent. 
 A number of stunningly detailed environments, including a dockyard and a really slick casino, more 
 than make up for the few disappointing (or at least, uninspiring) levels. As in the original game, 
 most objects in the game environments are interactive, so you can use, or at the very least blow 
 up, lots of stuff. The game includes 12 new types of enemies, though you'll be fighting mob thugs 
 for the most part. There are also a few mutants thrown into the mix, including a gigantic supermutant 
 boss monster.  

 Enemy AI seems to have been heavily tweaked throughout, as the bad guys are now more effective at 
 dodging your fire and are occasionally smart enough not to walk through a door and into the barrels 
 of your waiting shotgun. There are also a few spots in which enemies will run through doors that 
 lock behind them, but these appeared to be scripted events and not the work of the AI.  

 A number of cinematic sequences based on the game engine help to move the single-player plot along, 
 and so long as you don't find the dialogue too predictable and/or offensive, these sequences are 
 pretty good. I ran into one possible glitch near the very end of the game, where Blade must race 
 to stop a catastrophe (how's that for not giving away any plot elements?) . The trouble is, one 
 cinematic ends, and before you do anything, another starts up - and in between you're left with 
 this feeling that an entire mission or level was skipped. Perhaps the developers really meant for 
 this segment of the game to be told in cinematics only, but if so, it could've been smoothed out 
 a bit.  

 Fortunately, your weapon selection has been beefed up substantially in Wages of Sin, with seven 
 new toys added to the arsenal. The most enjoyable single-player weapon is the flamethrower, but 
 in multiplayer mode the guided missile wins hands down. Other items, like the concussion gun and 
 the plasma bow, are rather disappointing - they just don't give the same feeling of wanton destruction 
 that a nice chain gun provides. Additionally, Wages of Sin offers a special hover-bike option for 
 multiplayer mode. This is a pretty slick twist, though it's most enjoyable on the maps where you 
 have room to play both on and off the bikes. You can't use your handheld weaponry while on a bike, 
 but the bikes themselves come equipped with lasers, unguided rockets, and hover mines.  

 Multiplayer action was Sin's strongest offering, and the same might be said of Wages of Sin. The 
 game offers 12 new multiplayer levels, most of which are pretty well done. In addition, two new 
 gameplay options have been added. Marked for Death has everyone gunning for the informer, who must 
 try to shoot someone else with his informer gun and transfer the burden to that person. The other 
 option is Lynch Mob, where the informer remains the informer for the entire game, and the rest 
 of the players try to hunt him down.  

 Neither single- or multiplayer Wages of Sin sounds very good. Already something of a problem in 
 the original, the basic sound effects don't seem to have changed much in this mission pack. To 
 make matters worse, the game sounds as though it's being played in a giant tin can. This was on 
 a test machine equipped with a SoundBlaster Live! card, and no matter how many attempts were made 
 to adjust the audio settings (both in the game and through Creative's control panel) , the sound 
 quality remained poor. Finally, the game clicked in and out of screen modes at least a dozen times 
 each time I loaded it - and then did it again once or twice each time I moved from menu to gameplay 
 and vice versa. This was very annoying and just should not have happened.   

 Despite the sound problem and the other minor issues, however, Wages of Sin is a very impressive 
 first-person shooter. If you held onto your copy of Sin and resisted the urge to return it before 
 the patch came out, you should definitely give this mission pack a try. It's not a groundbreaking 
 game experience, but it is a fast-paced, action-packed first-person romp that hearkens back to 
 the classics of the genre.
