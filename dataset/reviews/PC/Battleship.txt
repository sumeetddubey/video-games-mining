:::Review:::
Not an intensely complicated game with intricate strategic developments to begin with, it's now 
 just a guess-fest. 

 "You sank my battleship!" Ah, the sounds of childhood Saturday afternoons and a really memorable 
 ad campaign. Dense blue plastic, knobby little red and white pieces (which the dog always tried 
 to eat) , and really strategic guesswork. Now that was fun.  

 Rather than simply relying on nostalgia to sell games, Hasbro develops, tweaks, adds, and replots 
 the game until you have not only the standard Battleship, but also World Domination mode, air warfare, 
 naval warfare, helicopters to fly, islands to defend, oil rigs to protect, and enemy submarines 
 to torpedo. Some great visuals accompany an intuitive interface and suddenly the game of childhood 
 afternoons becomes the one of I-really-should-be-working adult afternoons. This is a strategic, 
 real-time wargame, and one thoughtful enough to include both host and guest CDs so you'll always 
 be able to attack your friends.  

 While there can be no doubt that Hasbro has added extraordinary depth to this game, there is one 
 big, fundamental flaw: the "Classic" game. This is the game you'd expect - the direct translation 
 of the Battleship you grew up with to the PC screen. Fire missiles into enemy waters and hope you 
 hit your opponent's aircraft carrier; little gridded squares turn white when you miss and red when 
 you hit. And when you hit, you're treated to a cutscene with a dramatic explosion of your weapon 
 of destruction hitting the enemy ship.   

 However, the Classic game springs a serious leak: no strategy. Not an intensely complicated game 
 with intricate strategic developments to begin with, it's now just a guess-fest. The reason for 
 this? You can't turn your boats lengthwise. Try as you might, you just can't. Sure, you can move 
 your boat from one end of the grid to the other, but only horizontally. Try to flip it around vertically 
 and you'll find yourself frustrated. And if that wasn't bad enough, those dramatic cutscenes also 
 show you which of your opponent's boats you just hit. So when you fire your first missile and see 
 it hit the aircraft carrier squarely in the middle, you know you have to hit it exactly four more 
 times to make it sink. Same thing holds true for the submarine, the battleship, and the rest.  
 

 The Classic game, though, serves as training for the meat of this modern Battleship - which is a 
 simple real-time war game. You construct fleets and send them out to accomplish a particular goal, 
 and you must stop your opponent from doing the same. It works pretty much like the Classic game 
 (aim and fire) but it's in real-time (meaning you don't take turns) . There are several variations 
 on this theme, but it's all pretty much a super-vamped version of the classic board game.   

 One thing that is noticeably lacking is a detailed and complete manual. Granted, serious wargamers 
 will be able to catch on to the premise pretty quickly, but lots of the folks who buy this game 
 are old-school, plastic playing board game folks, and a little extra help couldn't hurt.  

 Hasbro Interactive's Battleship HITS with depth and strategy (and a cool opening sequence) , but 
 MISSES on the classic level.

Review:  The cutscenes and graphics are OK, the sound is good, but the gameplay is bad. You don't have all 
 the options you would like in the "classic" mode and the "ulitimate" mode is too confusing and 
 fast paced to keep up with. Overall just stick with the Battleship boardgame. Also the "multiplayer" 
 function won't work at all for some reason. Plus it changes the screen resolution every time so 
 you have to reset it in order to do other things. Most "ultimate" levels require it to be done 
 with others in multiplayer mode which as said earlier doesn't work, so that makes the "ulitmate" 
 mode hard to play.

Review:  Any gaming company can make a board game into a computer game, but its always hasbro doin it. Like, 
 take away the good family game. That really grinds my gears. Although i love battleship the board 
 game, this really grinds my gears. its more like ****  . I'd rather be hungover in a tacobell at 
 one in morning while the manager is on vacation and the pimply kid is picking his nose and wiping 
 it on the fat girl that makes the tacos, so then she punches him and he claims his nose is broken 
 so he gets rushed to the hospital, than accept the fact that this is still a family game.

Review:  This game is amazing, even for its not so great graphics, hard to understand gameplay at first, 
 but after some hours playing you get past all of that. I played this game all the time when I was 
 bored, and it cured my boredom. For anyone thinking, 'It's just Battleship, how can it be so enticing?', 
 well there is classic battleship (ya know, the board where you call out points on the grid) , but 
 there is also the more advanced version of the game where you control fleets of ships that you 
 can customize to an extent, and if they get damaged you can repair them, it is just amazing.
