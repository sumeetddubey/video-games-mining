:::Review:::
Dracula: The Last Sanctuary has huge lapses in logic, no atmosphere, and very little in the way 
 of respect for Bram Stoker's original story. 

  Dracula: The Last Sanctuary is the sequel to Dracula Resurrection, and, like that game, it has 
 very distinctive graphics. Unlike its predecessor, which was short and easy, The Last Sanctuary 
 also has a bit more substance. It's lengthy and difficult, and there are puzzles at every turn. 
 Unfortunately, the game is also filled with long, empty hallways bookended by mysteriously locked 
 doors -- so it doesn't manage to be atmospheric at all, in spite of its great visuals.           
 The game features a number of frustrating puzzles with time limits    

 Dracula Resurrection, like so many recent adventure games, was a modern sequel to a classic work 
 of literature. As a sequel to Bram Stoker's Dracula, it made little sense. As an adventure game, 
 it was brief and relatively enjoyable and made up for some of the shortcomings in its story with 
 its great graphics. Dracula: The Last Sanctuary features both the same great graphics and the same 
 silly story. You play as Jonathan Harker, and once again you are trying to save your fiance 
 Mina from the clutches of Dracula.   

  You begin the game in London, where Dracula has set up shop in a run-down house. In the house, 
 you'll need to find some clue as to where Dracula may go next. During your explorations of the 
 house, you'll be set upon by werewolves. These werewolves are easily destroyed by sunlight, and 
 you'll find numerous puzzles that require you to reflect the light outside onto the hairy beasts. 
 These puzzles are challenging and occasionally interesting, though less so if you consider that 
 the creators of the game have ignored, without explanation, everything you've ever been taught 
 about werewolves: Werewolves are nocturnal, and sunlight only turns them into naked, confused people. 
   

  The major problem with Dracula: The Last Sanctuary, as with its predecessor and other games like 
 it, is that it ignores its source material and makes no effort to explain its own internal logic. 
 For example, important character names, such as Renfield, have been inexplicably changed. And a 
 good part of your time in the game is spent avoiding a Dracula robot. Context is nonexistent -- you 
 won't even get text descriptions of your inventory items. When you pick up a pile of paper, the 
 only help you'll get in the inventory screen is a bigger picture of a pile of paper. This tends 
 to add an unnecessary layer of difficulty to the inventory-based puzzles. For instance, the pile 
 of paper's usefulness would have been much more apparent if someone simply had the foresight to 
 label it "sheet music."   

  The majority of puzzles in Dracula: The Last Sanctuary are locked-door puzzles. Some require you 
 to use inventory items, while others are self-contained and require you to pore over Dracula's 
 cryptic notebooks looking for clues. Many of the latter type are very hard, and most of them will 
 repeat, with different solutions, throughout the game. The repetition of puzzles tends to seem 
 like an artificial means of lengthening the game, but players who are fond of this style of puzzle 
 will undoubtedly find themselves suitably challenged. Occasionally, though, the game cheats. One 
 door puzzle requires you to find and destroy three guardians that prevent you from entering. The 
 catch is that the guardians aren't labeled and blend into the background, and no indication is 
 given that you can interact with them. So not only do you have to sweep the screen with your mouse, 
 but you also must do so blindly, as you are never given any indication of when you are near something 
 important.   

  There are many frightening adventure games. Sanitarium, Amber: Journeys Beyond, and The Beast Within 
 all balanced challenging puzzle solving with suspenseful storytelling. Dracula: The Last Sanctuary 
 doesn't even manage to maintain a slightly creepy atmosphere. The opening would lead you to believe 
 otherwise, because of its creepy music that sets the stage for a terrifying adventure. Unfortunately, 
 this music is all but absent from the game afterward. The voice acting doesn't help: The confused-sounding 
 actors ham it up like they're auditioning for a part in Mark Borchadt's Coven.           A mechanical 
 Dracula will stalk you throughout the game    

 The game's saving grace is its graphics, which are pixilated and muddy during in-game sequences, 
 but beautiful in the cutscenes. Virtually no game to date, apart from Dracula Resurrection, has 
 ever featured such striking characters. They are stylized and detailed and unsettling in a way 
 that the rest of the game should have been.   

  Dracula: The Last Sanctuary has huge lapses in logic, no atmosphere, and very little in the way 
 of respect for Bram Stoker's original story. It also has great graphics and a tomb full of difficult 
 puzzles. The puzzles will be enough for those who are content with being limited to the challenge 
 of finding a way past locked doors and blocked passageways. But great games transcend their genre's 
 limitations, while good games work within them. Mediocre games, like Dracula: The Last Sanctuary, 
 only serve to remind us of why such things are limitations in the first place.

Review:  I played this game a long time ago on my computer and thought it would kinda cool to get it on 
 the PS1 and play for kicks.
  Well... it offers nothing different really. Fun if you like puzzle solving but that is about it. 
 It is easy to use and you can easily get lost in playing it but to be honest maneuvering is a pain 
 in the butt. I know it is old school technology compared to what we have out there now but come 
 on!!!
  Seriously the only this game has going for it is the puzzle solving. This is one of those games 
 that you would pick up and play only if you beaten every game in your library and wanted something 
 to do.

Review:  +diffcult than lochness and -difficult than necronomicon (that is a huge - actually) dracula will 
 only offer satisfaction of giving yur green papers only to those fond of the really unique style 
 of the 2 other gmes mentioned above. to others well... lets just say that they will go on a rampage 
 after the first hour of playing the game. haha. i imagine the look on a cs and generally fps lover 
 after coming to think how the hell did he give his money for this game. its a either fascinating 
 or how the hell did i ever think of buying game. if yu are one of the latter guys yu might wanna 
 buy it to see how much yu are gonna last berofe dreaming of headshooting the assistant at the store 
 yu bought it from. but for the others about 0.000001 of the gamers worldwide it is a game that needs 
 to be in yur collection with necro and lochness.

Review:  Dracula: The Last Sanctuary is naturally quite reminiscent of Dracula Resurrection, with a connection 
 so tight that the second begins with an ending cutscene from the first. Some later settings also 
 look identical to those in the initial effort, and once again you play the role of Jonathan Harker 
 trying to save his love Mina from Dracula. But Dreamcatcher has clearly listened to user feedback: 
 this second release takes a lot more time to finish than its overly short predecessor, and it has 
 more places to explore than just the three settings in the first. Moreover, unlike the original 
 where you hardly interacted with Dracula at all (he just lurked menacingly in the background) , 
 in this sequel the best known vampire of all time is now more directly at center stage from beginning 
 to end
