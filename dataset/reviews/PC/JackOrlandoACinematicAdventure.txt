:::Review:::
The puzzles and graphics are enough to recommend Jack Orlando to serious adventure game fans.

  Jack Orlando manages to avoid most of the clichs that plague adventure games inspired by 
 film noir. And the one it doesn't avoid is the most obvious -- Jack Orlando, who is a down-on-his-luck 
 private eye, has been framed for murder. He has 48 hours to clear his name. You, as Jack, must 
 solve a series of pretty good puzzles, stomach some of the worst dialogue and acting ever heard 
 in a game, and navigate so many red herrings that you'll occasionally wonder if you're playing 
 a game or swimming in Agatha Christie's fish pond. Jack Orlando is a strange game that manages 
 to be both very good and very bad at the same time.           The hand-drawn art is the game's 
 best feature.    

  But it isn't just a strange game -- it's a strange game that's three years old. Originally released 
 in 1998 by the Polish developer TopWare, Jack Orlando is being released in the US for the first 
 time. The only difference seems to be the addition of "Director's Cut" to its title, but by all 
 accounts, it is primarily the same game. The fact that a 3-year-old game can seem so unfinished 
 is equally strange. Many of the game's problems, from the endless streams of meaningless dialogue 
 to the enormous areas in which there is nothing to do, seem to imply that the game isn't done. 
 You'll navigate a huge catacomb of ancient artifacts and secret passages, and all of it is completely 
 unnecessary. You'll walk through an abandoned caf filled with dozens of TV sets, and yet 
 the game takes place in 1933, six years before the introduction of commercial television.   

  These are simply surreal moments in a game that is, at its heart, a straightforward murder mystery. 
 There's no link to the Knights Templar and no strange alien technology to be found. The murder 
 at hand is a case of organized crime and the military, and there's little more to it.   

  The game takes place at the end of prohibition, and Jack Orlando has gone from being a hero of 
 the people to a drunken lout. He happens to witness a murder on his way home from getting soused 
 and gets sapped on the head and left at the crime scene. He's the only suspect, and the police 
 chief gives him 48 hours to solve the crime and clear his name. That's the whole story, and you'll 
 be investigating a pretty generic organized crime syndicate from the beginning on. With the 48-hour 
 deadline, it's strange that the game takes place in what appears to be a single night. But the 
 thin story is not a problem because puzzles, not plot, make up the backbone of the game.   

  The puzzles you'll solve are straightforward -- they stick to the standard inventory-based and 
 dialogue-based puzzle types that adventure gamers are used to. But what makes Jack Orlando interesting 
 is that it isn't simply a case of trying everything with everything. You can pick up dozens of 
 things that are completely useless, and most conversations in the game will lead you nowhere. It 
 makes for an interesting change of pace from the standard adventure formula, in which your every 
 step is outlined by the things you can interact with.           Most of Jack Orlando's conversations 
 lead nowhere.    

  Unfortunately, the extensive amount of dialogue in the game is also one of its biggest flaws. Jack 
 Orlando was obviously translated from another language. Much of the dialogue doesn't make sense, 
 and there's an abundance of strange responses and non-sequiturs. The voice acting is so bad that 
 it almost seems brilliant. The first voice you hear, an elderly lady, sounds like a 20-year-old 
 male pretending to be an elderly lady. And doing a poor job. The best voice acting is merely bad, 
 while the worst is unbelievable. The voices in Jack Orlando make Resident Evil's infamous voice 
 work seem like a beautiful production of Under Milkwood in comparison. Luckily, the music -- decent 
 if generic "smoove jazz" -- makes up for the voices in some respect, if only because it seems professional 
 and competent.   

  Despite all that is wrong with it, though, Jack Orlando has some good elements. The graphics are 
 its most notable feature. The art is mostly two-dimensional and hand-drawn, similar at times to 
 the Broken Sword and Circle of Blood games. The only exception is the cars in the game, which are 
 3D models. Jack Orlando's animation is a nice change of pace from the standard 3D of most modern 
 games, and though it would be better at a higher resolution, it makes for a unique, if slightly 
 dated, look.   

  The puzzles and the graphics are enough to recommend Jack Orlando to serious adventure game fans. 
 There are no mystical overtones, no science-fiction angle. It's a straightforward whodunit puzzle-solver 
 with terrible dialogue and some really strange dead ends.

Review:  I first played Jack Orlando as a demo in 1997, i liked the demo very much and decided i would play 
 it for sure later when the game came out. I later for some reason forgot about the game, im fairly 
 certain that it had to do something with The Curse of Monkey Island (MI3) coming out in the same 
 year.
  
  Later in 2001, a Director's Cut edition came out, which was the one i ended up playing.
  
  
 The game starts off in 1930s america, the prohibition has just been abolished and the streets have 
 begun to overflow with alcohol.
  
  Your character wakes up from unconsciousness in an alley beside a man he has never met to the sound 
 of sirens in the air, you are arrested for a murder you did not commit or dont remember commiting.
 
  
  Your only saving grace is the Police Inspector who gives you 48 hours to clear your name.
  
 
  On your journey, you encounter bums, prostitutes, dockworkers, gangsters and all sorts of colorful 
 characters along the way.
  
  The gameplay is very non-linear in that it gives you too many useless items that you can pick up 
 along the way, too many un-necessary people that you have to converse with. This might seem interesting 
 in giving you a choice of what to do, but that's where all the problems begin.
  
  When the first Jack Orlando was released, the game was without major problems, meaning you could 
 finish the game from begining to end without flaws and snags.
  
  In Jack Orlando The Director's Cut, there are several instances where you can continue the game, 
 forget to pick up a very important item and essentially pay for it later by not being able to finish.
 
  
  This happened to me in 2001 when i first got my hands on a copy of the director's cut. I had gotten 
 stuck and very frustrated with the game i uninstalled it until recently when i dug it up digging 
 through my old software.
  
  One of the people who worked on the game Mr. Bill was kind enough to release to the public a walkthrough 
 which will guide the player to the end. This is very dissapointing because i had gotten stuck at 
 one of the earlier snags and the majority of the game was just a breeze in terms of no interaction 
 with the beautiful scenery.
  
  The game art is very nicely done, it reminds me of old lucasarts games like Indiana Jones and The 
 Fate Of Atlantis and Full Throttle.
  
  The game's background music also adds to the feel of a 1930s detective adventure, it's jazzy night 
 club music is a nice touch on the developer's behalf.
  
  I must say however, this game would be most likely very difficult to beat without a walkthrough 
 as there are numerous issues with the gameplay and many distractions along the way to ultimately 
 clear your name.
  
  However, aside from it's problems and it's more fundamental flaws, there is a deep down well made 
 game with attention to detail, maybe they should release a patch 9 years after the game was made 
 to correct some of these issues?
