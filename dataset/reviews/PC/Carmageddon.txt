:::Review:::
Carmageddon is visceral, violent, vehicular fun. 

 "Members of the public, you now have one minute to reach Minimum Safe Distance." Truly, that's one 
 of the greatest opening lines of dialogue ever recorded for a racing game.  

 Carmageddon touches that particular collective nerve that fuses the wholesome popularity of the 
 All-American Racing Game with the homicidal singularity of the 70s cult film into an onscreen experience 
 that can only be compared to the kind of automotive mayhem that a five-year-old American male wreaks 
 with his Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars.   

 The object: Win the race. The motive: Greed. The Rules: None whatsoever. Clear all the specified 
 race checkpoints, destroy all the opposing racecars, or vehicularly murder every last pedestrian 
 bystander within a three-mile radius. It doesn't matter; nobody cares... with the possible minor 
 exception of the pedestrians.  

 Carmageddon uses a ranking system wherein players start at number 99 and move up, painfully and 
 violently, in rank via a series of six-car races through more than 36 circuits - through the circuits, 
 under them, and in some cases quite a considerable number of feet over them. The game is playable 
 as a cockpit-view racer, but the third-person, follow-cam view is a vastly better way to witness 
 the action, which ranges from the dead-on realistic to the absolutely ridiculous and back again 
 without warning. From the go-flag, the competing cars are at each other (1,000 bonus points to 
 whomever manages to cream the flag-waver on the way out) , and for the first few moments the gameplay 
 is usually little more than a dense column of outlandishly-designed 3-D vehicles (hopped-up hearses, 
 low-rider Carz That Go Boom, banana-yellow stylized vehicular sharks, and nitro-burnin' dragsters, 
 in addition to some 20 other types) all clashing and sparking and shrieking for pole position (the 
 designers obviously channeled a lot of time into finding really unpleasant, metallic scraping sounds, 
 some of which will put the sensitive gamer's teeth on edge with barely-formed thoughts of the dentist) . 
 Every car here can hit the century mark within a few seconds off the line, and the problems begin 
 immediately.   

 Usually it's something like this: One car will break away to one side (either accidentally or with 
 lots of help) , begin to slip into a screaming spin, and instantly trigger a chain-reaction meta-collision 
 involving every car on the road, most of the nearby pedestrians and possibly even some of the local 
 livestock - and if nobody takes the hint, you can start the festivities yourself by love-tapping 
 your lane neighbor, cranking the steering wheel or jamming on the brakes for no good reason. The 
 result is berserk, absurd, epic, and comical at the same time - bright, candy-colored racecars 
 sliding into walls, colliding with dense, metallic crunches, pinwheeling up icy slopes, spiraling 
 through the air like two-ton footballs, plowing red swaths through clusters of screaming pedestrians, 
 obliterating cows, plummeting off the sides of bridges, landing on top of each other and getting 
 points for all of it (including cunning stunt and self-explanatory piledriver bonuses) . You also 
 never know if some joker held off on the accelerator and hung back there until he could get a good, 
 well-timed ram at whomever may have survived the opening debacle in the most vulnerable condition 
 - it's like an evening with the entirety of the , only without the same sense of personal safety 
 and moral depth. And this is almost always before you've cleared the first checkpoint. Sometimes 
 you won't even ever see the first checkpoint.   

 Of course, once you've escaped this messy opening, you can race against the clock to complete the 
 circuit (picking up the odd extra few seconds here and there by picking off an old lady crossing 
 the street) , or you can concentrate on turning around, finding the rest of the competitors and 
 destroying them. There are no ranged weapons here (with the exception of an anti-pedestrian ray 
 gun power-up) ; all the combat is purely kinetic, and what promised to start as an honest race can 
 degenerate into a series of jousts at 150 mph. Interplay claims that the "vehicles display accurate 
 driving physics and realistic collision damage," and this is partly true - cars can do sideslips, 
 bootleggers, J-turns, etc. - but what they don't tell you is that this realism only holds true 
 at speeds of less that 20 game-miles-per-hour; beyond that, the collisions are catastrophic, the 
 results ludicrous, with vehicles slamming off sloped terrain (or other cars) and flying for the 
 game equivalent of a quarter of a mile. And, of course, there are bonus points for especially wild 
 stunts, intended or not. The impacts, too, are beyond human or vehicular endurance. No matter - 
 the point is, it's fun.   

 The points you earn translate immediately to money, which can be used for on-the-fly (sometimes 
 literally) repairs. Nobody cares how far in debt you go, as long as you come out with a positive 
 bank balance when the dust settles and the blood dries. And again, fun is the point here - if you're 
 not having fun in Carmageddon, it's your own fault. Drivers can go off-road, explore underground 
 caverns and quite a bit of the local airspace, short-cut, cheat, lay in ambush, trawl for power-ups 
 (some useful, like time-adds, and some just plain silly, like the dreaded pinball mode) , go human-hunting 
 or even - if the mood strikes them - try to win the race the right way, by completing the circuit 
 in record time.   

 Even those with very fast systems will be astonished at the load time for each track - upwards of 
 thirty seconds, even with a medium install (alas, it's not even an interesting thirty seconds, 
 just the same, static image that will likely become one of the biggest gripes for players) . Also, 
 the handling differences between cars often come down to issues of key-lag more than anything else. 
 But this is not a racing sim by any stretch of the imagination. If you can keep that in mind, you 
 shouldn't be disappointed. Carmageddon is visceral, violent, vehicular fun, no strings attached, 
 no artificial morals or ethics added, and no artificial colors - just black, blue, and red all 
 over.

Review:  I remember when this game came out is right about the time that road rage was becoming such a big 
 deal on the news. There were almost nightly stories about bad incidents of road rage caught on 
 tape and because of those issues being so fresh, many people weren't to happy about the release 
 of this game. But carmageddon was a game that with just one look, you knew it was gonna be a blast. 
 The car graphics were very nice for the time while the outside graphics were merely just average. 
 The game itself was very unique in how it mixed a demolition derby style race with the pure fun 
 of just running over random people and getting rewarded for it. The level designs were done quite 
 well.... no two races felt the same, even though their artwork wasn't the best. Carmageddon was 
 a game that everyone knew would be a classic and still a blast to play even to this day.

Review:  As always happens when innocence is lost, it is lost forever. I have just search for innocence 
 in Wikipedia and see what I've found: Innocence is a term that describes the lack of guilt of an 
 individual, with respect to a crime, sin, or wrongdoing. We were digitally innocent then. We hadn't 
 tasted the glories of slaying, murdering and brutally dismembering every spectator we got across 
 in a racing game. I searched recently on videogames history and there was a precedent. An old arcade 
 game about pedestrians and cars. It was the very first banned game for its cruelty. Pixels were 
 modeled again and pedestrians become zombies. No one blamed the game again (Dumb critics, ha, ha) 
 I am spaniard. Inquisition played a big rol in the olden days in my country. Fortunately it disapeared. 
 Or so I thought. I did not remember this game till today I have read that it has been confirmed 
 that MANHUNT 2 is not gonna be comercialized in the UK. Please Rating Critics STOP TELLING US WHAT 
 TO DO. I think we are grown enough to know what to do. Otherwise we are gonna get this games in 
 the black market where other substances are around. You are not that smart after all.

Review:  Forget racing, this game is about pure unadulterated violent FUN. Yes, fun.
  
  I realise it's 2006 now, and there have been many racing games since. But none have approached 
 Carmageddon's subject matter, not even close. Grand Theft Auto? Don't make me laugh; GTA is about 
 random senseless violence, with later ones having "missions" thrown in to break the mindless monotony.
 
  
  Carmageddon was infinitely better; it was about the race, always the race. The physics engine was 
 a joke, but reliable - after getting accustomed to it's quirks you would rely on it to pull off 
 hilarious over-the-top stunts, from squashing as many pedestrians flat in one jump to causing massive 
 pileups involving every other racer on the track. Frequently you had so much fun driving around 
 or knocking the others about that races were almost always won because you were the only one left 
 standing. And despite it all, it was always fun.
  
  Of course, it's been a long while since I've played Carmageddon, and the sequels were not quite 
 up to par (the one with timed missions, 3 I believe, was pretty much a disaster) - but this game, 
 the original Carmageddon, has left such an impression on me - pun intended XD - that no other racing 
 game has ever been able to duplicate, let alone surpass.
  
  I've always sneered at GTA, and I'll say again, it always gave the impression of trying to be "real", 
 like the manufactured tough boyband look - all flash and no substance whatsoever. The GTA series 
 is nothing but a glorified endless  Carmageddon, 
 on the other hand, was FUN with a capital F - something most developers now tend to neglect in 
 their race to appeal to the masses fixiated on the latest graphical one-hit-wonder, inevitably 
 sinking to the lowest common denominator.

Review:  First I'd like to thank the makers, creators, and all of those people for creating this game.
 
  
  Gameplay: 10- Awsome, Blood, Gore, Everything else you can think of. A downer is that you don't 
 have a good grip or traction so you go flying in the air if you get hit
  
  Graphics: 9- I love most of the graphics in the game, I don't own a Mac so thats glory but it seems 
 to me that its made up of squares and thats all you see.
  
  Sound: 10- Speechless, just great, It would be hard to do all those really realistic squishing 
 noises.
  
  Value: 10- Worth the money, 20 bucks then, Now... It's 5 bucks worth the money, Too Cheap for it's 
 quality
  
  Tilt: 10- Do not know what to say... Instant, Sticks out, I just don't know what to say.
  
 
  So thats my opinion of carmageddon, Don't agree with me or agree with me, I say It's the best 
 game ever created in the gamers dome of top games

Review:  Review for a 1997 game:
  
  The graphics and the interaction between the cars, pedestrians and scenery is all first rate. Each 
 of the cars is very detailed, mainly down to the fact that they've been rendered with polygons, 
 as is the scenery, the only parts which are sprites being some track accessories and the pedestrians. 
 Also, the collision-detection is spot-on.
  
  The sounds in the game set the tone perfectly, but lose a point for being not a great deal more 
 than you'd expect from a racing game. The sounds that do stand out are the grinding crunches between 
 the cars which are great fun. If you have your PC connected up to a hifi or surround amplifier, 
 make sure you have the volume turned up as you plow into the opposition!
  
  Playability is nothing short of excellent. The combination of keys can take a little getting used 
 to, but once you've worked out what goes where, or have configured the keys to suit your own preference, 
 you're well on your way to venting your frustration on the bad guys. After this, it's a case of 
 practice makes perfect, or try, try, try, try and try again... and again and teach the opposition 
 a lesson they'll never forget. 
  
  Overall, for me, this is the best dracing game ever made. It takes the conventional racing game 
 and gives it a sharp kick in the teeth, not to mention doing the same for political correctness. 
 :)
  
  If I wanted to make one alteration, I'd allow the saving of your position from within a race, but 
 then the way it stands now will make you try just that bit harder which may increase the longevity 
 of this game as you won't want to stop until you reach the top-slot.

Review:  If you've never played Carmageddon, let me paint you a picture. An old lady is walking across the 
 street. She stops. Her walker is stuck on a pebble. She tries to wiggle around it but she can't. 
 A car is coming. A red car. The car has blades on it. It's coming fast and right behind that car 
 is about 5 other cars who are ramming each other. Will the old bat make it? The red car slices 
 the old lady in two. You were driving in the red car. You wipe the blood from your windshield and 
 continue racing through pedestrian filled streets, killing anything in your way.
  
  What sets Carmageddon apart from your typcial racer is the fact you get to 1) blow up your opponents 
 by means of force or weird weapons; 2) get to run over stupid watchers just to be cruel and sick; 
 3) just cruise around a very open city and explore everything. I mean, you know you have a winner 
 when you can ram through a football stadium and "tackle" everyone in sight with your car!
  
  Game also features some highly addictive multiplayer that will keep you coming for more. Since 
 this is an older game, it's also harder for a "today's gamer" to get their hands on it and go to 
 town. There's no photo realistic graphics but there's some graphic images instead.
  
  -------------------------------
  Pros:
  Pushed the censorship with it's in-your-grandma's-face 
 gore; Great racing game; Actually highly addictive multiplayer; Great sounds/graphics for back 
 then; classic game.
  
  Cons:
  No language filter, although not much of it; Some graphic issues with today's higher end computers.
 
  
  Overall:
  Just a pure classic. I hope this series pulls itself back together and get's even more gross than 
 ever! Just never, ever release another N64 version of that game.

Review:  This game isn't about smashing pedestrians with cruelty.
  I remember how i started playing it. First i got demo, and when i ran it, the first thing that 
 surprised my was interface - it was terrible, with this bleeding hand, it sickened me. Then i loaded 
 the demo level and it was like - "wtf is this" - the graphics were so outdated (it was the year 
 of 2000) . I started to drive and noticed the first few pedestrians, then i realised that these 
 pedestrians were meant to smash. Oh god, i started to feel so bad that i momentarily exited the 
 demo and uninstalled it. After about two months i got the full version of this game and as i didn't 
 have anything else to play at that moment i decided to give it a try and i thank god about this 
 because it became one of my favourite games ever. When i started to drive for the first time and 
 noticed the first pedestrian i thought - "come on, it's just a stupid pc game" and drove over him. 
 Then i drove over the second, the third... And realised that it was fun and it wasn't cruel at 
 all (i hate cruelty) . I know it is hard to understand how smashing pedestrians can't be cruel but 
 you really have to try this game to understand it. I just can't describe it.
  This game has a very beautiful soul, fantastic atmosphere and the freedom that it gives is unbelievable. 
 Once more, this game ISN'T ABOUT SMASHING PEDESTRIANS, it's about the DREAM OF PC DRIVING GAMES' 
 PLAYER.
  
  P. S. Carmageddon 2&3 are crap, don't even try them.

Review:  Back in 97/98 carmageddon was: 'the game to play'. Me and my friends used to gather around a computer 
 and laugh our lungs out. Lookin at one of us playing and doing the stuppitest thing you can do 
 with a car.
  
  The controls were basic, but okay. 
  
  The graphix suck big time, when I see shots of it now, but in 97 they were considered good. 
 
  
  Carmageddon was a good memory, not the best.
  
  It's not a game I would recomend now, that it's not. What this review is saying is: 'It was a good 
 game in 97, but don't play it now cause there are many games which can be considered in the same 
 catagorie and are better''.

Review:  Carmageddon was one of those games back in high school that I use to play on a bad day when I was 
 pissed at the world. This was before the joys of GTA or Manhunt or anything other evil/bloody/violent 
 game really was around. Sure there were some, but this was the one I found and I fell in love with.
 
  
  Was it a great game? Not really. The controls on the computer were a bit basic and didn't really 
 work that well. Up to drive forward, back to drive in reverse and left and right to steer. The 
 controls were clunky and didn't always work too well. The graphics on the game today look horrid. 
 You can't tell if you a pedestrian or a bucket of paint or maybe Mario. But at the time, they were 
 alright.
  
  One of the strangest things about this game is it won't play on my computer anymore. My computer 
 is actually too good to play this game I guess. I'm not sure.
  
  But it was a ton of fun to play and really addictive. The races were boring and never completely 
 interested me. I enjoyed hitting cars and pedestrians and wrecking my own car.
  
  This game was ok for it's time and sucks compared to a lot of games today, but as it goes, it's 
 still a classic favorite for me.
