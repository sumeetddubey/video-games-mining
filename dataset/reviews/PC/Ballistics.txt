:::Review:::
If unadulterated speed and kaleidoscopic imagery sounds like fun, Ballistics is your ticket to paradise. 
 But many racing fans may well find that paradise short-lived. 

  The 23-minute psychedelic vortex scene near the conclusion of Stanley Kubrick's mysterious 1968 
 film  2001: A Space Odyssey  proved to many flower-power-era hippies that they needn't take drugs 
 to experience quasi-hallucinogenic effects. For a modern update on that  
 experience, Xicat Interactive offers Ballistics, a hoverbike racer that lets its practitioners 
 rocket through a series of humungous snaking tubes. Ballistics is all about speed, more speed, 
 and the audiovisual effects that such tremendous velocity produces. It's an impressive sensory 
 affair, though not overly compelling in the long run.           At supersonic speed, a Ballistics 
 pilot enters a kaleidoscopic world of bizarre shapes and colors.    

  Unlike most racing games, Ballistics doesn't ask you to negotiate corners. In fact, analog joysticks 
 and steering wheels are the least suitable control devices you could choose. Ballistics' bikes 
 are, for the most part, magnetized to the interior walls of their slim futuristic courses and thus 
 automatically follow the curved track whether they're right side up, upside down, or somewhere 
 in between. The only time you will need to move to the left or right is to avoid one of the many 
 obstacles or glide over one of the power-ups that Swedish-based developer Grin has placed en route. 
 And since just a quick tap in either direction adjusts the angle of attack -- much like the "strafe" 
 or "sidestep" commands in a typical shooter -- fast-action digital steering controls are infinitely 
 preferable to incremental analog axes. In the end, most players will find that the venerable mouse-keyboard 
 combination is the best equipment for the job.   

  Riding a Ballistics bike is an exercise best reserved for those who prefer bizarrely fast speeds 
 and short, lightning-quick movements to careful maneuvering. Click the left mouse button to accelerate. 
 Keep it firmly depressed to maintain a speed of 250mph or above or you'll soon be passed by each 
 and every one of your opponents. Dodge the big red Xs, the partially open doors and gates, and 
 the red cubes that are strategically positioned to slow you or stop you dead in your tracks. Search 
 for the yellow-colored ramps, each of which allow you to use your "boost" button to temporarily 
 supercharge your top speed to a near-insane and decidedly necessary 800mph or above. Head for the 
 blue-colored ramps, each of which partially repairs the beating you've been taking from all those 
 obstacles. The game designers have struck a good balance between positive and negative elements 
 and that tremendous speed, thus forcing you to keep all your senses sharp throughout the duration 
 of an event or face a premature end.   

  Yet Ballistics is clearly at its best when you do come upon an open and uncluttered section of 
 track. Here, you're able to use your acceleration and boost buttons to their maximum potential 
 and, in doing so, experience the proliferation of motion-related sensations that Grin has devised. 
 At first, objects zip by above, below, and all around you at a frightening but still perceptible 
 rate. Then, just prior to hitting Mach 1, the scenery appears to blend together in a mishmash of 
 power-ups, obstacles, and sounds. When you actually break the sound barrier, the resulting sonic 
 boom signals a period of true weirdness -- a time when all sound effects, except for the rush of 
 the wind, dissipate and the screen produces a psychedelic display of cosmic lighting and motion-blur 
 wizardry. For a moment, you appear to move backward like the white lettering on spinning automobile 
 tires. Then the rush of scenery begins again. If ever an epilepsy warning was warranted in a game, 
 it is here.           Once you've memorized the layout of a track, reaching the championship is 
 not too difficult.    

  Sadly, Ballistics loses much of its fascination within the first few hours of playtime. For instance, 
 consider the static nature of each of its seven circuits. Certainly most of them are lengthy enough, 
 and have single lap times in the one- to two-minute range. Yet the obstacles, which hold far more 
 challenge than the none-too-threatening artificially intelligent opponents, are always placed in 
 precisely the same location. It won't take more than four or five practice sessions at a given 
 circuit to determine exactly where each of the undesirable roadblocks -- and desirable power-ups -- are 
 positioned.   

  Furthermore, Ballistics' gameplay is simply so fast and so confined that you have very little opportunity 
 to really experience the thrill of virtual racing. Most often, the scenery, opponents, and hazards 
 move by at such a high speed that the bare-bones rendering of individual objects and bikes becomes 
 indistinguishable. The game offers several first- and third-person view perspectives, but none 
 alleviate the general lack of clarity. Nor does Ballistics have animated riders, noticeable vehicular 
 damage, or replays. At least the postrace "shop" adds intrigue by letting you purchase high-performance 
 parts with your winnings, and the multiplayer component permits a maximum of eight humans to race 
 together if they're first willing to take the time to find one another.   

  If unadulterated speed and kaleidoscopic imagery sounds like fun, Ballistics is your ticket to 
 paradise. But many racing fans may well find that paradise short-lived.
