:::Review:::
Put simply, Mission Critical was one of the best adventures of 1995. 

 MIT begat Zork, which begat Infocom, the king of text adventure games, which begat an ill-fated 
 attempt at developing business software (!) , which begat bankruptcy. But Infocom also begat a small 
 company called Legend Entertainment, devoted to making text-ish adventures for thinking people. 
 Legend mated point-and-click interfaces and graphics with well-written adventure prose for a meaty, 
 old-fashioned computer game experience. But Legend couldn't hold back the tide of graphic adventure 
 games. So, as if to show just how good they were as game designers, Legend cranked out Mission 
 Critical, a science fiction adventure with heavy graphic flair, set in deep space and starring 
 Patricia Charbonneau and Michael Dorn.  

 In the future, the United States and other nations are fighting another war of independence against 
 a fascist United Nations-run world government. Mission Critical provides the setup through a well-done 
 video sequence; Michael Dorn plays the captain of the USS Lexington, defeated by a UN starship. 
 Feigning surrender, he ferries over his crew to the enemy craft-along with a nuclear warhead, 
 sacrificing himself and his crew just to give you a chance to complete the Lexington's missionwhich 
 you'll need to puzzle out from video logs and computer records.   

 Put simply, Mission Critical was one of the best adventures of 1995. The halls of a 22nd Century 
 starship are rendered in 7th Guest-like detail, using camera-on-rails animation that delivers an 
 illusion of smooth 3-D movement down hallways or into rooms. Pick up objects, open containers and 
 solve puzzlesall typical adventure fare, but Mission Critical gives you a great deal more. 
 As your adventure moves from the immediate problem of repairing a badly-damaged spacecraft to fighting 
 deep space battles to first contact with aliens, you'll unravel a greater cosmic mystery that could 
 affect the entire human race. A chilling beginning and deep science-fiction premises make Mission 
 Critical an adventure game to savor.

Review:  Well, this review is just a little late, but this game ultimately deserves some high praise during 
 the time when it WAS around. As the original gamespot review points out, in 1995, this game was 
 a phenomenal adventure game. The graphics (again, at the time) were top notch and the puzzles throughout 
 the game nailed the concept of just the right amount of brain scratching mixed with nice pacing. 
 Of course, this title is always worth revisiting for one great factor: Not the now dated graphics 
 or the simplistic play style as compared to more modern games... but the STORY! Mission Critical 
 had one of the most amazing plots that I had ever seen. Twisting, turning, exciting, and with a 
 touch of sadness here and there, Mission Critical delivered plot wise. In a lot of ways, Mission 
 Critical helped further define/refine the adventure genre for years to come. In any case, if you 
 ever manage to stumble upon this classic oldie or are an older fan with a nostalgic sense of what 
 a good game should be, load it up and enter the world of Mission Critical. =)
