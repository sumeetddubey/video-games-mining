:::Review:::
Zanzarah attempts to be a PC game that appeals to traditional interests of both male and female 
 players, and it's moderately successful in doing so. 

 German developer Funatics' game Zanzarah is very similar to Nintendo's popular monster-trading game 
 Pokmon. In that game, and in this one, you collect small creatures and then train them to 
 do battle with other small creatures, but in Zanzarah, you collect fairies instead of monsters, 
 and you fight battles that resemble those in a first-person shooter. However, Zanzarah looks and 
 sounds great, and though the game's somewhat effeminate art direction may seem a bit unusual, it 
 seems somewhat appropriate in contrast to the intensity of the game's battle mode and its traditional 
 role-playing elements. Zanzarah attempts to be a PC game that appeals to traditional interests 
 of both male and female players, and it's moderately successful in doing so.           Zanzarah 
 is easy to summarize: It's Pokmon, except with fairies and first-person shooter battles. 
    

  The game puts you in the role of Amy, an 18-year-old London native at home alone. One strange noise 
 and one mysterious unopened box later, she's in the world of Zanzarah, a fantasy land of lush forests, 
 quaint villages, and squat little goblins, dwarves, and elves. Rafi, the swamp goblin who shanghaied 
 Amy, greets her on arrival and explains that the fairies created Zanzarah long ago to protect all 
 the wee folk from rampaging humans, but now the fairies are acting strangely, and they're attacking 
 anyone who passes by their trees and rocks, and there are some shady-looking elves that just showed 
 up too -- so could she help because there's a prophecy that says she will? The story may seem just 
 a little too trite, but at least it more or less dissipates into a lot of meandering quests once 
 the game actually starts. Furthermore, all of Amy's conversations are one-sided: She never speaks 
 and instead only listens to other characters talking at her, and as a result, the development of 
 the plot, such as it is, seems thin.   

  To complete her quests and save Zanzarah, Amy must start a collection of fairies, which will both 
 protect her and use their powers to clear obstacles in her path. This is the focus of the game, 
 and it's more or less identical to Nintendo's Pokmon, right down to using balls to capture 
 wild fairies. The only striking difference is that in a fight with a wild fairy or a rival fairy 
 master, combat takes place in one of 10 or so different arenas, and you control your active fairy 
 from a first-person perspective. The blasts of magic that you use to bring down opposing fairies 
 are charged up by holding down the left mouse button and can even hurt your fairy if you overcharge. 
 In addition to offensive magic, your fairy has a support spell, which can reduce the amount of 
 damage your fairy receives, make your own attacks do more damage, or even make your spell charge 
 to full power faster. Of course, as your fairies gain levels, they'll be able to use more powerful 
 spells and can eventually use a second pair of spells to change tactics in the middle of a fight. 
   

  Combat is pretty easy against a single wild fairy, but it can actually be surprisingly challenging 
 against a fairy master. It's not difficult to score a hit on your opponent; the real challenge 
 in Zanzarah lies in its variety of different types of fairies. The game has 12 different kinds, 
 and if you don't have a good grasp of your fairies' and your opponents' fairies' strengths and 
 vulnerabilities, you'll find that your computer-controlled opponents won't hesitate to make short 
 work of your team. You can also play Zanzarah competitively in online multiplayer games, but the 
 game has support for up to only 10 players per game, and we experienced problems getting Zanzarah's 
 Internet player-matching lobby to work at all.           Zanzarah may play like a Pokmon 
 clone, but it looks and sounds surprisingly good.    

  Zanzarah's art style and fairy design seem naturalistic and heavy on earth tones, and they look 
 quite good. Not all the fairies are of the "skinny woman with butterfly wings" variety, either. 
 There are some odd-looking and inventive designs among the game's 12 different fairy types. You'll 
 see little green imps pedaling helicopters with leaves for blades, caterpillars with human faces 
 and suits of armor made from a tree branch, strange aquatic designs, and even demons, skeletons, 
 and other not-so-cute designs for the fire, dark, and chaos fairy types. The game's environments 
 are also varied and natural looking. Zanzarah's forests are particularly impressive; they're dense 
 with a variety of foliage that rustles and moves as Amy moves through it. Positional sound is used 
 to great effect to provide atmosphere, and the excellent and very appropriate background music 
 consists of relaxing New Age arrangements on medieval instruments.   

  While you could say that the game plays like a Pokmon clone, Zanzarah has some surprisingly 
 great production values in terms of both art and music, though it could certainly have benefited 
 from a better plot and more character development. It ultimately falls short of being an excellent 
 game, but Zanzarah is definitely good and at the very least offers a relaxing change of pace from 
 more-traditional PC role-playing and action games.

Review:  Its really hard to describe a game like Zanzarah. Its a mix of action, adventure , statergy and 
 puzzle solving. Zanzarah is a story about a girl who is lost in a magical world. And must use her 
 intelligence and her ability to control the magical fairies to fight her way out and find her way 
 back home. I admit even i found the story line a bit uneventful but after giving the game some 
 time you start to care less about the story and more about the game play.
  
  The graphics are a bit cartoonish and cannot be classified as great. But what is great about the 
 Zanzarah is its game play. Game play requires a fair amount of skill and intelligence and is often 
 challenging enough to keep you satisfied.
  
  The other aspects of the game are pretty average but for me it was the uniqe game play style that 
 really hit the spot

Review:  Zanzarah is a fantasy world and centers around a girl called Amy, who comes from the normal human 
 world and got suck into some BOX landing her in the world of mystical creatures called Zanzarah. In 
 Zanzarah player assumes the role of Amy, who will be given a fairy to choose in the beginning from 
 a stone fairy ,water fairy to a plant fairy. The game is FPS RPG, in which you use the fairy to fight, after 
 fighting them, you even get to catch them, just like in pokemon, the evolve too. It has an amazing 
 graphic great music and very engaing gameplay. A game for both male and female. ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( (Ignore 
 the crap that i write at the back, i need to obtain 100 words) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) Warcraft pokemon blah blah 
 blah blah blah ball fairy hahaha
