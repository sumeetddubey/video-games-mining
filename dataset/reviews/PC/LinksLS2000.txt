Its additional features are so unimpressive that there's not much reason for owners of the previous 
 version to get excited. 

 Apparently all the commotion over the antitrust lawsuit kept some of Microsoft's packaging staff 
 from staying completely focused on their jobs the last couple of months. How else do you explain 
 seeing a box that says "Links LS 2000" on the outside, but has Links LS 1999 on the inside?  

 
 OK, I'll admit I might be exaggerating. Just so I don't get sued, I'll say this up front: Links 
 LS 2000 is indeed a different game from its predecessor. But its additional features are so unimpressive 
 both in quantity and quality that there's simply not much reason for owners of the previous version 
 to get excited. In fact, Links LS 2000 feels more like an add-on course bundle than anything else, 
 though five courses for around $40 (after the rebate) is admittedly a pretty good deal.  

 Two of the five new courses are from St. Andrews, the New and Jubilee Courses (the Old Course was 
 already available to Links LS owners) . The other three include two from Hawaii (Hapuna and Mauna 
 Kea) and Covered Bridge in Indiana. Though the three locations are definitely unique in appearance 
 and in the challenges they offer, this variety can't quite match PGA Championship Golf's array 
 of eight courses. Furthermore, the LS 2000 graphics engine looks to be the spitting image of LS 
 1999 (which was an awful lot like 1998) ; about the only major difference is an option that lets 
 you choose a "skyscape" - which basically means you can set how cloudy it is when you play.  

 
 Of course, the graphics in the Links LS series have usually been highly regarded by fans, so it's 
 not that much of a slam to say things haven't changed between this version and the one before. 
 But compared with the beautifully rendered 3D landscapes of PGA Championship Golf or Jack Nicklaus 
 6, the digitized images of LS 2000 are starting to look dated even at a high resolution. There's 
 just not much sense of depth when you're standing at the tee looking down the fairway - it simply 
 looks like a photo and doesn't feel like a golf course.  

 Aside from the courses, about the only other additions as far as offline play goes are a scant four 
 additional golfer animations and commentary from CBS golf analyst David Feherty and CBS sports 
 announcer Craig Bolerjack. The golfer animations are fine - Fuzzy Zoeller's one of the new computer 
 players, replacing Arnold Palmer as "king of the impossible birdie putts" - but the commentary 
 is a different matter altogether. At first, I wondered why Microsoft chose to not make the sound 
 script with the two broadcasters' dialogue the default choice for both tourneys and single games. 
 But after hearing the so-called commentary - complete with huge gaps of silence followed by failed 
 attempts at humor or insipid post-shot observations - it's not surprising that it's buried in the 
 game's labyrinthine setup menus. Someone let me know when a golf game gets audio analysis right. 

 New players will appreciate the inclusion of a nice set of tutorials explaining all aspects of gameplay 
 - and hopefully they'll learn enough to avoid the temptation to use the new one-click shot type. 
 Five new modes of play have been added, including Fuzzy Zoeller's Wolf Challenge, but since LS 
 1999 let you design your own custom modes of play, this seems like more of an afterthought than 
 anything else.  

 LS 2000's most important change is in the game's new multiplayer support options: Now you will be 
 able to compete on the MSN Gaming Zone, as well as compete in the Links LS Online tour. This should 
 be welcome news for any Links fan who didn't care for the heavy ad content on Mplayer, home to 
 Links LS '98 and '99 ('99 is also supported on the Microsoft Gaming Zone) , and there's usually 
 no scarcity of opponents even for quick, casual games. But performance might be an issue for less 
 patient gamers: Unlike the impressive speed of play in the Jack Nicklaus Online Golf Tour (thanks 
 to all players shooting simultaneously in real time) , Links LS 2000 can suffer from considerable 
 delays as you and your opponent pick clubs and set up shots. But it's definitely a great experience 
 when things are going smoothly, and the LS Online Tour has tons of online tournaments open to every 
 skill class.  

 Links LS 2000 naturally has everything that has made this the best-selling golf sim series ever: 
 great physics, offline tournaments, in-depth shot-customization options, and an existing library 
 of more than two dozen of the world's most renowned courses. In short, this is probably the version 
 of Links LS you should buy, provided you don't already own a recent version. But thanks to games 
 like Jack Nicklaus 6 and PGA Championship Golf, the days of simply assuming the latest iteration 
 of Links is the best golf sim around are long gone - especially if the series doesn't begin to 
 evolve more quickly than it has in the past couple of installments.

Review:  Even though it's the latter half of the year 2003, I recently 'upgraded' from my former golf game 
 -Links LS 99- to its sequel, the supposedly outdated and obsolete 4 year old Links LS 2000. Why 
 did I opt to purchase a four year old golf game instead of a new golf game such as Links 2003 or 
 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003? Because the supposedly obsolescent LS 2000 is still, even today, the 
 best golf game available.
  
  Being an avid connoisseur of the LS series, I can say that LS 2000 is, by a slim margin, the best 
 of the series. I was surprised to find that it is an improvement (albeit very small) over Links 
 LS 99, which I CAN'T say about Links 2001 or Links 2003: Both of these installments had many changes 
 made... and the changes weren't good ones, either. In a nutshell, ever since Microsoft bought out 
 Access Software in 2000, the Links series has gone downhill. Microsoft, like most software companies, 
 has no understanding of the addage 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it.' The numerous tweaks in Links 
 2001 and 2003 brought more graphical 3D rendering and better depth perception as well as increased 
 the detail of foliage on the golf course. The only good changes were a few graphical ones, but 
 the graphics in those two games ALSO look more 'cartoonish' than LS's graphics. Almost all other 
 tweaks have been de-improvements: Worse physics, very inferior swing meter, horrible real time 
 swing, no Virtual Tournament (offline) , and a host of other inferior tweaks. Microsoft discarded 
 the original and creative ideas of Access Software and adopted, in its place, the inferior ideas 
 and physics of Links LS's competition such as Jack Nicklaus 6 and Tiger Woods PGA Tour. Thank you 
 Microsoft; you people are such geniuses. 
  
  If you are a casual PC golfer who enjoys getting a quick round in and likes your golf course to 
 appear as aesthetically-pleasing as possible, as 3D as possible and as alive as possible, Tiger 
 Woods PGA Tour 2003 is your game. The physics are good and the real time swing works well and is 
 an added bonus. But for the true PC connoisseur of utmost golfing realism and simulation, the 'obsolete' 
 Links LS 2000, even today, still blows the BRAND NEW Tiger Woods game out of the water. The graphics 
 of LS 2000 -though not as 3D or 'alive' (e. g., trees swaying, water rippling) is photorealistic, 
 not 'cartoonish.' The courses are virtually indestinguishable from their real life counterparts 
 whereas in Tiger Woods you have no idea what course you're golfing: they all look similar and certainly 
 bear no resemblance to their real life counterparts. Gameplay makes a game and LS's physics are 
 much more realistic than Tiger Wood's. And there are far more options for customizing shots and 
 customizing the actual game in LS than Tiger Woods. As far as I'm concerned, LS 2000 is still by 
 far the best PC golf game ever, as far as simulations go (if you want a kiddie's 'arcade' opt for 
 Tiger Woods) . My only complaint is that in Links LS 99 I could set my display to 1600x1200 resolution 
 for 16.7 million colors. In LS 2000 the 1600x1200 resolution is only available in 16 bit (65,000) 
 colors. Why, I have no idea. Not a big deal, but it makes a little difference. Still, an excellent 
 game and I even find the sound script (Craig Bolerjack and the other guy's comments) pretty funny.
