:::Review:::
This electronic version bears little resemblance to the original. 

 The multimillion dollar card game that has swept the world finally makes its electronic debut with 
 Acclaim's Magic: The Gathering - BattleMage. Fans of the original version have been waiting a long 
 time to get their grubby mitts (well, card playing does make your hands mighty sweaty) on Acclaim's 
 Magic: The Gathering. Prepare to wait a little longer because Acclaim's version lacks magic of 
 any kind.  

 If you've never played the card version of Magic, you will find it nearly impossible to understand 
 what is happening Acclaim's adaptation, because the manual is a flimsy 30 pages (the rule book 
 for the card game alone was over 60 pages) and this electronic version bears little resemblance 
 to the original.   

 Imagine moving six creatures around a battlefield, defending yourself, and casting spells (which 
 requires you to scroll through an assortment of cards, pick one, and then tap the appropriate color 
 mana) , while your computer-controlled opponent is rocking your world with speed, agility, and pinpoint 
 accuracy. Anyone who has played the original version of Magic will have a hard time figuring out 
 why Acclaim decided to make this a real-time strategy game. Real time destroys the beauty of the 
 game - figuring out the perfect combination anticipating your opponent's next move - and destroys 
 the Zen-like experience of the card game.  

 Acclaim's adaptation allows two types of gameplay. Players can opt to go mano-a-mano against another 
 planeswalker or attempt to conquer all of Corondor in campaign mode. For those of you who remember 
 Defender of the Crown, the strategy portion of Magic is very similar. You start with one parcel 
 of land and must conquer other tracts one by one until you've gained total control over Corondor. 
 Unfortunately, the campaign mode is nothing more than a choose-your-own-adventure story where you 
 read some text and, according to your response, either gain control of the land or not. New underwear 
 on Christmas is more fun than this.  

 Although the card artwork, cutscenes, and stills are beautiful, the dueling graphics are substandard. 
 It is difficult to tell exactly where rival planeswalkers are or which creatures you are controlling 
 while in combat. The score and sound effects are repetitive and minimal. Gameplay follows the ancient 
 way of the three T's: torturous, taxing, and tedious. There is a patch available that corrects 
 the performance of a few spells and improves the network capabilities of the game, but it doesn't 
 change enough to significantly improve the gameplay.  

 Even in its unfinished state, MicroProse's long-awaited Magic: The Gathering looks much more promising 
 than Acclaim's finished product. But until that version is released, Magic fans will just have 
 to break open a new deck and wait.

Review:  Where to start?
  
  Well, I can remember the day a bought this game. I was probably around 11 at the time and had been 
 playing MTG for about a year or so by that time. I was so excited to have a console game with as 
 much depth as my new addiction (and I figured it would prove a whole lot cheaper than buying cards)
 
  
  I popped this thing into my play station and started on a conquest. Then I read, and read, and 
 read, and read. Made a choice. Read some more, continued reading, made more choices... etc.
  
  Eventually I had chosen enough right things that i had a good chunk of land under my name, 
 and a few decent cards. I then got a chance to experience my first electronic MTG battle. Long 
 story short, I lost. I had no idea what was going on. I was on a playing field with things flying 
 at my planes walker and I was trying to throw some spells at my enemy (but I couldn't find them!) 
 This went on for awhile until I finally died. I played quite a few of these battles before finally 
 realizing what was going on. I did eventually get the hang of it, and believe it or not I managed 
 to beat the stupid thing (and I couldn't even tell you what the ending was) The multi-player and 
 dueling modes were worthless.
  
  I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. Ever. I don't care what you like in games, this is not 
 it. Go throw a ball up and down in your back yard, chances are at least gravity won't cheat.
