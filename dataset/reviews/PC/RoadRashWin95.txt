:::Review:::
With the new Windows 95 version of Road Rash and its eight-player capability, the old standard now 
 has the power to addict. 

 Road Rash has long been a favorite among those gamers with a penchant for blood and speed. Originally 
 released for the Sega Genesis earlier, the first version sported unprecedented graphics and action 
 that was fast enough to give the player a real adrenaline rush. No other motorcycle game before 
 Road Rash had been this realistic, and certainly none had incorporated combat. Each of RR's many 
 incarnations since has offered graphic improvements upon the original and has taken advantage of 
 the varied platforms' power, but all have failed to be as inspiring as they could have been. Until 
 recently, the game lacked a critical competitive element; after all, it's really not much fun to 
 wail on a fellow "rasher" with a chain if you know they're just part of the game. If that "rasher" 
 is being controlled by your roommate or your girlfriend, however, the action takes on a whole new 
 dimension. With the new Windows 95 version of Road Rash and its eight-player capability, the old 
 standard now has the power to addict.  

 Over a modem or on a network, players can attempt to blast their real live opponents off the road 
 or bash their heads in with clubs. Up to eight human-controlled bikes can be on screen at the same 
 time. This is all handled pretty efficiently, especially when you consider the speed at which you're 
 traveling. Latency does pose a problem, though. Imagine you're flying down the 101, with not an 
 obstacle in sight, when suddenly, your modem hiccups. After 10 seconds of frozen screen, you find 
 that you're picking yourself up from a nasty collision with a large building. Now how did that 
 happen? Not only does this ruin your race standing, it also slams you back to reality right quick. 
 Flaws aside, though, multi-player racing does add a lot to the game.  

 Aside from the multi-player mode, you've seen this "new" version of Road Rash before. You'll recognize 
 the now-somewhat-outdated soundtrack featuring all your favorite "who-the-hell-is-that" recording 
 artists like Paw and Hammerbox. (All right, Soundgarden's in there too - I'll be fair.) Unfortunately, 
 just like all the other versions of RR, right when you enter the race and want to hear some head-banging 
 rock, it's replaced by the world's cheesiest General MIDI music. A little less annoying, but a 
 problem nevertheless, is the fact that EA decided to use separate .WAV files for the sound effects. 
 The result is what we'll call the  effect. Picture yourself smacking 
 into the grille of an oncoming pickup only to hear yourself grunt in pain a full second later. 
 Pretty annoying, especially if you've played the more efficient PlayStation version of RR.  

 Frankly, there are some changes that could and should have been made between the 3DO version (released 
 over two years ago) and this "all-new" one. Sure, they've souped up the graphics for super-nifty 
 Direct Draw 2 and there's virtually no load time from main menu to race time, but what about the 
 gameplay? The relatively recent Road Rash 3 for Genesis had new weapons and tracks. Not so here 
 - the characters, bikes, weapons, and tracks in this version appear to be identical to the 3DO 
 version, and that's the biggest problem with the game. Why not incorporate at least a few of the 
 changes made in Road Rash 3 into the Windows title and give gamers the most up-to-date release 
 available?   

 The only other flaws aren't really problems of the game, but of the Windows 95 OS itself. For some 
 reason, it's kind of hard to control a speeding crotch rocket using just two keys on a keyboard. 
 This holds especially true when Windows spontaneously decides its key buffer is full, beeps loudly, 
 and locks, thereby leaving you out of control for a few seconds. It's not quite as annoying as 
 the screen lag problem, but can still ruin your game.  

 Quirks aside, Road Rash's ride-and-bludgeon formula still works, and it's still quite a game. If 
 you have the ability to play it over a network, it's one of the coolest experiences available, 
 especially if you're familiar with the original title. Words just cannot describe the warm feeling 
 you get when you realize that those aren't just computer drones you're thrashing, but people who 
 up until recently were your friends. If you don't have a network, or you're short on friends, you'll 
 probably be disappointed with this one. When it comes to one-player Road Rashing, even the jerky 
 3DO version is better.

Review:  Haha.. not many reviews about this game! I somehow came across it luckily, not even intentionally. 
 Wow, seems like just yesterday I was 10 years old in my living room with some of my friends kicking 
 it to this game. Just seeing it on here brings back some fond memories. Even though now I wouldn't 
 enjoy playing the game, back in the day it was one of the coolest games I thought to play.
  
  This is one great oldschool game, and I'm sure those of you that love these types of games.. 
 you'll love this one. I used to have so much fun playing this game, but of course.. time has passed. 
 Much better, newer games have come out with the present, and to the future. What we have now is 
 going to be Road Rash in a few years, crazy to think about it that way huh? Just reviewing this 
 game, because it's one of the first I've ever played, and had memorable times during the course 
 of playing this, both playing and not. Adios, Roadrash. It was good playing you.

Review:  I used to play Road Rash and a couple of it's sequals on the Sega Genesis. I recently got access 
 to the PC and Playstation 1 versions and I must say that it's nice to play this game again.
  
  Gameplay: You race with motorcycles and the twist is that you can knock other people off with 
 a punches and kicks. This makes it unique from other racing games. Rating: 9/10
  
  Graphics: They are kind of nice. They are a bit staticy but they are still good for the time this 
 game came out. Rating: 6/10
  
  Sound: Their isn't really any voices. Mainly just screaming and stuff. The music usually goes nicely 
 with the racing. Rating: 8/10
  
  Value: Their's a money system and you can buy new motorcycles and parts. Most older racing games 
 don't value like this. You can choose from different people too but it doesn't really matter who 
 you choose. Rating: 8/10
  
  Tilt: Just for this game if you want to race with motorcycles. I got this game for only $1.50. 
 Rating: 9/10

Review:  A classic arcade style game! Road Rash brings back my old memories of my childhood life when I 
 was playing my NES!
  ROAD RAH IS A COOL GAME FEATURING LOTS OF BIKES AND LOTS OF CHARACTERS! There are only a few tracks 
 which become wider and wider as we go unlocking levels. We can buy bikes with our money. We can 
 aslo hit our fellow biker on the way with chains, sticks, baseball bat and much more. We can also 
 hit many pedistrains.
  A real challenge. Cops chase us. A little geeky cop chases us for the whole time. He goes when 
 we hit him and crash with him! 
  Above all, Road Rash is a funny game. A classic arcade game which can be played anytime we want!!

Review:  I happen to love this game! Its a break from all the high quality things you need to run a high 
 proformance game, and its actually fun. Its a simple game taking up very little space on a hard-drive, 
 and easy to learn. Sure the graphics and sound may be a bit weak compared to the things we have 
 today, but it was '95 when this was realeased. A varity of bikes and characters, even weapons! 
 Nothings better when your bored playing the same game over and over then to race this game, and 
 crack a cop in the head with a chain going 120 mph. If you have a computer, i HIGHLY recommend 
 finding this game and adding it. Its non-stop fun.

Review:  old but satisfying... road rash was the first game i ever bought for pc and its still a fun game 
 although seriously dated but yet im here downloading it even though its graphics arent very good 
 by todays standards the gameplay is still quite good and its easy to learn all of the typical things 
 about the game but there are still more things to find and do... since i havent played this game 
 for such a long time ( approx. 7 years) i dont know much about the game anymore but am hoping it 
 will al come rushing back to me when i start that bike up n knock a couple of cops off their bikes

Review:  This is the craziest game ever made. The cinematics really makes you say: I wanna be a street rider 
 because the girl falls in your hands and............... But the game is fun overall. You can get 
 a lot of weapons and you can hit pedestrians till they do not have blood left in there body. This 
 is probably the game that started the whole mature game fad. The point of the game is simple: Win 
 the race and do not get arrested. The police is really vicious and do not think they are gonna 
 let you off easy. Just watch movies and you will see....... In overall, the control sucks. Okay, 
 it only gives an advantage to curve. You will hit pedestrians that way. The sound is not very good 
 too. The graphics are great for the Windows 1995 era. In conclusion, you do not play this game 
 for the control, or the sound. You just play it for the fun of seeing pedestrians full of blood 
 on the road!

Review:  Even by 1996 standards, the graphics of Road Rash are abysmal when compared to other games at the 
 time. The sound leaves you wanting more, and there's not much depth to the game, but the game still 
 has one quality that saves it from getting thrown out: The game is fun as hell and just as addictive. 
 
  
  Playing as what you could call an outlaw biker, you partake in illegal races and bash, kick, and 
 ram any opponent who gets in your way. With a total of only five levels, the game leaves you wanting 
 more, but with each difficulty level increasing the lengths of the tracks, you can't help but go 
 back and play this game.

Review:  i first witnessed roadrash game in akanshya's house, the very cute and lovely daughter of my icon, i. e 
 my biology mam, a person very close to my family.
  well as for the game, inspite of several glitches, the game is rocking. U WILL JUST LOVE IT. THE 
 ABILITY TO COMPETE, FACE ALL  TRACKING) WHILE DRIVING AT BREAKNECK 
 SPEEDS IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS GAME, THE MOTOR BIKE RACE IS JUST THE BACKDROP. WELL U CAN BE A 
 PROFESSIONAL BIKER WHO GETS PAID ACCORDING TO HIS PERFORMANCE AND GOES ON TO BUY SUPERBIKES WHICH 
 ARE BELIEVE ME PRICED REALLY HIGH. U WILL HAVE TO COME FIRST ON ABOUT 15 OCCASSIONS TO GET A HAND 
 AT THAT. BUT THE PROBLEM IS AS U PROGRESS THROUGH THE LEVELS, UR LACK LUSTURE SLOW BIKE NEEDS TO 
 BE REPLACED BY THE RATBIKES, FOR U TO GET A POSITION IN THE TOP 3. THERE U ARE. AS U BUY THOSE BIKES, CASH 
 IN HAND FOR THE SUPERBIKES GOES ON DIMINISHING AND UR SUPERBIKE DREAM SEEMS A HERCULEAN TASK.
 
  
  GRAPHICS: 6.8/10, IS THERE A SEQUEL MAN, I WOULD LOVE TO TRY IT.
  SOUND: 8/10
  GAMEPLAY: 7/10, MAINLY DUE TO THE FREEDOM U GET IN FLOUTING RULES
  OVERALL: BUY NOW, A GOOD ADDITION 
 TO UR COLLECTION.
