:::Review:::
It may have 16 solid arcade hits, but if you care at all about visual accuracy in your arcade compilations, 
 this package most definitely isn't for you. 

  While the PC is the hottest of the hotbeds for the quasi-legal practice of emulating and playing 
 old video games, it always seems to get the short end of the stick when it comes to legal compilations 
 of classic games. After years of putting out its old games on the PlayStation and just about every 
 other console and handheld out there, Namco's Museum series is now on the PC as well, with 16 of 
 Namco's arcade games. The games are playable, but due to some weird screen-filtering options and 
 unfortunate control options, this isn't quite the birthday celebration you'd expect.  

          Namco's arcade classics deserve better than this.     

  The collection contains 14 
 games by default: Bosconian, Dig Dug, Dragon Spirit, Galaga, Galaxian, Mappy, Ms. Pac-Man, Pac-Man, 
 Pole Position, Pole Position II, Rally-X, Rolling Thunder, Sky Kid, and Xevious. You can unlock 
 Galaga '88 and Pac-Mania by achieving some easily attainable scores on some of the other games. 
 For the most part, each of the games controls identically to their arcade counterparts. Because 
 most of these games only really involve a directional pad or other joystick equivalent, along with 
 a button or two, that's not much of a surprise. However, we tried multiple PlayStation-style dual 
 analog gamepads and were unable to properly assign Pole Position's driving controls to an analog 
 stick. That's unfortunate.  

  The game's sound seems spotty in places. Some games sound slightly off pitch, and things like explosions 
 occasionally sound a bit off, too. Graphically, this collection is pretty ugly. That's not a statement 
 about how far game graphics have progressed -- it means that these aren't very faithful duplications 
 of the original games. You're given one choice graphically. You can either enable screen smoothing, 
 which smoothes out some of the rough edges of the games' graphics and generally makes the whole 
 game look ridiculously blurry, or you can turn that off, and witness the games running in some 
 sort of squashed resolution that makes text look blockier than it should. Neither option is particularly 
 appealing. Support for scanlines and other, more accurate screen modes would have been nice. The 
 games are tied together by a weak-looking row of arcade machines that serve as the collection's 
 menu. Also, it's worth noting that the game uses the Starforce copy-protection scheme and actually 
 drops back to desktop for further checks each time you load up a new game. If your machine has 
 been known to have problems with games employing such protection methods, then you'll probably 
 want to stay away.  

  While the basic gameplay in these arcade greats is spot-on, the control issues and poor graphic 
 options get in the way of the fun. If you're absolutely desperate for a Namco collection, the budget 
 price makes this one worth considering; but for most people, one of the other versions of this 
 collection would make a much smarter choice.

Review:  Once you buy a game these days; if you open it you have a hard time taking it back. That's why 
 game companies should put all of the software they intend to put on your computer on the box... 
 every other licensed bit of software is proudly displayed on game boxes (Miles, Divx, Havoc, etc.) , 
 so the fact that publishers have to sneak anti-piracy software on your computer tells you that 
 they are trying to force you to do something that you're probably not going to be happy with. Here's 
 a link that as of this review has some steps you can take to remove StarForce. http://www. glop. org/starforce/remove. php
 
  
  As for the game... just get a console version and save yourself a headache.

Review:  FUN = 100%
  GAMEPLAY = 100%
  GRAPHICS = Could be bad, but classics still owns.
  
  Anywayz, the best game ever are the classics, so thats what a gamer is defined. Those games like 
 FFS, Mario, Pacman, MK., SF and much others; are the truly game when you wanna get FUN!. In your 
 work, school, house - Even ONLINE MULTIPLAYER ENABLED with Kaillera .DLL.
  
  I give 10.0 score to all :) , since im a FAN AND, the own. So Download Emulators and ROMS and start 
 pwning.
  There are some sites that you can download some good emus and roms. If you need some just email 
 me, b3ngie@prtc. net, but this is stupid giving my email to get nice sites and good emus, even Dreamcast. 
 I guess y'all know all of that.
  Well Keep it up Classics and Keep the best.
  
  End:.

Review:  Well, I've been waiting for this game since the 80's, and it was well worth the wait. this game 
 has beatiful 3D graphics wonderful snow and forest scenery, not to mention great Multiplayer. This 
 game inquires what you love about this game and adds so much realism and wankstaness. Imagine a 
 game like mario and Halo together and this is what you get. One of the best things about this game 
 is it's wonderful online play. The online play is really awsome and competitive. Their is always 
 a room open. The M16 is a bit over used though but you alwasy have brandon Brown at your shoulders. 
 Multiplayer is where this game really shines. It has awsome multiplayer and great multiplayer.
