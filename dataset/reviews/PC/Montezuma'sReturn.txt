It features an engine chock-full of bells and whistles and gameplay that would feel right at home 
 on a console. 

 Star Wars is given a lot of credit for its influence on American culture, but Raiders of the Lost 
 Ark had an almost equal impact that is often overlooked. There were plenty of knockoff movies, 
 but games seemed to pick up on the treasure-hunting archeologist motif to a greater extent. Eight-bit 
 classics like Pitfall II, Aztec, and Montezuma's Revenge all featured fedora-wearing adventurers 
 rummaging through trap-filled tombs, and even modern-day heroine Lara Croft owes a debt of thanks 
 to Indiana Jones. Now, more than a decade later, one of the original knockoffs returns. Montezuma's 
 Return is the sequel to Montezuma's Revenge, and it features an engine chock-full of bells and 
 whistles and gameplay that would feel right at home on a console.  

 Montezuma's Revenge was a side-scroller for systems like the Apple II and Atari 800. In it, you 
 controlled a little guy who ran around, picking up gems while avoiding bouncing skulls and snakes. 
 The new game basically follows in the same tradition. This time it's from a first-person point 
 of view, and you jump around platforms, run under bouncing skulls, flip switches, swim around, 
 and fight the numerous foes who stand in your way. Over its short length, the game remains entertaining. 
 No trick is repeated twice, and the design of the various traps you must avoid and gadgets you 
 must activate stay innovative. One moment you'll be hopping along frogs' backs in a sort of super 
 hi-tech version of Frogger, and the next you'll be jumping from rope to rope over a bottomless 
 chasm.  

 Technically, the game is quite impressive - that is if you have a 3D accelerator. With 3D acceleration, 
 though, Montezuma's Return has colored lighting, dynamic light-sourcing, and environment mapping. 
 In fact, it's got them everywhere. Almost everything in this game is a light source, and small 
 actions on your part will cause whole rooms to start swirling with colors like some invisible hand 
 is performing an oil light show. It's a bit much at times, and it's hard not to recall games like 
 Yar's Revenge for the Atari 2600, which made every sprite rapidly cycle its colors simply because 
 it was a new technology. Montezuma's Return looks, at times, crazy.   

 But the game is overwhelmingly silly, and the psychedelic visuals only add to the goofy atmosphere. 
 Other elements add to this atmosphere, such as the effect when you fall from a great height and 
 control goes willy-nilly while stars appear before your eyes. The cartoonish quality also applies 
 to controls; you maintain an inexplicable momentum when turning, making more difficult obstacles 
 an impossibility until you master the finicky maneuvers required. And the combat, too, is silly, 
 as you punch and kick the creatures you encounter with little to no strategy or skill required. 

 This combat is really the only downside of Montezuma's Return, but a complete list of complaints 
 would have to include the length, clocking in at a meager eight levels - and short ones at that. 
 But this is no Quake clone, nor is it meant to be. Montezuma's Return sets out to be fun in a "high 
 score, beat the boss, get to the bonus round" sort of way, and in that it succeeds with flying 
 (and pulsating) colors.

Review:  I'll tell the positive points of the game - because there are only few good points here.
  
  The graphics is very good, there is no problem with it.
  The First Player idea was not a bad 
 idea, it gives an FPS feeling to the game. The minigames are good even.
  
  And now heres the negative points of this game, and be ready - there are a lt of! (I wasn't kidding!!) :
 
  
  First, the low intelligence of enemies. What are they doing? Most of them not attack us, but running 
 up and down. And if you perform a "Jumping Kick" they "retreat" and running away again! I saw enemies 
 whose killed themseves by jump into the lava traps!!
  
  Second, the bad controls and "effects". No matter have good is the FPS feeling, the control is 
 terrible. After the jump you character moving a little. And because the FPS screen you can't see 
 some things like traps. And making the control worse, the giddiness "effect", wich appear at both 
 turning or falling makes me dizzy! 
  
  Third, the trap problem. Some of the traps are not deadly, like the most lava traps, but you can't 
 get out of them!! So, you can't do anything, just stay in the lava and R. I. P.! I can understand 
 the spyke traps, because they are really deadly, but if a trap not deadly, you should be able to 
 get out of it!
  
  Forth, the game is very, very, very short! The game has 8 levels. 8 levels!!! In a game there should 
 be 18 levels minimum, not 8! So they game is very short, and not even the minigames can help on 
 it.
  
  Fifth, missing bonus things. You play with the game only for a Highscore list! I don't thing there 
 couldn't be at least a hidden movie or a hidden level!
  
  Last one, the weapon arsenal. You can only punch or kick the enemies, and nothing else. But the 
 kick is slower and weaker than the punch in the game. They should drop a whip or a pistol in the 
 game at least.
  
  Well, as you see, the game has a lot of negative points, and the scores are too much for the game. 
 If you have a lot of time, you can try it, but don't want too much from it.
