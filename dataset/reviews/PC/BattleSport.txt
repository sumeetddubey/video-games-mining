BattleSport seems like a missed opportunity. 

 BattleSport seems like a missed opportunity. While the concept and design aren't exactly earth-shattering, 
 they do lay the groundwork for an exciting game with outstanding replay value. As in so many video 
 game to PC translations, the developers seem to have made little to no effort to harness the PC's 
 capabilities. As a result, what could have been a fast-paced and addictive action title runs out 
 of steam after just a few hours.   

 And that's too bad, because BattleSport (originally crafted for the PlayStation and Saturn) serves 
 up an appealing mix of strategy, tactics, and down-and-dirty action. The basic idea is straightforward 
 enough: Controlling a hovercraft (the game calls them "tanks") in arenas of various sizes and layouts, 
 you and a single opponent try to grab a constantly moving ball and fire it into a goal. Exhibition 
 matches against one of ten computer opponents provide a quick dose of action; in the tournament 
 mode you must battle your way to the top of the BattleSport ladder, using cash winnings to outfit 
 your current tank or buy a new one.  

 Sounds derivative and even a little boring, but a slew of creative design elements give BattleSport 
 a surprising amount of depth of play. Each of the 50 arenas is unique in both layout and the types 
 of obstacles and power-ups it contains - computer-controlled guns, teleporters, walls, and ramps 
 mean that there's almost never a direct path to the goal. Then there's the goal itself: It can 
 have one, two, or four sides; spin or remain facing in a single direction; move around the arena; 
 blink out and reappear somewhere else. To complicate things even further, making a shot from a 
 distance earns two or even three points instead of just one.  

 And remember those tanks? Besides being able to grab and shoot the ball, they're also armed and 
 armored - missile hits can cause fumbles, and destroying your opponent's tank is a viable defensive 
 tactic. There are over 25 add-on components available, ranging from the usual upgrades in lasers 
 and missiles to more exotic devices that blind your enemy, block the goal, attract the ball to 
 your tank, or even add an extra period to the game if you're on the verge of defeat. The only drawback 
 here is that you're only allowed to carry three add-ons into a match - and in tourney mode you 
 have no way of knowing if the stuff you're about to tack on to your tank might already be lying 
 around in the arena.  

 What all this adds up to is some pretty intense action that will have you ready for one match after 
 another - up to a point. The problem is that after just a couple of hours of practice, even average 
 players will find they can easily handle any of the five opponents available for exhibition matches. 
 You'll run into much stiffer competition in the tournament, but the bottom line is that you'll 
 either win the tournament and have no desire to play it again or run into someone you just can't 
 get past and quit out of frustration. Either way, most gamers will have had their fill of the single-player 
 mode after ten hours or less.  

 This should be no big deal since there's a two-player mode, but it's saddled with several problems. 
 First, the only way to go head-to-head is via a split-screen at the same computer: There's no support 
 for play over a modem, network, direct connection, or the Internet. Even if you cotton to split-screen 
 play, you'll run into another problem: Only one player can use a joystick or gamepad. Considering 
 the game supports the Gravis GrIP, this is practically inexcusable - a situation made even worse 
 because there's no way to reconfigure the keyboard commands to your liking.  

 Unless you have a programmable gamepad or joystick, there's no way to reconfigure button commands, 
 either. That might not sound like a big deal, but once you get in the arena you'll discover that 
 cycling through the three special weapons is almost impossible. With a standard four-button gamepad 
 you have to press two buttons at once for weapon cycling (you also have to press two buttons at 
 once to activate the special weapon you've selected) ; I was never able to pull it off with a Gravis 
 Gamepad. The task is easier for Gravis GrIP users because weapon cycling is handled with the X 
 button; unfortunately, the only way to jump with the GrIP is to press the left and right paddles 
 simultaneously, and with the missile and shoot buttons side by side (B and C) , it's all too easy 
 to shoot the ball when you really want to fire a missile. All these problems could have been solved 
 with a simple joystick/gamepad configuration option, but it's just not there.  

 Even with all these problems (and without even mentioning mention the blocky VGA graphics) , BattleSport 
 will provide more fun than you might expect, but you'll wish the fun would last a little longer.

Review:  I was pretty excited when i first got this game, it looked cool, blowing things up for absolutely 
 no reason! Can you ask any more? But no, this gamed was horrible for a number of reasons. The graphics 
 were horrible! I could not tell the opponent ship from the arena and sky! The sound was just plain 
 bad. The gameplay was okay, you had power-ups and what -not. The overall impression was just bad. 
 you would get bored right after the first couple of matches. The game controls were very weird. 
 Also the sport itself is weird. You have to get a goal with this ball, and kill the other dude. 
 I mean decide what the sport is! The mix is not satisfying. If you really like the look and want 
 to play it. Rent it. I do not suggest you buy it.
