:::Review:::
SimCoaster dismisses the elegant design of its predecessor, and instead favors the often-overwhelming 
 amount of management found in the original Theme Park. 

 SimCoaster is the third game in Bullfrog's series of amusement-park-themed business simulators. 
 It's the sequel to last year's SimTheme Park, which itself was a sequel to 1994's Theme Park. SimTheme 
 Park differentiated itself from Theme Park by hiding much of Theme Park's notorious micromanagement 
 elements, so it let you concentrate on building and expanding your park while managing the minutiae 
 only as you saw fit. The goals were invisible, but certain benchmarks regarding income, crowd capacity, 
 and so forth gave you rewards. SimCoaster dismisses the elegant design of its predecessor and instead 
 favors the often overwhelming amount of management found in the original Theme Park. It also gives 
 you very specific goals that must be completed to progress further into the game.           Golden 
 tickets will open new objectives and attractions    

 If it weren't for the significant changes to the gameplay, SimCoaster would look like an expansion 
 pack to SimTheme Park. This is primarily because it uses the same engine as that of its predecessor. 
 And mechanically, it plays the same as SimTheme Park. You place rides, paths, shops, decorative 
 features, and sideshow attractions. Placement is key, and you want to make sure your guests are 
 always on rides or spending money and that your guests always have easy access to the next diversion 
 once they've finished the last. You can also choose to wander around your park in the first-person 
 camcorder view, a nice feature that lets you witness everything from a visitor's perspective as 
 opposed to your normal, all-seeing overview.   

  The most obvious change in SimCoaster is that there is more of an overarching goal. You begin as 
 an employee of a theme-park management company. By successfully completing challenges and objectives 
 assigned to you by the owners, you'll earn more stock, get promotions, open new areas to build 
 in, and gain access to special rides. Objectives are different from challenges. The first are your 
 overall goals for that time, and these are usually related to expansion. A typical objective will 
 be to find some way to remove a lake so that you can build there. Challenges are ways of testing 
 your management mettle, and they include assignments like keeping a certain number of guests in 
 your park or keeping your employees happy for a predetermined amount of time. Often, your objectives 
 will be to succeed at a certain number of challenges.           SimCoaster features three new zones- 
 - The Land of Invention, Polar Zone, and Arabian Knights    

 In theory, it's a nice change from SimTheme Park's very open-ended gameplay. In reality, the challenges 
 serve only to add a layer between you and the game. The challenges reward you for almost exactly 
 the same types of things as in SimTheme Park. The difference is that instead of simply being rewarded 
 for having been a good manager for a period of time, you must choose the block of time during which 
 your skills will be judged. It doesn't add complexity, just complication.   

  What's more problematic is that these additions take your attention away from the enjoyable part 
 of the game: building and planning your park. In SimTheme Park and Chris Sawyer's extremely popular 
 RollerCoaster Tycoon, the objectives seem directly tied to your ability to design a high-quality 
 park. In SimCoaster, the goals are much more focused on management. The original Theme Park was 
 a business management simulator disguised as an amusement park game, and SimCoaster returns to 
 these roots. The problems you deal with will be numerous and varied.   

  You wear many hats in SimCoaster. You're the park planner, the labor manager, the accountant, and 
 the head of security. You must constantly deal with problems, from employees wanting raises to 
 unruly kids setting fire to your bushes and trash cans. Once your park gets big, the problems come 
 fast and furious, and it can get more than a little frustrating when you're trying to build an 
 expansion area at the same time. Your advisor will pop up to inform you of problems, and eventually 
 she's almost always onscreen alerting you of one imminent disaster or another. You can always turn 
 off her commentary, but you would miss many important problems. An e-mail-like message system, 
 which is the other means of learning about significant events, is easy to overlook when you're 
 putting out fires all over your park.    

 Like SimTheme Park, SimCoaster features different zones. After you complete a few objectives in 
 one zone, another will become available. The zones are supposed to be part of the same park, but 
 they are very distinct areas. They aren't connected, other than on the larger, overview map, and 
 your monetary earnings in one are unaffected by the others. The zones are the retro-science-fiction 
 of the Land of Invention, the icy Polar Zone, and the desert landscape of Arabian Knights. As in 
 SimTheme Park, the only real differences between the zones are the difficulty (determined by the 
 amount of space and the variety of rides and attractions available to you at the start) and the 
 graphics. Each zone features the same basic rides -- just with a graphical change that suits the 
 theme.           The camcorder view lets you wander around your park from a first-person perspective 
    

 The rides in SimCoaster are imaginative, but nowhere near as fantastic as those found in SimTheme 
 Park. There are no huge apes spinning bananas over their heads. The misleading title would have 
 you believe that the emphasis in SimCoaster is on designing and building roller coasters, but, 
 in fact, the title seems like little more than an attempt to cash in on the incredible success 
 of RollerCoaster Tycoon. There are a wide variety of coasters in SimCoaster, but, unlike in Chris 
 Sawyer's game, they are not based on real-world and theoretical coasters. The coaster design kit 
 lets you design thrill rides when you are not actually working in your park, but SimCoaster's track 
 editor is simpler, and less satisfying, than the one in RollerCoaster Tycoon. The only real advantage 
 in SimCoaster is that you can actually ride the coasters you design.   

  Unless you crave micromanagement, you'll find SimCoaster to be less satisfying than RollerCoaster 
 Tycoon overall. This fact seems ironic given that RollerCoaster Tycoon was clearly inspired by 
 the original Theme Park. It's true that SimCoaster is a better-looking game than the relatively 
 older RollerCoaster Tycoon, but even SimCoaster's engine is starting to look dated -- its colorful 
 rides and attractions don't look as crisp as they did a year ago. However, the design of the game's 
 scenery is imaginative, and wandering around your park can be fun. It can be especially enjoyable 
 considering that there are a variety of new types of guests in the game since SimTheme Park. In 
 addition to children, you'll see adults and seniors wandering around. The seniors actually add 
 a strange element to the game -- you'll occasionally get reports that someone is saying bad things 
 about your park and that you should call a security guard to stop the person. It seems that basic 
 human rights don't apply in SimCoaster's amusement parks.           Good ride and shop placement 
 is the key to success    

 In a case like this, you simply right-click on the unruly guest and select "call guard for discipline." 
 SimCoaster has added a number of convenient interface options, and you can right-click on anything -- from 
 guests to vomit -- to get a list of actions you can take. Unfortunately, there are some small problems 
 with the interface. Once you open an interface window, you can't open another until you manually 
 close the active one. Though your scientists all hang out in the research lab, you can't actually 
 hire them from the lab. It's unintuitive and inconvenient at times when you want to put more scientists 
 on a particular project.   

  Much of SimCoaster seems inconvenient. SimTheme Park was enjoyable and easy to play, though there 
 were complex mechanics going on beneath the surface. SimCoaster just brings all the complexity 
 to the surface, without adding any real sense of reward for making you jump through the continuous 
 hoops it places in front of you. The resulting game seems to focus on all the wrong elements. Instead 
 of letting you create a park and watch your guests enjoy it, the game makes you spend most of your 
 time fretting about things like having to give a two-dollar raise to a guy in an animal suit.

Review:  How could anyone not like this game?!
  This highly addictive theme park creator is one of the best to ever hit our computer screens.
 
  You start of with a zone called Land Of Invention and have to complete tasks to open up new areas 
 like Polar Zone and Arabian Nights .
  It doesn't take long to learn how to play as the helpful (though sometimes annoying) blue advisor 
 helps you at the beginning (Turn her off in the Options Menu) .
  When you get further into the game, the rides are priced higher to make it more difficult. Also 
 challenges will often become available as you continue through.
  If the game breaks down (Which it sometimes does) it automatically saves your game so you can continue 
 from the last point.
  It is possible to be fired on Simcoaster if you go bankrupt or lose too many challenges but that 
 is highly unlikely.
  The music in each zone is the only thing that bores me. It's the same all the time until you head 
 over to another zone which is usually a while.
  Also I have never finished the entire game and frankly it might be impossible.
  Overall this 
 is still a fantastic game and is well worth buying.
