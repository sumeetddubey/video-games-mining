:::Review:::
All 12 games in the package remain enjoyable to this day, each in turn a testament to the timelessness 
 of the genre. 

 The Ultimate RPG Archives is an important package not only because it contains an even dozen of 
 the best computer role-playing games in history, but also because it's the first such collection 
 where every single game within is still worth playing. Usually when a company throws together some 
 of its older products and puts them back on the shelves, you get a decent game or two along with 
 a bunch of fluff, which makes you realize just how much better games are now than they used to 
 be. Not so in the Ultimate RPG Archives; all 12 games in the package remain enjoyable to this day, 
 each in turn a testament to the timelessness of the genre.  

 Its contents represent over a decade's worth of top-tier computer role-playing games, more than 
 half of which Interplay originally developed. The Bard's Tale series appears in its entirety: The 
 trilogy composed of Tales of the Unknown, The Destiny Knight, and The Thief of Fate is present 
 along with the full-featured Bard's Tale Construction Set. The Bard's Tale pioneered the first-person 
 step-by-step computer RPG format, which would later appear again in Interplay's Dragon Wars, another 
 solid entry in the Archives, which adopts the Bard's Tale formula to a grittier, more hostile game 
 world. The only top-down RPG in the package is Interplay's Wasteland, which inspired the highly 
 acclaimed 1997 post-nuclear RPG, Fallout (Fallout sold separately!) . The last of Interplay's own 
 additions to the Archives is Stonekeep, a pretty-looking dungeon hack, which was hammered on by 
 critics and consumers alike when its lengthy development period culminated in its lukewarm 1995 
 release.  

 Even if Interplay were to go ahead and publish a package composed solely of its own role-playing 
 games, the end result would be pretty solid. But it also secured the rights to five third-party 
 RPGs, which make the Archives a truly superior value. New World Computing's Might &amp; Magic: 
 World of Xeen - which is M&amp; M four and five seamlessly connected together - remains a creative, 
 humorous, and exciting game. Sirtech's Wizardry Gold, a high-resolution remake of Wizardry VII: 
 Crusaders of the Dark Savant, is deep and very challenging, with advanced NPC interaction and character 
 development. But perhaps the greatest surprise in the package is Origin's Ultima Underworld I and 
 II, both true-3D role-playing masterpieces and unparalleled to date in terms of scale and scope. 

 At first glance, Interplay does a commendable job of making the games accessible even on today's 
 advanced hardware by supplying a helpful boot disk maker and a utility to temporarily slow your 
 machine so the older games won't run too fast. On top of that, you get a massive volume of over 
 500 pages containing the original documentation of all 12 RPGs. However, all maps and reference 
 materials originally included with these games are nowhere to be found, despite repeated reference 
 to them throughout the documentation. This frustrating oversight won't affect your enjoyment of 
 the majority of games in this package, but a few - namely the Bard's Tale trilogy - demand the 
 use of these materials to answer copy protection questions in order to advance. The magic of the 
 World Wide Web lets lucky gamers like you download the appropriate maps and code wheels from Interplay's 
 web site, but those looking for a complete product out of the box will be out of luck.  

 None of these games is aesthetically competitive against the current standards. The Bard's Tale 
 series and Wasteland look downright archaic. Even the once revolutionary Underworld games look 
 well worn. But each and every game in the Archives has a distinctive personality about it, an attractive 
 appearance, and a stylistic element that make you understand instantly why the game is still held 
 in high esteem. Even Stonekeep fits right into this collection, as its old-style gameplay feels 
 more appropriate among the similar genre pioneers than it did when the game was first released 
 not too long ago.  

 Eleven of the 12 games in this set are played in the first-person perspective. Nonetheless they 
 are all different and unique, and between their ranks they offer high adventure, great challenge, 
 difficult puzzles, sly wit, all manner of monster and villain, and ultimately hundreds upon hundreds 
 of hours of top-quality computer role-playing. Even with the missing reference materials, this 
 is a compilation of the utmost quality and value, and it's certain to be one of the best purchases 
 for your role-playing dollar this year.

Review:  As you may have figured out by now, i write reviews for older games, the ones that i have fond 
 memories of as a youth, and this collection is hands-down the ultimate package.
  
  Although these games can no longer be played on the more advanced systems without a emulator (which 
 is pretty easy to find on the web with little searching) they are the begining of RPG's as we come 
 to know and love.
  
  Wasteland is a prime example.
  
  Orginally owned by Eletronic Arts, this game encompases the very essence of role-playing games, 
 hours of gameplay, an intresting storyline, and character builds unique to rpg's of that time.
 
  
  These games as far as graphics go, haven't stood the test of time very well, but if you can look 
 past that, and remember the true age of these games, you'll be more than satisfied with this purchase.
 
  
  This game can still be purchased, widely on E-Bay for about 20 dollars....50 for a mint game.
