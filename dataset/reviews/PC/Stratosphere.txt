:::Review:::
The game never really takes advantage of its unique premise and winds up as a title that simply 
 isn't very compelling. 

 It's not often that we as gamers get to see something new and original. So when a game like Stratosphere 
 comes along, it's hard not to root for it. You hope that maybe this is the game that will end your 
 boredom with the countless "me too" copycats and provide you with hours of addictive gameplay. 
 Well, the good news is that Stratosphere is based on an intriguing premise and offers an interesting 
 plot and some decent 3D graphics. The bad news is that the game never really takes advantage of 
 its unique premise and winds up as a title that simply isn't very compelling.  

 The game takes place on a world where wars are fought by massive fortresses of rock that float in 
 the sky. These fortresses move and fight very much like ships and are appropriately organized into 
 navies. As the game begins, one of the greatest heroes in the land returns after a long absence, 
 during which most people have assumed him to be dead. Instead of coming home in celebration, the 
 long-lost hero attacks his home kingdom, setting off an interesting and intriguing plot. Your role 
 in this story is that of a rookie fortress commander. You have just completed your training and 
 now must build and command a series of fortresses in the civil war that has broken out.  

 Gameplay includes simplistic resource management and building elements, as well as action-packed 
 combat sequences between your fortress and those of your enemies. You gather resources (called 
 floatstones because they... umm... float) by flying near them as they sit conveniently on mountainsides. 
 These clumps of rock will break apart and float to your fortress, where you can then use them to 
 build new weapons, structures, and power supplies for your floating rock-o-death. You have a free 
 hand in selecting which items to build and where, but that's misleading. You're really quite limited 
 because of the scarcity of floatstones.  

 Still, the game includes a nice variety of weapons for your fortresses, ranging from basic cannons 
 and catapults on up to the mighty doom cannon. As you progress through the 24-mission single-player 
 campaign, you can earn promotions that grant you the right to command larger fortresses with access 
 to more powerful weapons. (Be warned that a game-stopping bug occurs in one of the later missions, 
 unless you install the latest patch) .  

 Most of the missions have you follow a series of waypoints and take out a series of bad guys, both 
 in the air and on the ground. I found it odd that all airborne units in this game move around at 
 exactly the same altitude. While the land-based forces (just flak emplacements, mostly) help spice 
 up the environment, it would have been more interesting to allow vertical movement of the fortresses. 
 This is the primary reason why I feel the game failed to deliver on its potential. After all, if 
 they all fly around at the same unchanging level, why not just make them ships instead of floating 
 fortresses?  

 Despite the fact that the combat takes place in only pseudo 3D, the 3D space around each battle 
 is pretty impressive. The terrain is nicely detailed, with winding rivers and sprawling cities 
 visible on the ground below. Settings throughout the game include grassy regions, lakes, snow-covered 
 mountains, and volcanic regions. Even more impressive is the orchestral soundtrack, which is one 
 of the best I've heard.  

 The interface leaves plenty of room to view the action but does so at the expense of the tons of 
 information being presented to you throughout the game. The status of your fortress is presented 
 in an unwieldy format that's something like a Windows Explorer file menu, while the text messages 
 at the bottom of the screen are so small that they often pass by without notice.  

 The game is fairly difficult, though the challenge has little to do with the AI, which seems scripted 
 for the most part. The main difficulty lies in the puzzle-style mission designs, which can be downright 
 frustrating until you "solve" them and stumble across a winning strategy. Also, the game does not 
 allow you to adjust the difficulty setting during campaign play. Finally, the computer seems to 
 always have better equipment than you, and your tiny cannons must pound away for several minutes 
 to achieve the sort of destruction the computer inflicts with a single shot.  

 Multiplayer support is decent, allowing up to four players to take part in fortress battles via 
 TCP/IP and IPX links. Two players can battle it out over modem and direct serial connections. Gameplay 
 includes basic deathmatch-style action as well as team-based missions. Unfortunately, the game 
 was slow and unstable during my attempts to play it over the Internet.  

 Basically, Stratosphere is a game that immediately caught my eye and intrigued me with the promise 
 of something new. Unfortunately, the game fails to deliver on that promise. It's not a bad game, 
 and it can be quite fun when multiplayer mode works, but it just doesn't have the sort of gameplay 
 to keep players coming back.
