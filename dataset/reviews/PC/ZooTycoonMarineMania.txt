:::Review:::
Dinosaur Digs didn't significantly change or improve Zoo Tycoon. And unfortunately, neither does 
 Marine Mania. 

 When the original Zoo Tycoon was released last year, it seemed like a good idea at the time. It 
 was a management strategy game -- the kind of game that lets you create a virtual business. In this 
 case, it let you build a zoo, fill it with animal exhibits, and invite visitors to watch the animals 
 and buy snacks and souvenirs from your concession stands. Zoo Tycoon clearly tried to follow in 
 the footsteps of the phenomenal RollerCoaster Tycoon from 1999, which enjoyed tremendous retail 
 success for years. It wasn't quite as exciting as RollerCoaster Tycoon, and it wasn't quite as 
 fun as RollerCoaster Tycoon in many ways, but Zoo Tycoon was still a decent pastime and a perfect 
 way for parents with very young children to bond with kinds. Earlier this year, the first expansion 
 for Zoo Tycoon, Dinosaur Digs, was released, and it was rather disappointing, because even though 
 it added dinosaurs to zoos, it didn't significantly change or improve Zoo Tycoon. And unfortunately, 
 neither does Marine Mania. The new expansion pack features some new zoo animals, new exhibit types, 
 and the entire Dinosaur Digs expansion, but nothing else.           Building an aquatic exhibit 
 is a lot like building a regular one.    

 Marine Mania's most significant additions come in the form of aquatic animals and aquatic exhibits. 
 The game adds 20 new animals, most of which are fully aquatic, like dolphins and sharks, though 
 there are a few amphibious critters like sea lions. Building an aquatic exhibit is nearly identical 
 to building a land exhibit; you fence in an area and drop in an animal, though for many aquatic 
 creatures, you'll often need to adjust the depth of your exhibit tank, since some creatures prefer 
 deeper water than others. And just like in the original Zoo Tycoon, you can buy additional scenery 
 items for your new exhibits to make your animals happier. However, Marine Mania also adds a brand-new 
 feature: the ability to put on an aquatic show by building an adjacent "show tank." Basically, 
 this boils down to building an additional tank and some grandstands for your audience.   

  Unfortunately, these shows, much like the exhibits in both Dinosaur Digs and the original Zoo Tycoon, 
 sound a lot more exciting than they really are. You can buy toys and research new tricks for your 
 critters, but your shows are generally extremely short and look anything but spectacular, thanks 
 to the game's dated 2D graphics, sheer lack of detailed animation, and sparse sound. Since Zoo 
 Tycoon itself has no background music, an aquatic show will generally consist of a brief music 
 clip signaling the beginning of the show, a very brief show in which your critter performs a few 
 stilted animations then heads right back to its tank, and that's basically it. If you try to keep 
 your critters performing continuously, they'll become exhausted and miserable, and no one will 
 want to watch the shows. Basically, it seems as though very young children, who like animals but 
 may be frightened by loud noises or sudden movements, might be the only ones who will truly enjoy 
 these aquatic shows. Anyone older probably won't find them to be stimulating enough to be interesting 
 over time, especially if they've already played through Zoo Tycoon. Still, there's something to 
 be said for building a huge zoo that contains land-bound animals, dinosaurs,  and  aquatic creatures -- some 
 of the later scenarios will at least keep you occupied for a while, if they can hold your interest 
 long enough.   

  Beyond that, Marine Mania still has the same problems as Zoo Tycoon. You still can't really tell 
 what kind of concession stands and attractions would be best to build for your guests. The game 
 still suffers from a lack of keyboard shortcuts and requires you to hunt for onscreen icons with 
 your mouse. The game's sound is still entirely too sparse, even in a crowded zoo, and since Marine 
 Mania makes no improvements to Zoo Tycoon's graphics, the game hasn't gotten any better looking 
 with age, either. The game's pixelated 2D graphics are colorful but have the same washed-out look 
 as in the previous editions and suffer from the same lack of detail and lack of interesting animations 
 for your animals. You're also still limited to viewing your zoo at two restrictive zoom levels 
 that don't let you get a close look at your animals, either.           Unfortunately, aquatic shows 
 don't look too spectacular.    

 All things considered, Marine Mania is a good choice for fans of Zoo Tycoon, especially for those 
 who missed out on Dinosaur Digs the first time, or for parents who want to spend quality time with 
 their small child or children. Unfortunately, if you didn't care for Zoo Tycoon in the first place, 
 then Marine Mania's unimpressive presentation and largely unchanged gameplay probably won't do 
 much to change your mind.

Review:  You get to build your zoo marine, pick and take care of your animals and hire staff so you can 
 run a zoo and try to get the best ratings. Just like all the others but in this one you get sea 
 life!! They live in tanks that you set up around the zoo and you can also do shows with some of 
 the animals (orca's, dolphins...) . The graphics are good and so is the sound and the game play that 
 is almost endless. I would have to say that out of all the zoo Tycoons This one is the best for 
 me!

Review:  I think this game is safe and fun for the family. It gets boring after an hour or 2. Cheats and 
 downloads make at more fun! If you are just buying the game for it to be hard save you money. If 
 you are buying it for fun BUY IT. 
  BUT its up to you to find out!!!!!!!!!
  Go to zoo tycoon home web site to get the Full downloads or here. Go here for the cheats though. 
 Need a fast computer. For downloads. 
  Guest are hard to please!!!! And some animals are the same way. Fish tanks get dirty fast if you 
 have more then 9 fish in the tank. The workers are Not like Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 at all!!! Meaning 
 that you cant Place them where you want them!
