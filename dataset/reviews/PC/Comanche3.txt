NovaLogic is back with a sequel worthy of giving Longbow a spin. 

 There's some pretty stiff competition among the many helicopter sims that surfaced over the past 
 year, but most have been silenced by the recent release of EA/Jane's Longbow Gold collection. Just 
 when it looked there was a clear-cut rotary wing winner, NovaLogic is back with a sequel worthy 
 of giving Longbow a spin.  

 Comanche 3 is a based on America's most technologically advanced helicopter - the RAH-66 Comanche 
 - developed by Boeing Sikorsky for the US Army. The first prototype became airborne only two months 
 ago, and implementation of this 21st century combat chopper won't be until the year 2006. Fortunately, 
 air combat enthusiasts can test-drive the next best thing to this 12 million-dollar aircraft, but 
 don't expect this game to be just the original Comanche with new missions - both graphics and gameplay 
 are leaps and bounds ahead of the simple shooter released almost three years ago.  

 The first NovaLogic game built around its patented Voxel Space 2 rendering technology, Comanche 
 3 features photo-realistic terrain and sky effects, creating some of the most stunning graphics 
 and light-sourcing ever seen in a simulation. Flying over snow-capped mountains, moving trains, 
 jungles, deserts, lakes, and crop fields over the Ukraine, Jordan, Siberia, Cuba, and Iraq, reveals 
 unparalleled detail - even at close range. All of the 100-plus objects in the game are composed 
 of texture-mapped polygons and are unbelievably lifelike, from trees and buildings to tanks and 
 support vehicles. With the right camera angle, you can even witness the Comache's weapon bay doors 
 open and the landing gear retract.   

 The original Comanche also played more as an arcade game than an authentic helicopter simulation. 
 This time around, however, NovaLogic has worked with military consultants and Army test pilots 
 to incorporate accurate helicopter physics, and you have the option of an easy or advanced flight 
 model. The advanced model faithfully recreates the Comanche's high-tech features and forces you 
 to consider the stresses put on the engine, and the option to use a vertical stabilizer, HoverHold 
 feature, or altitude lock. . Take note, even the advanced model is not as difficult to master as 
 the steep learning curve in Jane's AH-64D Longbow. Comanche 3 is perfect for the beginner to intermediate 
 player. Although both Comanche and Longbow games come equipped with a handy keyboard reference 
 card, the controls are much easier to learn and use than they are in Longbow, plus the digital 
 HMD (head mounted display) is laid out more effectively and is less obtrusive. You and your wingmen 
 are armed with ample stingers, cannons, hellfires, and rockets, as you set out on recon missions, 
 hard-hitting strike attacks, vehicle escorts, and defensive objectives. Other features in Comanche 
 3 include 20 different camera angle views (great during recorded playback!) , support for a wide 
 variety of peripherals, and 16-bit stereo 3-D Dolby Surround sound. Gamers will be treated to actual 
 pilot chatter and digitized sounds of a real Comanche in flight.   

 Comanche 3 is not without fault. Gamers with a Pentium-100 or under should hold off on picking up 
 Comanche 3 until your next inevitable upgrade. Even on a P-133, with 32 MB RAM, the frame rate 
 is slow and motion proves choppy, even with most of the detail turned down. Game manufacturers 
 usually attempt to balance speed vs. graphic detail, and NovaLogic has obviously opted for the 
 latter. In its defense, NovaLogic has allowed for multiple resolution settings (six options ranging 
 from 320 x 200 VGA up to 640 x 480 SVGA) , but choosing any of the lower resolutions is simply cheating 
 yourself of the game's best asset.   

 NovaLogic may have also overlooked two of the most important trends in PC gaming - custom-built 
 scenarios and Web-based playing. Comanche 3 only comes equipped with four operations containing 
 32 levels, plus optional training exercises. Compare this to the 400-plus missions in Longbow Gold 
 (which also contains the Flash Point Korea expansion CD) and the lack of a map generator to customize 
 the game. This unfortunately takes away from the replayability of Comanche 3.  

 Multiplayer gaming seemed more of an afterthought as well. Although the game is playable over a 
 modem (two players) and LAN (up to eight players) , there is no Internet play besides using the 
 Kali service (the CD does contain the Kali starter kit) .   

 While these imperfections cannot be ignored, Comanche 3 is still one of the most fun and addictive 
 games of the year. After playing Comanche 3 for hours on end (you know, that "one more mission" 
 phenomena) , you'll see that NovaLogic's latest is far more than just eye-candy, and the striking 
 scenery and excellent helicopter detail make this futuristic helicopter combat sim a must-have 
 for budding pilots.

Review:  I was a huge fan of the original Comanche game so when I saw Comanche 3, it was a must have for 
 me. However Comanche and Comanche 3 were two totally different games. The original comanche played 
 more like an arcade style game than anything. It had simple controls, simple missions, and a small 
 learning curve. I was kinda expecting the same with comanche 3 but was in for quite a suprise. 
 The controls were made to be a bit more life like, along with the missions, weapons, enviroment, 
 etc. Though this helped add realism (which I'm always a big fan of) having had some much fun with 
 the original comanche I was wanting more of an arcade experience again so I was a bit let down 
 at first. However as I started messing around with the newer controls and adoaring the beautiful 
 graphics, I started to enjoy the game more and more and it turned out to be quite a good flight 
 simulator.

Review:  Comanche 3 is as you have probably guessed, the third in the line of Comanche games, this is the 
 first one I have played and I must admit, I now love it! 
  
  The game takes a while to get used to as there are a lot of controls. Once you get past this, the 
 game becomes a joy to play. You can blow up anything and can fly very high. The controls are semi-realistic 
 and the explosions look intense. Even now I still play this game and will for a long time! 
  
  I recommend this game to anyone as it is just SO good at what it aims to do and is an absolute 
 bargain as it is under the price of a CD!

Review:  Let me just say this is the only Comanche game Ive played, but when I get my new computer I will 
 get the new one.
  
  This game had me hooked right away. It takes a little to get used to all the controls and things 
 you can do. (Not that there are a bazillion like others) . But you will find how to use controls 
 that will aid in your missions and kills. Things like Hover Hold, and Altitude Return, Priority 
 Targeting just to name a few. As you get more familiar and better at piloting, the game will suck 
 you in. I play it using a simple joystick with fire button and two more that you can customize 
 to a control feature, and use the keyboard for all other inputs. The trigger fires the current 
 weaopn I pick, and I set up one button to return to altitude (which I preset at 21 feet) and then 
 the other to scan for targets. Its hard to tell you why this game rocks, but if you want a deep 
 game without being majorly overwhelming with data input, go get this game. Trust me its fun and 
 (later on) challenging.
  
  (Learning curve is based on almost total understanding) .
