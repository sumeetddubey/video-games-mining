 It's not often that you run into a PC gaming program that becomes more rewarding and fun the longer 
 you play it, but that's exactly the case with Pinball Builder - provided you're patient enough 
 to learn the ins and outs of this versatile program.  

 Now, that last sentence isn't meant to imply you can't start enjoying Pinball Builder as soon as 
 you install it. Nine playable tables (all can be played in Windows or DOS) are included with the 
 game, so you can try a few rounds to get your creative juices flowing before you get to the heart 
 of the program: the Workshop.  

 You've got two choices when creating your own table: build one essentially from scratch, or modify 
 one of the tables that comes with the game. I say "essentially from scratch" because there are 
 certain design parameters you don't have any control over - flippers, ramps, and side-guards are 
 already in place. Fortunately, there are 32 table templates to choose from, so finding one that 
 suits your tastes shouldn't be a problem.  

 Don't care for the background graphics on a table? No problem - import a PCX or BMP image of your 
 choosing to replace it. Adding a new object or modifying the appearance of an existing one is simple 
 thanks to the game's Graphics Editor, which lets you crop an existing graphic in the shape of kickers, 
 bumpers, lamps, and other objects and add it to the program's already extensive object library. 
 And once an object's been placed on the table you can change its properties (what happens when 
 you hit it) , from number of points, awards, and sound effects, to mirroring and rotating a graphic. 

 In short, Pinball Builder gives you a lot of tools to work with, and once you fully grasp the mechanics 
 of the interface you'll appreciate just how broad in scope the options are here. But the program 
 does have a few quirks. For one, I'm a little puzzled why you can't place ramps, though to be fair 
 it might be a little tough dealing with an object that's three-dimensional. But I can't figure 
 out why flippers aren't one of the objects you can place on the table, or why the program wasn't 
 designed to allow you to modify existing sound effects (or add new ones) .  

 Another problem I encountered was ball speed. With an ATI Mach 64 Pro Turbo PCI video card, the 
 ball moved at the speed of sound whether I was playing in DOS or Windows, while on an S3 video 
 card it ran fine in Windows and at 320x200 in DOS but accelerated to unplayable speeds as I increased 
 the DOS resolution. (21st Century Entertainment's Technical Support team is aware of the ATI Mach 
 64 problem and is currently working on a patch.)  

 Those gripes are relatively minor, however, compared to what Pinball Builder has to offer. Even 
 if you never create a table, you can still enjoy new challenges by loading tables created by other, 
 more industrious owners of Pinball Builder. But a word of warning: Things can get a little sluggish 
 if your system only meets the game's minimum system requirements. Your best bet is to download 
 the demo and see how well it runs on your machine before spending any money - that's what demos 
 are for, right?
