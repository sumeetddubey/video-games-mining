:::Review:::
Riddle of the Sphinx makes up for its technical shortcomings with a great location and an impressive 
 amount of detail. 

 DreamCatcher Games, the self-appointed savior of the adventure game genre in the United States, 
 has an erratic track record. It not only serves as a window for some of Europe's worst adventure 
 games to make their way into the United States, but it also serves as a means for independent developers 
 to get their games published. Riddle of the Sphinx falls into the latter category. And, like Traitor's 
 Gate before it, Riddle of the Sphinx is a game that makes up for its technical shortcomings with 
 a great location and an impressive amount of detail.   

  Riddle of the Sphinx is neither a remake of the confounding game by Imagic for the Atari 2600 nor 
 a retelling of Oedipus saving Thebes. Instead, the game takes the plot from Infocom's text-based 
 Infidel and adds a few twists. The game takes place in the modern day, and you play as an archaeologist 
 visiting the dig site of your mentor, Sir Gil Blythe Geoffreys. Geoffreys has vanished just before 
 making a great discovery regarding an artifact buried in a secret chamber in the Sphinx. He has 
 left behind clues that you must decipher in order to finish his work. The story is little more 
 than a clothesline on which to hang puzzles, but it serves its purpose and even manages to be involving, 
 especially when you're listening to the tapes Geoffreys has left behind for you.   

  Geoffreys' voice is provided by Jeffrey S. Tobler who, along with his wife Karen, did almost all 
 of the programming, art, and design for Riddle of the Sphinx. There are a few ancillary members 
 of their design team, and quite a few of them also have the last name Tobler. But for the most 
 part, this is a two-person show. It's a labor of love, and it shows. The personal nature is both 
 what makes the game seem rudimentary and what makes it great - this isn't the kind of game you 
 get when someone is concerned about the bottom line. Perhaps it's no surprise that the end result 
 is really good. In particular, the voice of Geoffreys is more believable than most of the voice 
 work in bigger-budget games. His notes to you are delivered so convincingly and naturalistically 
 that it seems at times as if David Mamet were directing the dialogue.   

  Likewise, the graphics and sound are well suited to the game. The score is subtle and atmospheric, 
 while the sparse sound effects are, if not particularly noteworthy, at least nonintrusive. The 
 graphics make up in detail what they lack in quality. That's not to say the art direction is bad, 
 but the low-resolution graphics do seem a bit dated. The Toblers have used Macromedia Director 
 as the backbone of the game, and the graphic quality suffers slightly as a result. But despite 
 the technical drawbacks, the design is great, and it features realistic environments and believable 
 settings.   

  Riddle of the Sphinx follows the same sort of format as the classic Myst - you read a lot of notes 
 and use the clues found therein to solve the numerous puzzles that await you in the locations you'll 
 visit. The puzzles are challenging but logical. The clues are there, but they aren't obvious. Occasionally, 
 the game does get slightly ridiculous. One puzzle early on requires you to control a mobile camera 
 as it travels through a small tunnel. That tunnel is so long that you'll undoubtedly think you've 
 done something wrong - but you must hold the "forward" button on the controls for what seems like 
 minutes. Luckily, moments like these are rare, and the puzzles will certainly be enjoyable to those 
 who loved or even liked Myst and the higher-quality games it inspired.   

  The obvious amount of research that informs Riddle of the Sphinx makes it a perfect choice for 
 those with an interest in Egyptology or just good old-fashioned puzzle solving. The subject matter 
 is old hat - there have been many games with the same setting. But the Toblers have added an amount 
 of depth and detail that makes the setting seem fresh, so that adventure gamers who haven't tired 
 of wandering empty landscapes in search of cryptic clues will doubtless be challenged and entertained 
 by Riddle of the Sphinx.

Review:  Gameplay: The game takes place in the modern day, and you play as an archaeologist visiting the 
 dig site of your mentor, Sir Gil Blythe Geoffreys. Geoffreys has vanished just before making a 
 great discovery regarding an artifact buried in a secret chamber in the Sphinx. He has left behind 
 clues that you must decipher in order to finish his work. The story is little more than a clothesline 
 on which to hang puzzles, but it serves its purpose and even manages to be involving, especially 
 when you're listening to the tapes Geoffreys has left behind for you. The gameplay is similer to 
 the gameplay of myst, so people who have played myst will be familier with playing this game. The 
 puzzles are challenging but logical. The clues are there, but they aren't obvious which can be 
 diffecult and really requires you to look and think.
  
  Graphics: The Graphics are really colorfull, detailed and very nice to look at I think. It's well 
 desined and it's like eye candy.
  
  Sound: The sound track is allright but there is not much diologe in this game besides the usually 
 sounds when you intract with something.
  
  Value: I personally think that this game has good replay value because the puzzules are fun to 
 solves and watch what happen's afterwards. This is a keeper to add to your computer game collection.
 
  
  So the obvious amount of research that informs Riddle of the Sphinx makes it a perfect choice for 
 those with an interest in Egyptology or just good old-fashioned puzzle solving. To bad this game 
 is mostly unknown and underrated *Sigh* alot of adventure games are like that today like this one, 
 to bad. So I give this game 8.6 out of 10.
  If you have not gotten this game and played it I suggest you go out there and pick it up for a 
 low price of $9-$10 or the double back where you get the first and second edition of this series 
 for the same price.

Review:  I'm not a fan of Myst-like games, but this was a little different. You're an archeologist's friend 
 sent to the Sphinx to find out some information. Apparently, the camp is a ghost town and everyone 
 has fallen to the curse. I found this game to have many hours of gameplay; at least a day.
  
  The graphics were okay. Nothing special, except the fact that only a couple created the game.
 
  
  The sounds are average. Not much people speech. The value was great since we got this game with 
 its sequel the Omega Stone. A value pack for $10 at GameSpot.
  
  I found the main menu to be a bit tricky to manuever. I nearly overwrited my save games.

Review:  This game seems first to be another Myst like game but this time in Egypt. It is similar but this 
 time you get to explore real places and uncover secrets, that you feel are really there. Take for 
 example the plot. A secret chamber is found under the Sphinx along with a papyrus. The discover 
 suddenly dissapears, and the papyrus is thought to be cursed. And now they calll you to help uncover 
 the secret. Sounds attractive, doesn't it? The graphics are really fantastic for my taste, and 
 the idea of traveling inside pyramids, tombs and other ancient monuments, makes me feel amazing 
 inside me, and every second you are finding more and more secrets! It is rather complicated to 
 win it, but when you do, the ending is great and will leave you wishing to go get the next part, 
 The Omega Stone, which also rocks.
