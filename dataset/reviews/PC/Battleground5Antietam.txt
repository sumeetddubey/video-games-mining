:::Review:::
It may not be the perfect Civil War game, but it's pretty darn close. 

 The Civil War was the bloodiest conflict in American history. Four years of bitter fighting gave 
 us the North and South, heroes and cowards, victories and defeats. Places such as Shiloh and Gettysburg 
 still echo with the ghosts of battles past. Leaders such as Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant 
 set the standards for future commanders. Talonsoft attempts to capture both the substance and sprit 
 of this period with the fifth entry in the Battleground series. Battleground: Antietam allows you 
 to recreate "the bloodiest single day in American history" in amazing detail.  

 Battleground: Antietam reflects the continuing development of the series. The outstanding graphics 
 of the game remain one of its many strengths. Multiple views of the battlefield provide you with 
 the information you need to make informed decisions. Pop-up video footage, while entertaining at 
 first, can be turned off if you have tired of seeing the same artillery barrage for the 100th time. 
 The limited sound effects do convey the action more than adequately. The historical music, courtesy 
 of Bobby Horton, may explain the low morale among the troops of the time.  

 The multitude of scenarios - ranging from selected engagements to "what-if" situations - offer good 
 replay value. New features (available in the v1.10 update) include excellent items such as Extreme 
 Fog of War and Internet play. With Extreme Fog of War enabled, you don't know much about the units 
 you square off against. Battleground: Antietam also provides an option that allows you to adjust 
 the combat odds during the game. The "advantage" slider makes it easier to learn the game without 
 growing too frustrated.   

 The computer AI often makes the game interesting. Questionable moves are frequently followed by 
 brilliant strokes. The computer's unpredictable actions force you to adapt as the battle progresses. 
 If you grow bored with annihilating the computer's forces, the multiplayer mode allows you to test 
 your abilities against another human. You can crush your opponent by e-mail, over a modem, or on 
 the Internet.   

 Battleground: Antietam is extremely well done. Graphics, sound, and gameplay distinguish this from 
 the numerous others in the category. It may not be the perfect Civil War game, but it's pretty 
 darn close.
