:::Review:::
Even if you've finished Doom II and its siblings, this one might be worth taking a look at. 

 
 There are over 20 games in the id Anthology and, although the collection claims to include everything 
 ever released by id, there is the obvious omission of the joint venture with Raven Software: Heretic. 
 Too bad - Heretic was outstanding. However, fans of 3-D games won't be disappointed with this cornucopia 
 of primal carnage. The four-CD pack includes such classics as Commander Keen, Rescue Rover, and 
 Wolfenstein 3D, as well as more contemporary hits such as Doom II, Final Doom, and the ground-breaking 
 Quake. Yes, that's right - the software company that holds the record for the most broken Ctrl 
 keys in this decade has packaged all of its games together in one neat little bundle.  

 When reading this review, it is important to remember that the scores reflect a combination of the 
 whole id library, from 1990 to the present. Sure, Commander Keen may not look as good as Quake, 
 but give the little guy a break... he's six years old and still mildly entertaining (at least a 
 lot more than most six-year-olds I know) . And Wolfenstein 3D may not seem like much nowadays, but 
 a few years back it was the only action game in town.  

 With a $110 price tag, the id Anthology may be a bit expensive for those who already own the Doom 
 series and Quake. But for those of you who still haven't jumped on the bandwagon and indulged yourselves 
 in a bit of violent mayhem, this is the compilation for you. And even if you've finished Doom II 
 and its siblings, this one might be worth taking a look at. Quake alone is going for nearly $70, 
 so why not take the plunge and sink an extra $40 into countless hours of furious fun with the id 
 Anthology? Just think, your grandkids may thank you one day for giving them the chance to play 
 this collection of games by id - the software company that defined 3-D action gaming.

Review:  Games like Halo and Half Life may be awesome, but they owe their existence to Doom. There were 
 FPS games before Doom, most notably Wolfenstein, but Doom was the first Multi-player FPS. It was 
 the game to introduce the Shotgun, Double Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, Chainsaw, and more. The original 
 Doom alone I would rate about a 10. Doom, Doom II (plus two expansion games for Doom 2 which had 
 entirely different stages) , Quake, and all the old 80's-90's games that allowed ID Games to become 
 what it is today can score nothing less than a 10 out of 10. If you like platformers, you'll enjoy 
 the Commander Keen series. If you like FPS, you owe it to yourself to see what the original FPS 
 games were like (every one of them is on this collection) . If you like puzzle or strategy games, 
 there's some of that here too, if older games don't turn you off. Hands down this is the best collection 
 I have ever had the pleasure of owning. And with the possible exception of the Final Fantasy series, 
 there is no other purchase that has captured my attention so completely.
