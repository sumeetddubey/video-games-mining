:::Review:::
Fable is an earnest but uneven effort. 

 Fable is an earnest but uneven effort. Its eye-grabbing graphics and decent voice acting do not 
 make up for its minimally challenging and unoriginal puzzles, abundant anachronistic humor, and 
 design flaws.  

 Fable falls into the King's Quest vein of point-and-click, inventory-oriented graphic adventures. 
 But it fails to meet the high quality we've come to expect from the best of that genre.  

 I'd set up the back story for you but it's too convoluted and confusing. The quest is easier to 
 explain. Basically, you're in a fictional medieval kingdom. A priest volunteers you, for no apparent 
 reason, to visit four magical lands, slay their four beastly rulers, and recover four jewels. Success 
 will somehow bring peace and tranquility to your hometown.  

 Fable's adventure elements - look everywhere, pick up everything, insert object here, use combination 
 there - are generally routine. There are a few problems and some obscure hidden hot-spots, but 
 most experienced adventurers will find nothing new or overly ambitious here.  

 The inventory gathering sometimes defies logic. Feel free to rummage through a witch's pantry and 
 cellar while she sleeps, blithely unaware of your kleptomania. There's no need to trick her or 
 interact with her in any way. She's just a prop, as are several other characters. Slaying the bad 
 guys is fairly straightforward, and they generally give you ample time to find the right item to 
 accomplish your task.  

 There are some nagging design problems: The settings, while superbly colored and detailed, are diminished 
 by the herky-jerky animation and non-lip-synched dialogues. When you die, nothing happens. The 
 first few times you have no idea whether or not you're still playing the game. You need to hit 
 escape to finally bring up a menu and restore a saved game. And the interface is clumsy. Instead 
 of having the most logical action be the first to appear, you usually have to click through a whole 
 smorgasbord of selections before finding what you need.  

 In what appears to be a medieval setting, the bathroom and juvenile jokes are jarring and misplaced 
 and the characters speak with a multitude of modernisms - complete with contemporary slang. These 
 issues wouldn't be such a problem if Fable had any sense of identity, but the game switches between 
 fantasy and farce without warning.  

 Finally, the ending (s) are terrible. The UK version has two, neither very satisfying: You die in 
 a cave-in or celebrate your twenty-first birthday in prison after having "merged your family with 
 a frozen mackerel at the age of three," whatever that means. So Sirtech wanted to come up with 
 what I guess would be considered a more satisfying ending for the US version. I won't tick them 
 off further by telling you what it is - but I will say they failed miserably.  

 All that said and done, should you buy Fable? If you're a fan of graphic point-and-click adventures 
 looking for a mildly entertaining, two-day diversion and you see Fable on the remainder rack, sure. 
 Enjoy the eye-candy and problem solving, and perhaps a few yuks at the inappropriate jokes, but 
 don't expect much else.

Review:  Even if we let aside the fact that there's no music in the game, overlook the fact that even tho 
 there's speech, there isn't even the slightest attempt to make lipsinc to the characters, what 
 really bothered me the most about this game is just bad programming. I mean, you can go to a house, 
 knock on the door, and Quickthorpe will say "I guess there's nobody home", then you can open the 
 door and see that there's an old woman there, talk to her for a few minutes, then you walk outside 
 and if you knock, he'll say, again, "I guess there's nobody home". In another instance, you can 
 "look" at a chair, and Quickthorpe will say "the Chair's nice, but check out the green lady". What 
 green lady? the one that you're suppose to see hovering above the chair 3 chapters from now, and 
 is nowhere to be seen ATM. More examples of bad programming includes death scenarios that leaves 
 you unaware that you're even dead (there's no pop up or anything, the game keeps going, only you 
 can't do anything) .
  I played this game to the end using a walkthrough, simply to get it over with. The ending is lame 
 and unsatisfying (there's another ending possible, but whenever i try to do it, the game crashed) .
 
  Overall, the only good thing this game has to offer is good graphics, beautifully well drown and 
 quite high quality for the time. But it seems like the game came out incomplete and was rushed 
 out, otherwise it's hard to explain why there are so many fundamental flaws.

Review:  Fable, ahhhhhh the old times, ireally liked this game because of the funny puzzles and beasts.
 
  
  Gameplay:
  hmmmmmmmm.
  +4 different worlds with puzzles to complete.
  +Funny puzzles and beasts.
  -Puzzles a bit too hard
  -No language support.
  
  Graphics:
 
  +My god, the number of colors is good.
  +beasts and stuff look good.
  -Bit too old for the year 1997 though.
  
  Sounds:
  +Voice acting in the game.
  -Bwahhh.
 
  -No music???
  
  Value:
  -Playing it once is enough, because it will take you weeks before you finish a puzzle or quest.
 
  
  Variety:
  hmmmmmm.
  -Not much to do, just finish quests.
  
  Online:
  Hell no......
  This is a puzzle game.
  
  Hmmmmmmm, the old fable it gives me memories, bad 
 and good.
  Cya all and whenever you playing this game, good luck.
