:::Review:::
At last, a well-executed game based on the recent batch of Star Trek shows. At last, a well-executed 
 game based on the recent batch of Star Trek shows. The game doesn't waste any time: five minutes 
 into gameplay, the player is confronted with a violation of Federation space, a group of alien 
 defectors requesting political asylum, and a very large and pissed-off Romulan pursuit ship. For 
 me, part of A Final Unity's appeal may be because I'm so used to computer games' bad voice-acting 
 and HORRIBLE dialogue. Next to that stuff, this title's decent writing and Patrick Stewart's thespian 
 baritone seem like the last batch of Sno-Cones in Hell. (In fact, the voice talent of the entire 
 cast is here.) Further, almost every aspect of the gamesave-screens, astrogation, tactical 
 combat, even the design of the manualis presented in a very attractive, straight-faced style 
 consistent with what I shall call Star Fleet Aesthetics. Players less interested in starship operations 
 and more excited by living the lives of their favorite Star Trek characters may delegate' 
 technical operations such as combat and power routing to crew members if they wish, but the hard-core, 
 armchair starship commander can take full controla very nice arrangement. In fact, if the 
 game has a notable flaw, it may be that options are sometimes a little too open, and the player's 
 range of choices a little too broad. (But of course if we game reviewers didn't bitch about something, 
 nobody would read our stuff.) Overall, this game offers an excellent extension of the feel of the 
 show, and a solid game design as well.

Review:  It's just too bad paramount hasn't released more Star Trek games of this caliber. I remember playing 
 this game with my dad back when i first got into TNG and it was an AMAZING experiance. It feels 
 like you are actually living through an episode of the classic series. Not only are all the characters 
 there but the voice actors are too. As it is very rare now a days for a TV franchise game to use 
 the actual cast's voices. The graphics were superb for when it was released and is not too far 
 from PC graphics today. One of my favorite parts of the game is going on a way missions you get 
 to pick and choose who you want to beam down. They even have the imfamous Majel Barrett (computer 
 voice) do the ... report to the transporter room... line. If i could find it i would deffinatly 
 play through this game again, maybe 2 or even 3 times!
  
  Though a few games have come close not many have really matched the quality of A Final Unity. If 
 you can manage to get your hands on a copy i very much recomend picking it up if your a huge Star 
 Trek fan.
