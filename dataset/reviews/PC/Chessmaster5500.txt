The worst thing you can say about Chessmaster 5500 is that you might not want to spend the bucks 
 on it if you already own Chessmaster 5000. 

 The worst thing you can say about Chessmaster 5500 is that you might not want to spend the bucks 
 on it if you already own Chessmaster 5000 - but that's more of a comment on how outstanding the 
 Chessmaster series is rather than a slam against the latest installment. Simply put, Chessmaster 
 5500 is far and away the best all-around chess program for PCs on the market. There might be stronger 
 chess engines available, but there's definitely none that has as much to offer novice, intermediate, 
 and even expert players as CM 5500.  

 Of the new features introduced in Chessmaster 5500, most notable is the addition of over 12 hours 
 of audio instruction, critical analysis, and narration. Three of the program's 26 core chess tutorials 
 are accompanied by speech, but don't think that's skimpy: All these core tutorials (including an 
 excellent audio tutorial on chess concepts written by Grandmaster Yasser Seirawan) are subdivided 
 into more specific categories. The addition of speech really does make the initially daunting task 
 of learning strategies and ideas a much more appealing prospect, though I'd love to see the ability 
 to "back up" during a lesson, as well as be able to actually move the pieces when challenged and 
 be congratulated if you chose correctly.  

 Another area where speech adds immeasurably to the presentation is in Josh Waitzkin's annotated 
 games. Waitzkin, the subject of the excellent movie (and book) Searching for Bobby Fisher, is a 
 20-year-old international master whose love for chess shines clearly in his spoken analysis of 
 five of his most memorable games. My favorite is his match against lifetime U. S. Master Ed Frumkin; 
 it was the ten-year-old Waitzkin's first win over a master and was won by Waitzkin with a wonderfully 
 planned sacrifice of the queen and a rook. (I particularly appreciated that four of the five games 
 have separate annotations for beginners as well as advanced players, and that all feature the ghosted 
 pieces and movement.) Waitzkin also authored eleven advanced chess tutorials, but these aren't 
 accompanied by speech.  

 But perhaps the most impressive use of audio comes in the game's Natural Language Advice feature. 
 At any point during a game, you can ask the program to tell you what the best move is - and along 
 with the suggestion comes an explanation of why it's best, complete with moving pieces indicating 
 what moves you should make to your opponent's various responses. Chessmaster 5500 can also build 
 a voice annotation (analysis) of an entire game, but how good the annotation is depends on the 
 speed of your processor, the number of moves, and how long you allow the program to analyze each 
 move. Even if it took an hour, though, the results would be worth it: This powerful and impressive 
 learning tool is unmatched by any other chess product on the market  

 Just the tutorials and Natural Language Advice are probably worth the price of admission, but Chessmaster 
 5500 has several other interesting features for the beginning and intermediate player. With "Rate 
 My Play," Chessmaster 5500 will approximate your level of chess expertise by asking you to make 
 the correct moves at various points in historical matches; "John Nunn's Favorite Puzzles" provides 
 50 of the Grandmaster's favorite mind-bending chess puzzles that challenge you to find the shortest 
 winning line for a particular position; and activating the teaching mode will inform you of hazards 
 such as isolated pawns, pinned pieces, pieces that can be captured by your opponent, and more. 
 About the only gripe I have, in fact, is that the solutions to the chess puzzles only show the 
 first move: I'd rather see it worked all the way to the end, especially in some of the more complicated 
 problems.  

 Once you've sharpened your skills against the CM 5500's computer opponents by studying opening book 
 lines (over 2200) and competing against virtual chess luminaries such as Fisher, Tal, Kasparov, 
 Karpov, and dozens of others, it's time to head onto the Net for some competition against real 
 human opponents on Chessmaster Live. Any Chessmaster 5500 owner can play for free on CM Live, but 
 for a yearly fee of $19.95 you gain access to USCF-compatible ratings, daily tournaments, chess 
 classes, and a whole lot more. If you're at all interested in chess, it's a real bargain.  

 I could name some of CM 5500's other features - the opening book editor, classic game archives, 
 the outstanding graphics for boards and pieces, and more - but essentially it boils down to this: 
 If the reason you're thinking of buying a chess program is to improve your game, Chessmaster 5500 
 is the only way to go.

Review:  I don't think I would have even got this game if it didn't have such a low price. I bought it for 
 $3 and wow this is actually a great game for chess. Most people stay away from chess because people 
 think it is to hard but then you will want to play this game because it is hard.
  
  The gameplay is chess and it does have some extras in. There are different modes such as for beginners 
 there is a mode which will tell you some moves and tell you how to play, which is a great feature 
 in the game. A few other modes are for normal players and for better players. One of the best features 
 in the game is the different peices that you can select. you can personalise your game like this 
 bye picking the peices and the board that you want to play on which has a lot of options for you 
 to use. The A. I. is some of the ebst that I have seen in a game because unless you have mastered 
 chess you will lose in this game but after a while you do win a few matches but it does take a 
 while. This game has short load times and chess fans will love this game but that is about the 
 only people who will play this game because of the difficulty. The tip section can be annoying 
 but you can turn it off but they are useful. 8/10 in gameplay.
  
  The boards in the game are wow. Some of the boards in game look better that in the real world. 
 The peices that you can pick also look amzing and have designs that are from different parts of 
 the world. The screens could have used a little bit more details in the games. There are pics of 
 people who have played the game through the years. The best part graphically is most likely the 
 opening sceen when you start. there is only 1 load screen but you won't see it for more than a 
 few sections between matches. There really isn't that much to grade in the graphics but it does 
 deverse a soild 7/10 in sound.
  
  The sound, well there really isn't that much in game. Yes they are voices which help you in the 
 game by saying moves and telling you about sections in the game. But when it comes down to it this 
 game is not to good in the sound but I have to grade what is there not what isn't there so I would 
 give it a 6/10 in the sound department. 
  
  Chess fans will and need to play this game but not to many other people will want to play. It does 
 have additional info for beginners and for people who have played the Chessmaster series before 
 and there is some on famous players of the game but that isn't enough for people who don't like 
 chess to get the game. Still it is a great game that I believe people should play so I think this 
 game deverse a great rating.
