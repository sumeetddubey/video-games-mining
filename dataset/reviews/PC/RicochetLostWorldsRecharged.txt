:::Review:::
Recharged brings a wide collection of cool levels to an already interesting Arkanoid-style game. 
 

  Ricochet: Lost Worlds Recharged is a post-Arkanoid block-breaker that takes Taito's Breakout-enhanced 
 blueprint and spins it even further out of control with moving bricks, a collection of new and 
 interesting power-ups, and of course, updated graphics. The gameplay, however, is largely what 
 you'd expect from this style of game. You move a paddle at the bottom of the screen and attempt 
 to keep batting a ball up into a series of blocks at the top of the screen. When all the blocks 
 are broken, you move on to the next stage. Here, though, you've got all kinds of moving blocks 
 and plenty of devious setups to contend with.  

  The game's greatest strength is its value. Recharged is essentially a level add-on for the original 
 game, and it's got hundreds of levels. The game also has a level editor, which lets you make your 
 own collections of stages. The level editor is pretty deep, so dedicated folks should be able to 
 do some pretty cool stuff. All in all, this one's definitely worth checking out.

Review:  Great graphics, with alot of awesome animations going on at the backgrounds, the brick animations, 
 the brick movements, and the ship itself are just outstanding.
  Great sound, with just one tune coming from the theme song, but varies in instruments and tones 
 depending on the backgrounds, and the sound effects of every single movement happening.
  Great value, its worth its price, hell, it should be even more expensive!
  And Outstanding Gameplay, 
 the best part of the game, with over 300 levels in the normal package, and then all the doesnloadable 
 packs on its official site (www. ricochetlostworlds. com) , you can never get bored of this game. 
 All the powerups make the fun continueing, its not your ordinary brick-buster, its one of the most 
 hard-worked sleek style retro games out there, and being only a 11 MB downloadable packafe, and 
 just taking 40 MB of your hard-drive, this game is worth it. Plus, you cannot only play levels, 
 you can also make them! With the cool and big Level Editor option, you can make your very own set 
 of levels, and its not too hard to use either. This game is a MUST-HAVE for every gamer, hardcore 
 or casual. Hell, even anti-gamers should try this!

Review:  Ricochet: Lost Worlds Recharged follows in the well-worn shoes (boots, sandals, take your fancy) 
 of classic titles like Arkanoid and Breakout, and gives them a new-age twist. Essentially, Ricochet 
 is a 21st century incarnation of Breakout, that little game where you had to break blocks by moving 
 a floating platform ferrying a ball back and forth. Like Pong, the player controlled a small platform 
 back and forth across the screen, and keep it from passing you. But instead of the human opponent 
 who would keep the ball coming back, you now have blocks, which you must destroy in order to complete 
 the level. Time may have gone on since that concept came to fruition, but this kind of gameplay 
 is timeless.
  
  The sequel to the award winning Ricochet: Xtreme, Lost Worlds takes the formula to a bigger extreme, 
 with faster action and more head-scratching puzzles. Power ups are a big aspect of this, pitting 
 both beneficial and harmful spells on the ball. There are even power ups that don't affect the 
 ball itself, such as the machine gun and rocket launchers that can be equipped to your craft, or 
 the electric shield which will hang on to your ball, handy for getting that precise shot. Or some 
 that even affect the puzzles themselves, such as turning every second block explosive or warp holes 
 that can be hit into to reach otherwise inaccesible areas. And then there are just the entertaining 
 power ups that can give you around 80 balls, or multi-balls, or balls with lasers (seriously, needs 
 to be seen to be believed) or make the gameworld shrink, making the balls large enough to knock 
 out several targets at once.
  
  And it isn't just the power ups that make the difference, but also the creativity and general excellence 
 of the level designs. You will require some real problem solving skills to get past more than a 
 few. Generally, the courses get harder and you rely more and more on power ups to get you through, 
 though the level design can sometimes give you options as well.
  
  A personal favorite level of mine was after hitting a "do not hit" block, the entire rest of the 
 blocks on screen formed into one very ugly block alien and began eating away at my ship! Now, if 
 that isn't original, I don't know what is.
  
  Collecting the five hidden rings per level gives you bonus points, and collecting thirty five all 
 up will grant you an extra life. And they are not easy to find, as some can be devilishly clever 
 in keeping away from the player, warping from one side to the other, bouncing and hiding behind 
 blocks. Sometimes I found the greatest challenge in getting that last elusive ring before I completed 
 the level.
  
  Graphically, Ricochet isn't going to blow apart anyone's PC, but then, it's not trying to. There 
 is only so much graphical dressing you can add to a puzzle game like a Breakout clone, but it is 
 certainly one of the prettiest ones available. Being the sequel to the "breakout hit" Xtreme, Lost 
 Worlds opts for a more natural environment, like Molten Lava and Atlantis-esque tribal overtones. 
 Blocks are usually arranged in figures as well, highly reminiscent of a certain scene in Finding 
 Nemo.
  
  The many explosions and fast motion will engage players constantly, and there is no doubt that 
 Lost Worlds looks good. There is usually a lot happening at once. Cranelike arms quickly arrange 
 the levels, and your scoring info is nestled safely to the right. The interface is simple and problem 
 free.
  
  Suprisingly, the techno and hard rock soundtrack support the game experience very well. Considering 
 the tepid nature of the genre, this definately stands out. But when you consider how fast the on-screen 
 action can be, and how well the sound is implemented, you will find yourself smiling immediately. 
 The mechanical sound feels just right.
  
  The game's effects will have everyone reminiscing to the glory days of the Arcade. Explosions (and 
 there are lots of them) in particular are convincing, and the gentle bleep and bloop from ball 
 to craft is pleasing. On the whole, the effects do a fantastic job at creating the illusion of 
 classic arcade.
  
  With over one hundred and sixty levels, and several thousand player-made levels available online, 
 Lost Worlds is no slouch in longevity and value. While there is no multiplayer, you can easily 
 record high scores and compete online. The fact that many of the levels are so unique is also a 
 testament to the developers, but there is also option to create your own levels, which is very 
 rewarding. There is virtually no end to this game, and being such a small file, it isn't hard to 
 keep on your computer for quick bouts while in between bigger game sessions.
  
  Ricochet: Lost Worlds encompasses everything that is right about this kind of game. It provides 
 a family-fun title at a great price that will keep you playing for a good long time. For such a 
 simple game, this is something I can't help but keep coming back to. Give this game a try - you 
 won't be disappointed.
