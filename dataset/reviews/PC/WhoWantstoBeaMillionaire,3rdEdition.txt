:::Review:::
At this point in the series, the execution and the host are so familiar that the only appeal left 
 is the trivia challenge itself, which is unfortunate. 

  The Who Wants to Be a Millionaire computer game concept feels about as listless as its host Regis 
 Philbin now sounds in this unrevised sequel. When the irrepressible pitchman starts the game with 
 his familiar cry, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire... Third Edition ," even he sounds bemused that 
 the publisher is milking the show's waning popularity yet again.           The only new feature 
 is downloadable question sets.    

  It seems as if not one line of programming code has been changed this third time out since the 
 previous installment. To its credit, the basic Millionaire game engine has always been a competent 
 translation of the prime-time experience. On a nicely animated version of the TV set, you respond 
 via keyboard commands to an increasingly difficult list of multiple-choice trivia questions. While 
 Regis doesn't read the individual questions, his characteristic urgings and chides are piped in 
 as you make your way up the money tree to the $1 million question. The topic mix (familiar phrases, 
 pop culture, sports, science, history, and so on) is all here, and unlike in previous editions, 
 this question set doesn't seem as dominated by TV trivia.   

  The lifelines are handled creatively. Phoning a friend for help gives us a cute exchange with one 
 of Regis' apparently endless collection of oddball acquaintances (from circus clowns to grease-monkey 
 savants) . They may or may not provide you with the right guess, although you can often get a pretty 
 good read on the accuracy of the guess from the nature of the exchange between Regis and the friend. 
 The 50/50 option eliminates two of the possible four answers for a question, and the poll-the-audience 
 lifeline uses actual response data from test audiences.   

  The only revision in this third edition is a fresh set of trivia questions and the new ability 
 to download additional question sets from the game's home Web site. Currently, only one specialty 
 question set on famous phrases is available online, which seems either stingy or lazy since this 
 is the only new feature of the new edition. Worse, this set turns out to be really only a single 
 run of 15 questions that can be played once -- not a full library of sets that can be played repeatedly 
 without encountering the same question twice. Also, considering the game's target audience of casual 
 consumer gamers, the procedure for downloading these new questions is surprisingly awkward. The 
 software launches the default Web browser and makes you download the appropriate file, then seek 
 it out on your hard drive to install it manually. Less experienced home users deserve a more seamless 
 installation in which the game engine does most of the work.   

  All of this speaks to the basic laziness in the design of the third edition of Who Wants to Be 
 a Millionaire. The game engine always struggled to make the gameplay experience more interesting 
 than a multiple-choice questionnaire, which is all the game is in the end. Zooming in on the winner's 
 circle and including the melodramatic soundtrack from the show were welcome decorations the first 
 time out. But it's surprising that the designers have made no effort across these two sequels to 
 break from the now familiar and tedious gameplay in the slightest. After all, they have how many 
 episodes of the TV show's sound and video tracks to play with? Why not add in video clips of audience 
 reactions to players winning or losing in order to enhance the TV-like experience? The only reward 
 for climbing the money ladder is the same visual of a check made out to you. Surely buyers of this 
 game are fans of the show; wouldn't they love a video archive of actual million-dollar winners? 
           The poll-the-audience lifeline delivers actual results from a sample audience.    

  Two weaknesses of the series remain unfixed: a worthless fastest finger routine and an absent 
 online component. In this version, the fastest finger mode is a vain attempt to re-create the elimination 
 round that qualifies a player for climbing the question ladder in the actual show. Using different 
 parts of the same keyboard, two players compete to be the first to put a set of occurrences in 
 chronological order. With only two people, the exercise seems gratuitous. It also misses the opportunity 
 to enrich the game with a new multiplayer mode that could allow head-to-head competition over a 
 given set of 15 questions. Likewise, the designers continue to ignore the very good live Millionaire 
 game hosted at the Disney-ABC Web site, where hundreds of thousands of users compete against the 
 on-air contestants in real time during the telecast. This online version is actually more fun and 
 more intense than the CD-ROM game, but Buena Vista misses an opportunity to improve the CD-ROM 
 version by integrating with this wildly popular online version.   

  Even Regis seems tired this time around. While earlier editions had the freshness of his unlikely 
 celebrity, the host's interjections are now less frequent and less entertaining. Phrases like, 
 "That's the answer you're sticking with, eh?" and "Gonna go with the majority?" feel as if they're 
 served up in shorter cycles now, suggesting that Regis spent precious little time recording new 
 voice-overs for this one. Hard as it is to believe, the deep library of Regis' doggedly bland comments 
 may have been one of the strengths of the first edition. It kept us playing.   

  Nevertheless, there is no denying that Millionaire will keep trivia fans' interest -- at least for 
 a while. After all, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire remains a decent pick-up trivia game. You can 
 complete a round of gameplay during a 10-minute coffee break. But at this point in the series, 
 the execution and the host are so familiar that the only appeal left is the trivia challenge itself, 
 which is unfortunate. The designers of such games should be spending more, not less, creative energy 
 on successive installments.
