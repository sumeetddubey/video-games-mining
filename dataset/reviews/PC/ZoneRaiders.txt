:::Review:::
Overall, Zone Raiders is an entertaining game that is fun to play for short periods of time, but 
 don't expect this one to be permanently lodged in your CD-ROM drive. 

 Are you tired of the same old racing games where you drive around in a circle 500 times? Do you 
 want to blow the hell out of the other cars on the track? Then power up your plasma gun and jump 
 into Zone Raiders for a little excitement. Although this title is at its heart a driving simulation, 
 you won't get bogged down with gear ratios and wind drag. All you have to know is how to drive 
 fast and hit hard.  

 In Zone Raiders, you're a scavenger whose ultimate goal is to reach the FreeZone. You can acquire 
 goodies such as new weapons, shield regenerators, and jet packs as you speed around 15 different 
 tracks.   

 The graphics in Zone Raiders are fluid and pleasant, but a great deal more detail could have been 
 added to the tracks and cars. The music is typical, techno-inspired fare which pumps you up to 
 blast away other vehicles.  

 Zone Raiders' best overall feature is its gameplay. Even though your hovercar requires several buttons 
 to control, you can customize the keys to suit your specific style of play. Before long you'll 
 be zipping down the highway, and even off of it, as you search for new gadgets to add to your car. 
   

 Of Zone Raiders' few flaws, its monotony and flat graphics are the most problematic. Although the 
 tracks look different, all you do is speed around and blow up vehicle after vehicle. Avid arcade 
 fans may not tire of this, but others may begin to find it tedious. Also, because the graphics 
 are a bit flat, it's often hard to tell if you are approaching a curve at 160 mph or if that speck 
 in front of you that keeps moving is indeed The Guardian.  

 Overall, Zone Raiders is an entertaining game that is fun to play for short periods of time, but 
 don't expect this one to be permanently lodged in your CD-ROM drive. However, considering the cost 
 of many of the games out now, Zone Raiders' price and quality make it a pretty good deal.
