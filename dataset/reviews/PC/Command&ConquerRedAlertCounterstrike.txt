:::Review:::
Although this game doesn't include everything it should, there are some tasty extras. 

 Just about every product Westwood has produced in the last few years has been outstanding - except 
 for its mission discs. Command &amp; Conquer's Covert Operations add-on was the first guilty party, 
 and now Red Alert's Counterstrike has become the second Westwood add-on mission disc to fall seriously 
 short of expectations.   

 Counterstrike is a great purchase for players looking to squeeze playtime out of Red Alert, at least 
 from a single-player standpoint. Eight new Allied and Soviet scenarios are offered for a total 
 of 16 new missions (in addition to the hidden Giant Ant missions) . Like Covert Operations (and 
 unlike Red Alert) , the missions are selectable from a menu, saving Westwood the effort of creating 
 new FMV to give Counterstrike a vivid story - instead, you get stale mission briefing text. These 
 new missions are much more challenging than those in the original game, largely because of the 
 addition of new units that increase the stakes, units such as Nuclear Subs, Wonder Dogs, Tesla 
 Tanks, and Super Soldiers. Unfortunately, Westwood opted to use old Red Alert unit graphics, instead 
 of original art, to depict these new combatants. For example, the new Tesla Tanks look like Mobile 
 Gap Generators that discharge bolts of lightning and Nuclear Subs appear as ordinary subs whose 
 missiles pack a nuclear detonation upon impact.   

 Counterstrike fails to deliver anything substantial to online players, except for 100 new multiplayer 
 maps, which isn't as great a value as it sounds, since the original game came with a map editor 
 and maps are readily available on the Net. The hordes of Red Alert fans who have been drooling 
 over the thought of having new units to play with in multiplayer combat have been dealt a cruel 
 blow - the new units are only available in the one-player missions. This lack of multiplayer improvements 
 appears to be a ridiculous oversight on Westwood's behalf - especially considering Red Alert's 
 large and devoted online following.   

 Although this game doesn't include everything it should, there are some tasty extras. Counterstrike 
 includes all sorts of pleasant Easter eggs, such as several Windows 95 Red Alert themes, the ability 
 to play the hidden Giant Ant missions, and several great techno tunes that can be played from any 
 CD player. But however amusing these tidbits are, most fans would gladly trade all of them for 
 the multiplayer support this game should have had.   

 If you simply want some new, harder missions to play through, then Counterstrike is a great bargain. 
 If, however, you were hoping for a companion disc that would make Red Alert a more robust multiplayer 
 game, you will be sorely disappointed.

Review:  When I realised there are giant ants in a military RTS, I knew the developers were desperate. They 
 knew they couldn't make a perfect game any better and they were exasperated! Then, in the midst 
 of collapsing in their board meeting, one guy had a brilliant idea! Why don't we let them fight 
 mutated giant fire-breathing ants? he said, and Red Alert Counterstrike was born.
  
  What the hell?! Accompanying the weird idea are some mis-matched new units like tesla tanks and 
 chrono tanks and more, well... a little interesting, but not satisfying enough. Some new music 
 tracks are available (as playable CD!) , but not as classic as the original ones. The missions are 
 not coherent, so it results in a lack of motivation for playing. Even being a hardcore fan of the 
 C&amp; C series, I still find it a chore to finish the campaign.

Review:  I played this expansion in The First Decade and I think its a little bit underrated. Westwood wasn't 
 treated it very good, but still RA is a great game and new missions are even more interesting than 
 RA original campaigns. Mission pack consists of 16 mission + 5 hidden. Mission design is quite 
 unique and new in comparison with previous C&amp; C games, difficulty is varying from super easy, 
 like the one with russian agent and his cyberdog, both have crazy hp and move through map destroying 
 everything (look more like arcade than RTS) to unspeakably hard, like mission where enemy's planes 
 send nuclear strike every minute. Another notable mission is where Tanya have to survive in complete 
 chaos of war. Enemy is everywhere. This one is probably hardest, if Tanya stops, mission is failed. 
 Overall missions use a lot of scripts to make gameplay more fun.
  
  Another notable plus is hidden ants campaign which is similar to Funpark missions from C&amp; C 
 CO, I would say nothing about it - you just have to experience it, it's great.
  
  Actually there are no new units in game, at least on skirmish. In single player most interesting 
 new unit is Tesla-tank. It's very powerful and probably would kill balance in multiplayer, so it's 
 available only in single.
  Other new units is modifications of original units, like Mig and submarine that shoots with nuclear 
 bombs, usually player are not allowed to build it.
  
  The biggest flaw of this expansion (and same is in Aftermath) is missing ingame FMV's that were 
 included in PS version called RA - Retaliation. This is really sad. I can recommend this expansion 
 for those who really like RA1 and want some more action. Since I think RA1 is best C&amp; C, I really 
 liked those expansions

Review:  When i finished the Red Alert game Westwood came out with this expansion. Although it is the only 
 expansion i ever bought in my life i never regretted it. The expansion has some new missions which 
 are fun enough, but there are no new videos or a story that accompanies them. There are no new 
 animated movies either. There are however secret bonus missions where ou have to defeat giant ants! 
 This was great! It reminded me of old b-movies and also a Amiga-game called It came from the desert 
 an adventure game where you also have to stop an invasion from giant ants. On top of that the discs 
 feaureres a Red Alert theme-pack with icons, sounds etc. I still use some sounds from that library 
 on my computer today. I'm used to hearing the sonar sound of a submarine when i open a menu and 
 the h2-bomb when i empty the computer's thrashcan. For these reasons i never regretted buying this 
 expansion. There are no other reasons to get this expansion, or any expansion for that matter, 
 because expansions are mostly crap.
