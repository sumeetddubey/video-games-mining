You'll start seeing repeats of the same questions far too soon. 

  Quiz shows have been around almost as long as television itself, but they've never enjoyed the 
 kind of wild success they're experiencing right now. In addition to mainstream shows such as  Who 
 Wants To Be A Millionaire  and  The Weakest Link , the quiz show phenomenon has spread into every 
 market imaginable: music, history, shopping, sports, and so on. But Rules of the Game, the new 
 sports-quiz game from Infogrames, wasn't cranked out to take advantage of quiz show mania. It actually 
 began life as a board game created by Robert Poole and quickly became one of the most popular sports 
 board games on the market -- and on first impression, this PC adaptation looks to improve upon every 
 aspect of the original. After all, it delivers nearly three times as many questions as its board 
 game forerunner, and its GameSpy support theoretically means you can scrounge up some human opponents 
 faster than an NFL ref can toss a flag for an offsides penalty. But after you put it through its 
 paces, you'll soon realize that the person-to-person interaction in playing a board game is a lot 
 more important to the experience than you might have expected.           There are seven different 
 sports trivia categories available.    

  Rather than duplicating its board game cousin, Rules of the Game is presented as a TV show in which 
 up to four contestants can compete in each round. The animated MC Joe Banks hosts the affair, who's 
 supposed to liven things up with a steady stream of banter. Unfortunately, Banks' babbling not 
 only fails to provide much amusement, but it also slows down the pace of the action to a crawl. 
 After just one or two games, you'll likely start searching for the option to shut him up. Even 
 if you do, you'll still see him sitting at his desk, making goofy expressions.   

  Each game consists of three rounds with increasing point values for correct answers -- but as the 
 point values go up, the time allotted to submit an answer goes down. Actually, the clock can be 
 disabled, but that results in a considerably less challenging experience. Questions are selected 
 from one of seven categories: baseball, college basketball, pro basketball, college football, pro 
 football, pro golf, and miscellaneous. Miscellaneous features some real zingers such as darts, 
 curling, horseshoes, power lifting, and table tennis, as well as more popular sports such as soccer, 
 hockey, and tennis. Multiplayer games feature an additional category called challenge; challenge 
 questions can be answered, passed to another player, or redeemed for a "safe" card that you can 
 use to avoid another challenge. Unlike the case with standard questions, an incorrect answer to 
 a challenge deducts the point value from your total.   

  Each correct answer gives you a shot at picking up extra points by answering a bonus question, 
 and to add a little spice, these questions don't necessarily involve rules. You might get a trivia 
 question, be asked to name the location of a sports facility or determine the attribution for a 
 particular quotation, and so forth. The difficulty of these range from dreadfully simple (pick 
 the borough in which Yankees Stadium is located) to insanely obscure (select the bowler who, when 
 asked why he drove to tourneys, asked the questioner if he'd ever tried to fly with 20 bowling 
 balls) .   

  That's about it as far as the single-player game is concerned, except for one thing: You'll start 
 seeing repeats of the same questions far too soon. The designers probably didn't want someone to 
 play enough single-player games to know all the answers before going online to compete against 
 someone else -- but that doesn't change the fact that you can start seeing repeats after a mere two 
 or three outings.           The MC Joe Banks is supposed to liven up the game, but gets tiresome 
 fast.    

  Multiplayer support is handled via hot-seat play at one computer or through the GameSpy Arcade 
 client, which is included with the game. The good news is that GameSpy Arcade is quick and easy 
 to use, and that latency isn't much of an issue in a game like this; the bad news is that it might 
 take a while before anyone shows up in the GameSpy lobby looking to play Rules of the Game. We 
 checked the game lobby at various times over the course of a week, but there was nary a sports 
 fan to be found.   

  Rules of the Game would make for a nice diversion at a pregame party, and it'd probably be a kick 
 if you could find someone to compete against online. But because it has such a thin single-player 
 component, your best bet is to check GameSpy from time to time and see if anyone's playing the 
 game -- and not to buy it until someone else does.
