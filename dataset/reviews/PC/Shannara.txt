:::Review:::
Shannara is an excellent pick for novice users or fans of Mr. Brooks, but experienced players should 
 probably keep looking. 

 Having been a fan of Terry Brooks novels since 1979, I was thrilled to find out that someone had 
 used the Shannara universe as the setting for a computer adventure game. Combining 
 crisp, realistic graphics and a sparse but powerful soundtrack, Legend has created an atmosphere-filled 
 adventure that is surprisingly evocative considering its medium. Into this already impressive framework 
 is set a storyline strong enough to provoke genuine emotional response to the various characters 
 in the game.  

 Your exploration of Shannara is simplified by the game's basic interface. All major game functions 
 can be handled with a quick click or two on the mouse button. Although this system is extremely 
 effective for movement and inventory, it has the unfortunate drawback of rendering combat somewhat 
 lifeless. Your only real impact on these conflicts is through the general commandslike attack, 
 retreat, and defendwhich never really deliver the feeling of control that you need in a combat 
 system. Fortunately, by staying out of trouble, a careful player can keep minimize the effects 
 of these frustrating flaws on gameplay.   

 The real soul of Shannara lies in its puzzles. As you might expect, you spend most of your time 
 in this game finding various items and trying to figure out where to use them. Even so, the puzzles 
 are fresh and well-implementedthough a bit basic for adventure game veterans.  

 Even though the game's linear structure ensures that you'll spend a little while in Frustrationland, 
 the excellent plot, moving character development, and top-notch visuals make for some pretty entertaining 
 gaming. Shannara is an excellent pick for novice users or fans of Mr. Brooks, but experienced players 
 should probably keep looking.

Review:  The Good:
  For its time, a beautiful looking game similar to some of the King's Quest games. It was also one 
 of the first games to feature extended voice acting. The voices themselves were solid, in particular 
 the druid Allanon's deep timbred baritone and the soundtrack substituted quality for quantity. 
 The storyline is a solid one with a best selling author collaborating, and the characters are real 
 enough to provoke true emotion out of the players. The puzzles are entertaining.
  
  The Bad:
  Combat is unimpressive, never making you feel like you have much control. Gameplay 
 is a little simple. The game is short, clocking in under 10 hours from start to finish for most 
 folks familiar with the genre. It is also quite easy.
  
  Shannara is an adventure game based on the books that share the same title by best selling author 
 Terry Brooks.
  
  Specifically, this game adds an extra chapter inbetween the two books The Sword of Shannara and 
 The Elfstones of Shannara and a new character, Jak Ohmsford, that once again gets used as the druid 
 Allanon's tool to save the four lands from the threat of The Warlock Lord, who was believed to 
 be destroyed once and for all at the end of The Sword of Shannara. But this game needed a bad guy 
 worthy of smiting so here he is again.
  
  While knowledge of the backstory from the book is not explicitly required in order to enjoy this 
 game, it certainly helps, so your helpful reviewer is going to provide some. You play the role 
 of young Jak Ohmsford, first approached by the druid Allanon and dragged into the adventure to 
 help out. For those who are unfamiliar with the book, many generations ago, when The Warlock Lord 
 first became a threat to The Four Lands, Allanon's father, the druid Breman, created The Sword 
 of Shannara to battle him. In the book by the same name, Allanon explains that his father erred 
 by giving the Sword to the elf king Jerle Shannara and not to the people of The Four Lands. This 
 created a situation wherein only those with Shannara blood can wield the sword.
  
  The Ohmsford family qualifies. And, in fact, are the only ones that do. Many human generations 
 ago, young Jak's family intermarried with an obscure offshoot of the Shannara clan, which has since 
 been wiped out. This leaves Jak's family as the only one who can wield the needed weapon.
  
  You'll be joined on your quest by a very strong cast of memorable characters. Great care is 
 put in to make each addition to your party feel like a real person, and indeed is one of the strongest 
 parts of the game. Part of the way the game draws you into it is with the soundtrack. It is sparse, 
 and could use some more breadth, but what there is of it is well suited to the mood of each location 
 it plays in. Not once does the player scratch their head and wonder why a particular piece of music 
 was chosen for a specific situation. It all fits in nicely and blends into the background as a 
 good soundtrack should.
  
  Filling out the rest of the audio is some fine voice acting, which adds to and improves on the 
 already top notch character development. Your companions are first presented by good looking designs 
 and well-written dialogue, but the voices presenting the dialogue are what really bring those characters 
 to life and give them greater impact. One particular sequence about two-thirds through the game 
 drives home their emotional weight on the player like no other.
  
  As you journey through the beautiful lands on your meandering quest to both find the sword, and 
 the companions that will help and protect you, you'll be entertained by a solid, but short offering 
 that is nevertheless easily recommendable to anyone looking for a nice, old-school, overlooked 
 title.
