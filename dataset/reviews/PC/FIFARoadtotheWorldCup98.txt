:::Review:::
I think we've all been expecting a little something special from FIFA 98. Happily, mes cheries, 
 this tour de force does not disappoint. 

 We're all familiar with the EA formula by now: a stunning opening credits sequence (which in this 
 game reaches no less than music video level) ; an unbelievable variety of fully licensed international, 
 professional, and club teams; beautifully rendered stadiums complete with roaring, chanting crowds; 
 and John Motson's dry, humorous commentary. But with the official license to World Cup Paris 98 
 on this year's resume (as EA makes abundantly clear with the numerous references to "the beautiful 
 city of Paris") , I think we've all been expecting a little something special from FIFA 98. Happily, 
 mes cheries, this tour de force does not disappoint.   

 As beautiful as a walk along the Seine, the first things that hit you in FIFA 98 are the expansive 
 stadiums, ever-changing skies, and perfectly rendered 3D characters. Complete with facial features 
 and hairdos, your players are able to perform more feats of aerial derring-do (or is that Depar-dieu?) 
 than the legendary Cirque du Soleil performers. Bicycle kicks, slide tackles, diving headers... 
 all of these are actually possible in the game, and advanced moves such as jumping over a slide 
 tackle or flipping the ball over your opponents' heads can be mastered with a slight bit of practice. 

 While EA is famous for its wealth of options, FIFA 98 offers more options than there are types of 
 Brie at the lovely cheese shops along the historic Champs Elysees. There are hundreds of teams, 
 three difficulty levels, and five different play options, including friendly, league, penalty shots, 
 and the road to the World Cup. Most impressive, though, are the actual team management options 
 in the game, allowing you to choose from multiple formations, player positions, and strategies. 
 More amazingly, you can also adjust each individual player's attack bias and aggression level, 
 choose who takes free and corner kicks, and create or purchase new players to add to your club. 

 All of this is good, but what sticks out in FIFA 98 like a baguette from a shopping bag is the gameplay. 
 Fast, challenging (at least for a while) , and as smooth as a neatly rolled Galoise, one game immediately 
 erases all memory of what must now be seen as the transitional FIFA '97. While this fast pace may 
 be at the expense of true realism, it is certainly more entertaining to play; slide tacklers get 
 back to their feet in time to rejoin the action, shots occasionally find the corner of the net, 
 and it is actually possible to win a fifty-fifty ball from a computer opponent. Additionally, the 
 computer AI is much improved, allowing you to play the ball into open space and let your teammate 
 run on to it, creating a fast-break opportunity. This does work against you when you are trying 
 to play the ball back to the goalie (and you end up rolling it into open space in front of the 
 net) , but, for the most part, it creates a faster, more exciting style of play than any soccer 
 game ever made.   

 Smooth, entertaining, and relatively high-scoring, FIFA 98 may eventually prove a little easy for 
 hard-core footballers, but the multiplayer options (and EA's matchmaking site) will let you find 
 one another like long-lost lovers at the Eiffel Tower. They say Paris is the city of love, and 
 you'll most certainly love this game.

Review:  This was the game that really kicked it off for the FIFA franchise, and soccer sims in general. 
 No other game had taken it to this level. First of all every nation that took part in world cup 
 qualifying had all their current players, hell you barely get that in the world cup versions of 
 the game now a days.
  
  On top of that you had the standard leagues with all the stars (There were a couple of notable 
 exceptions, Ronaldo, I'm pretty sure was missing) .
  
  Of course there were some flaws the game was a little fast and too easy for hardcore soccer sim 
 players. The AI had some issues and keepers weren't particularly smart or athletic. Also the player 
 transfer system was average, you had enough money you brought him. 
  
  That being said in this game the flaws were easy to overcome. The game was fast paced and high 
 scoring, (we're playing a game we don't want every second game to be 0-0) . The menus were extremely 
 slick and easy to navigate.
  
  This game may not be deep as it is nowadays but it still holds its own.
  
  A damn fine soccer 
 sim.

Review:  While the rest of football simulators of the time where good enough to be played this one was the 
 best.
  The past version from 97 was like the first step to consolidate the next tittle, and, unconsciously, 
 the next generation of football simulators.
  Among the interesting things about this game we must emphasize the importance of acquiring the 
 licenses from all the countries, thing that gave the opportunity to won a World cup with Swaziland 
 or Vanuatu.
  However, there were some thing quite annoying, like the AI of the opponent, making some weird strategies 
 or a quite useless goalkeeper with a high tendency to place the ball inside of his net.
  The game bring you the opportunity to play the world cup and a considerable number of leagues quite 
 interesting and exotic, like the Malaysian one.
  And the editor of the game was quite good for the year with a good variety of options to modify 
 both players and teams.
  Conclusion: One of the best games from 1997 (8) and the best soccer simulator of that year.
