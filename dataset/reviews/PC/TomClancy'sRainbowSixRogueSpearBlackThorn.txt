:::Review:::
It's a solid but unremarkable addition to the aging tactical shooter. 

 As Rogue Spear expansion packs go, Black Thorn isn't quite as good as last year's Urban Operations. 
 It offers neither as many new features nor as many maps. On the other hand -- and ignoring for a 
 second the clear measuring implications of GameSpot's ten-point rating system -- it's immeasurably 
 better than last year's other Rogue Spear expansion pack/civil service test simulator, the utterly 
 misguided Covert Operations. If you've been waiting for that one extra element to finally draw 
 you in to the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear experience, Black Thorn isn't it. It's a solid 
 but unremarkable addition to the aging tactical shooter.  

          The new levels in Black Thorn are good enough, but nothing special.     

  Like Covert 
 Operations, Black Thorn is a stand-alone product priced as an expansion. It can be played either 
 by itself or as an Urban Operations mod. The best feature of Urban Operations, its custom mission 
 generator, has been included in Black Thorn. Though it offers no new game types, the six standards -- assault, 
 lone wolf, terrorist hunt, hostage rescue, recon, and the very tense and fun defend -- are all there. 
 And unlike in Urban Ops, each of the 15 maps in Black Thorn supports all six gameplay modes.  

 
  Unless you were paying a lot of attention to the manual and the opening movie, the previous installments 
 of Rogue Spear all shared the same story: something about you rescuing hostages from various exotic 
 locations such as, say, Belize. Black Thorn continues the tradition of having an irrelevant plot 
 that's buried deep in the mission-briefing subscreens. The story is completely optional, and you 
 can successfully navigate the single-player campaign without having any real idea what exactly 
 is motivating your squad at any given moment.  

  Ten missions were originally planned for Black Thorn, but one that took place on a hijacked jet 
 was cut at the last minute in deference to the September 11 attacks. At this point, Rogue Spear 
 levels have settled into a pleasant groove, and the nine included in Black Thorn are all professional 
 but generally unsurprising. Here's a list of the environments, in case one setting really strikes 
 your fancy: Japanese embassy, cruise ship, African village, jungle camp, hospital, train station, 
 bus station, convention center, hotel.  

  In the campaign mode, eight of the nine missions are pretty straightforward hostage rescues. The 
 African village mission breaks form a little and involves your having to reach an elevated position 
 to destroy a bus before it leaves the city. The entire campaign can be finished in a few hours, 
 especially if you don't try a lot of different plans. The custom mission generator, however, gives 
 the single-player game a lot of longevity.  

  Ten new real-world weapons have been added to the Rogue Spear arsenal, but, seriously, who cares? 
 That was a test: If you're mad about the "who cares" part and appreciate the differences between 
 the 9mm MP5 PDW SMG, the 9mm TMP SMG, and the 9mm M12 SMG, you should probably get your car keys 
 right now and just go buy Black Thorn. No other series models weapons as accurately as Rogue Spear, 
 but it's often at the cost of making the weapons virtually indistinguishable from one another to 
 anyone but hard-core enthusiasts.  

          Only hard-core Rogue Spear players should apply.     

  Six multiplayer-only maps are 
 packaged with Black Thorn: an Alaskan depot, a junkyard, a city street, a terrorist camp, an office 
 complex, and a Japanese pagoda. As usual, the single-player maps can be used in multiplayer as 
 well. A new multiplayer version of lone wolf has also been implemented. In it, one player is "it," 
 and the rest of the players must hunt him. The player who kills the lone wolf then takes his place. 
 Even though it's a gameplay mode that's been available for a while as a mod, it's a lot of fun, 
 and formalizing it means there'll be more people playing it online. Playing over Microsoft's Zone 
 is still an option, though the default server browser is now Ubi Soft's own free player-matching 
 service, Ubi. com. The new service is slick and appears to work well, and there are already a lot 
 of people playing Black Thorn, which means you shouldn't have a hard time finding a game.  

  There isn't much to say about the graphics. The flat look of the outdoor environments and the 
 very obvious, very square skyboxes tend to give the impression that you're rescuing hostages from 
 a museum diorama. Like the methods of team Rainbow Six itself, the graphics may not be pretty, 
 but they get the job done. In fact, the same can be said of Black Thorn in general. It's a well-made 
 but entirely prosaic map pack.

Review:  If you played one Tom Clancy game, you've played most the entire Rainbow Six Series. Aside from 
 a few more guns, a couple of new items, and less-stupid terrorists, this game doesn't add too much 
 of to the series. The only reason my hours on it are so high, was that it was the best game i had 
 at the time and also my first real online-multiplayer first shooter. It's a good solid game if 
 you've never played any of the others (and i recommend that you try at least one of the rainbow 
 six series) It leaves a lot to be improved. I'm not so sure how many people still play online, 
 but it's probably not enough to be worth the variety of skills they had when i used to play a long 
 time ago. The best things about this game? Coop Terrorist hunts, Clan TACTICAL battles (not just 
 a run and shoot game) as well as some of the missions (stupid hostages) . Lots of mods are available 
 for the game that improve the quality. In short, I enjoyed this game a long time ago, and i still 
 boot it up for a terrorist hunt or two, but there are plenty of other Tactical First Person shooters 
 available!
