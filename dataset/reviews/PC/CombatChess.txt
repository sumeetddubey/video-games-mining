:::Review:::
If you're a casual player who wants the option to see some action with your chess game, then it's 
 not a bad purchase. 

 The modern-day computer is a wonderful medium for games. It allows you to experience things you 
 could never experience in real life, such as fighting the battle of Waterloo or coaching the Bulls 
 through an entire season. The things you can experience in real life, such as card and family board 
 games, tend to feel flat on a computer. Other than providing solo play or easily finding players 
 over the Internet, there's really no benefit with a computer translation. Computers work best in 
 exploiting the imagination, something not needed in a game of hearts.  

 Throughout the years, companies have tried to entice people into playing traditional games on the 
 computer. One of the most common novelties was to add nudity to the game. Another novelty was video; 
 for example, when playing Battleship you can actually watch your vessel sink. In 1988 Interplay 
 tried to spice up chess with Battle Chess. In it the pieces were animated and actually fought for 
 a square. A decade later someone at Empire Interactive apparently thought the gaming public needed 
 an updated version. Thus Combat Chess was born.  

 Combat Chess, like it's predecessor, is simply a chess game with animated pieces. From a purely 
 aesthetic point of view it succeeds wonderfully. The animation for each piece is stunning. Movement 
 of each piece from the dragonlike pawns to the regal bishops is fluid and a joy to watch. Even 
 more impressive is the battle animation when the pieces clash. A great example is the black bishop 
 who sears the flesh off the enemy with a bolt of energy from an overhead cloud. The sound effects 
 that go along with the carnage are for the most part good. The Six Million Dollar Man effect when 
 the knights move could have been left out of the game though. OK, so it looks and sounds good. 
 How does it play?   

 The chess engine itself is adequate, giving a casual player a good opponent. There's also a slew 
 of options for tweaking the engine to suit your play style. These include setting the computer's 
 strength, how much processing power it will use, and how long it takes to contemplate the move. 
 Other amenities include several tutorials on playing chess, the ability to create your own tutorials, 
 setting up the board to re-create famous matches, and being able to load PGN files from other chess 
 programs. There are also the usual mutliplayer options including serial, modem, IPX, and TCP/IP. 
 The manual states that there is a lobby server at Empire's home page to find other players, but 
 at the current time it is not up. Sadly there is no PBEM option, which would have been welcomed. 

 Even though the engine is decent, Combat Chess suffers from a large problem: The battle animation 
 is simply a novelty, which wears thin rather quickly. This is especially bad when one considers 
 that it's the entire raison d'&amp; ecirc; tre for this game. The first few times you play Combat 
 Chess you'll find yourself enraptured with watching the pieces make their moves. By the fourth 
 time you'll realize you've seen about everything there is to see. You'll pay more attention to 
 the 2D board than the 3D animated board. Around the seventh time of playing you'll switch over 
 to the alternate chess set, which is just a standard Staunton set. When the tenth game rolls around 
 you'll realize that there are better chess games out there.  

 The definition of novelty is "something new and unusual." Once it stops being new, the enjoyment 
 of it quickly fades - which is exactly what happens with Combat Chess. If you're a casual player 
 who wants the option to see some action with your chess game, then it's not a bad purchase. Combat 
 Chess is actually also not bad for teaching children chess. The animated pieces would probably 
 hold their attention better than a normal chess set. The uncensored version is pretty violent, 
 but there is an option of turning the gore off - making it child-safe. If you're a seasoned computer 
 chess player, you probably already own a better game, and, unless you really want to see your opponent's 
 king impaled when put in checkmate, this game will be of little interest to you.

Review:  This game is great. If you like chess, but find it sort of boring. BUY THIS GAME.
  It has a nice animation set and good sound effects.
  
  GAMEPLAY- The gameplay is great. You 
 get to wack people over the head or just put a spell on them to get ride of them. An original gameplay.
 
  8 out of 10
  
  GRAPHICS- The graphics are ok. They are pc graphics so i wouln'd call them the best.
