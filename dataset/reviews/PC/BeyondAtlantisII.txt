:::Review:::
By abandoning almost all pretense of a coherent story, the designers have simply created a series 
 of beautiful, interesting environments filled with some good puzzles. 

  In the opening sequence of Beyond Atlantis II, a bald man digs into a cave wall, greedily snatches 
 a crystal skull, and proclaims "All power is mine!" You likely won't notice how silly the dialogue 
 is at first, because you'll be too distracted by the incredible animation. Beyond Atlantis II may 
 well be the best-looking adventure game ever. The characters are so realistic that it's a bit creepy 
 at first. The eyes look human and expressive, and the facial expressions are emotive and believable. 
 Even the lip-synching with the dialogue is nearly perfect. As in so many Cryo games before it, 
 Beyond Atlantis II is full of strange puzzles and metaphysical gobbledygook. But the constant barrage 
 of strangeness actually works in the game's favor.           The characters are strikingly detailed. 
    

  You play as a "young archeologist" (the game never names the protagonist) who is searching for 
 a lost Egyptian tomb thousands of miles from Egypt. When told that Egypt is far away from her target 
 location, she responds matter-of-factly: "Yeah, I noticed." At least Beyond Atlantis II makes it 
 clear early on that the story won't be an issue. She finds the tomb, and the discovery leads her 
 to ancient Egypt (or possibly future Egypt -- it's never clear) . From there it's on to Baghdad, some 
 prehistoric tundra, and a metaphysical world full of bubbles, spiny paths, and crystalline dolphins. 
 Her goal is to unlock the secret of the crystal skull. The secret will lead the world toward a 
 new age of enlightenment.   

  Beyond Atlantis II doesn't try too hard to make sense. Those who have played earlier entries in 
 the series will note this as a good thing. Both Atlantis and Beyond Atlantis spent a good deal 
 of energy bludgeoning you with a seemingly endlessly stream of profound-sounding dialogue that 
 meant nothing at all. The characters in Beyond Atlantis II will more often than not spout some 
 nonsense, but at the end, they'll just tell you what you need to do. Your tasks are still cloaked 
 in nonsense -- you'll need to find a feather to help free a Pharaoh's soul, fight cave paintings 
 to resurrect yourself, and jump into bubbles that lead to decrepit municipal hallways -- but at least 
 it's nonsense with clearly delineated goals.   

  Once the game gives up on making sense completely, it gets really interesting. When the nameless 
 heroine finds herself in Baghdad, for no apparent reason, she turns into Scheherazade and begins 
 telling the story of a young thief. During this segment alone, you'll visit a wizard's enchanted 
 garden, get trapped in outer space, lead a unicorn through a maze, and race a metal gnome up a 
 staircase by playing a handheld video game about a monkey and some hippos.   

  Not all the puzzles are this inventive. Beyond Atlantis II features its fair share of generic puzzles, 
 and some may be a bit too obtuse. Others are just downright bad, with a dialogue tree puzzle near 
 the end being the worst of them. But many of the generic puzzles are good, and the balance of inventory 
 puzzles and traditional puzzles should ensure that fans of any type of adventure game will find 
 one or two stumpers that they really enjoy. Even the easier puzzles are enjoyable. In Egypt, you'll 
 be required to arrange a series of stone tablets to tell a story and then arrange another series 
 of stone tablets to illustrate the story. It doesn't take too much effort, but it's an interesting 
 twist on a standard theme.           The puzzles range from generic to downright bizarre.    

 
  Unfortunately, there aren't very many puzzles. Unless you get hopelessly stuck, it will likely 
 take only a few sessions to finish the game. Perhaps the lack of puzzles is an inevitable result 
 of just how much effort was exhausted on the visuals. Beyond Atlantis II looks beautiful. It isn't 
 just the characters -- the environments are gorgeous. The game uses the standard node system found 
 in many adventure games -- you move from one predetermined location to the next and then you look 
 around. The difference here is that you'll want to actually spend time looking around. Unlike other 
 adventure games in the Myst mold, the worlds in Beyond Atlantis II look alive. Birds fly around, 
 water moves, and people move about. The scenery itself is impressive, and it's enjoyable to stop 
 and just look at a mountain on the horizon or a nearby lake.   

  The attention to detail in the visuals may also explain the lack of attention to the audio. The 
 dialogue is mostly bad, the voice acting is mostly awkward, and the music is mostly indistinct 
 though occasionally grating.   

  Cryo may have finally found a means to make its standard formula work. By abandoning almost all 
 pretense of a coherent story, the designers have simply created a series of beautiful, interesting 
 environments filled with some good puzzles. And while the puzzles are still bizarre, at least you 
 have some guidance. Cryo's adventure games have always seemed like patchwork affairs with crude 
 seams. With Beyond Atlantis II, the simple fact that the seams are almost nonexistent makes it 
 easy to overlook the disjointed nature of the whole and just appreciate each strange part in turn.

Review:  All in all, this is a fairly decent adventure game, with exceptional graphics and a sooth game 
 play. I resorted to a walk through several times but it was mainly sheer impatience on my part 
 rather than extreme difficulty in the puzzles. Most are rather straight forward, although some 
 involve pixel hunting that can cause terminal squinting.
  
  The premise is not as bad as I've seen in other games and anyone who looks for great "plotlines" 
 in a game is usually disappointed. Suffice it to say, you visit several different worlds and need 
 to accomplish various tasks in each. My favorite was the icy Siberian type locale, which boasted 
 a few interesting and unusual "puzzles." 
  
  Characters range from the very boring and stilted heroine (with the absolute WORST voice acting 
 I've ever heard ... it was almost enough to make me want to mute the whole thing and just read 
 the subtitles) to a hilarious mummy who helps her out during the Egyptian phase of the game.
  
  Bottom line is that the game kept me entertained for a few hours (it is actually quite a short 
 game, although as I said, I cheated a few times to hurry things along) . But don't expect it to 
 win any 'game of the year' awards.
