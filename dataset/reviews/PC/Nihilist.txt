:::Review:::
By combining nonstop action, puerile humor, and an interesting storyline, Nihilist offers a new 
 twist on an old genre. 

 Nihilist (a person who believes traditional values and beliefs are unfounded and that existence 
 is senseless and useless) truly lives up to its name. As a galactic wanderer your only concern 
 is the location of the next cosmic rumble.  

 In Nihilist, battles take place in the Kraal (an enclosure for animals) , also aptly named because 
 it is generally filled with fierce and savage warriors from the stretches of the universe yourself 
 included. Although your main objective is to whup a little interstellar ass, throughout each battle 
 you can collect various weapons, boosters, and Kash Krystals to aid you in future conflicts. Kash 
 is especially important because, as you progress through each Kraal and eventually into other galaxies, 
 you have to pay to enter the next arena. If you don't have enough Kash, you must face wave after 
 wave of Vermin Clan fighters (an attack en masse of small, swift ships) to get it.   

 Although the graphics in Nihilist are not incredibly flashy, the game is transformed into a truly 
 visual experience once you don the included ChromoDepth glasses and blast away the other combatants 
 in full 3-D action. The Kraals are depicted as simple wire-frame sculptures, but the ships really 
 stand out against the surface as you speed around the arenas while wearing the ChromoDepth shades. 
 The sound effects in Nihilist are crisp, and a soundtrack which includes Dog Eat Dog, Pop Will 
 Eat Itself, and Sugar Ray promises to keep you rockin' while in the Kraal.   

 The game also has a few humorous extras... well, if you like fifth grade humor (and who doesn't?) . 
 For example, you face off against such combatants as surly Jed Buttface and Private Partz. If you 
 want to jettison your ship and hope that Gladys and the sisters will save you from the Kraal, simply 
 press the "premature ejaculation" button and flee in your coffin escape pod.   

 Although a bit repetitive, Nihilist breaks the monotony by providing 29 different combat arenas 
 and three different types of Kraals: Fluxes (spherical) , Mandalas (horizontal and flat) , and Mantras 
 (vertical and flat) . Also, as you progress through more Kraals and collect more Kash you can buy 
 new ships or upgrade the one you have with new weapons such as the Blinder, Cutter, and Nutter. 

 Nihilist is an entertaining game that offers a truly unique visual experience. By combining nonstop 
 action, puerile humor, and an interesting storyline, Nihilist offers a new twist on an old genre.
