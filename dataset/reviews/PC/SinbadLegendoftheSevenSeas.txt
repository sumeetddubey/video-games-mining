:::Review:::
Though the game features some competent gameplay mechanics and attractive graphics, the extremely 
 short campaign mimics the film's brief theatrical run a little too well. 

  Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas is a simple action game based on the children's movie of the same 
 title that was quietly released in the summer of 2003. Though the game features some competent 
 gameplay mechanics and attractive graphics, the extremely short campaign mimics the film's brief 
 theatrical run a little too well, as it's gone almost before it starts.  

          The Teen rating may have been a little harsh for this game.     

  The problems begin 
 before you even open the box. Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas is rated Teen by the ESRB, but clearly, 
 this is a game aimed at the same younger audiences that saw the PG-rated film. The very light and 
 cartoonish violence in the game left us wondering how Sinbad could have earned the same rating 
 as many explicit shooters, but no matter how you rationalize it, there's got to be something amiss 
 when a game's rating does not match its target audience.  

  Once you get started playing, you'll find that the developers have done a pretty good job with 
 Sinbad's graphics. Though the animation isn't always crisp, the vibrant colors and the artistic 
 settings and character models do resemble the film that the game is based on. The game's music 
 is appropriately epic, but it's disappointing that none of the stars (Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, 
 and Michelle Pfeiffer among them) who lent their voices to the film did any voice acting for the 
 game. In fact, the game is devoid of any kind of spoken dialogue whatsoever. The plot is advanced 
 instead by comic book-style panes and scrolling text in between missions. Like the Teen rating, 
 the abundance of written text seems somewhat strange for what's basically a children's game based 
 on an animated cartoon.  

  The game follows the same plot as the movie. You take the role of the legendary swashbuckler Sinbad, 
 who has been framed for the theft of the Book of Peace, which protects the city of Syracuse. The 
 actual culprit is the goddess of chaos, Eris, and it's up to you to seek her out and return the 
 magical Book of Peace to its proper place.  

  The gameplay mechanics are surprisingly decent for a movie-licensed game. You use the mouse to 
 move around by clicking on the area where you wish to move. Your actions are confined to just three 
 keyboard buttons, which are mapped to your slashing attack, thrust attack, and block maneuvers. 
 By using different combinations of these keys, however, you can unleash special attacks like dives, 
 uppercuts, spin attacks, and a coup de grce. Later on, you are able to unleash magical attacks 
 that eliminate every enemy on the screen at the expense of your supermeter, which very quickly 
 builds up as you defeat enemies through more conventional means. The game does a great job at teaching 
 you these moves, and although the mouse-driven movement can make aiming your attacks a little awkward 
 at times, for the most part, the controls feel pretty tight and intuitive.  

          Magical attacks, like the earthquake, can clear the screen of enemies.     

  Sinbad: 
 Legend of the Seven Seas' biggest problem as a game is that it's far too short. There are just 
 five different areas to explore, and each is broken up into a few missions. Unfortunately, it takes 
 just two hours or so to get through all of it. A child who is less experienced at games may take 
 a little longer, but the overabundance of health potions and the frequency with which you can clear 
 the screen of enemies through magical attacks makes Sinbad a rather easy game to get through. There 
 isn't much variety in the mission objectives either. Aside from a couple of shooting gallery missions 
 where you man the harpoon gun on Sinbad's ship, the Chimera, it's pretty much hack-and-slash all 
 the way through the game. Furthermore, the enemies don't differ all that much in how they attack 
 you.  

  Once you've beaten the campaign, you unlock a score attack mode where you can play through the 
 missions and receive a numerical rating based on how well you do, but aside from this, there isn't 
 much to the game. There are no multiplayer modes at all.  

  Overall, Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas amounts to a typical movie-licensed game. The presentation 
 is pretty good, and the gameplay is somewhat more interesting than you might expect. Its primary 
 failings are a ridiculously brief campaign (even for a value-priced title) and an ESRB rating that 
 will keep the game out of the reach of those who'd probably like it the most.

Review:  I reckon that sinbad is actually a good game. You get to kill lots of enemys and have lots of moves 
 as well as special moves. This game is quite long and is an ok game for your collection and would 
 recommend this to some people that like adventure games. It is not very hard to beat and it gives 
 you hours of fun. I'd give the gameplay a 7, the sound a 6 and the graphics a 6. Overall, it is 
 ok and pretty fun to play when defeating enemys and thats all. You should rent this first because 
 I don't think everyone would like it.

Review:  Sinbad: Legend of seven seas is a good game! But it is very short! Just 5 levels, we can complete 
 the game in just a sec!
  It's based on the movie. We play as Sinbad a sailor who is a fearless person! We have to find the 
 Book of peace! And defeat the goddess of chaos! 
  On the way, we defeat many enemies with our sword. The enemies are mainly ghosts, zombies, creatures 
 and all. There are 5 bosses. 
  We also get help from many skeletons and we can aslo, like, strenghten our sword to a lightnng 
 one an earthquake one and all like that! We a\can aslo take control of our boat and defeat many 
 ghosts on the way!
  Above all, Sinbad is just an average game. The movie lovers will find the game worth it!

Review:  Sinbad is a kind of game where you have to spent several hours of sword
  fighting. There are no new concept in this game. Just fight, collect health, armor, bonuses and require 
 objects. In each level you have to kill a good number of enemies and in the end a boss will appear 
 and you have to kill it in order to finish the game and this continue till the end. The game too 
 short and only need 10-12 hours to complete. Though graphics are good looking and sounds are so 
 so. And i think the buttons and combos are a bit complex to remember ,yet fightings look nice.
