:::Review:::
The Ward has some good puzzles and some interesting points in its story, but these moments only 
 punctuate a very bland game. 

  The Ward combines elements of other adventure games, such as LucasArts' The Dig and Inscape's Drowned 
 God, the movie Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and a hodgepodge of UFO-related conspiracy theories. 
 It begins slowly but in a promising manner, then shoots itself in the foot soon after by resorting 
 to nearly every pitfall of adventure game design. It's a disheartening turn of events because the 
 story, as it develops, deserves better than to be upstaged by a bunch of slider puzzles.       
     This slider puzzle is bland like most of The Ward    

 At the beginning of The Ward, a series of strange events has left two members of a three-man moon 
 mission dead. The survivor, David Walker, awakes in a strange laboratory, with a security necklace 
 around his neck and the corpses of humans and aliens surrounding him. As he wanders the halls, 
 he realizes that this is not the result of a battle between the two species, but of a rebellion 
 that is still raging within the base. He meets some aliens, the ubiquitous grays, and learns that 
 he is the Ward, a legendary hero.   

  He is sent to a human colony, and things pick up again after the game stumbles around the hackneyed 
 "legendary hero" plot point. At the colony, Walker learns that abducted humans are actually kept 
 by the aliens, and those humans who seem to return are actually drones implanted with false memories. 
 Walker must find a means of saving the humans and helping the grays with their rebellion against 
 their wicked rulers, the reptoids.   

  That's a good deal of plot, and much of it is interesting. The game has three distinct sections. 
 The first takes place in the alien base, where you must do your best to make sense of the alien 
 technology and the battle that rages around you. There are some nice moments in the first segment, 
 but it also features some incredibly difficult puzzles. One, involving some colored plates that 
 must be placed in a particular order, is so difficult that the game will just tell you how to do 
 it if you're stuck for too long. It's not bad for adventure games to include hints, but it would 
 be better if the designers of The Ward had found some way to work them into the reality of the 
 game. A second puzzle -- requiring you to program a biological container to smuggle an artifact in 
 your own body -- is equally hard, and yet there's not a clue to be found in that case.   

  Once you reach the human colony, the difficulty eases up. Most of your time in the colony is spent 
 walking around, talking to the inhabitants. Actually, most of your time in the colony is spent 
 just walking around. The inhabitants move around a lot. So, you must seek out key people, then 
 get them to talk to you. Most will only talk to you in specific locations, so once you get their 
 attention you must walk again, this time to whatever predetermined locale they feel safe in. It 
 wouldn't be so bad if the colony didn't have so many rooms. Worse still, Walker lives up to his 
 name. There's no way to run, and so you must wait for his slow-as-molasses gait to carry him from 
 one side of the screen to the next.           The game's presentation isn't impressive    

 At the colony, you'll learn about the previously mentioned abductions, as well as some history about 
 the aliens, their technology, and, to a lesser degree, the story of the Ward. There doesn't seem 
 to be much of a story behind the Ward, other than that he's legendary. Even so, the rest of the 
 story in the game is generally intriguing, particularly the bit about the drones and the memory 
 replacement. Unfortunately, these ideas are presented as a series of brightly colored sentences 
 told to you matter-of-factly while you're standing around in bland rooms. As such, it's hard not 
 to imagine a better game, telling the same exact story from a different perspective. The one-dimensional 
 characters themselves don't add much to the ambiance of The Ward, as they have an emotional range 
 that seems to be stuck somewhere between sarcastic and hostile.   

  The colony isn't all dialogue. There are a few puzzles, some of which are good. Unfortunately, 
 the majority of them are slider puzzles. Apparently, the advanced technology of a race called the 
 masters (the precursors to the grays and reptoids) didn't include any means of securing cabinets. 
 There are several slider puzzles, and what's worse is that there's no way you can solve them without 
 a key -- a picture diagramming what the final outcome should look like. The keys can be less than 
 helpful, and they are often creative interpretations of the final picture. There's also a very 
 restrictive time limit on some of the puzzles, which makes them even more frustrating.   

  The Ward has some good ideas. It has some good puzzles and some interesting points in its story. 
 But these moments only punctuate a very bland game. There are no voice-overs and the graphics are 
 dated. If the story unfolded in a more exciting manner, these problems would be less obvious. But 
 as it is, The Ward is like sitting at a boring party, listening to charmless people drone on and 
 on about fantastic, faraway places.
