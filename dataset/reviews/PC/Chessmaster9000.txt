:::Review:::
If you're looking to pick up your first chess simulation, the decision is simple: no other product 
 delivers the ease of use and instructional value of Chessmaster 9000. 

 For years, the Chessmaster series has rolled along unchallenged as the chess simulation of choice 
 for a huge range of players, thanks to its combination of strong artificial intelligence, excellent 
 teaching tools, and crisp graphics. In fact, the Chessmaster series has become so dominant in the 
 mainstream chess game market that it's practically its own worst enemy. Will owners of the previous 
 games in the series see enough new features in the latest game to make a purchase worthwhile?  
          Chessmaster 9000 offers the same impressive number of options as its predecessor.    

 
  They might -- if they have the right operating system to run the game. Chessmaster 9000 supports 
 Windows 98, ME, and XP, but not Windows 95, 2000, or NT. Omitting Windows 95 support is somewhat 
 understandable. Leaving Windows 2000 owners in the lurch, on the other hand, seems a bit miserly. 
 That's not to say the game absolutely won't run under Windows 2000 -- apparently, several users have 
 reported that the game runs fine on their Win2K systems -- but the lack of official support for a 
 fairly widespread OS is somewhat disquieting.   

  Chessmaster's biggest strength has always been its suite of chess lessons, tutorials, and drills 
 aimed at novice and intermediate players. In fact, it's difficult to think of ways that aspect 
 of the program could even be improved. For Chessmaster 9000, the most notable addition is "The 
 Psychology of Competition," an eight-part course consisting of nearly 20 annotated games assembled 
 by international chess champion Josh Waitzkin. Though many of the tactical and positional aspects 
 explored in these games are dealt with elsewhere in the program, Waitzkin's engaging narration 
 is both exciting and educational.   

  It's sometimes difficult to keep track of the new drills introduced with each successive Chessmaster 
 upgrade, but the two new drills are both great learning tools. In "follow the game" you must listen 
 to (and read) a series of moves and then re-create the exact ending position (including which side 
 is next to move) , while "memorize the position" forces you to do just that -- with up to 24 pieces 
 on the board in the advanced drills. These are relatively simple, but they should dramatically 
 assist players preparing for competitive play. Rounding out the tutorial enhancements are an endgame 
 quiz authored by International Grandmaster Larry Evans (50 multiple-choice questions) and a "blunder 
 alert" that tips you off when you're about to make a foolish move (only available in unrated practice 
 games) .   

  So what else does Chessmaster 9000 have that would make it worth buying for those who already own 
 Chessmaster 8000? Some of Chessmaster 9000's additions seem rather trivial. For example, "true" 
 3D boards and pieces that can be rotated and zoomed in on have been added, but their value depends 
 entirely on how you enjoy playing chess on a PC. For many, a simple 2D board is easier to analyze 
 than an attractive 3D board that sometimes makes selecting the right piece a bit difficult. You 
 can now assign yourself a rating when you create a player profile (rather than earning one by playing 
 a set number of games against computer opponents) and then see it rise or fall with each qualifying 
 game. A quick start mode sends you immediately into a game against a random opponent in a five-minute 
 game using Fischer clocks, but why anyone would use it except for an occasional quick diversion 
 is unclear.   

  More important for dedicated players is the improved Chessmaster chess engine and the availability 
 of a downloadable endgame database generator. Though the game has been out for only a short while, 
 early reports from users who've pitted it against other commercially available chess programs indicate 
 that it's more than holding its own. But the most noteworthy test will come at the end of September 
 2002, when current US Chess Champion Larry Christiansen takes on Chessmaster 9000 in a four-game 
 match. Even if Christiansen wins, it's clear that the only chess players who won't be severely 
 challenged by Chessmaster 9000 are the ones who didn't need to improve their game in the first 
 place.   

  And the endgame database generator creates a database containing perfect knowledge of all possible 
 outcomes for all positions with very few pieces on the board. Ubi Soft, the publisher of the game, 
 says its proprietary database format, called FEG (final endgame generator) , is superior to more 
 commonly used formats already in existence -- though the inclusion of a proprietary format means 
 users won't be able to take advantage of other endgame databases already available online.     
       Chessmaster 9000 re-introduces online multiplayer to the series.    

 Though there are other minor improvements, the last big change that Chessmaster 9000 makes to the 
 series is actually a step backward: built-in multiplayer support via Chessmaster Live, which was 
 last seen in Chessmaster 5500. This may be a case of too little, too late. There are now dozens 
 (or perhaps hundreds) of ways to play chess for free online, and barring any future announcement 
 of online tournaments or ladders, it's unclear how active Chessmaster Live will become -- it was 
 certainly dead during the two weeks following the game's US release. But things should hopefully 
 pick up once the game ships in Europe, and if it becomes half as popular as the original Chessmaster 
 Live, there should be plenty of competition to square off against soon enough.   

  If you're looking to pick up your first chess simulation, the decision is simple -- no other product 
 delivers the ease of use and instructional value of Chessmaster 9000. And if you own Chessmaster 
 8000, you might want to get Chessmaster 9000 to take your game to the next level with the new game's 
 endgame database generator and seamless multiplayer interface.

Review:  Chessmaster 9000 at the moment is the best chess computer game you can buy. We have a lot of material 
 here for chess fun. We can start with a great opening database with several kind of opening. Also 
 there is a good learning sistem through a lot of examples and explanation you can learn how to 
 play chess from the beginning...
  There are different chess set you can choose in and different view of the game. You can save matches 
 to star again later and continue it. Also there is a good Elo system that can permit you to see 
 your level improvement along the matches you play.
  If you like chess dont leave it on the shelf !

Review:  Chessmaster 9000 has taught me alot about tactics in the game of chess and is just plain fun. The 
 series of chessmaster games just keeps getting better (as it should) with each new edition released. 
 From different boards to chess sets you can customize the game the way you like... you can customize 
 the different types of gameplay is just great!
  
  you can use it as an online tutor for when your playing chess with a friend or play online against 
 various players in the games own competition room. Chess is a game of tactics and strategy and 
 you can play aggressive or cautiously. The games ingame tutor is really helpfull and you will enjoy 
 this game for years to come.
