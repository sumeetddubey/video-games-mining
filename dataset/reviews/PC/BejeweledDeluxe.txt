:::Review:::
Bejeweled Deluxe is an incredible puzzle game. It's easy to pick up and hard to put down. 

  Aside from good ol' Solitaire, there are few games that you can say have as much universal appeal 
 as Bejeweled. The game relies on a simple concept of lining up colored gems into rows or columns 
 of three or more. It's an incredibly easy game to play, and offers enough challenge that even skilled 
 players can enjoy spending hours racking up high scores. However, with Bejeweled 2 now available, 
 there is little reason to go back to the original. Even so, this game stands to show just how simple 
 a game can be and still be a blast to play.

Review:  Bejeweled is an excellent Popcap game.. it isn't as enjoyable as say Chuzzle but it is great for 
 short bursts of time. It is also harder than 2 in that you have to think ahead and plan.. Sure 
 you can be mindless and just play, but in order to advance ahead of say level 5 or so.. you have 
 to start planning. Gameplay: What can I say.. its a tetris variation.. not much to it than that. 
 Of course this can be said about most Popcap games. from Chuzzle to Big Money
  
  Graphics: dated.. and not as pretty as Bejeweled 2 but you have to place the game in context. It 
 did well for its time and it is still a stellar game.
  
  Sound: The music score and the jewel sounds are pretty spot on.. Of course 2 has a more impressive 
 array of sounds and updated music score.. it doesn't get annoying like games I have played.
  
  Value: You can play it to have mindless fun.. you can play it to think.. hmm does bejeweled 
 have an ending? If not.. then value is through the roof ;)
  
  Tilt: I give this popcap title a nice solid 8.. it is a great Popcap game!
  
  The STEAM version 
 works well and is a nice quick install. :)

Review:  Bejeweled is one of those simple, yet addicting puzzle games that starts with a great idea, continues 
 with a bit of promotion, and then blows up into a massively hyped and quickly over rated game that 
 users quickly grow to expect, and nothing more. The PC version of Bejeweled is what started it 
 all, and anyone that takes the time to give this game a try will quickly see why it became so popular.
 
  
  Just in case you've never browsed the games on your cell phone or iPod, or hopped on the internet 
 within the past couple of years, Bejeweled is a colorful puzzle game that fills up the screen with 
 various gems, each with a unique shape and color. The player must swap these gems at 90 degree 
 angles, one at a time, in order to line up 3 or more of the same gem to score. This causes the 
 gems above the aligned gems to collapse further down the screen, giving the player a chance to 
 earn bonus points in the case of more gems aligning during the fall. Add a timed mode to keep players 
 on their toes and a simple, relaxing mode that does the same thing (minus the clock) , and you've 
 got Bejeweled.
  
  The gameplay on the PC version is all controlled entirely by the mouse. Players can either click 
 the two gems they wish to attempt swapping seperately, or drag the mouse from one to the other. 
 This results in a swap attempt which will either succeed or fail, and when the gems are finished, 
 the player repeats the process. There's not much to it, but the colors, music, and simply addictive 
 gameplay keep you going... for a little while, at least.
  
  Graphically, the game doesn't have much to offer, but it does a good job with what little content 
 there is. The gems are all extremely colorful and look great, complete with a few animations depending 
 on what happens during a move. A few special effects for clearing levels and achieving bonuses 
 are included, though nothing is really worth mentioning. The interface of the program is simple, 
 but it works. After all, simple is the entire premise of the game.
  
  Sound is simple enough, as well, with a couple of soft trance tunes to keep the player happy while 
 they're gem hunting. The gems make appropriate clink sounds when being swapped, with explosions 
 and a few other small effects occupying the various events. And, to top it all off, there's an 
 announcer to let you know when to start a level.
  
  Overall, Bejeweled is, and always has been, a highly addictive yet simple puzzle game. So much 
 so that it's appeared on nearly every multimedia device that one is expected to use by now. Unfortunately, 
 the game feels dated and over hyped anymore, even when players bring the slightly better sequel 
 into the equation. Recommendation - try out Bejeweled, but don't bother paying anything for it.

Review:  Puzzle games seem to be losing their place in the market. If a game wants to have some sort of 
 puzzle solving, it takes a backseat to some dort of adventure. So Bejeweled comming out was a great 
 breath of fresh air. It's simple, but addictive gameplay proves that puzzle games can succesfully 
 stand alone.
  
  Bejeweled Deluxe is essentially the same gameas the original version of Bejeweled. The only difference 
 I noticed was that this version doesn't take over the whole screen. 
  
  If you've never played bejeweld before, you've missed something. The gameplay is simple. You are 
 given a board of several different jewls, and you need to switch 2 to make a row of 3. If the jewls 
 you switched don't make a row, they will witch back. As you clear the gems, a bar at the bottom 
 fills up. Once it's full, you level up. The game ends when there are no more possible moves. It 
 may sound dull, but it really does get interesting.
  
  There is also a TimeTrial mode. This is more or less the same, but as you're playing, the bar that 
 you need to fill up is emptying is self. This will only end if you run out time. If you run out 
 of moves, you are given a new board. Making chain reactions really helps you in this version.
 
  
  The gameplay hold up very well, but it can get a bit voring after a while. A few more modes would 
 have been nice.
  
  As a puzzle game, you can't really expect too much from the graphics. But Bejeweled manages to 
 do a good joc. All the jewls look nice enough, and the backround changes colour for every level.
 
  
  The sound isn't amazing either. There are 2 music tracks, one for each mode. These both sound nice 
 enough. Other than that, there isn't really much to hear.
  
  Bejeweled Deluxe is a fun game, but there should have been a bit more to it. It's worth picking 
 up if you're even slightly interested in puzzle games.
