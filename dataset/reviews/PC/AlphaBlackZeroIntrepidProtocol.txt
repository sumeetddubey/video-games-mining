:::Review:::
It's a dimly lit, lackluster shooter that doesn't know when to stop. 

  Alpha Black Zero: Intrepid Protocol is a textbook example of why bigger does not always mean better. 
 This third-person action game from developer Khaeon aspires to be an epic shooter, but it muddles 
 that goal with terrible pacing. Instead of filling Alpha Black Zero with fun and exciting action, 
 Khaeon instead serves up a dimly lit, lackluster game that doesn't know when to stop.  

          Stealth plays a role in part of the game, because you want to evade detection when you 
 can to save ammunition. Otherwise, you have to shoot guys like this.     

  The game takes place in the near future. You play as Lt. Kyle Hardlaw, a young marine officer in 
 charge of an elite, five-man squad called Alpha Black Zero. Hardlaw is the kind of take-charge 
 officer who is not afraid to take the initiative. Of course, we know this from the prologue of 
 the game, which puts Hardlaw in front of a military tribunal explaining why he and his squad decided 
 to wipe out a facility full of civilians. The rest of the game then serves as a flashback, setting 
 up an interesting but convoluted story of rebels, renegades, and sophisticated artificial intelligence 
 systems.  

  From the opening moments of the first mission, you're introduced to all the game mechanics you'll 
 need to worry about in Alpha Black Zero. You and your squad start off on foot and must march from 
 one point on the map to another while wiping out any resistance that you stumble upon. While you 
 play as Hardlaw, you can issue orders to your squad, and they'll follow you around. You've got 
 to be careful where you go, though, because the squad AI isn't too bright. For example, you can 
 lose squad members when they occasionally try walking off of cliffs to catch up to you.  

  You can switch between squad members, which is a fairly useful feature, as you'll discover that 
 your highly trained, elite marines apparently can't even scavenge weapons and ammo from the bodies 
 of enemy dead. You'll have to switch to another team member when your ammo is running desperately 
 low, and the only way to replenish ammo is to raid an enemy supply cache, many of which are scattered 
 throughout a mission. The fact that you can use ammo from an enemy supply cache and not ammo from 
 a fallen enemy is just one of the many annoying contrivances in the game.  

  The enemy AI is fairly dull, and most of your battles will consist of encounters between you and 
 a bunch of bad guys sitting around waiting for you to stumble upon them. Their behavior is downright 
 laughable at times, because they'll scatter, run straight at you, or just stand still. Combat itself 
 feels clumsy, since the controls and animations just aren't smooth. Even worse is the fact that 
 Alpha Black Zero is one of the dimmest games we've seen in a long time; in fact, most of the game 
 feels like it takes place in perpetual twilight. Unfortunately, your marines don't even have night-vision 
 devices, though the technology does exist in the context of the game, because some weapon scopes 
 offer some kind of light amplification. However, the overwhelming darkness makes it difficult to 
 spot enemies, and it hangs over the game like a depressing pall.  

  All of the aforementioned problems wouldn't have been half as irritating if you didn't have to 
 suffer them for long. However, Alpha Black Zero drags on to the point of frustration. Case in point 
 is a tedious escort mission where, for some harebrained reason, your high-tech military squad has 
 to walk a small convoy of technicians through enemy territory (it's an age of interstellar space 
 travel, and apparently you can't shuttle the convoy by air) . So you battle through enemy territory 
 to get the convoy to its destination, only to learn that you have to go back to escort a  second 
  convoy through the same territory you just vacated. So you battle back to the starting point (yes, 
 all the bad guys reappear) to meet up with the second convoy. And, yes, the territory that you've 
 cleared out twice now is teeming once more with bad guys. So you deliver the second convoy only 
 to learn that you have to go back to repeat the process a  third  time. The game is full of levels 
 like this, and even if they were half the length, they'd still border on "dragging-on-for-too-long." 
 You almost dread getting a level with a mountain in it, because you just know that you're going 
 to have to wind your way around it several times to clear out every ridge and valley.  

  The multiplayer is only limited to cooperative gameplay, and you can play with up to four other 
 players. This has its obvious advantages, as you don't have to worry about shepherding your AI 
 squadmates, which allows you to focus your fire more effectively. However, the weak combat remains 
 pretty much the same.  

          Your elite troopers will follow you in line, but make sure you don't get too far in front 
 of them or else you'll be alone in a fight.     

  Alpha Black Zero uses Croteam's Serious engine, the same graphics engine that powers Serious Sam. 
 It's certainly capable of rendering huge levels that play seamlessly. However, Alpha Black Zero 
 is nowhere near as colorful as Serious Sam, because the game is mired in bland environments. The 
 alien worlds are practically barren, save for clumps of grass, and the few buildings are relatively 
 basic in design. Some of the atmospheric effects are nice, such as dust storms. And there  is  
 one outrageous sequence where huge, fiery chunks of metal fall from the sky. The game's indoor 
 levels are a bit better, since they tend to be better lit, though not by much, at times. While 
 there's some decent voice acting during the long cutscenes that are interspersed throughout the 
 game, the sound, for the most part, is otherwise forgettable. You can barely hear the dialogue 
 during the game; the toylike sound of weapons fire is pathetic; and, generally, the music consists 
 of a constant, low-frequency thrum that doesn't change pitch.  

  Khaeon certainly presents some interesting ideas with its game's universe, because the story is 
 jammed with all sorts of details that are waiting to be explored in future titles. However, the 
 developer needs to spend just as much attention on getting Alpha Black Zero: Intrepid Protocol's 
 gameplay mechanics right if it wants anyone to care about the game's story.
