:::Review:::
It's easy to see why Zuma is one of the best-selling casual games of all time. 

  Zuma Deluxe, which was designed by Bejeweled creator PopCap Games, may be one of the best action 
 puzzle games you can play on your PC. In Zuma, these masters of the "match three" genre have crafted 
 the perfect blend of strategy, action, and precision. Instead of the usual grid of blocks, you're 
 attacking advancing chains of colored balls, which snake all over the Mesoamerican-themed levels 
 toward a sacred gold head. You have to destroy the chains by shooting balls out of a rotating stone 
 frog, which is otherwise stationary. As you eliminate groups of three or more like-colored balls, 
 you can cause the chain to contract and set off chain reactions, producing bonuses and power-ups. 
 There are now many Zuma imitators, but none are as good as the original, which is definitely worth 
 $20.

Review:  The puzzle games genre is not so famous for its good storylines or its solid gameplay, but it is 
 obvious that Zuma is a game which breaks this law. In Zuma, the story is settled in the Maya kingdom, 
 where you uncover old Maya temples and reveal their secrets. There is a huge variety of levels, 
 where you hit a chain of balls before they reach you, from the mouth of a frog (no one knows why 
 this frog is there) . It starts to be very simple and too easy, but in the end it turns out to be 
 extremely challenging. Apart from the 13 levels of the Story mode, there are other modes to play 
 in, like practice or sun god. The graphics are very good while the game is still running great. 
 There is an amazing option which enables 3D balls, but it requires great PCs and may cause headache. 
 But Zuma is overally one of the best puzzle games ever and you should, at least, download its shareware 
 version.

Review:  Zuma is a great puzzle game. Following the street of previous successufull games like Puzzle Bubble 
 and similar this game design a simple gameplay featuring a nice graphics and good sounds. But the 
 aim of Zuma is its addictive mechanism. For the first match you will like it and you will think 
 "mm let me play one more time" and from that point you will be into this game until... ? So until 
 when? I think there is no limit to play with this because there are hundreds of level you can join 
 and I'm sure you will no stop anymore to play with it !!!!
  So i think that if you like puzzle game you must buy this game and you will enjoy it, but if you 
 are not a puzzle game's fun maybe playing this game you will change your mind!!
  Oh i leave you and advice.. remember that behind your pc screen playing Zuma you still have your 
 own life ;)

Review:  This game makes me extremely sick because of the graphics and sound effects. But the fine graphics 
 and beautiful sounds will cause my feelings to change rapidly. It is just the same arcade game 
 in MSN. Everything in this game makes me having tiredness but it is quite a beautiful game. You 
 just shoot at the beautiful balls and eliminate them before they fall into the very, extremely 
 ugly skull that opens its jaws. I hate the level completion theme where the stage cracks up. The 
 worst of all is the level is the level 14, 4 and 12. And almost the entire game was a puzzle game 
 that blew my head off and make me sad and if I play this game, I will think about it for a long 
 time But Mom still like this pretty much. Still the good news is she can beat it up to level 15 
 while I can only reach up to 3. The bad news is that Mom can't go any further that level 15 which 
 new colours appears while the look is like I am going to the beginning of the level again to the 
 end, except for the last one. But it is pretty cool. And I don't feel sick when I play it again 
 is the good news. I chose 10hrs or less because I play the trial version.

Review:  If you enjoy puzzle games this is a must for your collection.
  
  Zuma Deluxe's gameplay is very fluent and smooth. There are times of fast action and the game does 
 not lag or chop during these moments. The movement of your character is precise and accurate.
 
  
  The game stays fresh each time you play it. It isn't too difficult where it no longer becomes enjoyable. 
 The game has two modes and both are very fun.
  
  The sound is a little lacking. There are no voices but just noises. These is some text between 
 levels and I am not certain if it is purposely done but it is full of bad grammar. Overall this 
 is a fantastic game that will keep you playing for hours even when you are frustrated by not being 
 able to complete a level.

Review:  It's a very fantasy, awesome, masterpiece of all the casual game i've ever met.
  It's going harder and harder when your levels going up. Never axious about the difficult!!!!!!!!!! 
 It's just a game, never make it control your emotion, ever mind!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  It's the best way for killing time. Seeing the odd frog slitting the ball and eliting them. Try 
 to get so special items in quite a difficult way, enjoy it.
  It's so amazing funny. Nothing can pull you out of that kind of casual games' affection.
  When 
 you opening it again next time, relax your mind, take it easy, buddy!!!!!!!!!
  You might get some unexpected soccers or level. Enjoy the joy what it give to you!!!!!!!!!!!

Review:  Ok, I got the game played it for 30 minutes it was sucking me in... played it for another hour 
 it got better, after playing 4 hours I said "ok this game had enough, I have a life". I let it 
 chill out I play it the other day and I was shocked at how boaring it became all of a sudden. This 
 game is fun untill you finish it, once you are over you will never turn to it again, but then again 
 there are people out there who enjoy games like Tetris. According to me this game is not worth 
 purchasing get the demo play it get it over with! I have games which after 10 year I still play 
 and talk about instant classics, but this is just to repedative... it's boaring... and please they 
 made it for X-Box 360??? Wow there goes a game that needs that raw power. Oh and yeah I forgot 
 to talk about the sound/music... but there is not much of that is there? Expect the African-like 
 sounds in the back. Let me check my clock... yep it's 2006, graphics are better, gameplay = intense 
 action.

Review:  Zuma's simple concept makes for a great game. The game consists of shooting different color balls 
 out of a frogs mouth and trying to make combination of 3 before all the balls reach a certain area 
 and speed off the screen. It sounds weird, but its really fun. There isnt really anything to think 
 about, its mostly all speed. There are a few tricks that you will learn but it really is just speed. 
 There are several different levels but I wish there were more. You may end up playing the same 
 level or temple over trying to beat the game only the balls will be moving faster. 
  
  The graphics arent that spectacular but they do look good. You can tell they took their time developing 
 this game. I only wish they took more time on developing more levels. I think you play this for 
 the Xbox360 and Im not sure if their are more levels and better graphics there. 
  
  The Sound is annoying to some people, but I personally like it. The noise changes on different 
 types of shots and the music is jungle themed to go with the game.
  
  Another similar game that you may have played or want to check out is Luxor, but I believe Zuma 
 beats Luxor and is a lot more fun to play. If your interested in action puzzle games then this 
 is perfect for you.
  
  Since you can probably find this game for about $10 I recommend it. Its very addicting and it will 
 keep you playing it for a long time.

Review:  When I first played Zuma, I have to admit that I wasn't sure what to expcet with it. However, after 
 playing for about 10 to 15 minutes, I have to say that I found it pretty easy to play, all you 
 have to do is shoot the same color ball that is snaking along in the temple and make sure that 
 you get rid of them all. I also thought that it was pretty fun to try and get more points and better 
 shots through any gaps there might be, since that would help get the player through the level faster 
 that not shooting through the gaps. I definitely have to say that Zuma can get pretty addictive, 
 because of how you always try your hardest to beat the level you are on and then move on the next 
 and to try and solve the mysteries of the temples you go in. If you want to play a pretty fun game 
 that could be a challenge at times, I would highly recommend Zuma Deluxe.

Review:  I was first introduced to this game by my ex girlfriends mom, and the game did look challenging 
 and fun at first, but then I started playing the game and then I began to wonder how could anyone 
 be so addicted to this game? The game seems like it has no purpose whatsoever, you just try to 
 get 3 balls that are the same color together and try not to let the line of balls from getting 
 to the target. This is challenging and entertaining for a while, but after awhile there is really 
 no reason at all to play this game. Plus all of the Aztec gods that are in it goes against my religion, 
 but thats just me. If you do want to play this game, I suggest you play it for free online, instead 
 of buying it, its not worth the money.

Review:  When you see the beginning screen, you think it's going to be a really cheesy game. The music has 
 that Tiki feel to it, and the funny lookin' guy at the beginning doesn't help with the cheezy-ness. 
 In a way it is-come on, a frog spitting out coloured marbles?-but it gets you really involved. 
 It has it's own ways of giving you that "level up" that gamers so much desire and work for. Your 
 new goal at hand will be to become a Sun God. One of my favourite things in the game is the great 
 music and the strange phrases after "level ups."

Review:  When I tried Zuma I thought it would be a one time game experience, but I was wrong. Ive dedicated 
 hours to this game trying to solve its mysteries. I was suprised at the way this game captivated 
 my attention and I just had to keep trying to beat it. It is plain, simple, and suprisingly addictive. 
 Its an easy game to learn, but it gets harder as you get past each level. I never gave these kind 
 of games a second thought, but after Zuma I have to take a look to see if they might be worth my 
 time. Zuma will suprise you.

Review:  This game is challenging, fun, and simple. If you liked the original Bubble Bobble from back in 
 the day, then you'll like Zuma too. 
  
  The basic premise is shooting colored balls at other balls of the same color. However, it gets 
 more involved as you advance to higher levels, and there is a surprising amount of strategy involved 
 in truly mastering this deceivingly simplistic game. The multiple game modes add to the replay 
 value, and trust me, once you start it'll be a while before you stop.
  
  Zuma is well polished, the graphics are pretty, and the sound is great. It's a nice way to take 
 your mind off studying for a while with its refreshingly old-school gameplay
