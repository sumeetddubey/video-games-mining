:::Review:::
If you've ever played games like Arkanoid or Breakout, you know exactly what to expect from Bricks 
 of Egypt. 

  If you've spent any time playing video games at home or in an arcade, you'll probably be instantly 
 familiar with Bricks of Egypt. The goal of each level is to bounce a ball off an array of carefully 
 placed bricks until every last one is gone. Some bricks require multiple hits to destroy, while 
 others hide items that make the game easier or harder to play. All you really need in order to 
 enjoy this game is a tiny amount of hand-eye coordination and some extra time on your hands. The 
 game offers a number of different levels to play, and there's a decent amount of challenge involved 
 if you intend to clear each one. Give this game a shot if you're up for an old-school arcade challenge 
 with an Egyptian twist.
