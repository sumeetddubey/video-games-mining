 Newcomer Monster Games came up with an interesting concept for Viper Racing: Create the type of 
 ultrarealistic physics model found in games like Grand Prix Legends and use it to simulate racing 
 a high-dollar production car. It might not sound that groundbreaking, but with the exception of 
 1993's Car and Driver, it's probably the only game featuring a car like the Dodge Viper that isn't 
 95 percent arcade action and 5 percent realistic racing.  

 So if the box art of a Viper tearing down a speedway led you to believe you were getting a beefed-up 
 Need for Speed III or Test Drive 5, you're in for a big surprise. The Viper's the only authentic 
 car featured here; the other choices are generic rides called "sport," "sedan," and "exotic," along 
 with a plane tossed in for the hell of it. The graphics work for the cars doesn't come close to 
 what you find in Test Drive 5, and the scenery and terrain are merely average compared with the 
 gorgeous background visuals of Need for Speed III. And even when you play the game in arcade mode, 
 you'll discover the physics model is considerably more demanding than in pure arcade racers.  

 
 But it's a whole other story if you head into Viper Racing expecting a highly detailed, realistic 
 simulation of one of the world's most powerful and alluring automobiles. Though Viper Racing's 
 pleasures (perhaps "rewards" is a better word) aren't discovered quickly or cheaply, some patience 
 and practice will reveal a pulse-quickening game that feels so real at times that knuckles whiten 
 and teeth grind.  

 What makes Viper Racing so immersive is the physics model MGI created for the game. At first, it 
 might seem a little too realistic, as you find yourself constantly fishtailing out of control, 
 sliding off the track into a field, or even rocketing off a cliff. But when you realize what sort 
 of car you're driving - a 3400-pound beast with an 8.0-litre V10 capable of generating 450hp - 
 and remember that you can't sling it around like a Formula One Racer, you'll find yourself staying 
 on the track and gradually becoming more competitive with the aggressive computer-controlled cars. 
 And I do mean aggressive: These guys'll bump you off the road and into a river or valley with the 
 sort of precision you'd expect to see at a Joey Chitwood show.  

 At about the same time, you'll also begin to notice just how real the driving experience seems, 
 particularly if you've got a force feedback wheel. As you head through curves, you can feel when 
 you're about to lose traction completely and back off the gas to avoid disaster, and even heading 
 down a straightaway you can sense the contours of the road. The sound effects, from engine noise 
 to the squeal of skidding tires, are very good and add subtly yet effectively to the overall driving 
 ambience. Even if you turned the sound off, though, the banging, bumping, and powersliding action 
 is plenty good enough to make you think you're screaming down a stretch of highway at 165mph.  
 

 Quick races can be run against computer opponents, the clock, or your own best performance ("ghost 
 car") on any of the game's eight tracks and in any vehicle, and there are options to set the difficulty 
 level of opponents and the physics model for the cars. Every setup feature in the garage - you 
 can adjust camber, toe-in, bump, anti-roll bar, rebound, springs, ride height, brake bias, wheel 
 lock, spoiler size, and gear ratios - is accessible in a quick race, making it a good way to get 
 a general idea of how you should set up for each track once you start the career mode.  

 I say general idea because the career mode starts you out as an amateur, limiting your adjustments 
 to brake bias and wheel lock. What this means is that how quickly you advance to the next level 
 of competition depends on your driving, not your setup expertise. As you win races and start socking 
 away prize money, you'll be able to add performance-enhancing accessories to improve your exhaust, 
 shocks, axles, gearbox, tires - you name somewhere on the Viper you can slap a new part, and it's 
 probably in this game. Choices are limited to your class, and by the time you get to GT Class the 
 whole world of upgrades opens up to you.  

 But Viper Racing's low price and its lavish attention to modeling the Dodge Viper come at certain 
 costs. Although the computer drivers are good, there are only seven to race against on eight tracks, 
 and those tracks seem strangely barren and devoid of any signs of human life except for nondescript 
 buildings (OK, the castle isn't nondescript) . The Viper's the only car you can drive in career 
 mode (I've got no problem with that) , and no matter which of the other cars you choose for a quick 
 race, the other guys will be in - you guessed it - Dodge Vipers.  

 But those are shortcomings, not flaws; when it comes to actual complaints about what's in Viper 
 Racing, the biggest one I can come up with is that the sensation of speed is... well, screwy. You 
 know the message on rearview mirrors that says "Objects are closer than they appear"? Viper Racing 
 should have a similar warning, something like: "You're always going faster than it appears." As 
 you slide out of control in a curve, you'll be wondering why it's happening when you're only going 
 60 or 70 - until a quick glance at the speedometer shows you're way over 100. This is a purely 
 subjective gripe, of course, and after a while you'll undoubtedly develop an innate sense of how 
 fast you're going in relation to the track. But it is something that might put impatient gamers 
 off before they get a chance to discover how intense this game can be.  

 Viper Racing sports a full array of multiplayer options (modem, serial, LAN, and TCP/IP for Internet 
 play) , but just as with Grand Prix Legends, Sierra has tossed a potentially great multiplayer game 
 on the market with zero support to help owners set up races. Serious racers will find a few Viper 
 Racing leagues to join, but those of us looking for some quick racing without the commitment that 
 goes along with league play are out of luck. Here's hoping Viper Racing makes it onto WON or the 
 Internet Gaming Zone soon.  

 Probably the worst thing you can say about Viper Racing is that it's pretty limited in its scope 
 - but you could just as easily turn that around and say that the developer focused on a few things 
 so it could make sure they were all done very, very well. All I know is that it sure hooked me.

Review:  This game might have been made in the past century, but you will be surprised how the car handles! 
 With each new added component to the car, the whole driving experience changes. I have been playing 
 this game since 1998, and to be honest, I have played most racing games to date, few come close 
 to the driving realism that this game offers. With a steering wheel plugged to your PC, it's just 
 perfect. I am still amazed how the company managed to make such a superb game. I know that some 
 might disagree, but if looked upon in an objective point of view, the game is Highly Addictive.
 
  
  The graphics are not so and so, but let's be real, for a game that old, the graphics are fair.
 
  
  Even though you might be playing new generation racing games, give it a try! If you are already 
 a driver, the realism should shock you! Still recommend it to date!

Review:  This is a Papyrus game, the folks who later brought us the great NASCAR series. The physics engine 
 is excellent, the tracks are great, and career mode is just a lot of fun. The other driver AI's 
 are little bit stupid; they sometimes behave as if your car wasn't even there. This can be quite 
 annoying, especially at the start of a race. The graphics are good, probably close to state-of-the-art 
 when the game was released, and the sound is OK. I just replayed the game recently on my WinXP 
 system, and the sound was having some problems -- but the gameplay was just as fun as I remembered. 
 There are a good variety of tracks, and you have to adopt different racing styles to excel at all 
 of them. All in all, an eminently enjoyable racing sim.
