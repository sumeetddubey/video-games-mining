:::Review:::
One fact will immediately become apparent when playing Get Medieval: This game is Gauntlet. 

 
 If you're reading this review in the hopes of finding a new role-playing game, you should probably 
 stop reading now. If you're a fantasy action fan that can't wait for Heretic II, you should do 
 likewise. This review might as well be of a much-beloved 1980s Atari arcade game in which players 
 wandered through dungeons slaying beasts and gathering treasure. One fact will immediately become 
 apparent when playing Get Medieval: This game is Gauntlet.  

 From the opening animation, there's plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor about fantasy adventurers. A 
 dragon swoops down over a village as the voices of four adventurers (apparently watching the intro 
 animation like a movie) make humorous comments such as "The flying chicken is very angry." The 
 four adventurers are basically the same four hero types as in Gauntlet: the elf archer Eryc, the 
 Valkyrie-like Kellina, the brutish barbarian Zared, and the sorceress Levina. The two-bit plot 
 has the adventurers going into a dragon's dungeon to slay the evil beast and gain gold and glory 
 for themselves. If you still don't believe in the similarities yet, allow me continue.  

 Gameplay is exactly the same as Gauntlet. There's the top-down view of the characters as they move 
 around a dungeon picking up treasure, potions that give you health (like food in Gauntlet) , and 
 power-ups that will improve your weapons and shields. Along the way there will be baddies to slay 
 and their spawning points (spiders' nests, beast cages) to destroy. The monotony of the dungeon 
 crawl is broken up by the appearances of the "boss" creatures. Appearing as just enlarged versions 
 of the smaller creatures, there's not much to be said about them except for the fact that practically 
 one hit from them kills your character.  

 Character design doesn't divert much from Gauntlet. Each character has a certain set of statistics 
 that depends on what character class is chosen. The barbarian has high weapon strength, but is 
 slow. The elf is quick with his bow and on his feet, but his arrows do little damage. The other 
 two characters fall somewhere in between. During play, the characters make even more humorous comments 
 about the current situation. Each hero type has a different saying for certain events. The elf 
 shouts out "Ha ha! I'm rich!" while the sorceress exclaims "I'm going shopping!" Other conditions 
 such as getting low on health, shooting much-needed items, and slaying large numbers of monsters 
 also have their own sounds. And if for some reason you still aren't convinced of the similarities, 
 just wait till you start mistakenly shooting healing potions.  

 The strange thing is, this game is still entertaining. With SVGA graphics and the humorous sounds, 
 it just goes to show that some formulas still work. Of course, there's no denying the fact that 
 the game gets repetitive and boring after a while. Due to the lack of a large overhead map, the 
 design of the levels starts to blur from one to the next. The creature design could also have been 
 better. Some of the nuances of the denizens of Gauntlet, such as the annoying Lobbers that attacked 
 over walls, are sorely missed.  

 It's not the fact that Monolith Productions tried to remake Gauntlet that should be upsetting, it's 
 the fact that it was done so blatantly, and without any pretense of originality. Still, perhaps 
 the designers deserve some kudos for bringing a much-loved game back to the PC. This game may be 
 Gauntlet, but Gauntlet is still a lot of fun.

Review:  This is such a cool game. The game is based in a dungeon and you have to fight enimies and try 
 to find the exit. Its easy with the first few levels but when it gets on to the more advanced ones 
 oh it gets tough. Theres puzzles involved in each level like picking the right teleporter also 
 finding keys getting health powerups and opening chest boxes. Theres robbers that steal all your 
 weapon powers that you need to watch out for.
  
  There are four characters which each of them have their own personality and funny dialogue. The 
 game is up to four players. I use to play with my brother and friend on this game. So my advice 
 is go out and buy this game but the bad thing is the game is getting old. Still the game is fun.
 
  
  The level editer is complicated.
  
  
  I completed this game on hard mode. Also there is another mode called torture chamber which seems 
 impossible.
