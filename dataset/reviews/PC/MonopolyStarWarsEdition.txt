:::Review:::
Though not an entirely bad idea, the actual combination of the two proves to be somewhat pointless. 
 

 How appropriate that the Star Wars franchise should be adapted as a PC version of Monopoly. A trilogy 
 of movies so successfully merchandised and made a part of the public consciousness deserves a spot 
 on the original Monopoly's game board itself. (Perhaps Skywalker Ranch could replace Water Works.) 
 Monopoly Star Wars differentiates itself from the classic board game by utilizing features available 
 only through a computer game: the thrilling strategies of Monopoly accompanied by all the music, 
 sounds, and scenes of the Star Wars movies. Though not an entirely bad idea, the actual combination 
 of the two proves to be somewhat pointless.  

 The gameplay of Monopoly should be as familiar to most as tic-tac-toe or checkers. Each player has 
 a marker, or in this case a Star Wars character, which moves over spaces that represent either 
 properties to own, cards to draw, or money to collect or pay. You buy and maintain as many properties 
 as possible without going bankrupt or having to mortgage too many properties, while seeking the 
 financial destruction of your opponents. The droid C-3PO introduces the game and sets the scene, 
 guiding you through the choosing of characters and rules. He also can provide narration throughout 
 the game, explaining the scenario presented by each space on each move.  

 The familiar avenues like Park Place and St. James Place have been replaced by familiar Star Wars 
 backdrops like Tatooine and Hoth. Houses and hotels have been replaced by X-Wings, TIE fighters, 
 and starports. Oddly enough, the In Jail, Free Parking, and Go to Jail spaces are exactly the same 
 as on the board game. (Why not replace the jail with the Death Star detention center?) There are 
 no more problems to solve or strategies to engage than in the board game, and it's this familiarity 
 that proves to be so dull.   

 Numerous nifty clips of the movies have been inserted to break up the monotony of the gameplay, 
 though so much window dressing ultimately reveals the blandness of the game. There is simply not 
 much else for you to do other than click the cursor on the screen's two dice when your turn comes 
 around. Once the dice are rolled the screen quickly switches to animations of your character jumping 
 and somersaulting around the board to the space rolled. There isn't even enough time to count out 
 the spaces to see where you're going to land. You then have the choice either simply to buy the 
 property or to obey whatever command comes from the computer, whether it concerns a card or paying 
 rent to an opponent or the bank. A simpler version of the game can be played, one with a static 
 gameboard in which stiffly posed characters slide from space to space. Even though this plays faster 
 and a little more like the traditional Monopoly, it's no substitute for the hands-on rolling of 
 dice in the board game.  

 With the more animated version of Star Wars Monopoly, a movie clip is played each time you land 
 on a square, usually a scene with a close association with the location. Some of the clips are 
 a little off base or simply wrong: A clip of Chewbacca in the Cloud City torture room to introduce 
 the Cloud City Landing Platform? A clip of the Death Star throne room to introduce the Coruscant 
 Throne Room? Nit-picking to be sure, but these clips are shown each time the gamespace comes into 
 play, even if it's been shown numerous times already. And after a couple games these clips become 
 a little too familiar. The clips also extend the length of your turn and add lots of needless waiting 
 time. It's a cute feature during the first game but it quickly becomes old hat.   

 The most entertaining feature of the game is the voice work of Anthony Daniels, who gives life to 
 an animated C-3PO. The credits even list Daniels as having written the witty repartee found throughout. 
 The graphics are also quite nice, especially some of the character depictions (except for the potbellied 
 Darth Vader) , and the sound meets the standards expected from the folks that brought us THX. Despite 
 some obviously good intentions, though, the replay value of this game is quickly exhausted. Star 
 Wars Monopoly is more like a novelty item that can be played at most a couple of times and then 
 passed among friends and family.

Review:  If you like to Monopoly, and you like Star Wars, then why not play Star Wars Monopoly? There's 
 not much to be said about this game. If you don't like Monopoly, you won't like this game. If you 
 don't like Star Wars, then you might as well play any other Monopoly game.
  
  The sad thing about this game is that it doesn't run on Windows XP, so for those of you that haven't 
 played it, guess you're just gonna have to play the REAL Star Wars Monopoly. This game was fun 
 while it lasted.
  
  The added clips of the then recently released Star Wars Special Edition films was an added bonus. 
 The sound is great. It is narrated by Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) and features great Star Wars sound 
 effects.
  
  Simple review for a simple game. :)

Review:  I own the actual board game version of this game... why? Because it was a collectors item and I 
 have it boxed up with the many other Star Wars items I have collected for years. This is obviously 
 a review for the PC version of the classic board game Monopoly, which has been given a Star Wars 
 makeover.
  
  
  GAMEPLAY 6/10
  
  I couldn't exactly give gameplay a 1/10. Just about everyone has played Monopoly and most have 
 enjoyed it for a little while, this is kind of the same. It's interesting seeing all the locations 
 in Star Wars form, with characters and ships instead of hotels etc. This quickly wears off and 
 you realise it's just as boring as Monopoly is after 40minutes. I don't need to explain what you 
 do , thats pretty obvious. GRAPHICS 4/10
  
  Nothing special at all. Some decent animations for your characters movements... also some funny 
 ones for when you are going to jail etc. It looks as good as you can probably expect when staring 
 at a Monopoly board.
  
  
  SOUND 9/10
  
  As usual, Star Wars game deliver good sound. Lots of music from the films, ships crashing when 
 the dice are rolled and some other extras. If there was no sound in this game you really couldn't 
 play it for more than 20 seconds. Despite the good sound, it doesn't make this game much better.
 
  
  
  VALUE 3/10
  
  You will probably play this game once and never play it again. Against the computer it's boring, 
 against a friend it's boring. If you are a big Star Wars fan and want to own the Monopoly, I urge 
 you to buy the actual Star Wars board game, see this game for pennies in bargain bin? Walk past 
 it. It's as exciting as a game of Monopoly...
  
  
  OVERALL 4.7/10
  
  Thats a generous score. Everything except sound is terrible. Gameplay is nothing special, graphics 
 are below average and nothing will make you look twice.

Review:  The ability to save and start a trade only once during your game, while the computer may trade 
 as often as it wishes, greatly decreases the games value. While a nice idea for Star Wars fans, 
 it's pointless for monopoly fans. The ability to customize the rules is a nice idea, but hardly 
 saves the game from poor design. The only reason this was on my computer was because I got it for 
 free. I would recommend you not pay money for this game. The ability to choose from memorable Star 
 Wars characters, while amusing, is rather pointless. This game is one of the most disappointing 
 titles I've played to date. It is no longer support by it's manufacturer, so any problems you may 
 have you are completely on your own. Even the developers realized it was a disaster and quickly 
 abandoned it. I highly recommend you do the same.

Review:  The good news is that it's Star Wars, so if your into that it's enough all on it's own.
  
  It's also Monopoly, and that in and of itself makes it a game worth playing. It does a good job 
 keeping with the Monopoly feel, but all considered that is the easy part.
  
  Where this game fails is making itself different from every other theamed Monopoly game. It just 
 doesn't stand out. There is nothing special about it, and that was really dissapointing as I was 
 hoping for something additional and cool from the Star Wars universe. No AT-AT's blowing up non-paying 
 squaters, nothing!
  
  Overall, if you see it in the bargin bin just pass it up and get the real board game.
