:::Review:::
Cold Shadow's addictive action, combined with Disney's impeccable attention to detail, makes it 
 one of the best entertainment values. 

 Platform-style games haven't been getting a whole lot of respect lately, and for good reason. Since 
 they're the easiest kind of game to produce, and everybody and his brother thinks he can just whip 
 out a good one overnight, the rather limited selection of platformers this last year has been staggeringly 
 dull. A few million Mario Brothers fans can't be wrong, though. It's not really the genre that 
 sucks - it's the individual games. And Disney Interactive's latest, Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow, 
 proves that good platform games can and do exist. This is quite possibly the best low-tech title 
 to come out this year. It doesn't have real-time 3-D environments or multiplayer network play or 
 even mouse support. What it does have is about fifty hours of good ol' fashioned jump-and-punch 
 action.  

 You are Maui Mallard, a hard-boiled, aloha-shirt-clad private dick... er... duck. You have been summoned 
 to a tropical island to help the Muddrakes retrieve their stolen mojo idol, Shabuhm Shabuhm. On 
 your journey, you must collect money to add to your score as well as bugs to put in your bug gun. 
 Five different kinds of bugs are available, each with different attributes. (Lightning bugs go 
 a long distance while homing bugs zero in on a target, and so on. Combine two different bugs and 
 get combo results: long distance homing bugs, for instance.)  

 After making it through the first level and past the giant spider, you discover some mysterious 
 coins imprinted with the yin/yang symbol. These enable you to magically transform into (dah-da-da-daaaaah!) 
 Cold Shadow, legendary Ninja master. From there, things start to cook. As the Ninja, not only do 
 you wield deadly nunchaku, but you are able to use them to climb up walls, and are also able to 
 teleport (aka run very fast) . Needless to say, this adds a lot to the game, but I still prefer 
 shooting bugs at the bad guys. Between levels there is a unicycle-based bonus level and a handsome 
 reward at the end for the lucky duck who completes the arduous task. With all these features, it's 
 no wonder Disney's spent months and months working on this version and its 16-bit papa, Donald 
 Duck in Maui Mallard.  

 Despite all that work there are still some rough edges. Although the game touts five different types 
 of bugs, they are all revealed in the first level. That's no fun. For the big band soundtrack, 
 which is remarkably good even by Disney standards, Disney Interactive chose to use Redbook CD audio. 
 Unfortunately, this means that with most CD-ROM drives the action onscreen freezes for a bit every 
 five minutes as the CD restarts the audio track - not a serious flaw, but pretty annoying. The 
 graphics are basically a direct port from the 16-bit game, but are quite detailed nevertheless. 
 (What else did you expect from Disney?) The full screen mode supported by the game, however, is 
 prohibitively choppy, so most players will be forced to play in a 640x480 window. That, combined 
 with the relatively poor keyboard control, makes for a somewhat aggravating time in parts. However, 
 the sheer quality of the gameplay overshadows any minor frustration.  

 Cold Shadow's addictive action, combined with Disney's impeccable attention to detail, makes it 
 one of the best entertainment values for Windows users. Yet another winner from the magical mouse.

Review:  Cold Shadow is one of the best games of all time, full stop. If you like plat-formers, or action 
 games, or adventure games, or games at all, this is one to pick up!!
  
  i know it is old, and has horrific graphics for modern day standards, but for the time they were 
 top notch!! The gameplay is a little on the easy side, once you get the hang of it, but overall, 
 makes for a slight challenge and lots of fun!! The music for all the levels is original and inspired, 
 and i'll listen to it for hours on end!!
  
  Plus the story is great, and combined with awesomely fun and addictive game-play, what more could 
 be in a game!?

Review:  I repeat what was mentioned above. Look at my critic of this game, which is written in the SNES 
 version of the game. (Its pretty much the same anyway, the game I mean) I didn't know Gamespot 
 had written about the PC version, which I have. So, if you look at the SNES version the game, you'll 
 find my review and the opinion I have about the game, since the SNES version is the same as the 
 PC version. (Sorry if this looks kind of repetitive and like if I needed to fill in. The point 
 is that I needed to rediredt persons from here to the game in SNES so people could read. Gamespot, 
 thanks for understanding!)
