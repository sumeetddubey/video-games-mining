:::Review:::
Rise & Rule does a fantastic job of making players feel like they belong to their selected culture. 
 

 Openly taking on Civilization 2 (Civ 2) , the folks at Impressions have taken loads of interesting 
 cultural information, fantastic sound and graphics, and full network support and combined them 
 in a title that is full of atmosphere and life, but slightly lacking in its strategy content.  

 Rise &amp; Rule uses the same basic structure as its competition. Players start on a map (randomly 
 generated or realistic) with one settler. With this single unit, players must found a city, spread 
 out across the continents, and create an entire civilization capable of standing up against the 
 test of time. As the game progresses, players can access different unit types including a variety 
 of combat troops, philosophers (who trade information between cities, facilitating the building 
 of roads and the cultivation of fields) , and merchants (who generate trade between cities) . Moving 
 units is as simple as highlighting them with your mouse and clicking on their destination, and 
 newcomers will find the game's on-line tutorial and help boxes very helpful when getting started. 

 Rise &amp; Rule does a fantastic job of making players feel like they belong to their selected culture. 
 Every city improvement, every unit, every rendered animation and even the soundtrack reflects the 
 specific culture that the player has selected. Unfortunately, in their attempt to one-up Civilization 
 2, the designers at Impressions seem to have forgotten to make the game fun to play. This title's 
 limited time span (the object is to win by A. D. 500) , limited number of unit types (around 12, 
 as compared to Civ 2's 50-plus) , and limited research involvement (players use a slider to determine 
 how much effort to dedicate to five areas of study) , leave the game sadly lacking in just about 
 every area that Civ 2 succeeds in. As beautiful as the game is, there's no reason for anyone to 
 buy a title you're not going to enjoy playing in the long run.  

 If you've got access to a network and you're looking for a multi-player game with great sound and 
 solid graphics, you may want to give Rise &amp; Rule a spin. Those looking to buy a single-player 
 strategy game will almost surely be happier with Civ 2.

Review:  I still cant believe i found this game... I was looking at another strategy game similar to this 
 when this game came to my mind.. This game had everything you needed in a turn based strategy game, 
 and if you were like me you played countless nights against the computer trying to conquer everything 
 in your path. I remember i played this game against my cousins a long time ago. This is the only 
 game I can remember that you could play a turn based strategy game like this with the same computer, 
 monitor and all. I guess due to the fact that I couldnt help but try to figure out the locations 
 of my cousin's empires, that they eventually stopped playing and so did I. But If i could ever 
 find this game and if it would work on an xp computer I would love to have it. Of course, back 
 then the graphics were excellent. Now looking at something like Age of empires, Civilization games, 
 etc, this game is old an obsolete. But like I said, its a classic and fun game to have and if you 
 can ever find it, I recommend you play this game. For awhile, this was the standard on how strategy 
 games should be.
