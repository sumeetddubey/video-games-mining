:::Review:::
The sweat that the first Lemmings produced on your brow may not be there, but die-hard Lemmings 
 fanatics may still get a kick out of this new edition. 

 Long ago, when the original Lemmings entered the computer gaming circuit, game enthusiasts were 
 enthralled by a new morbid, yet somehow cute game. Lemmings - where the object was to guide a relentlessly 
 marching troop of otherwise suicidal creatures to safety - was an addicting title that actually 
 required the player to exercise mind-racking ingenuity on the fly. Many sequels to this original 
 title have since been released by Psygnosis, the latest having been Lemmings 3D, which expanded 
 upon the linear puzzles found in previous Lemmings titles by adding a new dimension to the action. 
 Lemmings Paintball, Psygnosis' most recent pledge in the Lemmings brotherhood, takes quite a different 
 approach to our favorite self-abusive creatures. The sweat that the first Lemmings produced on 
 your brow may not be there, but die-hard Lemmings fanatics may still get a kick out of this new 
 edition.   

 Unlike previous Lemmings scenarios, the levels in Paintball are rendered in three-quarter perspective. 
 You begin with anywhere from one to four Lemmings, controlled separately or as a group (a la Syndicate) . 
 Armed with paintball guns, these guys have to wander through each level, be-splattering any enemies 
 who cross their paths, their goal being to capture one or more flags that lie in some area of the 
 map. Tricks and traps such as collapsing floors, paint-mines, and lava pits befall the pint-sized 
 adventurers in their travels. You must carefully utilize elevators, keys, and balloons to overcome 
 these obstacles, and in some instances, one of your lemmings may have to activate a lever to free 
 his lemming comrades who are trapped elsewhere in the level. The strategic element, while not always 
 brilliant, is still present, and this time around, if you get tired of playing one of the 100 or 
 so levels, you can always play Paintball over the network.   

 Sadly, I had a lot of problems with Lemmings Paintball, and two things that saved this game for 
 me were the soundtrack and the fact that Psygnosis included two of the classic Lemmings titles 
 as a bonus. The problem is, while the graphics are pretty good and some of the levels may be challenging, 
 the game ends up leaving a great deal to be desired. The lemmings still move to your beck and call, 
 proceeding from point A to point B even if danger lies in between. So, while the puzzles aren't 
 terribly difficult in themselves, the difficulty in having to navigate these dumb creatures around 
 the precipitous terrain of each level can quickly become frustrating. Again, although veteran Lemmings-heads 
 will probably derive some satisfaction from Lemmings Paintball, the title's bizarre gameplay makes 
 it hard to compare this game to its predecessors. Hopefully, the next installment in the Lemmings 
 infinology will contain some of the craftiness of the original Lemmings. Perhaps a Lemmings-Doom 
 clone is in order. Can you picture lemmings in body armor?
