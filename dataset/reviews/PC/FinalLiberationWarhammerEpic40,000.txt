Final Liberation looks and feels like a traditional turn-based wargame, but meticulous gameplay 
 balance and dozens of imaginative units set it apart. 

 Games Workshop's Epic 40,000 tabletop wargame demands a pretty serious commitment. You must be prepared 
 to pay hundreds of dollars buying the miniature models that compose your futuristic army and spend 
 perhaps an equivalent number of hours assembling and painting each in turn. You'll want to set 
 aside the better part of a day to play out a single battle against a friend, since moving those 
 miniatures, rolling dice, consulting event tables, and whatnot really adds up on the clock. That's 
 where Final Liberation comes in - it's the first computer game to recreate the Epic 40,000 game 
 system and the struggle between the Imperium of Man and the marauding Space Orks. Indeed, Final 
 Liberation is a very faithful (and economical) adaptation of its source material, and it even adds 
 a number of clever features on the side.  

 Final Liberation looks and feels like a traditional turn-based wargame, but meticulous gameplay 
 balance and dozens of imaginative units set it apart. Both the Imperium and Orks offer several 
 dozen types of infantry and armored units that must be deployed in careful combinations to succeed. 
 Once the conflict begins, you and your opponent take turns spreading your forces across huge, detailed 
 maps in an attempt to gain ground quickly but remain as safe as possible and hopefully out of your 
 enemy's line of sight. You can stop your units short so they can reserve a shot for the enemy's 
 movement phase, you can entrench your infantry, or you can sacrifice a unit's movement for additional 
 time to fire its weapons. Firing, in turn, involves a series of probability checks to determine 
 whether an attack hits its mark, whether it penetrates the target's armor, and how much damage 
 it inflicts. Keeping your forces close together means you can concentrate your firepower, but also 
 makes you a much easier target for your enemy's indirect fire. Staying close also helps morale, 
 but should the enemy take out one of your key units, the rest may well turn tail and head for cover, 
 thus throwing your carefully planned offensive into chaos.  

 Final Liberation's quick battle mode pits you and the computer or a friend in a single battle restricted 
 by a predefined point limit, and each type of unit costs a certain amount of points. You must construct 
 your military differently depending on just how many points you make available. A thousand points 
 means you'll probably deploy hordes of infantry and a few tanks, while eight thousand means you 
 can unleash the massive Imperial Titans and Ork Gargants whose shielding and weapon arsenals make 
 them veritable armies themselves. Battles in excess of 5,000 points are epic indeed and can rage 
 on for hours as you and your opponent control your massive armies piece by piece. Fortunately you 
 can set the game to alternate turns each time you move a unit rather than the whole side to speed 
 things along. Meanwhile, the single-player campaign mode offers a cohesive plot and nonlinear structure 
 as you control the Imperial forces in an effort to reclaim the planet Volistad from Ork raiders. 
 You must take the planet back region by region, thus increasing your resource surplus as the Orks 
 brace themselves to prevent your advance.  

 You can control several commanders at once each with their own armies working different areas of 
 the planet, lending the campaign game plenty of variety and more than a little replay value. The 
 computer AI is quite smart at purchasing wicked combinations of units and using them against you, 
 and it even sets up nasty ambushes once in a while despite its tendency to spread its forces too 
 thin. Controlling the combat is a snap thanks to Final Liberation's tutorial and helpful movement 
 and firing hex overlays coupled with an intuitive mouse-driven interface. Likewise, if you're wondering 
 just what in blazes that Ork Bubble Chucka Speedsta (or any other unit for that matter) is about 
 to do to you, a simple right-click lets you access the Codex database on all its vital stats.  
 

 Better still, the campaign is highlighted by surprisingly well-acted FMV sequences that feature 
 truly impressive costume designs for the Imperials and Orks alike - almost as if the scenes were 
 taken from a Warhammer 40,000 film in the making. These scenes more than make up for Final Liberation's 
 rather austere gameplay graphics that, though colorful, enthusiastically animated, and true to 
 the tabletop game, really aren't anything special. Meanwhile, a pleasant (though inappropriately 
 mellow) music score along with a pretty basic set of sound effects means Final Liberation doesn't 
 offer too much in the way of aesthetic excess. But while its plain appearance won't make the game 
 reach out and grab you right away, its graphics will grow on you after a while, and by then, you're 
 sure to be pleased with how it plays.  

 Final Liberation is designed to accurately recreate the Epic 40,000 tabletop game, and it does. 
 But after playing it for awhile you'll certainly concoct a sizable mental wish-list for a sequel 
 or add-on. After all, the game only offers the one Imperial campaign (which is very good) , and 
 the two sides in Final Liberation only scratch the surface of the many interesting races contained 
 in the Epic 40,000 universe - all of which are referenced in the Codex but left conspicuously absent 
 during play. A more modern presentation would likewise go a long way to draw in new fans, but for 
 now, Final Liberation will appeal mainly to those already interested in its source material. As 
 it stands, Final Liberation is a solid, enjoyable turn-based strategy game that offers plenty of 
 strategy, imagination, and value for those looking to win large-scale future wars.
