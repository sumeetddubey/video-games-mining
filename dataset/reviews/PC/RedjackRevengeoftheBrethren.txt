It's a shame that someone decided to go and spoil a decent adventure game by including action elements. 
 

 Over the years there have been numerous buccaneer-based adventure games, from early two-word parser 
 games like Scott Adams' Pirate Adventure, through Infocom's more complex text adventures like Cutthroats 
 and Plundered Hearts, and on to LucasArts' Monkey Island trilogy - the last of which, The Curse 
 of Monkey Island, was far and away the best adventure game of 1997.  

 Cyberflix's Redjack: Revenge of the Brethren is the latest game to utilize a pirate storyline, but 
 it is far from the greatest. In the past, Cyberflix has made interesting and original adventure 
 games (Dust, Titanic: Adventure Out of Time) and dreadful action games (Skullcracker, Jump Raven) . 
 Redjack makes an attempt to blend these two genres, and it should be no surprise that the final 
 result is a somewhat schizophrenic blend of good adventure and terrible action.  

 Redjack has many strengths. The basic story is fairly involving: You play a young man named Nick 
 Dove who is being pressured from a variety of people in his town to make something of himself (though 
 why they think signing on with a bunch of pirates is a good idea - and they all seem to think signing 
 on with a bunch of pirates is a good idea - is never explained) . As you prepare for the pirate's 
 life, you learn of a group of pirates who sailed under the name the Brethren and were led by the 
 legendary Captain Redjack. Redjack was betrayed by one of the Brethren during a particularly lucrative 
 plundering and, as he died, cursed his treasure until the turncoat was revealed. Now, many years 
 later, the few living Brethren are reuniting, and it is your job to find Redjack's betrayer.  

 
 The adventure portion of Redjack is standard fare. It's moderately fun but lacks the innovative 
 elements that made Dust so interesting, such as characters who seem to lead their own lives and 
 follow their own schedules. In Redjack, you simply move from port to port, solving one or two puzzles 
 and talking to numerous characters in each place and moving on. It's a fairly standard adventure 
 game in that respect. There are a number of "maneuver the mechanism" puzzles and a few intuitive 
 inventory-based puzzles. The puzzles are not too hard, and if you get stuck, another character 
 in the game will often have a small piece of advice. They will occasionally even tell you the solution 
 to a puzzle, which saps some of the challenge from the game. Redjack is also, like most modern 
 adventure games, far too short.   

 On a technical level, Redjack is really impressive. The characters are animated is a pseudo-claymation 
 style, and each has a great deal of variety and personality in its animations. The voice acting 
 is good, for the most part, and the ambient music is fitting, though at times it gets rather repetitive. 
 The real strength of Redjack is its 3D engine. This isn't Unreal, mind you, but it's a great deal 
 better than the 3D engines seen in games like Tex Murphy: Overseer.  

 So far, so good. It's just a shame that someone decided to go and spoil a decent adventure game 
 by including action elements. There are two basic kinds of action sequences: swordplay and a sort 
 of Mad Dog McRee-style shooting gallery. The swordplay isn't so bad - at first. The swashbuckling 
 training portion of the game is actually quite fun, though you'll find in actual combat the techniques 
 you learned aren't any more effective than just wildly swinging and parrying. The shooting sequences 
 are even worse. Imagine trying to make a 3D shooter out of the Might &amp; Magic VI engine, and 
 you have the basic idea; the engine that was great for adventure is abysmal for action. Blocky, 
 hard-to-see enemies and sluggish response time only complicate matters. Add to this the frustration 
 of having to go through two of these sequences in a row without being given a chance to save, and 
 you'll be pulling your hair out by the fistful in no time.  

 Had the designers stuck to the adventure side of things and spent more time developing the stories 
 and the characters, the game would have been much, much better. As it stands, Redjack isn't all 
 terrible; it's only half terrible, and your individual need for new adventure games will be the 
 deciding factor in whether or not the competent half is worth the effort.

Review:  I really enjoyed Redjack for it's time. It was one of my first PC games I owned and only Pirate 
 game I had played at the time. I loved it. While it had it's share of problems, I found it's story, 
 characters, and locations more than made up for them. It plays like Myst although I think is more 
 involving story and has a freeroaming 360 degree camera. If you can go forward, an arrow will appear 
 letting you know your allowed to. When you move forward the game is very pixellated, though once 
 it stops, it becomes very nice and detailed. Characters are 2D in the 360 degree camera though 
 nicely detailed models when your talking to them up close. While the story is pretty simple though 
 keeps you interested enough since it's nonstop cinemas just about, it's quite short. The game is 
 on 3 CDs yet that is mainly for the graphics and sounds I suppose. You end up switching to CD2 
 the second you leave Lizard Point in the beginning which doesn't take long. 
  When I first played this game, it took me awhile to beat it. I had to keep going back to an online 
 guide to figure out certain parts. Only once I did that though. Everything from then on got embedded 
 into my head and I've not beaten the game about 10 times since my first time. I know every single 
 thing about it pretty much. As a race through the game, I beat it in alittle under an hour, I think 
 it was 45minutes I have stuck in my head though I'm not quite sure. That was skipping every dialogue 
 and I believe most of the cinematics using spacebar. It's quite a fun pirate game and I would recommend 
 it to any pirate fan. Nowadays it will show it's age easily and is probably VERY hard to find. 
 I would still say give it a try because aside from pixellated movements, it's graphics still look 
 nice to this day. 
  Cheers!
