:::Review:::
Its gameplay is so flawed and so unenjoyable that the end result actually seems like a practical 
 joke at the buyer's expense. 

 South Park Rally is the third South Park-licensed game, and it's terrible, just like the first two. 
 It's a simplistic racing game that successfully captures the look and style of the show, but its 
 gameplay is so flawed and so unenjoyable that the end result actually seems like a practical joke 
 at the buyer's expense.  

 South Park Rally looks and sounds deceptively good. Beware: If you didn't know any better, you might 
 think the quality of the graphics, and how well they capture the cardboard-cutout look of the television 
 show, are suggestive of the overall quality of the game. You'll instantly recognize all the various 
 characters in South Park Rally if you've seen them in the show before; their simple forms and clean, 
 flat colors come across perfect, and their faces animate just as expressively as they do on TV. 
 Each character drives his own unique little vehicle, from Chef's wood-paneled station wagon to 
 Officer Barbrady's cop car, often complete with a personalized license plate. The tracks in the 
 game also look quite good; they're holiday-themed, and look just like sets from the show.  

 Then again, it's not like South Park is best known for the high quality of its visual style; as 
 such, the best that can be said for South Park Rally's presentation is that it looks like the show. 
 By any other standards, the game's simple 3D shapes and flat lighting effects would be merely average. 
 In addition, although South Park Rally does feature original dialogue by the South Park cast, there 
 isn't nearly enough variety to the sound effects, and they're poorly sampled on top of that. For 
 example, the game's announcer speaks far too loudly compared with the other characters, and some 
 of the other speech in South Park Rally is incomprehensibly muffled. The game's twangy and dissonant 
 soundtrack is reminiscent of the show's signature title track, and it'll grate on your nerves as 
 you keep listening to it over and over, unless the other elements of the game get to you first. 

 It wouldn't seem as necessary to point out the relatively minor problems with South Park Rally's 
 graphics and sound if the game actually played well. However, it plays so terribly that its other 
 problems end up standing out even more. South Park Rally is supposed to be a fun and simple racing 
 game just like so many other go-kart-racing games out there. Just like so many other kart-racing 
 games, South Park Rally lets you drive around or across a circuit while picking up power-ups that 
 are designed to sway the race in your favor. The power-ups include rats, Cheesy Poofs, and more. 
 However, most of the power-ups are utterly worthless aside from their comic value; some work like 
 landmines, which you must drop blindly, as you have no rearview mirror, let alone any onscreen 
 indication that a rival car is coming up from behind. Some of the other power-ups are much too 
 inaccurate to be of any real use.  

 But the real problem lies with your computer opponents, who recover from your attacks easily and 
 carry on around the track with unstoppable resolve; yet if you're on the receiving end of one of 
 their weapons, you may as well start over because you're never going to catch up. In addition, 
 the game's open-ended track design means that you can easily get stuck or lost, and if you lose 
 so much as a second of time, you've lost the race. South Park Rally is entirely unforgiving - you 
 need perfect driving skills and a lot of luck to finish first, and unless you finish first you 
 can't advance to the next stage. The game's driving mechanics are grossly simplistic - all you 
 do is press a button to powerslide around corners - and the game's sprawling track design, which 
 features hidden shortcuts and items that you don't actually have any time to find, is completely 
 irritating.  

 Maybe all the glaring problems and misguided design decisions in South Park Rally are deliberate; 
 it's difficult to explain or justify its lack of a difficulty setting and a save-game feature otherwise. 
 South Park Rally isn't necessarily impossible to win, but it seems intentionally designed to be 
 impossible to tolerate for very long. There's no point playing it against the computer since you'll 
 keep losing, yet you have no option to save and a limited option to continue. And there's no point 
 playing it against your friends, thanks to the bad track design and ill-conceived power-ups; there's 
 not even a draw in trying all the different characters, since all of them control exactly the same. 
 Maybe South Park Rally is a self-conscious work of comedic genius that we'll praise one day for 
 its blatant defiance of every convention, much like the irreverent show that inspired it. Or maybe 
 not; it's more likely that South Park Rally is actually nothing more than a blatant attempt to 
 quickly and greedily cash in on a still-successful but waning franchise. It's an utterly terrible 
 game and Acclaim's third strike with the South Park license.

Review:  ok so I admit south park rally isn't the best racing game ever, but letting Greg Kasavin review 
 it is like having queer eye for the straight guy reviewed by a homophoob. I don't know what he 
 is talking about. I've been playing it at least 1 hour a day, every day. But the thing is, you 
 will only love if your a fan of the series since day one. All of the humor is out of episodes from 
 the first season, back from 1999. So if you like south park, and I mean really like south park, 
 you can play this game for weeks maybe even months. Greg Kasavin just doesn't like the series obviously. 
 and that's to bad cause I think it's a little masterpiece and as a fan I would give it a 9.9 but 
 as an avarege gamer I would give it a 7.0 cause it's still loads of fun.

Review:  I rented this game thinking i would have fun playing it but its just not what its cracked up to 
 be.
  
  Very short lifetime and definately needs a second or third consideration before buying it.
  
 
  Im the type of person who enjoys a laugh on a game but this is just lethargic to play and there 
 are games out there which wipe the floor with this one.
  
  Acclaim please dont put the south park characters in racing cars again, thanks!
  
  A dissapointing 
 game which tries so hard but fails on all grounds! : (

Review:  The popular animated tv comedy South Park is back and this time in video game form (were they went 
 i dont know) and is more enjoyable than ever. When i picked this game up for $25 i thought seeing 
 that it is cheap it probly crap but i was back then a big fan of south park so i gave it a try 
 and it is the best South Park game that is a fun racing game mixed with a twist of comedy!
  
  Characters include  mom, Erics mom, the aliens, ike, shely, officer 
 cartman, homie cartman, brave chief even Jesus and Satan! There is about 8 more that i cant remember 
 but i know theres heaps more. There are also about 10 levels that are in this game.
  
  Some of the mission objectives are shooting people with cupids bow and arrow for Valentines day, checkpoint 
 racing, collecting easter eggs, turkeys and chickens for certain events and defeating Satan and so 
 much more.
