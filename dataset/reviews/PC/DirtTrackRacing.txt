:::Review:::
Even with all of Dirt Track Racing's finer points, it's hard to overlook its repetitive tracks and 
 racing events. 

 Australian developer Ratbag is best known for its work on Powerslide. Released in the final weeks 
 of 1998, the game featured fun-to-drive cars and inventive tracks riddled with sharp banks, tall 
 drops, and long jumps. Powerslide was defined by its tracks, as they served to set it apart from 
 the glut of racing games that clogged the genre during the early part of 1999. However, there was 
 one track in the game that was simply dull and uninspired by comparison: the oval. While this straightforward 
 track was meant to familiarize you with the feel of the car and the general play mechanics of the 
 game, it lacked any depth or substance. With Dirt Track Racing, Ratbag has focused an entire game 
 around the simple concept of racing around this same small, oval track.  

 The tracks in Dirt Track Racing can be characterized in three words: oval, dirt, and small. They 
 range in variety from regular ovals, to D-ovals, to the occasional figure eight. All said, the 
 game has approximately 30 of these unimaginative racetracks scattered across a number of states 
 throughout the US. And while the nature of dirt-track racing (this motorsport actually exists) 
 calls for these sorts of uneventful tracks, translating them into a computer game makes them lose 
 whatever real-life appeal they might have.  

 However, once you get past this glaring shortcoming, Dirt Track Racing actually becomes a robust 
 racing game, complete with a functional money system, accurate car-handling characteristics, varying 
 traction, and a variety of customizable cars. The game's career mode is split up into stock, pro-stock, 
 and late-model car classes. You start out in the stock class with $1,000 in your account to buy 
 your first car and pay entry fees for your first series, which is a set of racing events aimed 
 at one of the three car classes. The events in each series are in turn made up of practice, qualifying, 
 heat, and main races. To gain prize money and corporate sponsors for necessary car upgrades, repairs, 
 and event entry fees, you must successfully work your way through these series, ultimately earning 
 enough money to buy a car in a higher class and making you eligible to compete in successively 
 tougher series.  

 The cars' physics are overexaggerated to maximize the effects of powersliding, oversteering, and 
 countersteering that define Dirt Track Racing's gameplay. The basic premise is to "slide" through 
 turns in order to keep the speed of your car and engine revolutions as high as possible when coming 
 out of that turn. As stock cars gain horsepower through engine modifications, this powersliding 
 technique becomes even more exaggerated, leaving little room for error. With power topping over 
 800hp, pro stock and late model cars require an even steadier hand during cornering. Thankfully, 
 the game lets you tweak and upgrade your suspension setup to your liking, making the cars a bit 
 more forgiving. Just like Powerslide before it, Dirt Track Racing takes some getting used to, but 
 you'll be able to take the cars to their limits once you get acquainted with the game's handling 
 dynamics.  

 Dirt Track Racing is also the first game to mimic the development of the "groove" effect associated 
 with the sport. Before the start of each event, the track is watered down to give the dirt better 
 traction. As the cars start to run laps around the track, a groove forms along the best driving 
 line, causing that part of the track to become drier than the parts not worn down by the cars. 
 Driving along the groove becomes progressively more difficult after each lap, as the dry dirt lacks 
 the traction that it had at the start of the race. This forces you to either drive high along the 
 outside of the groove or low on the inside of the track. It's certainly an effect that hasn't been 
 attempted in previous racing games, and it adds a new facet to an established genre.  

 The game is powered by the same engine used by Powerslide. Long, streaking textures on the track 
 and along the walls give a great sense of speed to Dirt Track Racing. The cars themselves are fairly 
 detailed, and the sun-worn paintjobs and chipped sponsor logos lend more realism to the cars' appearance. 
 Improvements in the engine include the ability it gives you to play the game from a 3D cockpit 
 view, and the incorporation of a damage model that affects your car's aesthetics. However, unlike 
 in Powerslide, Dirt Track Racing has no soundtrack whatsoever, leaving you to contend with nothing 
 but the droning of the cars' big block engines.  

 A robust multiplayer component lets you and nine others compete over a LAN or through an Internet 
 connection. The game even comes with a lite version of Gamespy for easy sorting of active servers. 
 But even with all of Dirt Track Racing's finer points, it's hard to overlook its repetitive tracks 
 and racing events. Despite the fact that the game accurately captures the nature of the sport it 
 portrays, Dirt Track Racing ends up being a robust racing-management system broken up by boring 
 races.

Review:  The game itself is pretty good, like the concepts and physics, but the events are too repititive. 
 You have to race through like a thousand small races before you get to the real event. The sound 
 is good, although the racing sounds are kinda too loud. The graphics are great, like the sponserships 
 and the track textures. Its real easy if you are doing the easy style, but for the quick race, 
 the late models are fast but hard. Overall, its too repetitive, but its still got its good parts. 
 The Sprint Cars version looked pretty good. If DTR could improve its gameplay and sound, then that 
 would make it real awesome.

Review:  WOOHOO!! Come one, come all. Rednecks, race fans, and those who just like speed. Gather 'round 
 for a good ole time and get yer cars mudday!
  
  Ok, you can't really get mud on your cars because at the time the graphics wouldn't allow it. But 
 it will last you a while. A couple of days if you play video games like you breathe. A year or 
 two if you don't. 
  
  The repetitive tracks p*ssed me off too much but it was something to do at least. And the sounds 
 when I first played it were so annoying I just had to cut off the sound. I eventually started to 
 listen to my own music and play the game. 
  
  Actually this game wasn't all that it was cracked up to be. It was more of a waste of $20 (at least 
 it came with 3 other games) . The AI was horrible, all they knew was to run around in circles. It 
 was too easy. 
  
  I played the demo for the 2nd game and it was better, graphically and gameplay wise. But it was 
 too short. I cant really put into words what this game is like, but it's cool. More or less.
  
  I suggest that if you like racing games, get it and try it out. If you don't, don't bother.
