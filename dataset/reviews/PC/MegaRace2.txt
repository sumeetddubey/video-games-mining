:::Review:::
MegaRace 2 seems designed solely for the action fan. 

 If you're a big fan of realistic racing sims, the kind with tons of real-world physics and statistics, 
 Mindscape's MegaRace 2 is not the game you've been waiting for. A sequel to the sleeper hit MegaRace 
 (I bet you figured that one out on your own) , MegaRace 2 seems designed solely for the action fan, 
 bypassing entirely the usual load of bells and whistles that decorate most sims in favor of sharp 
 visuals and arcade gameplay. Combine this with some of the weirdest video clips to ever be included 
 in a game, and you have  well, it's hard to say exactly what you have, and therein lies one 
 of MegaRace 2's biggest problems.  

 What MegaRace 2 sets out to do, it does very well. Each of the game's tracks is modeled at a level 
 that approaches perfection. Even playing straight from the CD (loading the entire track on your 
 hard drive offers better on-track performance at the expense of a longer wait before each race) , 
 the animation is fairly smooth and believable and stands out as a graphics achievement against 
 even the latest processor heavy racing engines. MegaRace 2's sense of shticky humor is also a lot 
 of fun, with plenty of twisted video clips that outline a futuristic society gone mad. Your show 
 host Lance Boyle and his lovely (but remarkably vacant) assistant irritate, offend, and insult 
 without ever losing any of their goofy charm. Backing all of this up is a solid techno soundtrack 
 that builds up adrenaline without driving players crazy with repetitive licks.  

 Unfortunately, good looks and a bizarre cast aren't enough to make a great game. Despite MegaRace 
 2's brilliant production quality, at its heart this title is little more than RoadBlasters remade 
 for the 90's. Between each race, players are given a chance to spend the money they've earned on 
 missiles (to shoot people in front of you) , mines or oil slicks (to shoot people behind you) or 
 shields and car repairs (to protect you from other people's weapons) . While the concept of a shooting 
 car on a racing circuit is certainly appealing, if unoriginal, this smattering of weaponry ensures 
 that the whole process gets repetitive rather quickly. Also reducing MegaRace 2's effectiveness 
 as an action title is the lack of any sort of rear-view mirror, which ensures that the player who 
 gets in the lead early will almost certainly be shot to death by trailing opponents without any 
 way to intelligently avoid the barrage. Finally, Mindscape has completely snubbed the current trend 
 towards multi-player gaming by excluding any sort of network or modem competitive mode. With such 
 a small number of tracks included, this ensures that once you've beaten the game (which any true 
 fanatic will do fairly quickly) , there's no real reason to go back and play again.  

 For all its problems, there's no doubt that MegaRace 2 is a beautiful game that is definitely a 
 step forward for graphics technology. If you've got some friends coming over who haven't shown 
 enough appreciation for the raw power of your new desktop, this might be the application to wow 
 them into submission. If, however, you're interested in playing an arcade racer that can deliver 
 some serious entertainment over the long haul, you may want to hold off on your purchase until 
 the release of Sega's Daytona.

Review:  Megarace II is a futuristic racegame in the style of WipEout. The only difference is the fact that 
 you race in cars. But the small tracks, the unusual settings and the weapons are almost the same. 
 
  
  The gameplay is about what you can expect from a racegame. However there is this thing with the 
 camera. Its fixed to the track and all you do is steer left and right. The ingame graphics arent 
 all rendered. The only objects that are rendered are the cars, weapons and obstacles on the track. 
 The track itself however is somewhat like a movie that plays back in the speed youre racing in. 
 But that doesnt mean the graphics arent good. On the contrary, they are topnotch! Unfortunately 
 that doesnt go for the sound. The annoying house music is better off turned off, but the SFX arent 
 that bad. 
  
  To be honest, Ive had some good fun with this game, but these days it just doesnt do it anymore. 
 So if you have a very slow PC then this might be something for you. But if not, then be considered 
 warned!
