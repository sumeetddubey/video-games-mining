:::Review:::
While its missions are complex and often satisfying, Emergency 2 is frustrating at times because 
 of its clumsy interface. 

  The vast majority of real-time strategy games simulate war or some other type of armed conflict. 
 Emergency 2: The Ultimate Fight for Life is also a real-time strategy game, but instead of following 
 the crowd, it attempts to simulate the management of a city's emergency services during various 
 civil crises. In Emergency 2, you'll control dozens of units -- including search-and-rescue helicopters, 
 police K9 units, and fire engines with hydraulic ladders, among others -- in an attempt to bring 
 order to 25 different emergency situations, ranging from a gas explosion at a police station to 
 a meltdown at a nuclear power plant. While its missions are complex and often satisfying, Emergency 
 2 is frustrating at times because of its clumsy interface.  

          The control center lets you quickly switch views from headquarters to the crisis area. 
     

  One of the biggest problems in Emergency 2 is its woefully inadequate documentation. The paper 
 manual that comes with the game says nothing about how to use its different units, or what their 
 main specialties are. The tutorial is brief, offering very little help, and you won't find any 
 information in the game's "readme" documentation file, either. In fact, the only place you can 
 find information about the units is the in-game database, which is accessible only after launching 
 a mission. This is rather inconvenient, since you can't pause the game and study the unit data 
 at the same time. You'll have to use quite a bit of trial and error to learn all your units' abilities. 

  Even after you finally learn how to use all your units, you'll still grapple with the game's poorly 
 designed interface. In many of the game's missions, time is of the essence -- injured victims need 
 immediate medical treatment, and fires need to be kept under control. Unfortunately, Emergency 
 2 lacks some of the basic tools needed for players to efficiently control large numbers of units 
 in a real-time strategy game. Groups of units cannot be assigned to number keys, as in most real-time 
 strategy games. Orders can't be queued up. The game doesn't have keyboard shortcuts for common 
 functions, either. Units are scrambled to emergency sites from a special headquarters area, but 
 they must be sent one at a time -- the game offers no way to efficiently scramble multiple units 
 of the same type. What's more, the game's mouse control is imprecise, so even selecting units can 
 be something of a chore, especially when several of them are bunched together.  

  Fortunately, Emergency 2 offers plenty of challenging missions that require a good deal of creative 
 thinking to complete. However, the gameplay isn't as open-ended as it would seem -- the design often 
 requires players to find one or two specific tricks that the developers had in mind. At times, 
 the solutions end up being bizarre and almost Rube Goldberg-like in their design, but finding them 
 and executing them properly can be satisfying if you have enough patience to see them through. 

  Some players may enjoy trying to work out the puzzles of each scenario, while others might find 
 these aspects of the gameplay too frustrating. For instance, there are a number of missions that 
 require players to scour the map, looking for a hidden victim or criminals trying to escape. Trying 
 to find these individual entities on the large maps, which can cover acres of land, sometimes makes 
 the game seem more like  Where's Waldo  than an honest challenge. At other times, the game will 
 try to clue you in, telling you, for example, that a gas line needs to be shut off in order to 
 bring a fire under control. However, the game never tells you where to shut off the gas, so you're 
 forced to comb the map looking for anything that looks like a control box. As a result, you'll 
 find yourself restarting many missions from the beginning until you've finally learned all the 
 tricks and memorized all the key locations to complete that particular mission.  

  Emergency 2's graphics engine is more than adequate, creating large rural and city environments, 
 complete with believable vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The game's buildings feature a good 
 amount of detail and variety as well. It isn't possible to rotate the map, although the game will 
 display objects hidden behind buildings or trees when you mouse over them. The biggest problem 
 in the game's graphics occurs when you zoom in your view -- bringing the viewpoint in any closer 
 than the default setting turns the city into an ugly, pixelated mess. Thankfully, you'll spend 
 most of your time at the default view level, in order to better assess the situation.  

          Finding a tiny monkey in the midst of all those trees can tax your patience.     

  
 The game's sound effects aren't quite as polished as its graphics. The most common sounds you'll 
 hear are the sirens of your various emergency units, but over the course of a long play session, 
 the incessant, droning wail of the European-style sirens will get on your nerves. The voice acting 
 is also subpar, and whenever any character collapses from injury or exhaustion, you'll hear the 
 same man yelping in pain, even if the in-game character with the injury is female.  

  Overall, Emergency 2 is a game with a good premise and plenty of gameplay for the price. With a 
 little bit more polish, it could have been a great game for any real-time strategy fan looking 
 for a change of pace. Unfortunately, it falls short of its promise because of its lack of documentation 
 and its dated, clumsy interface.

Review:  The game's idea of creating a simulated emergency responder is a great idea. It shows the whole 
 effort and requirements and overall the total complicatedness when responding to major and minor 
 emergency calls. But the game is still a fatal production like it's predecessor it lacks in sound 
 effects, and the ones it actually has are not realistic. The interface and other controls are a 
 major hassle the constant switching between one window and the other becomes a nuisance after a 
 while. The graphics I must almost say seem to hit the top of the list in my rating though not the 
 best they still seem to have taken at least some thought of the developers. The overall game-play 
 is degrading it has no story line or any sort of time-line other than the pointless construction 
 at the HQ revealing new vehicles every once in a while. The whole click and command with the mouse 
 is not very well done either, half the time you mean for this to happen but can't go through with 
 it because some object or something is to close or in the way that is obscuring command/ action 
 options. Over all the game is underdeveloped for it's whole point and meaning!

Review:  This game is just a slight trade up from Emergency 1. Controls are cumbersome, sound effects are 
 non-existent, mission maps are unnecessary large ---where is there a need for huge piece of fam 
 land where its a city mission?? This leads to constant scrolling of the mouse in attempt to position 
 your units (ie. police car, fire engines, aambulances) . Also, the characters (ie. e policemen, fire 
 fighters) in the game are unusually small and with the already cumbersome controls, make it a headache 
 to control..... I am not exaggerating, I actually got a headache after completing one of the missions!
 
  
  Save your money, buy another game.

Review:  Theres not much to say about Emergency 2. The game play was pretty cool. how you had the home base 
 and were able to get hints. This hints weren't very helpful though. I got stuf on a few missions 
 and the game did tey to help but the help wasent dteailed enough for me to understand it. The sound 
 was ok. The mission I did get to were decent. The graphics are questionable though.
  
  This game needs alot of work to get above a 7. Or even a 6. This game could have relaly been a 
 solid 8 if it had the time and effort put into it. The wasent won of the games kids obesse over. 
 This game was average. Id give in a 6.3 or 6.5.
