:::Review:::
The games range from quite entertaining to downright stupid. 

 The makers of this entertaining but lightweight desktop diversion have really hit on an ideal formula: 
 By constructing a game based on lampooning the randomness, shallowness, and unoriginality of today's 
 workplace, they have freed themselves to release a game that is as random, shallow, and unoriginal 
 as what it's lampooning. Hey, so what if one of the ten included "games" has no real ending. That's 
 typical of the open-ended assignments in today's culture. So what if many of the games blatantly 
 rip off classics like Space Invaders, air hockey, and Donkey Kong... people in the workplace steal 
 ideas all the time. It's all part of the joke!  

 There is a rough structure to Dilbert's Desktop Games. It is your job to succeed in seven of the 
 ten different activities to earn parts that will upgrade Dilbert's Game Machine. Once you've succeeded 
 and the machine is functional, you get to... print out a certificate! (typical of corporate America's 
 pattern of under-recognizing a job well done) . The games range from quite entertaining (the Donkey 
 Kong-like Techno-Raiders, where you try to move from level to level, gathering donuts, while avoiding 
 contact with coworkers) to downright stupid (The Final Word, where you stamp classic Dilbert sayings 
 like "This has long day written all over it" onto your computer desktop, then print them out) . 
 For the most part, though, the games are just what they are advertised as: fun little diversions 
 to waste some time while you're at work.  

 While Dilbert's Desktop Games doesn't take itself too seriously, and therefore needn't be judged 
 too harshly, it was kind of disappointing given the innovative, cutting-edge, and ironic humor 
 of the actual Dilbert comic strip. It's my bet that Scott Adams, Dilbert's brilliant creator, was 
 nowhere to be found during the writing of this game, and therefore has learned an important corporate 
 lesson about blindly licensing out his product.

Review:  Dilberts desktop games (Dreamworks interactive, 1997) is just what the name says: A collection 
 of simple desktop games starring Dilbert, Dogbert and friends. It contains 9 games/toys, which 
 vary from entertaining to utter rubbish. When launched, a console pops up to your desktop and you 
 can choose your game/toy.
  
  The games as follows:
  
  1. Techno raiders
  In this game, you control Dilbert in an office environment and collect donuts and try to evade 
 your co-workers. Dilbert carries various gadgets and if a co-worker touches him, he loses one. 
 If Dilbert loses all his gadgets, the game ends. This game is like a platformer, but without any 
 jumping or whatnot. Dilbert can only hide, use elevators, scare co-workers and enter doors. Entertaining 
 for a while, mainly because of Dilberts 'witty' comments.
  
  2. Enduring fools
  This game turns your desktop into a territory of idiots. You control somekind of a zapper with 
 your mouse and try to fry the idiots. The game keeps a score of how many idiots you've zapped, 
 and how many idiots got away. This game entertained me for nearly two minutes. So, not very good.
 
  
  3. Elbonian airlines
  In this one, you control a slingshot with which you slingshoot people into the sky and try to make 
 them hit things like airplanes, balloons, islands and boats etc. Every time you shoot, Dogbert 
 makes some fun comment and the people shout something like 'Wheeeeee!' which is almost the only 
 thing that kept me entertained with this one. Stupid game.
  
  4. Boss evaders
  This is a Space invaders-clone, and by far the best game in the package. You control Dilbert, and 
 try to shoot the four heads that fly above you, throwing papers and shouting things like 'Status 
 report!' This is the crappiest Space invaders-clone I've seen. Only four enemies at a time, and 
 they move too slow.
  
  5. Can-O-Matic 2
  Next in line, is Can-O-matic. In this one you control a cannon, once again people up into the air. 
 Only this time, you try to hit various electronic gadgets. You have 25 shots in one game. This 
 kept me entertained for 25 shots, and I never touched it again.
  
  6. Project pass-off
  This one is kind of a table hockey. You control two people's hands, and try to score goals with 
 the assignments your boss keeps throwing on the table. In the beginning of the game, the screen 
 says 'One player mode' but I haven't been able to figure out how to set 2-player. Anyways, the 
 one player mode is too boring to interest me any longer than a minute or so.
  
  7. The Final word
  This isn't a game, it's just a toy. You control a huge stamper with your mouse, 
 and if you left mouse-click, it stamps your desktop. Right mouse-click changes the stamp. There 
 are 40 different stamps, and some actually made me laugh out loud. The texts include such phrases 
 as 'Doomed' and 'Urgent - Start ignoring this immediately.'
  
  8. The Jargonator
  This is just a toy too, but probably the most entertaining thing in this package. You can type 
 in something and choose from three alternatives; 'Make it sizzle', 'Punch it up' and 'Managerialize.' 
 
  
  Example: I typed in 'This is a test'
  Make it sizzle: 'This is a verification'
  Punch it up: 'This is genuinely a verification'
  Managerialize: 'This is a verification, so you 
 can see that increasingly a geographic
  dimension is unavoidable in scope determination.'
  Hehe, entertaining to do while IRCing or something ;)
  
  9. The CEO Simulator
  All of the 
 games are just a way to earn money for the real game, the CEO simulator. You have to CEO a firm 
 of somekind, and playing this only takes up a minute or two a day. I don't really know how this 
 works, because all the other games sucked so bad I didn't even want to try to collect sufficient 
 funds to test this one. :|
  
  Overall:
  The graphics in this game are pretty good, and the sound effects are hilarious. Gameplay is good, 
 and relatively easy since the games are so simple. However, the only game this is worth getting 
 for, is Boss evader. But, I recommend you download Space invaders or one of it's many clones instead. 
 But, the game being quite new (1997) , it works on WinXP without any problems or whatnot. However, 
 I recommend you don't waste money on this, unless you're a diehard Dilbert fan or a really REALLY 
 bored office-worker.
