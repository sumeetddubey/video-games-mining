A bit of advice: Save your cash and just download the shareware version of Raptor - you'll have 
 a lot more fun. 

 When Apogee released Raptor: Call of the Shadows in 1993, it was universally heralded as a genre-busting 
 action game. Before Raptor's release, PCs were snubbed as too "underpowered" to handle graphically 
 intense shooters, and console gamers took great pleasure in rubbing our noses in games like Keio 
 Flying Squadron and Super Turrican. However, Raptor's graphics and gameplay took the shooter genre 
 to a whole new level, and by allowing you to trade in cash for powerful new weapons, injected some 
 strategy as well.  

 Now, Raptor's core team has returned to bring us Demonstar. This game is basically a one-man show 
 - both the programming and art come from Raptor's lead designer, and the audio portion was performed 
 by Bobby Prince, Apogee's pet composer. But when you fire up Demonstar, it may leave you asking, 
 "Is this it?"  

 Demonstar is the most simplistic shooter you could ask for. As your tiny ship blasts through scrolling 
 starfields, dozens of nasties fly towards you on a collision course. Wiping out these enemies yields 
 helpful power-ups that enable bombs, phalanx lasers, and other destructive options. As you progress 
 through the 20-odd levels, the action escalates in its intensity, with faster enemies and projectiles 
 spewing all over the place. Chances are pretty good that you've played this type of game before, 
 and you won't experience anything new here.  

 But the biggest disappointment about Demonstar is how it can't even come close to equaling the original 
 Raptor. Aside from some stunning explosions, the graphics are amateurish at best, with little diversity 
 over the course of the 18 levels. The sound effects are nothing to write home about, and the music 
 is repetitive and dull. It would have been nice to trade in points to beef up your ship as in Raptor, 
 but no go - you're stuck pounding through from start to finish (without any save-game feature to 
 boot) .  

 You won't have to worry about death - thanks to a whopping 18 continues, even the most joystick-impaired 
 player can succeed admirably. But instead of challenging your reflexes, Demonstar tests your patience 
 - chances are good that you'll be voluntarily pressing Alt-F4 to quit long before you run out of 
 ships.   

 While Raptor ran in low-res VGA to keep the frame rate smooth on 486s, Demonstar ups the ante by 
 running in SVGA. There's a major trade-off: Demonstar always runs in a window, even if you're playing 
 in the so-called "full screen" mode (which simply crops out your desktop background with metallic 
 textures) . And while there is a two-player mode that lets you and a buddy take on the evil empire 
 at once, the box falsely advertises some sort of "Internet play." Sorry, it ain't in my version 
 - but I doubt that TCP/IP support could have helped this game much.  

 In short, Demonstar is an inadequate game, even though it is a bargain-priced title. A bit of advice: 
 Save your cash and just download the shareware version of Raptor - you'll have a lot more fun.

Review:  If you brothers on the PS2, the XBox can't read the disks, and there's nothing to eat in the fridge, 
 this can be a good game.
  
  It's pretty much just a basic blaster that you can never lose, which may play to your ego but can 
 also get dull.
  The graphics? One word - YUCK.
  
  Value? OK, so the game's OK. But don't push it. I wouldn't even pay $1 for this thing. It's only 
 good side is blasting stuff up, and the free download can provide that for you.
  
  Having not played this in ages (it was on a different computer) I', sort of starting to miss the 
 mindless, purposeless, unexplained shooting with no real 3D environment. But I'm extremely bored 
 right now, all the broadband is used up and everything is crawling along. I'd be desperate for 
 anything so much as a rubber chicken.
  
  The mindless shooting can be oddly satisfying in a boredom-buster way, but don't expect it to provide 
 a real buzz.

Review:  Here Is a game that will amaze you with space battles and play a game similiar to the Arcade ones. 
 This a little overview of the game:
  
  Gameplay:
  8.5/10 This does feature very intense battles and some challenging parts which make the game a 
 little more fun
  
  Graphics:
  5/10 hey this is a game thats not like our PS2 or XBOX games, even though it might have bad graphics 
 its still an enjoyable
  
  Sound:
  7/10 really because it doesnt resemble one of their made up sounds and feels very bland and dull 
 which takes away the fun.
  
  Value:
  6/10 because you would rather be better with Raptor but if you just wanna blast stuff then this 
 is the one.
  
  I d say this game is only for those who wanna have a ton of fun with some of our old school genres
