:::Review:::
Poseidon is as enjoyable as Zeus and suggests that Impressions' city-building series will just keep 
 getting better. 

  Last year's Zeus: Master of Olympus was the best game to date in Impressions' city-building series, 
 as it improved on the ideas of the Roman-themed Caesar games and their Egyptian counterpart, Pharaoh, 
 while adding new tasks and mechanics that made the game's formula more complex and enjoyable. Poseidon, 
 the official expansion for Zeus, doesn't include many new features, but it does include some significant 
 ones. The game is set in Atlantis, and the fantastical setting has allowed the designers to take 
 more creative license with the mission design. The result is as enjoyable as Zeus and suggests 
 that Impressions' city-building series will just keep getting better.           The hippodrome 
 is one of Poseidon's most significant additions.    

 The first city you will build in Poseidon is Atlantis itself, and the landscape is based on Plato's 
 description of the city as a series of concentric rings. Your primary goals are the same as in 
 previous city-building games: Build a prosperous city, establish trade with your neighbors, and 
 perform various tasks to please the gods. Each of these goals has been slightly altered for Poseidon. 
 The most basic change is the most obvious -- many of the buildings have been colored in shades of 
 blue. But Poseidon's changes are more than just superficial.   

  The most significant difference in the early part of the game is the lack of entertainment structures. 
 No longer will you need to build gymnasiums and theaters to keep your people happy. Instead, your 
 population will want to learn, and scientific outposts are needed so the city will grow. You'll 
 need to build bibliothekes, inventor's laboratories, observatories, and museums, as well as workshops 
 and universities to supply them with employees. The scientific structures play the same role as 
 entertainment structures did in Zeus, with one drawback: The yearly competitions have been removed, 
 and nothing has been included to replace them.   

  Most of the changes in Poseidon are this slight and subtle, and they're mostly just new features 
 that make only slight changes to the game, if any. For instance, there are several new ways to 
 beautify your city, including stone circles, orreries, and water parks. The residents of elite 
 housing need chariots instead of horses. There is a new food type available. And you can gather 
 and trade two new raw materials, black marble and orichalc.   

  The new raw materials are required for the building of pyramids, one of Poseidon's most significant 
 additions. The idea is from Pharaoh's expansion, Cleopatra, but the implementation is slightly 
 different. To build pyramids, you'll need a good supply of marble, black marble, wood, and orichalc. 
 The pyramids range from small to huge, and even if they aren't required elements of your city, 
 they are great for improving the appeal of neighborhoods. In addition to pyramids, you'll also 
 have to build wondrous structures such as special observatories and museums. These are basically 
 pyramids with another building on top. The new pyramids vary from campaign to campaign, and they 
 help keep things interesting.   

  The new materials are also used for creating the sanctuary to Poseidon, the only new sanctuary 
 in the game. Unfortunately, the previous sanctuaries haven't been changed to require the new materials. 
 While this makes them easier to build, it would have made for a nice aesthetic change if the sanctuaries 
 from Zeus could be adorned with the new materials. Nothing has been changed in terms of pleasing 
 the gods, and you'll still need to perform quests for them. To this end, two new heroes can be 
 summoned to your city: Bellephron and Atalanta.           You'll build pyramids to honor the gods. 
    

 The only other significant addition in Poseidon is the hippodrome. The hippodrome is a horse-racing 
 track that brings both money and happiness to your city. It can be as long as you like, though 
 building it is somewhat difficult. You must hold the cursor down and wait while the different track 
 segments cycle through. It's easy to get the wrong piece, and even easier to find that the track 
 won't fit in the area you've planned. This is especially frustrating when you've laid down a huge 
 track already, only to find your entire plan must be scrapped. The hippodrome is a great addition 
 to the city, but creating it is a chore.   

  Luckily, one of the previous game's biggest chores has been all but removed. Combat plays an almost 
 insignificant role in Poseidon, as for most of the game you'll be prevented from attacking other 
 cities because of a pact with the gods. You'll still need to keep a strong force at home in case 
 of invasion, but otherwise the conquest element of the game is almost entirely gone. This may frustrate 
 those who liked the combat elements of Zeus and its predecessors, but it helps alleviate the problem 
 of Zeus' subpar combat interface.   

  Even though there aren't very many of them, the additions in Poseidon are enough to revitalize 
 Zeus. You get to trade with cultures like the Maya (perhaps a hint of things to come) and create 
 great new structures. There are plenty of new campaigns and missions, and the new structures and 
 colors make the game look even more cheery than Zeus. It's enough to make you hope that Impressions 
 will pick an even more fantastic setting for the next installment in the series, but for now, Poseidon 
 is satisfying enough to add some life to one of the better strategy games of last year.

Review:  Okay. This game came out years ago. We have Next Gen titles coming at us in mass in 2006. Many 
 of them I already own. But yet, I am playing this game more than Oblivion and I will tell you why: 
 I cant help it
  
  There is something about the need to tweak the cities in just the right way that keeps me coming 
 back to this game years after its release. The graphics are a big part of it. They are rich and 
 colorful and in many ways more artistic than any Sim City to date. 
  
  The sound works its magic on you as well. The pouring of wine the sounds of animals and workers. 
 The atmosphere in this game is surprisingly rich. Building improve as in other sims, but something 
 about seeing your shabby shacks and dirt roads bloom into colorful cities with shining marble streets 
 is tremendously gratifying. 
  
  The gods add another tweak that adds a very different flavor to the game. Of course they protect, 
 they bless, and they curse, but their appearance is always entertaining and the voice acting is 
 illustrious. 
  
  My gripes: I wish it had weather and possibly a few more expansions and buildings to construct. 
 Its very much about balance more than research and I wish there was more advancement in the game.
 
  
  Bottom line: One of the most addictive and beautiful sims ever made. Buy it now.
