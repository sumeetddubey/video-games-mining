:::Review:::
A promising game bedeviled by several control problems and nagging design issues. 

 After having forged a respectable reputation in the air-combat simulation genre, it now appears 
 as if Digital Image Design - the makers of EF2000, F-22 Air Dominance Fighter, and Total Air War 
 - is heading off in a completely different direction with the release of Wargasm. No doubt looking 
 to crack the larger and obviously more lucrative mainstream market, Wargasm (WAR Ground Air Strike 
 Mission) represents the company's first foray into the action/strategy gaming genre, a promising 
 game bedeviled by several control problems and nagging design issues.  

 Set in the not-too-distant future, the nations of the world have supposedly sworn off the pain and 
 anguish associated with modern mobile warfare and have instead decided to settle their collective 
 differences in cyberspace via the all-new World Wide War Web (WWWW) . The WWWW has been created 
 by the world's top programmers to look and feel like a battlefield, a war zone complete with different 
 types of terrain and real-world environments and dotted with all sorts of civilian installations, 
 fortifications, and various military compounds.   

 Similar in many respects to Battlezone, Urban Assault, and Uprising, Wargasm is another entry in 
 the hybrid action/strategy genre, meaning that it combines the tactical and strategic elements 
 of traditional real-time strategy games with the frenzied gameplay of today's typical 3D shooter. 
 So while you can command your forces from a top-down perspective, you can, if you so choose, watch 
 the action unfold from the ground level by hopping into and controlling any of the ground and air 
 units in your charge.   

 You begin each scenario by selecting your battle group from a finite number of units, deciding how 
 many infantryman, armored personnel carriers, tanks, and helicopters will be placed within your 
 "Webspace" in order to accomplish your immediate objectives. Next, you must then choose which predefined 
 entry point will serve as your forces' starting location, taking into consideration the mission 
 goals, terrain, and locale of each objective. Once the entry point has been determined, the battle 
 group is deployed en masse at the entry point and, for better or worse, sometimes seconds away 
 from an opening engagement with the enemy. While this heightens the overall experience and adds 
 a sense of impending peril to every situation, I can't for the life of me figure out why you aren't 
 given the opportunity to deploy your forces prior to the start of a mission or why you are unable 
 to split up your forces so that they arrive at multiple entry points. Bear in mind that once a 
 scenario begins it usually takes a couple of minutes to assess the battlefield and assign each 
 unit its waypoint orders. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to issue specific orders 
 to a unit - such as patrol a region or defend a critical installation - or have them seek cover 
 when a firefight erupts. Worse still, the group command seems ungainly given the current state 
 of game design, and because the units start out bunched together in a tight formation, oftentimes 
 they require multiple orders before they set off in differing directions.   

 From a game-playing standpoint, Wargasm is certainly one of the more demanding combat simulations 
 available today, requiring intense concentration, physical as well as mental dexterity, and incredible 
 patience to emerge victorious. All too often, the typical battle devolves into a brutal slugfest, 
 with you haphazardly jumping around from unit to unit attempting to engage and destroy the enemy 
 instead of making the best use of your available forces. And given the nature and intensity of 
 the conflict, the incorporation of multiple points of view within a vehicle leads to a situation 
 known as "work overload," whereby you have to wear too many hats and fulfill far too many functions 
 to succeed.   

 Furthermore, from a ground-level perspective, it isn't always clear when you are driving the vehicle 
 and when you are operating its guns. In retrospect, it probably would've made more sense to incorporate 
 all of the vehicular functions within a singular crew station, thereby alleviating the need to 
 constantly shift back and forth between the crew positions and removing some of the guesswork as 
 to what system is, in fact, being operated. I was also stymied by some of the weaponry's effects. 
 For instance, an infantryman can raze barbed-wire obstacles with sweeping machinegun fire, but 
 a tank isn't able to destroy a simple tank trap or dragon's teeth with its cannon.   

 And then there's the user interface. For some reason, you are limited to using one of five predefined 
 controller sets, unable to remap or reconfigure the individual key and joystick commands as in 
 the typical 3D shooter. Again, this leads to some confusing situations where it isn't always clear 
 which key or joystick command is used to aim and fire the weaponry and which controls movement. 
 Furthermore, to move from unit to unit, you must return to the tactical map, locate the unit you 
 wish to control, then double-click on it, a tedious procedure that has a pronounced impact on gameplay 
 and leads to more confusion. I'm not sure exactly why the designers opted to go with this method 
 for commanding and controlling, but suffice it to say the end result leaves a lot to be desired. 

 So, while Wargasm manages to capture the intensity and flavor of tactical-level firefights, and 
 marks the debut of Digital Image Design's especially impressive 3-Dream graphics technology, the 
 clumsy interface and frenetic gameplay undermine what could have been an extraordinary real-time 
 wargame.

Review:  Before anything, you need to get the Control Patch as Wargasm is the ultimate PITA without it. 
 With it, it's far more tolerable (although far from perfect) .
  
  DiD was too far ahead of themselves with the drop into anywhere 1st/3rd person combat strategy 
 game, and I'm sure the sales showed (I loved their F22/AWACS simulator) . Let's face it, Wargasm 
 sucks as a strategy game. And the weapons and heafty amount of ammo is unrealistic.
  
  But damn it is fun! I must have wasted way too much time on this game, and my wife knows it!
 
  
  I love to just take 1 unit like a tank or special forces (with LAWs or remote detonation bombs) 
 and see what I can blow up before I get blown up myself. And when I die, I just get another. It's 
 not realism, and its certainly a time-waster, but it's just damn fun, so that's why I play.
  
  I have a P3-866MHz with a Voodoo3 16MB AGP card (also with 512MB RAM, 40GB HD and running Windows 
 98 SE) as a retro gaming box and this is one game that gets the most time on it (along with Freespace 
 2 and Independent War 2) .
  
  Oh yeah, the classical music selection does set a good mood. It's only limitedly dynamic, but it 
 still fits when driving a tank or sneaking up on one! It's now hard to find and I scratched my 
 original, but I found it on eBay.
  
  Definitely NOT a game you want for a challenge or to complete as the gameplay/endgame is rather 
 stupid. But just to take some tanks or special forces and pick up some extra LAWs and blow crap 
 up -- it's definitely THE ORIGINAL.
  
  If you want more real strategy and realistic action, then I suggest Operation Flashpoint 1985 with 
 all the patches and the countless user missions out there (which means avoid the Xbox version, 
 ge the PC version) . Yes, the graphics are dated on Operation Flashpoint, but it's still fun.
