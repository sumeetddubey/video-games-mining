:::Review:::
The Price of Loyalty does one thing really well - it diversifies the missions. 

 Last year's was an excellent turn-based strategy game, an underappreciated little gem marked by 
 its originality. It didn't try to be Civilization or Master of Orion. Heroes II was its own game, 
 far better than the original Heroes, and featured a great mix of combat and resource planning, 
 a beautiful operatic score, and even some touches of humor - such as the Vampires exclaiming "Blah!" 
 when attacking. The only problem with Heroes II was that it tended to get a bit monotonous because 
 the missions had basically the same objective over and over - find the resources, eliminate your 
 opponent. Mind you, the "same thing" in this case was great fun, but once you found a few useful 
 strategies the challenge was minimized.  

  first expansion pack for Heroes II, The Price of Loyalty, does one thing really well - it diversifies 
 the missions. The expansion was developed by , the same folks who created the add-on for . The 
 two full campaigns included, as well as the two mini-campaigns (totaling 24 new campaign missions) , 
 feature some great new mission types that will force even the most stalwart hero to rethink his 
 strategies. There are missions with time limits, missions where you can't build any castles and 
 must rely upon hiring creatures at various locales, and missions in which the resources are clustered 
 in spots across the map, making it nearly impossible to have access to everything you need without 
 some haggling at the marketplace. And thankfully New World Computing didn't follow the "make it 
 impossible" trend of most add-ons: Heroes II vets will find this a suitable, but not insurmountable, 
 challenge.  

 Unfortunately, the diversity is this add-on pack's only notable strength. There are a few nice additions 
 - the ability to hire a wider variety of creatures outside of your castle, a selection of new artifacts, 
 and some new building types scattered across the map - but there's a noticeable lack of anything 
 that really changes the gameplay. Only the Necromancer gets a new castle upgrade (the Evil Shrine, 
 which enhances his ability to raise the dead) , and there are no new monster upgrades or spells 
 to augment the other heroes' arsenals. The Price of Loyalty also includes some new music (which 
 is great) and some new heroes, but unless you're really attached to the first game this probably 
 won't be much of a deciding factor.  

 Of course, more of a good thing is still more of a good thing, and those who've finished Heroes 
 II but don't want to spend the dozen or so hours necessary to complete a multiplayer game will 
 find The Price of Loyalty a solid method of prolonging the experience. But for those who are still 
 trudging through the original campaigns, there's not much here to make it a necessary purchase 
 until you've finished.

Review:  Heroes of Might and Magic II: The Succession Wars was a brilliant game, and it improved upon the 
 original Heroes of Might and Magic. Cyberlore studios was given the task of creating an expansion 
 for Heroes II, and The Price of Loyalty was born.
  
  Price of Loyalty is split into four campaigns, two campaigns are just as large as the original 
 Heroes II campaigns, while the other two are fairly short four mission campaigns. The first large 
 one, The Price of Loyalty, which the expansion is named after (obviously) is set in the north lands 
 where an Empire has been betrayed by a talented commander. As an old friend of the traitor, and 
 talented in your own right, you are tasked by your superiors to pursue the traitor, and at the 
 same time race against him in order to recover some powerful artifacts.
  
  The second large campaign, Descendants, centers on quite a few generations of a Barbarian family. 
 It begins with a single man struggling to unite the northern Barbarian tribes, and chronicles how 
 that family came into conflict with a rival family thus starting a war.
  
  The first mini campaign, The Voyage Home, chronicles one of the journeys of a knight named Gallant. 
 When his ship is wrecked he is forced to survive on an island, and build up his forces for the 
 journey home. Along the way he runs into pirates, and when he finally reaches home he finds that 
 it has been plunged into a civil war.
  
  The second mini-campaign, and the final campaign included in the expansion, Wizards Isle, focuses 
 around you trying to gain control of a mystical island that has sprung up in the middle of the 
 ocean. You're forced to combat the heroes of your rivals with heroes of your own as you try to 
 find the fabled Fount of Wizardry .
  
  The campaigns are very well made, and none of them are the same. They also feature very unique 
 missions, so they are definitely worth playing. Besides the new campaigns PoL adds even more standard 
 game scenarios, and like the old ones the new scenarios are also very well made, and quite memorable.
 
  
  The graphics are the same, but the audio includes some new tracks for each faction's towns. I liked 
 the new town themes over the original ones, but some of the purists did not approve of the new 
 tracks.
  
  The Price of Loyalty is not really anything more than some new campaigns, and scenarios. If you 
 liked the Heroes II campaigns and scenarios, though, The Price of Loyalty is definitely worth tracking 
 down. It may just be easier to track down a copy of Heroes II Gold, instead, however.
