:::Review:::
It's suitable for those who like side scrollers but are looking for more puzzles and less action. 
 

  Monkey Brains is a cartoon-style game that combines side-scrolling action and puzzle-game elements. 
 It is one of the first episodic games to be distributed by ARUSH Entertainment, and if you are 
 interested in trying the game, you can download the first installment for free, and then download 
 additional episodes for a small fee.   

          You'll have to command mind-controlled monkeys to do your bidding.      

  While the 
 game's simple graphics and sound are unlikely to impress anyone, Monkey Brains features interesting 
 game mechanics that correspond with the game's background story. You assume the role of Dr. Simius, 
 an injured scientist trapped on an island. To stop his evil partner, Dr. Kreep, from using a dangerous 
 mind-control technology, Dr. Simius must travel across the island and destroy the remaining mind-control 
 machines. Travel is difficult, though, since he is confined to a wheelchair, and there are a variety 
 of challenging levels in his way. To make it through the levels, Dr. Simius must control a group 
 of monkeys and have them pull levers, climb ropes, press buttons, and perform a wide variety of 
 actions to help him complete his mission.   

  Monkey Brains uses simple 2D graphics, but the animations are amusing and colorful. The music in 
 the game is pleasant, but it can get repetitive, especially on the harder levels in which you must 
 spend time figuring out the puzzle solutions. The sound effects used in the game are appropriate 
 and, combined with the music, give the game a fun, cartoonlike feel.   

  The basic game mechanics involve guiding monkeys through side-scrolling levels, complete with traps, 
 enemies, and puzzles. The traps and enemies in the game are nonlethal, but they do reduce the overall 
 monkey health bar found at the bottom of the screen. When the health gets to zero, the game is 
 over, so you must replenish health by collecting bananas and fruit.   

  In addition to the typical side-scrolling game mechanics, Monkey Brains adds the ability to switch 
 control between monkeys so that if a door is controlled by an inaccessible lever on the other side, 
 it's possible to take control of a different monkey and go around another way. Most of the puzzles 
 in the game operate on this principle so you must use teamwork among the monkeys to complete the 
 objectives. Some puzzles require more complicated maneuvers: For example, you'll start off controlling 
 one monkey, which you'll use to throw another monkey across a pit -- and then you'll switch control 
 in midair to the other monkey, which will have to grab hold of a hanging vine.   

  Other puzzles require that you press a series of buttons, which let you open doors or get monkeys 
 to move rocks or bounce on beds to get to a higher perch. Some of the levels are fairly amusing -- one 
 puzzle in the big-top area requires monkeys to load themselves into circus cannons and shoot themselves 
 across the screen, and there are areas within the levels that are filled with monkey-eating Venus 
 flytraps and ponds full of enormous goldfish ready to gobble up (and later spit out) swimming monkeys. 
   

  One notable shortcoming in the game is the lack of an adjustable difficulty level. Most of the 
 game's puzzles are geared toward average players, but some can be fairly challenging. The game 
 provides simple hints and tips that scroll across the bottom of the page occasionally, but these 
 seem to relate to the game as a whole rather than the specific level or puzzle you're involved 
 in.   

          The game features a two-player split-screen mode.      

  The game includes a cooperative two-player split-screen mode as well as a head-to-head two-player 
 battle mode. The cooperative mode lets two players help one another through the game's levels, 
 while in battle mode, you try to be the first to destroy each other's mind-control machine. These 
 add some variety to the gameplay and can be fun for two people to play on the same computer, but 
 they don't significantly increase the value of the game as a whole.   

  Overall, Monkey Brains is a game that's suitable for those who like side scrollers but are looking 
 for more puzzles and less action. The graphics and sound are adequate, many of the levels and puzzles 
 can be entertaining, and the game mechanics add a bit of a twist.

Review:  If you like confusing puzzles and no cool voices then you have to be a idiot to play this game. 
 but to be honest its not much of a killing or destroying game and the name of the game makes no 
 sense. but seeing how this was going to be like that great game gruntz, i don't blame them for 
 making this mistake. all companys always make one or more bad games. so play this game if you want, 
 im not going to stop you, but im never playing that game again.... ok maybe i might, once i find 
 something good about the game. well thats it for my review don't forget to watch the avgn. he's 
 a great reviewer how allways gets to the point of things. wow i still have to say more words. well 
 my next review will be long and good to read. that game is 3D ultra thrillride but im not going 
 to tell you when you just have to wait.
