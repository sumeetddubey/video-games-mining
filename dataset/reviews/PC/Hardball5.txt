:::Review:::
Once you get used to having the pitch coming right at you, you're prepared to tackle the most playable 
 baseball sim on the shelves today. 

 The Hardball series has always divided sports game buffs into two camps. Are you a stats freak, 
 desperate for absolute accuracy and faithful statistical representation of all players? Or are 
 you an arcade/action type, more interested in jacking towering homers, making diving catches and 
 stealing multiple bases?  

 If you are the latter, I'm sure you've been looking forward to Hardball 5. Hardball titles have 
 long been known for beautiful graphics and fast, exciting gameplay. In this respect, Hardball 5 
 does not disappoint. This baseball game is as colorful, easy to use, high-scoring and fast-paced 
 as you will find this side of a Sony Playstation.  

 In previous iterations, all this fun came at the expense of statistical tracking and realism. Hardball 
 5 addresses both issues. The game generates piles of statistics, broken down by league, team, or 
 positionenough to satiate all but the hardest of hardcore stat lovers. (If you think you 
 need more stats, you really need to get out more.) In addition, Accolade has added even greater 
 manager-level control over your team. You can easily adjust your team's onfield characteristicstell 
 em to run, hit for average, or swing for the fenceswithout having to get your hands 
 dirty and do anything yourself.  

 The on-field graphics in Hardball 5 are nothing to write home about. In fact, fielding in the outfield 
 can get a little tricky from time to time in large part because of them. It's the actual pitcher/batter 
 interface screen, though, that is this title's crown jewel. Great perspective, huge players and, 
 most importantly, a huge strike zone make the process of hitting the ball a terrific blend of challenge 
 and viewpoint. Once you get used to having the pitch coming right at you (not as difficult as many 
 people think) , you're prepared to tackle the most playable baseball sim on the shelves today.

Review:  I spent many an hour playing HardBall 5 as an early teenager. I actually purchased the first game 
 at an old Babbages in our local super-regional mall in 1995. 
  
  Upon loading the game into my old 286 Acer computer I was absolutely blown away by the graphics, 
 the commentary, and the over all playability of this terrific title. I was amazed at the MLBPA's 
 allowance of using real names, players and their faces in respect to the title. Also more exciting 
 was the age-old ability to modify the statistics of your favorite player so they would always hit 
 a homerun every time.
  
  I was actually shocked when Accolade released HardBall 5 v2.0. This "new" game added a few new 
 features based off of the 1997 season such as Interleague play and updated stats. However it was 
 still frustrating because you could not add any new teams; such as the then-new Arizona Diamondbacks 
 or the then Tampa Bay Devil Rays (now the Tampa Bay Rays) . It was also a little frustrating because 
 at the time in 1997 the Milwaukee Brewers had jumped leagues and was placed in the new 6-team National 
 League Central division.
  
  The commentary was great for its time. Al Michaels supplied the voiceover for the play by play 
 action and thus added a great background for this game.
  My favorite ability was the play with the Legends and the Immortal teams in the Legends League. 
 With this portion of the game playing, you could step back in time and play in hallowed and heavenly 
 grounds such as the Baker Bowl, Ebbets Field, Yankee Stadium in 1927, Sportsman Park and others. 
 Along with that you could suit up as one of dozens of immortal players such as Lou Gehrig, Babe 
 Ruth, Dizzy Dean, Jackie Robinson and others.
  28 full rendered baseball stadiums with information, layouts and dimensions made for a non-stop 
 baseball experience. 
  
  A must-buy for those who are nostalgic or those who enjoy a step back into old gaming.
