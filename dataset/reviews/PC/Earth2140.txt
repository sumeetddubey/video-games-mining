:::Review:::
Although it desperately clings to the precepts espoused by most real-time wargames, Earth 2140 shouldn't 
 be quickly dismissed as just another Command & Conquer retread. 

 The explosion of real-time wargames - particularly those set in a rather bleak, postapocalyptic 
 future - has coincidentally served to dampen the spirit of most strategy gamers. Even the more 
 ardent aficionados have been left cross-eyed by the dizzying array of titles now being released, 
 as they vainly attempt to cull the choice collectibles from the rest of the look-alikes spread 
 out across store shelves. Fed a steady diet of Command &amp; Conquer clones, it's no wonder that 
 many players have taken a wait-and-see attitude before settling on the supposed next-generation 
 champions, lingering reservations about freshness and unique gameplay continually toying with the 
 consciousness and pocket book of the average player.   

 Interplay's Earth 2140 seizes upon this common real-time thread, portraying a polarized world split 
 largely along geopolitical lines. In one corner we have the conspicuously named United Civilized 
 States (UCS) , comprised largely of the Western Hemisphere and key areas of Western Europe and North 
 Africa. In the opposite corner struts the Eurasian Dynasty (ED) , which, naturally enough, engulfs 
 the Asian and Eastern European world. As we soon learn, the sanctity of our once noble world has 
 been severely compromised, irradiated by countless nuclear detonations and scarred by incalculable 
 destruction thanks to another mindless world war unfettered by the ignorant concept of mutual assured 
 destruction. As a result, both factions have had to resort to constructing huge underground civilizations, 
 occasionally reemerging on the desolate surface to extract precious minerals and other important 
 natural resources, which can only be found on the planet's crust. By the year 2140, both sects 
 now realize that the time has finally come to lay claim to the world's remaining dwindling resources 
 if they ever hope to survive the perpetual holocaust blanketing the planet.   

 Both in-game and background graphics are breathtaking, embedding the powerful visual appeal of advanced, 
 fully realized weaponry and structures with cutting edge special effects. Mission briefings are 
 stylistically rendered, seemingly borrowed from the cold cyber-soldier perspective evinced in Terminator. 
 Units and structures are fully animated, replete with turning turrets and twisting torsos all recklessly 
 unleashing a torrent of hell-raising flame and fury. Unfortunately, the color scheme for the ED 
 units blends into the background on both the strategic and tactical windows, making them very difficult 
 to discern amidst the unsettling lush green backdrop depicted in certain missions. Likewise, text 
 displayed in the information panel is equally hard to decipher, the soft red and green hues used 
 to identify objects mismatched amidst the brilliantly defined interface.   

 The pacing of the missions is rather clumsily choreographed. For instance, the first four missions 
 on the UCS side involve the routine destruction of penny packets of enemy units. In the fifth mission 
 though, you are immediately thrust into a "kill or be killed" setting, your small ragtag force 
 of assorted units and supporting structures beset by an unremitting drove of ED forces. As a result, 
 the stepped-up sequence of slowly immersing you into the overall framework of the game is critically 
 compromised.   

 Beyond the aesthetics and rudimentary features, Earth 2140 introduces a rather unique mechanism 
 surreptitiously dubbed a "Virtual General." In effect, you can group together various units, then 
 hand them off to a computer-controlled assistant who will lead them in either a defensive or offensive 
 manner, determined at the outset by you. Frankly, because situations can fluctuate in a minute's 
 notice, there is hardly any need to actually employ this option - it's far more useful to retain 
 control over every unit in an effort to meet both short- and long-term mission goals.   

 Although the game desperately clings to the precepts espoused by most real-time wargames, Earth 
 2140 shouldn't be quickly dismissed as just another Command &amp; Conquer retread. Clever innovations 
 - such as the Virtual General - some rather remarkably crafted segues and mission briefings, and 
 the employment of 22 dissimilar unit types for each warring faction help to distinguish this game 
 from all the other C &amp; C clones that have glutted the market. Unfortunately, once these subtle 
 nuances are stripped away from the titillating veneer, you will readily discover the all-too-familiar 
 battle doctrine of "building and killing units faster than your opponent" still morosely bubbles 
 to the surface. And, when you consider all of the other real-time wargames that have capitalized 
 on this somewhat tired theme, you begin to realize just how much of an impact the Command &amp; 
 Conquer phenomenon has had in reshaping the computer gaming industry. Enjoy, but be advised that 
 Earth 2140 is just another sheep in wolf's clothing.

Review:  Earth 2140 was cool for that time.. I mean I could even run it on my Windows 3.1 version with pimped 
 video & sound cards. Still the graphics were lots better then the games that came out around that 
 time. The sound track was great... but you'll experience lots of problems with your mouse, it has 
 to be 100% Microsoft compatible, so no Logitech or other types. The sound track in the game was 
 great, always looping and no interruptions if your pc starts working slower. When I was playing 
 I got stuck at the 2nd or 3rd lvl already because it was almost impossible to defend yourself from 
 the enemy (who was attacking your base) on easy difficulty setting. I gave the graphics an 8 because 
 I compared it to the games during that time.
