:::Review:::
Veterans of the You Don't Know Jack series will be instantly at home with the gameplay. 

 We've all heard the old saying: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Berkeley Systems has apparently 
 taken this advice to heart with the release of You Don't Know Jack Volume 3.  

 Of course, it's hard to argue with success. When You Don't Know Jack first made its appearance in 
 1995, it was rightfully hailed by critics and gamers alike for its dead-on gameplay, intelligent 
 questions, and irreverent atmosphere. Volume 3 of You Don't Know Jack keeps all of these features 
 intact and makes only minor adjustments to this proven formula.  

 Veterans of the You Don't Know Jack series will be instantly at home with the gameplay. One to three 
 players compete for cash by answering a series of seven or 21 questions. But of course this isn't 
 just any normal trivia game: You choose from categories like "Would You Like To Touch My Primate?" 
 and answer outrageous questions on subjects ranging from medieval warfare to the popular sitcom 
 Friends. The entire package is punctuated by cheesy music, wicked commentary, and enough insults 
 for three more Beavis and Butthead movies.  

 There are a few minor additions to the mix this time around. Bizarre guest hosts make appearances 
 during the game, and there's a new type of question called a ThreeWay in which you try to associate 
 a clue with one of three words. (As an aside, the ThreeWay is the first true dud of the You Don't 
 Know Jack series; the associations are often stretches, and the woman squealing "Yes!" each time 
 you get an answer correct grates on the ears, especially after the seventh time.) You Don't Know 
 Jack Volume 3 is also a bit more subdued in its tone than its more hectic predecessors: Colors 
 are softer, the music is more laid back, and the game atmosphere seems less chaotic than previous 
 volumes.  

 All of these changes are obviously minor ones, and none of them affects the gameplay significantly; 
 Berkeley knows that it has a winning formula. Perhaps it's best to leave well enough alone. In 
 any case, You Don't Know Jack Volume 3 is a superior trivia game, and fans of the series certainly 
 won't be disappointed.

Review:  Sometimes, games are worth repeating. And this is an example of one of those games.
  
  Using the formula that worked for the original You Don't Know Jack , Volume 3 asks more hularious 
 questions, has some great background tunes, and some great lines.
  
  This is the sort of game that's perfect for when friends come over. From everything of screws and 
 sarcastic remarks, despite the fact that this is a formula that's been used before, it works.
 
  
  Though it's a little short on graphics, the funny lines that go along with everything make you 
 laugh. And thanks to the 3-Way bonus, it makes the game all that more fun. With categories that 
 make you laugh your brains off, this game delivers.
  
  All it takes is a keyboard, a computer, and a few friends, and you have yourself one of the greatest 
 'gameshow-style' games ever. Volume Three works with the original, tweaks the forumula just a tiny 
 bit, and gives you yet another stellar game.
