:::Review:::
The payoff is never as heavy as the suspense and definitely not worth the amount of time spent figuring 
 out the solutions. 

 For those of you who feel that the cute, bouncing animals and half-baked storylines of today's gaming 
 world are an insult to your intelligence, then I've got just the game for you. In fact, if you 
 are the type of person who spends his free time hacking the security system at the State Department, 
 then Syn-Factor may be right up your alley.  

 Syn-Factor is a deep space first-person whodunnit in the mold of Myst or Buried in Time, where you 
 are a ship's techie saddled with the task of uncovering an intergalactic mystery and aided only 
 by a computer chip implanted in your brain. From the start aboard the suddenly abandoned I. S. T. 
 Rident to the explosive conclusion, the game asks you to use found objects, people you meet, and 
 your own wits to make your way through space. Sounds exciting, huh? Maybe if you're Stephen Hawking... 

 As if to prove itself a thinking-man's game, Syn-Factor is almost entirely made up of intellectual 
 solutions to its problems, featuring such white-knuckled action sequences as hacking thermostatic 
 computers; inputting proper coordinates to create spacial wormholes for intergalactic travel; overmagnetizing 
 your credit computer to gain extra conduits; reading through old logs, Coleridge poems, and computer 
 core-dumped muck for passwords; rerouting elevator source power... and more! This game should have 
 a special online multiplayer battle zone reserved for computer programmers, English professors, 
 and electricians. In fact, many of the solutions are so obscure that you are forced to resort to 
 the old "pass the mouse over every part of the screen and hope something lights up" style of play. 
 Thankfully, there is an included hint feature and your trusty Syn-implant helps you out along the 
 way.  

 Syn-Factor is a pretty-good-looking game, and the atmosphere and music create the appropriate sense 
 of foreboding. The controls are smooth, simple, and intuitive, and the storyline keeps you interested 
 in reaching a conclusion. Unfortunately, the payoff is never as heavy as the suspense and definitely 
 not worth the amount of time spent figuring out the solutions.   

 While Syn-Factor has its heart in the right place - there are definitely too many games featuring 
 reflex action and violence and not enough involving using your brains - it may have pushed the 
 envelope on just how many complex mathematical solutions we want to come up with before we get 
 to bash someone in the head with a pipe. While I'm as much of a computer geek as the next guy, 
 I don't need a game to challenge my computer expertise. If I want to fiddle around with a computer... 
 I'll just fiddle around on my own.

Review:  Some believe having a chip implanted in your head will be a sign of the end of the world. In this 
 game, it may be the only thing that will save you.
  
  Armed with the special scanning power of this device, your ID card and very little else, you must 
 roam the IST Rident (cute) to figure out a looming mystery. What is at the heart of the ship's 
 power drive? Where are you headed and why? Is the mission beneficial to humanity, or could it spell 
 our doom?
  
  The story plays like a quirky take on an Asimov novel. You spend a lot of time exploring the ship 
 and dismantling traps in your way. Keep a notepad next to you, it will save you a lot of continues.
 
  
  Despite the demanding pull of the game in terms of hours and complication, I loved it. You don't 
 get too many titles that combine the thrill of mystery with the rarified joys of serious science 
 fiction.
  
  Long live Istvan Pely.
