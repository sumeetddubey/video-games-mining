The very things that make it unique and interesting are also the source of some of its most frustrating 
 aspects. 

 Outwars is a game stuck on the horns of a dilemma: The very things that make it unique and interesting 
 are also the source of some of its most frustrating aspects.  

 The setup for Outwars is part Starship Troopers, part Aliens. At an unspecified time in the future, 
 an alien race has begun ravaging several of Earth's colonial outposts. As a member of the Colonial 
 Defense Force's Marine Jump Corps, you've been assigned the task of putting an end to the raids 
 - but as the game opens, your intensive training on how to use the Jump Corps' standard-issue jetpack 
 becomes a baptism by fire when alien ships arrive and start dropping an invasion force right in 
 the CDF's own back yard. Yep, they're bugs all right - extremely big bugs armed with some pretty 
 strange weapons.  

 But you've got some big-league firepower at your disposal, too - everything from pulse rifles and 
 Gauss cannons to flamethrowers, guided and unguided missiles, and several types of mines. And because 
 many of the bugs can't fire upward, your jetpack can help you maneuver past enemy concentrations 
 and launch attacks from new directions or reach the relative safety of a plateau. And a newly discovered 
 "glider wing" technology lets you fly for nearly unlimited amounts of time (though I'm not sure 
 what's so futuristic about something that's little more than a hang glider...) .  

 At first glance, Outwars seems to have all the requisite ingredients for a first-rate action game. 
 You get to choose what type of combat suit you'll wear, and the weapons loadout is up to you as 
 well. There's a good variety of mission types here, ranging from full-scale attacks to desperate 
 evacuations requiring you to hold off hordes of bugs with only a teammate or two to assist you. 
 The Direct3D terrain graphics are nicely rendered, and the animation is impressively smooth even 
 on a lower-end machine (until you get four or five bugs simultaneously onscreen, that is) .   

 
 Without the jetpacks, Outwars would be just another run-and-gun shooter - but it's the jetpacks 
 that can cause a lot of frustration, especially at the start of the game. Yes, it's great being 
 able to use the jetpack to avoid enemy fire and find your way to those hard-to-reach spots, and 
 it's also a treat to deal death from above during a hot firefight. But instead of letting the jetpack 
 complement gameplay, the designers made it the focal point of the action - and the result is that 
 intense combat is too often replaced with platform hopping. What this means, at least for the first 
 several missions, is that you'll often wind up missing a platform and falling to your death.  

 
 The problem is that these jetpacks aren't as high tech as they're made out to be: They have only 
 enough fuel to keep you aloft for a few seconds at a time (they do recharge after a short period, 
 though) . I don't mind dying in combat - and that'll happen a lot, too, especially from the midgame 
 on - but dying because I ran out of gas isn't quite as noble an end as I'd like. Considering how 
 tricky landings can be at first (unless you switch to an MDK-style third-person perspective, which 
 is somewhat lousy for actual combat) , there's really no need to aggravate things by giving you 
 such a short amount of air time. Personally, I'd prefer an unlimited supply of jetpack fuel, but 
 at the very least an advanced device like this should work better than something Robert Goddard 
 could have designed.  

 You might not find the limited fuel or hippity-hoppity missions as annoying as I initially did - 
 and even I've got to admit that I eventually got used to it. But Outwars doesn't reach its full 
 potential for a couple of other reasons. Take the idea of leading a squad, for instance. On many 
 missions you'll have a couple of marines under your command, but all you can tell them to do is 
 stay put, attack, withdraw, or join up with you. What's more, you can only issue global team commands, 
 eliminating the ability to have one team member guard a position while another goes on the attack 
 with you. And if you notice that a buddy's taken damage, you can't order him to pick up one of 
 the medkits lying around - and wounded team members don't have the common sense to pick up medkits 
 on their own.  

 You'd think that going up against these big bugs might send a shiver or two down your spine, but 
 until you get deep into the game and start seeing some new insects, the truth is they actually 
 look a little silly. It doesn't help matters that the graphics for an exploding bug are a mass 
 of red and green pixels (yes, even with 3D support enabled) , or that the graphics for weapons fire 
 - both yours and the enemy's - are, for lack of a better word, uninspiring. I don't know about 
 you, but when I use a flamethrower on a bug I want to hear some screams and see him dance around 
 as he burns to a crisp; instead, all you see is its health bar go down.  

 Even with these shortcomings, though, there's a lot of fun to be had here, so long as you're patient 
 and don't mind hearing Aliens-style cliches over and over again during battle. Some of the level 
 design for enclosed places like tunnels and aboard ships is excellent, and the game is pretty great 
 in multiplayer mode - it's pretty latency-tolerant, and the free-for-all games combine the tension 
 of a cat-and-mouse duel with the high-octane pyrotechnics action hounds crave.   

 In the end, Outwars is a good game that almost achieves greatness: It's definitely worth trying, 
 and you might even wind up loving it. Give it a few tweaks here and there, though, and the sequel 
 could move undisputedly into the top echelon of action games.

Review:  Outwars was the first game I ever played that pretty much required the keyboard/mouse control scheme. 
 It took me awhile to get used to, but once I did I never looked back. Obviously game developers 
 didn't either.
  
  This game could be called a precurser to Giants: Citizen Kabuto in that it was a third-person sci-fi 
 shooter that required a combination of run &amp; gun and some very frustrating precision jumping, 
 made slightly more bearable by the inclusion of a rocket pack. You could also choose a small mech 
 suit for each mission, a decision based on whether you wanted quickness, ample jetpack fuel, or 
 heavy artillery. The plot was so flimsy and generic that I remember none of it besides the gruff, 
 faux military briefings for each level. Still, I had never played anything like it, especially 
 on the PC. The levels were filled with strange alien monsters and, if I remember correctly, many 
 contained alien nests to destroy. Level design was fairly interesting as well, including one series 
 of floating islands, and another level with small targets perched at the tops of bizarre Dr. Seuss 
 trees. Like I said, though, this game was pretty difficult, and it's one of the few that I liked 
 and never finished. The last thing I remember was a giant, tooth filled hive queen that you had 
 to fly inside of and fight through portals (organs?) , rather like the final boss in the original 
 Contra. Never did get through it.
  
  I remember Outwars fondly, if only because it showed me that a new style of gameplay was available 
 on PC, and mastering the keyboard and mouse combo that seems like second nature now made me feel 
 pretty terrific at the time. If you can get your hands on an old copy of this game -- I think it 
 ran on Windows 95 -- you could do worse, but you could also save yourself the headache and go right 
 for Outwars's great grandbaby, Giants: Citizen Kabuto.
