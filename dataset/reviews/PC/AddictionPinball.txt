:::Review:::
While it doesn't have the ultrarealism of a game such as Pro Pinball: Timeshock, Addiction Pinball 
 offers more sensory gratification. 

 Every time pinball is mentioned as a possible candidate for some Saturday-afternoon game playing, 
 eyes start to glaze over, and the unopened Microsoft Entertainment Pack that you got for Christmas 
 last year starts looking more inviting. But the fact is, a good PC pinball simulation can be a 
 great deal of fun, and Addiction Pinball is almost as good as any pinball sim around.  

 The game comes with two tables, both of which are based on other Team17 games. This device works 
 well because the basic gameplay of the originals - Worms 2 and World Rally Fever - provides a good 
 setup for the tables' strategy. On the Worms table, the object is to score kills and complete missions 
 by using specific combinations of shots to the various ramps. Here, hitting a specific ramp at 
 a specified time is more important than scoring points. The Rally Fever table provides a more repetitive 
 strategy where the duplication of certain ramp shots is the key to winning.  

 While it doesn't have the ultrarealism of a game such as Pro Pinball: Timeshock, Addiction Pinball 
 offers more sensory gratification. The table design is really impressive. The tables look and feel 
 like they were meant to be full-fledged arcade table designs. The ball physics, surface friction, 
 and momentum forces respond realistically within the game, and pinball purists will be hard-pressed 
 to find faults. And for those of you who even like the video modes of current stand-up machines, 
 Addiction Pinball gives you some arcade action as well.  

 Addiction Pinball does contain a few irritating elements. The first is the Worms 2 table. If you 
 find the voices of the worms from the original game annoying, you're going to be enraged by the 
 time you finish one game on the Worms table. The Worms table provides too much flavor of the original 
 game in the form of sounds and cutesy worm ambience. As for the Rally Fever table, such recycling 
 of materials is justified and almost appreciated; in racing games, the squeal of the tires and 
 the voice of the race announcer is an important factor.  

 In the end, Addiction Pinball is recommended if you're looking for a solid simulation. If you can 
 handle Team17's style of self-promotion in the tables' theme design, you're going to enjoy the 
 experience on the whole.

Review:  Addiction isn't the word for this space age pinball gallery. Spend hours trying to manipulate the 
 ball. And blast off. This game isn't easy on the pc compared to the arcade days where you had lever 
 buttons. They were located on the side of the machine. Pinball machines seem a thing of the past 
 until they put them as a pc game. Learn the controls to aim or direct the ball. You're setup as 
 a space ship and you can warp through space. This game has some real cool sound effects and features. 
 I was reminiscing the old days when I would rock a pinball game or make it tilt (game over) . Enjoyable 
 on the pc but not the same as playing a real pinball machine where you used your body to bump the 
 machine to control or maneuver the ball. Caught myself a couple of times bumping my pc. Definitely 
 don't want to tilt my pc. This is a worthy game to add to your unfulfilled collection. And if you 
 can't add it to your collection then you can come watch me play.

Review:  Skill Shot! 
  I was instantly hooked when i shot the ball from its launcher, hit it once, into a small slot, 
 and was rewarded with those two words. I cant express how addicting this game is, and im not much 
 of a pinball fan. Addiction Pinball runs with two boards, Rally Fever and Worms. Personally, i 
 play the worms table the most because im a die hard worms fan.
  
  I went to my local gamestop and found this in the bargin bin, for under a dollar, when i popped 
 it in my computer, i got ALOT more than i paid for.
  
  The graphics are very detailed to the last pixel, and with the detail turned to high, i was amazed, 
 for such an old game.
  
  Sound wise, this game perfects it, with great music, from the opening music to the war-themed play 
 music.
  
  Prepare to spend the next 10 hours of your life glued to the computer screen, racking up skill 
 shots, kills, and multi-balls. Have fun

Review:  The Good:
  - Great inspiration by Team17 games
  - Solid Gameplay
  - Good mix of realistic and arcade play
  - Neat artistic detail
  The Bad:
  - Only 2 tables 
 to choose from
  - Aiming and angling your shot seems a little too arcady
  - Actual game graphics arnt too good
  - Extras are totally unworthwhile
  
  Addiction Pinball 
 is a great pinball game anybody can pick up and play. If you love pinball games you will absolutly 
 love Addiction Pinball. There are so many things to do and discover on the two gimmick boards which 
 are Team 17's Worms Armagedon and Rally Fever.
  
  There is so much stuff to do in Addiction Pinball it will take you weeks to discover all the stuff. 
 Its a shame there are only two different tables but even so it is still very fun and entertaining. 
 There are shop spaces, random event spaces, many mini-games, loops, bends twists and curves and 
 also Multi-Ball! Also in addiction spinball is a unique space at the top middle of each board which 
 when hit will give you a bonus.
  
  Each board realy gimmicks there real game ancestors realy well. On the Worms Armagedon you have 
 all the worm sound effects, music and details etc. There are mini-games which even let you sorta 
 play worms on the pinball screen by avoinding a foot or bombs or even controlling a super sheep 
 trough a maze whilst ralley fever is vice versa with junkyards, stunt evens, race events etc.
 
  
  What realy makes Addiction Pinball stand out is the amazing artistic detail. What I mean by this 
 is the textures that are on the boards. The graphics even are quite good aswell the whole thing 
 nearly looks lifelike, just go see some screenshots for yourself. With that said however the raw 
 graphics arnt so good. Some objects are rather jagged, the screen of the pinball table is realy 
 ugly and the whole presetation seems outdated. However the game certainly does a good job of makking 
 use of makking things look like different materials like plastic, metal etc. and the ball reflects 
 the playfeild quite well.
  
  The gameplay in AP is just solid. It nails a perfect combination of an arcade style whilst also 
 being quite a realistic game. The ball speed physics are arcady but the way it bounces of object 
 and decelarates and accelerates and prefectly angles itself of objects how you would expect makes 
 it a realy fun pick up and play game. However, this is also for the bad. For instance, the flippers 
 on the board arnt so realistic but so arcade. What I mean is not only are they an odd shape and 
 size, but the way the ball reacts with the angle of them can be pretty unpredictable at time and 
 sometimes makes it impossible to angle your shots. This is due to the realism of the ball physics 
 and the arcadism of the flippers. Still, the game is so much fun to play and like I said it is 
 easy to pick up and go.
  
  Addiction Pinball is a solid pinball game that is easy to pick up and play. It has some realy neatly 
 detailed textures, tons of replay value (heck I could not stop playying till I got the highest 
 score which I had to beat a score of 1,000,000) lots of stuff to do and different ways to play 
 and overall is a great way to play pinball if you had enough of thoose rather dumb gravity depending 
 real life pinball tables.
