A breakthrough in outdoor 3-D action sims, Terra Nova gives mech games and flight sims something 
 to aspire to. 

 Most outdoor 3-D action games have a problem with their horizons. Traditionally, terrain is rendered 
 with polygons, and the farther you can see, the more polygons your woefully under-powered Pentium 
 will have to render. Some games, like Magic Carpet, get around this by hazingafter a certain 
 distance, terrain is obscured by a thick fog effect. Other games, like MechWarrior 2, just refuse 
 to render things beyond a certain distance, which leads to noticeable effects that destroy your 
 suspension of disbelief, like huge mountains that appear polygon by polygon when you get within 
 a click-and-a-half or so.  

 Leave it to Looking Glass Technologies to change the 3-D rules. LGT produced the first true 3-D, 
 first-person perspective game in Ultima Underworld, in addition to creating a cyberpunk masterpiece 
 in System Shock and using fluid dynamics, physics, and photo-realistic terrain in Flight Unlimited. 

 Terra Nova, LGT's entry into the world of outdoor sci-fi combat sims, puts you in the shoes of a 
 squad leader in command of up to three other specialists, and missions range from recon and repair 
 to all-out assault. The game plays like a first person, 3-D real-time version of Syndicate. Encased 
 in powered battle armor, you and your squad stomp across distant planetscapes while fighting a 
 covert war with a fascist imperialist government. The terrain is simply spectacularsnowy 
 peaks, distant mountain ranges and reflecting lakes as far as you can see provide a convincing 
 backdrop to the mayhem and warfarethat you won't even notice the absence of an SVGA mode 
 (you can choose between 320x200 or 320x400 video resolution modes) .  

 A breakthrough in outdoor 3-D action sims, Terra Nova gives mech games and flight sims something 
 to aspire to. Advanced technology supplies beautiful graphics and excellent play dynamics, and 
 great mission-building provides challenging and entertaining situations.

Review:  I first played pc games in '96 when my first purchase was the highly acclaimed Duke Nukem 3D, I 
 was under aged, but boy was it fun. Its no suprise I didnt hear about this game, no one really 
 did, and its too bad because I sure would rather there being never-ending hype on a Terra Nova: 
 Forever, rather than Duke Nukem: Forever. I played this game two years after the fact when I noticed 
 it on the sale rack for five bucks at K-Mart. I never forgot about it. Through the years new games 
 have come and gone, and I find myself selling the new ones but always coming back for the old ones. 
 Yes, for a game that is ten years old, this game is still amazing. Only now do you hear of the 
 new revolution in graphics engines where there are vast landscapes and reflective water surfaces, 
 but Terra Nova had them ten years in the past. With that fact I can easily get over the dated pixelated 
 graphics with ease. The action is fantastic and extremely fast. the fluidity of your movement is 
 awsome, you can run faster than any man ever could, withstand many enemy attack on you, and jump 
 hundreds of feet up into the air thanks to you Powered Body Armor. If this game was remade with 
 todays graphics technology, and nothing else change, it would still be a classic, but I have the 
 classic in my game library unlike many others, aand I can only praise so much a game of this massive 
 amount of enjoyment and breakthrough.
