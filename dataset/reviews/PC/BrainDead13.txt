:::Review:::
Brain Dead 13 is a skillfully animated cartoon that is almost entirely unplayable and fails completely 
 as an interactive experience. 

 It's immediately obvious that Readysoft, the game's designers, were involved in the translation 
 of the PC versions of the 1980's coin-op favorites, Dragon's Lair and Space Ace. In these games, 
 and in Brain Dead 13, an animated sequence is played and you have a fraction of a second to press 
 one of the arrow keys or the spacebar. If you guess correctly which key to press, the video sequence 
 continues to play until you're given the next unforgiving chance to "interact." If you don't, it's 
 certain death and you start all over again. In the end, this means that the game must be played 
 systematically as a process of elimination; in any given situation, you must press each key until 
 you find the correct one. We're not talking real-time interaction here. Just point Mr. One-finger 
 at an arrow key, then sit back and watch the results.   

 The game has other flaws besides its grossly outdated gameplay. For instance, a number of rooms 
 in the castle (see company line for plot overview) are mirror images of places you've been before. 
 You can avoid the Red Witch, say, by pressing up, right, space bar, right, and so on. But to avoid 
 the Green Witch, you'll press up, left, space bar, left, and so on. Even worse, it's never quite 
 clear what the results of your actions will be. In one room you can escape through a door in the 
 upper-left corner by pressing up, but another room with an exit in the same place will require 
 you to press left to get out. This inconsistency and thoughtlessness in design highlights the problems 
 inherent in imposing an interactive interface on a traditionally linear media.  

 Brain Dead 13 does have one positive aspect: the animated cartoon that provides the framework for 
 your limited interaction. Full of colorful characters (both literally and figuratively) , the clips 
 feature incredibly smooth animation all neatly packed onto one CD-ROM. Although this level of production 
 quality is no minor technical feat, it's not enough to save this game from being inducted into 
 my own personal computer game Hall of Shame. Unless you're a fan of the Dragon's Lair series of 
 games, I strongly suggest that you avoid this exercise in absolute frustration.

Review:  Brain dead 13 was an old game a long time ago that basically tried to take the draon's lair formula 
 and make a paper thin storyline with gimmicky characters engraved into it. What you got was partly 
 amusing cutscenes, but extremely painful gameplay, or lack thereof, I would highly reccomend avoiding 
 this at all costs, unless you got it for free and have absolutely no other choices of cures for 
 boredom. Although the voice acting is pretty good and the graphics were at par with dragon's lair, 
 all I can say is avoid this like the plague, because it's probably the closest thing to it.
