Live 2000 is just as good as Live 99, but at best it's an iterative update to the classic PC sports 
 series. 

 EA Sports' NBA Live series is like the Chicago Bulls of basketball games. The Bulls were the dominant 
 NBA team of the '90s and arguably the best basketball team ever. No other team even came close, 
 and any time a contender like the Jazz reared its pretentious head to challenge them, the Bulls 
 slapped them down in the championship when it counted. Similarly, EA Sports' NBA Live was the dominant 
 basketball game of the '90s. A few companies like Microsoft and Fox have tried to compete, but 
 NBA Live remains the premier basketball game on the PC. However, just as the Bulls recently split 
 apart and turned into the biggest turkey in the NBA, so too has NBA Live lost much of its luster. 
 Fortunately, NBA Live 2000 hasn't taken as big a fall as the Bulls; it's only lost a step compared 
 with the new games in town.  

 NBA Live 2000 is basically the same game as Live 99, with the addition of Michael Jordan and a cast 
 of all-stars from the '50s to '90s. It has the same types of gameplay as before: arcade mode, simulation 
 mode, exhibition games, single-season games, and multiple-season games in franchise mode. The NBA 
 Live series' dizzying array of options also remains intact. You can tweak graphics detail, adjust 
 quarter length, toggle virtually every official NBA rule, or throw everything out and just play 
 wild arcade basketball.  

 Like 99, Live 2000 lets you manage your team through multiple seasons and try to create a consistently 
 winning franchise. However, whereas Live 99 only let you play ten seasons, Live 2000 requires you 
 to play 25. It would have been nice to have an option to play for five, ten, 15, or 20 years, rather 
 than forcing you to stick it out for 25. The new one-on-one mode is also a fun addition to the 
 game, because it lets you play as or challenge the greatest basketball players in history. You 
 can match Iverson up against Jordan or relive the classic Russel-Chamberlain battles of yesteryear. 

 Single games are still fun whether you play them in exhibition or season mode. The emphasis is on 
 action, and as always, it's better to play offense than try to win on defense. However, it seems 
 that every year, NBA Live gets better in terms of letting you play defensively if you so choose. 
 I didn't steal too often, but I sure blocked a lot of shots.  

 NBA Live 2000 adds a direct shoot and direct pass option, so you can force shots, dunks, and layups. 
 But in reality, direct shooting does not mean you will automatically get your dunk or layup. You'll 
 occasionally be frustrated when you think you're in position for a dunk and end up seeing your 
 player try a jumper from under the basket. Thankfully, this only happens rarely. NBA Live 2000's 
 computer-controlled teams are tough as always in superstar mode and get progressively easier as 
 you pare down the difficulty setting. However, I noticed some things that shouldn't have happened 
 no matter what the difficulty level. For example, in starter difficulty (the normal setting) , whenever 
 I was in the lead, the computer player failed to play with any sense of urgency. If the computer 
 team was down 10 points with one minute left, it would still take its sweet time to shoot. In previous 
 versions of NBA Live, the AI fouled too often when it was behind because it was trying to get the 
 ball. Unfortunately, it fouled so often and needlessly that it ruined its chances for catching 
 up. Live 98 and 99 did away with that problem, but Live 2000 seems to go too far in the opposite 
 direction, at least in starter difficulty, as the AI plays too lethargically when it's losing. 

 The graphics that were so mind-blowing in Live 99 are still good but no longer revolutionary in 
 Live 2000. The players move well and animate quickly and smoothly. After particularly good baskets, 
 your players will celebrate with chest thumping, jumping, and lots of facial expressions. Unfortunately, 
 NBA Live 2000's graphics are weak by comparison to present PC game standards and don't look nearly 
 as good as NBA 2K for the Sega Dreamcast either, whose animation is better, graphics cleaner, players 
 more lifelike, and players' likenesses more accurate than in NBA Live 2000. Live 2000 still looks 
 good, but no longer looks great.  

 From Live 95 through Live 99, the series offered good graphics, fast and rewarding action-oriented 
 gameplay, and a lot of great extras. In contrast, Live 2000 is a modest update that falls behind 
 simply by virtue of not moving forward. Live 2000's biggest claim is that it adds the elusive Michael 
 Jordan to the roster, so now you can play against him in one-on-one basketball. NBA Live 2000 is 
 undoubtedly a good basketball game and still one of the best on the PC. But you can't consider 
 PC sports games in a vacuum, and while recent PC sports games look better than anything on the 
 PlayStation, the Dreamcast is another story.  

 The bottom line is if you only have a PC, then NBA Live 2000 is worth getting. Those who are familiar 
 with the series will feel right at home: Live 2000 is just as good as Live 99, but at best it's 
 an iterative update to the classic PC sports series; the gameplay, graphics, and style are eminently 
 familiar.  

 However, if you own or are considering owning a Dreamcast, then you'd be better off with Sega's 
 NBA 2K, which is a better game in every way. And just like that, NBA Live is no longer the champion 
 of basketball games. It still might be the best on the PC, but then, the Knicks were the best of 
 the East, the Bulls' conference, and the Spurs of the West beat them handily in the championship 
 that the Bulls used to own.

Review:  Congratulation, pretty good game but not as good as 2005. 2005 is the best so far out of all of 
 them. 2000 has actually good graphics and some of the players actually look like themselves compared 
 to some in the newer games. They may not be high quality graphics but the faces look like some 
 of the players. The game was very good for its year and I believe it remains a classic forever 
 because of what it was like, also with jordan in it and things like that like shaq still with Orlando. 
 Overall this game is a true classic and very fun for its years.

Review:  The Good:
  -Groundbreaking graphics for its time. I couldn't get enough of how great it looked compared to 
 NBA Live 98, which was my previous game.
  -I fell in love with the franchise mode. I loved seeing my players progress through their career, 
 and it was done very accurately. You could sign, release, and trade players, just as you'd expect 
 from an NBA Live game. But the depth of the franchise mode sucked me in, and I would play this 
 all the time.
  -There's a 3 point shootout available and it works pretty good.
  -The action on the court holds up pretty good. The replays look good, and so do the moves players 
 make.
  -Internet play worked great when it was still available.
  -One-on-one mode was a great new feature.
  
  The Bad:
  -Color commentary is pretty dry.
 
  -The action on the court is good but it does have flaws. With some defenders it is impossible 
 to get by them unless you pass to someone else. Howevery, they might have the same problem. To 
 make matters worse, there's no one to pass to in one-on-one.
  -After a while the game got a little easy, even with a crappy team.
  
  Even today I would still 
 recommend getting this game. I've kind of lost interest in basketball so it doesn't mean much to 
 me, but it's still fun to go back and play for old time's sake.

Review:  I got this game on eBay after having played NBA Live '98. The graphics, first of all, are WAY better 
 now, and so is the gameplay. NBA Live '98 was good, but this is even better. The 1-on-1 was a big 
 reason why I purchased this, and it's a good mode. It's cool to see some of your favorite players 
 going head-to-head in a dunking contest, like MJ vs. Wilt Chamberlain. The Create-A-Player mode 
 is great too... I've made a couple so far. The Import Face feature is extremely nice, though a good 
 photo must be had first... mine is a mixed blue color, because of shadows and bad lighting. One 
 thing you can do for modern players is go to the NBA site or whatever, get that player's mug shot, 
 and then put it into Face Import... I did that for Linas Kleiza, one of Mizzou's best centers who's 
 now with the Nuggets.
  Franchise mode is sweet. I'm doing the Houston Rockets right now, and I'm undefeated (I think at 
 least 10-0, maybe more) . The uniforms are WAY better now than in NBA Live '98; have you seen the 
 Rockets uniforms for NBA Live 98? They're horrible! Now in Live 2000 they're an awesome blue and 
 red color, very good for the eyes.
  Lastly, the commentary and replay feature. I kinda like NBA Live '98's commentary better; Vern 
 Lendquist is one of the greats. This Don guy and Reggie Theis are okay, but not as good I don't 
 think. As for replay, 2000 is AWESOME. The different camera angles and the focus on the player 
 is just superb.
  All in all, I HIGHLY recommend getting NBA Live 2000 if you have a nominall system computer. My 
 laptop's a 266, so not exactly the best in the world. It plays NBA Live 2000 fine.
