:::Review:::
Timeshock! has none of the problems of its predecessors, and may be the closest thing you'll find 
 to real pinball on the PC. 

 Past efforts to bring the game of pinball to home computers have been often futile efforts. While 
 it's true that there have been some entertaining products released, problems such as split screens 
 and skittish physics have had a hampering effect on realism. Empire Interactive's Pro Pinball: 
 Timeshock! has none of the problems of its predecessors, and may be the closest thing you'll find 
 to real pinball on the PC.  

 As the story goes, an experiment in the future failed, releasing a Timeshock. The Timeshock is headed 
 back toward the dawn of time, intent upon the destruction of everything, and you must stop it by 
 gathering pieces of the time crystal, scattered throughout four eras. By completing playfield tasks, 
 and surviving the Time Machine and Time Warp Frenzy, you will race toward the dawn of time. Create 
 an Anti-Timeshock and save the universe. But Timeshock isn't an adventure game, it's pinball, and 
 thankfully the plot here doesn't sully the action.   

 Gameplay is fast and accurate, and anyone who has ever spent time bandying a little silver ball 
 around a playfield will appreciate Timeshock's attention to the physical properties of pinball. 
 In Timeshock, the ball behaves as if it were a tangible object, reacting to its three-dimensional 
 environment with absolute precision. Whether the ball comes off the bumpers or down the ramps, 
 it adheres to the proper laws of physics, providing the most realistic pinball simulation yet on 
 a PC. This realism isn't limited to the spinning ball either, because Timeshock beautifully translates 
 all the elements on a pinball table into a vibrant, three-dimensional arena.   

 Table design in Timeshock is seamless. Ramps, bumpers, flippers, and chutes are positioned to work 
 together, and play off each other, fluidly. This critical element comes across strong in Timeshock, 
 and as your game progresses certain combinations of ramp shots are needed to further the plot. 
 Tables can be adjusted to any of four views: three varying angles of perspective and the now-lackluster 
 flat table are just a click away.   

 All the elements in Timeshock combine just right, delivering a fully realized product that screams, 
 "Play me." Actually, a digitized voice says that, and in full surround-sound to boot. Timeshock 
 is the best computer pinball simulation yet, and if you get good enough at it, you can even brag 
 about your high score by posting it at the Empire web site.

Review:  While it is true that many pinball games have failed to impress, ProPinball Timeshock is the exception 
 of these series, as not only it improves but it merges fun with realism.
  
  You will have to collect some time crystals in order to stop chaos which is released during a failed 
 experiment, which resulted to a timeshock. The gameplay is like an action game's, as it is very 
 fast and succesfully does it make the players stuck in front of their screens. Furthermore, you 
 will have to make some certain strikes or combinations into the table in order to progress. The 
 3D environment is well-designed, and the ball's animation is put well into the virtual table.
 
  
  Timeshock is one of the best parlor games for the PC. Of course it could improve more, but the 
 sense of satisfaction hidden in Timeshock is unlike anything I have tried in the past.
