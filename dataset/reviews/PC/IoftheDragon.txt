:::Review:::
I of the Dragon has some short-term appeal, but over time it makes you feel like a glorified exterminator, 
 tediously eliminating an endless stream of generic monsters for no real reason. 

  I of the Dragon is an action RPG with a couple of things in its favor. Instead of letting you play 
 as the typical barbarian or mage, this fantasy game lets you take to the skies as a dragon. It 
 also requires you to do some tactical thinking instead of relying solely on brute force. Beyond 
 that, it's generic fare marred by numbing missions and repetitive combat, not to mention a wholly 
 forgettable gameworld. I of the Dragon isn't actually a bad game, just a strikingly unimaginative 
 one. In short bursts it can be fun, but over the long haul it becomes a real snoozer.  

          Take to the skies as a colorful dragon.     

  The game serves up a disposable story. 
 Once upon a time, a generic fantasy world was beset by evil monsters. Humans and their dragon allies 
 managed to destroy the wicked monsters infesting the land and banish their Sauron-style leader. 
 After their victory, some shortsighted humans suspiciously turned on the dragons and drove them 
 away, too. Naturally, the great evil of former times returns, and suddenly a dragon -- that would 
 be you -- is needed to fight the forces of darkness.  

  Cutscenes fill you in on this limp tale. If you're expecting cinematic drama akin to the astounding 
 cutscenes in Diablo II -- or even something half as good -- you'll be sorely disappointed. Instead 
 you get lame in-engine scenes in which some little low-polygon guy appears (sometimes with his 
 head cropped out of the picture) and tells you to go kill a bunch of monsters.  

  In fact, bare-bones monster killing is the core of I of the Dragon -- kill all the monsters here, 
 then kill all the monsters there, defend this town from monsters, then defend that town from monsters. 
 Not exactly inspiring or imaginative. When the missions do differ, it might entail building a town, 
 but that basically means flying to a preset site on a map and pressing a particular key. The missions 
 that don't involve merely killing everything on a map can be unclear, since they often give you 
 no idea where to look for the specific monster or building you need to find.  

  A few woefully ill-conceived missions have you playing as a human. These stink, not only because 
 they're just plain boring, but also because the movement interface and camera were designed for 
 airborne dragons and prove frustratingly inadequate when used for a creature stuck on the ground. 
 You can hardly see where you're going, and evading enemies can be nearly impossible, as your character 
 gets stuck on scenery.  

  Thank goodness you mostly fight as one of three different types of dragons, each of which has a 
 different combat emphasis and a different selection of potential spells. The basics of movement 
 and combat apply to all three. To move, you just click a spot on the landscape, and away your dragon 
 flies. With the keyboard, you can vary its altitude and speed. However, even with the game-speed 
 slider cranked up to the maximum 200 percent and your dragon's speed stat boosted through leveling 
 up, your character's movement still feels slow and ponderous. Forget any dreams of soaring on the 
 winds and performing stunning feats of aerial acrobatics. These dragons have all the grace and 
 agility of a school bus.  

          Amateurish cutscenes make a bad impression.     

  As far as combat goes, you just right-click your target to attack it. The trick is in coordinating 
 your attacks and flight pattern. You can avoid attacks more easily by soaring high above your enemies, 
 but the farther you are from a target, the more likely it is that your ranged attacks will miss. 
 Swooping down low makes it easier to blast your prey, but it also increases the likelihood that 
 you'll get caught in a hail of projectiles. You can use terrain to your advantage, letting an intervening 
 stand of trees absorb attacks from land-based monsters while you destroy the lair that generates 
 them. Some of the terrain is destructible, though, so those trees won't hold out for long.  

  Your core dragon attacks include close-range breath weapons (fire, frost, and so on) that you 
 can charge up for a lengthy, full-power blast or let loose more quickly but with less power. There 
 are also single-shot breath-weapon attacks and a special attack that lets you dive down, snatch 
 a monster with your talons, and then eat the squealing beast to sate your hunger. You'll need to 
 stop and hover when you feed, so getting to safe ground first is vital.     

  While these physical attacks are important, it's the spells that often form your most powerful 
 arsenal. I of the Dragon offers good diversity in the spell department, encouraging you to try 
 the campaign as each of the three dragon types. The spells let you create geysers in the landscape 
 to injure nearby foes, launch lightning blasts, raise zombie allies, heal yourself, and a lot more. 
 Overall, the game's combat often has a numbingly repetitive and formulaic feel, but the way you 
 choose to sequence your magic attacks adds some much-needed spice. For instance, blinding nearby 
 foes for a moment might give you the time needed to destroy their lair without suffering too much 
 damage yourself. In the heat of the moment, you might need to decide whether to lash out with a 
 particularly brutal spell that takes a long time to cast or hurriedly cast a weaker spell.  

          From up here, enemies look like ants.     

  You can purchase new spells as you level 
 up, which is done by defeating monsters and the lairs that spawn them. You gain extra spell slots 
 by collecting little glowing balls that sometimes appear when you demolish a lair. Spells run on 
 mana -- what else? -- which recharges over time. Each time you level up, you're granted some stat points 
 that can you use for boosting your mana influx or otherwise expanding and improving your dragon's 
 abilities. You'll have to prioritize carefully, since some stats -- like health regeneration -- require 
 more points to boost than others.  

  While these sorts of decisions add a little bit of strategy to the game, I of the Dragon's character 
 building is pretty sparse, and combat mostly boils down to a series of monotonous, simplistic tasks. 
 Once you figure out a few basic tactics, it all comes down to point, click, repeat. That's admittedly 
 a major part of the action RPG formula, but here you don't feel like you're getting anywhere or 
 accomplishing anything. The game lacks the hidden depth and "just 10 more minutes" addictiveness 
 of the genre at its best. There are no weapons or enchanted items to find, buy, or create, so there's 
 no tempting promise of nabbing that elusive item you've been hankering for. There are no random 
 maps to keep things fresh, but instead 12 fixed, relatively small battlegrounds. There are no multiplayer 
 options, either. Co-op play could have made things much more interesting.  

  The bland and boring gameworld is no fun to explore. Landscapes vary a bit across the different 
 game areas, but they all feel generic and similar in the end. A fantasy setting should induce a 
 sense of awe and wonder, but those things are totally lacking here. The creatures, saddled with 
 dumb names like "Tumba-Umba," never frighten, amuse, or otherwise captivate. Plus, you're usually 
 flying well above any foes, with the camera situated even higher for a top-down view. That means 
 nearly every monster appears as a tiny speck. You can play I of the Dragon for many hours and barely 
 remember what a single creature looks like.  

          Chow down on enemies to sate your hunger.     

  Bland, dated graphics don't help in 
 that regard. The spell effects are flashy enough, but in a gratuitous and unimaginative way. A 
 bunch of random brilliant lights doesn't really cut it. The dragons are detailed, down to the veins 
 in their translucent wings, but not really imposing or inspiring. Overall, I of the Dragon lacks 
 any distinctive look or feel. Actually, the interface is distinctive, but only because it's ugly 
 and cluttered. Unlike the graphics, the audio has almost nothing in its favor. It's bland and sparse, 
 with wimpy monster sounds, phoned-in voice-overs, and a mishmash of pedestrian new age music that 
 doesn't create any unified or even relevant mood.  

  I of the Dragon doesn't make much use of its interesting premise. In this game, being a dragon 
 turns out to be a pretty prosaic job. The game does offer some mildly interesting tactical options, 
 thanks in part to the wide spell selection, but those strengths nearly collapse under the weight 
 of the pitifully bland campaign. I of the Dragon has some short-term appeal, but over time it makes 
 you feel like a glorified exterminator, tediously eliminating an endless stream of generic monsters 
 for no real reason.

Review:  I of the Dragon is a nice game and which is one of the best games I've played. You would like it 
 especially the dragons. One of the best things in the game is the dragons in the game which has 
 a pretty shiny scale and will also grow horns in the head and at the back from the neck to the 
 tail when you get stronger as you kill more monsters and destroy more lairs in the game. At each 
 level, you get points to increase some of your skills or get one spell. The black dragon is the 
 one that I've manage to use to finish the game since it doesn't cause a lot of points when you 
 add some in to the stats of your dragon or when you get spells. The texture or graphics of the 
 game may not be that much great although you will still even like it especially the magic spells 
 and the ability to breath fire (frost, flame, corrosive/poison) . You would also like the number 
 of enemies which you would meet in the game from small once up to gigantic monsters. Its worth 
 buying it.

Review:  The I of the Dragon may be an amusing game for a few hours however, it slowly gets very boring 
 over time. The I of the Dragon allows you to play as a dragon, either fire, ice, or dark. Each 
 of these dragons has their own strengths and weaknesses and the ability to cast various spells. 
 At the start of the game, you will notice that the menu screens have no words, except the title. 
 You cant really tell what button does what. You will have to move your mouse over each button 
 to see what does what.
  I of the Dragon do feature many unique spells that you could try, but there are certain spells 
 that can only be cast at yourself, so why the spell cant be instantly cast as soon as you click 
 it?
  The gameplay itself is a little slow. When they say the necromancer was slow, they mean WAY SLOW. 
 Its like playing a flying snail. To get the right speed you want, you can either set it to 200%, 
 or up your speed at least above 120.
  Missions are very repetitive. There is only 3 things to keep in mind. Kill, destroy lairs, and 
 build towns. Occasionally, you have to get artifacts, or upgrade your town; otherwise its just 
 three things; kill, destroy lairs, and build towns.
  Graphics are ok, but the biggest drawback is the sound, voice acting, and the music, mainly the 
 voice acting. The dialogue and the subtitles dont match, so its kind of confusing cause you dont 
 know whether to read or to listen. The worst voice Ive ever heard is from the magician, in a mission 
 he asked you to intercept a caravan, if you fail, he will come to you and say, No, no, they got 
 away... he was talking as if he didnt care whether they got a way or not.
  The cameras are not the best and completely useless during a mission when you play as a human. 
 You wont be able to see whats going on with all the trees in your face during a human mission, 
 besides, I dont think there should be a human mission. First person camera is the worst.
  There is a bug I encountered. When I picked up a dead creature, then press the eat button, some 
 magicians came to claim its soul while the dragon was still eating, then, the game crash.
  The only thing I like about this game is the fact that you can play as a dragon, and the ability 
 to cast all the mad spells (I like volcano the most) , other than that, theres not much of a reason 
 to get this game.
  Bottom line is if you can totally ignore all of its bad points, then this is youre your game. 
 If you cant take bad music and horrible voices that dont match the subtitles, save your money 
 for something else.
  
  NOTE: Even if you like dragons, you will get bored very quickly...

Review:  This is the most captivating RPG I've played to date, especially because the dragons are well done, 
 and you're playing one! 3 types to choose from and they all have their specialties from the beginning. 
 To date I've only played the black dragon. The game moves along at a nice pace and auto saves at 
 each level so far. You have just enough health in the beginning to survive if you pick your fights 
 without getting overwhelmed. At each level you can choose to increase abilities like your breath 
 power or breath capacity, life, fly speed, and magic. You're alloted a limited number of points 
 at each new level and each increase has a different cost. Do not forget magic! Many spells exist 
 to help increase your battle prowess and not just defensive magic. Also, flight speed is important. 
 Monsters aim to throw magic/ and missiles at the dragon, and speed can help you get out of a tight 
 spot where you're overwhelmed.

Review:  As featured on loadedinc. com...
  
  Combine the exploration of vast swaths of land, a medieval-esque setting, being able to breathe 
 fire, and the ability to eat random people alive and youve got I of the Dragon. The latest from 
 developer Strategy First is an overall decent RPG but several glaring technical and game play issues 
 prevent it from being great.
  
  In I of the Dragon, you play as a dragon (didnt see that coming did you?) . You can select from 
 three choices: the brute-force dragon that uses sheer firepower over magic, the magic dragon that 
 cant take much punishment but has a plethora of spells at its disposal, and the dark magic dragon 
 who can raise dead monsters to fight on the side of good. Whichever dragon you choose though, youre 
 thrown right into the middle of a conflict that you probably wont even care about.
  
  For an RPG, you would expect the story to be better presented. At the very beginning you are met 
 a carpet-riding man that simply instructs you to start killing things. Through short dialogues 
 with different characters, you can put together the pieces and it appears that the world has been 
 taken over by monsters and humanity is making its last stand in a final village. You are the dragon 
 that was prophesized to save humanity.
  
  Story-wise, its a rather weak setup for a main plot. You are given no background on any of the 
 characters so you wont really know why youre helping them. The few plot twists thrown in arent 
 really effective in establishing credibility for the story either. In the end, it seems that most 
 of the emphasis is on the humans and your dragon character plays a subservient role even though 
 its the main character.
  
  I of the Dragons gameplay revolves around two things: destroying monsters and building villages. 
 As the dragon youll fly around various lands combating evil monsters. The monsters in the game 
 all spawn from lairs, to successfully destroy the monsters you have to destroy the lairs. Its 
 not all that easy though as enemy lairs can be rebuilt. To cutoff the lairs you need to control 
 special energy wells. There is one energy well per level and to control it simply means to build 
 a town over it. Building is accomplished at the press of a button and the villages serve the simple 
 function of cutting off enemy lair construction and a place to recharge your health. Human towns 
 can be upgraded and the upgrades will add walls, beef up defensive towers, and add more humans 
 like archers and knights to the defense.
  
  Its too bad that the game doesnt stray far from the build town, destroy lairs and monsters formula 
 too often. Granted, there are a few missions that will see you take control of human characters 
 but those missions are few and far between. More often than not youll be cruising the world as 
 a dragon and using your various fire attacks to destroy enemies. As a strike against I of the Dragon, 
 this does get rather repetitive; fortunately this doesnt happen quickly. The variety of enemies 
 adds some challenge and enjoyment to the game; theres nothing more satisfying than swooping down 
 and eating an enemy Shaman alive. Eating is how you keep your hunger bar full, a hungry dragon 
 will have his health regeneration, fly speed, and mana charge negatively effected. In addition, 
 eating also restores some health to your character. Its a nice touch that adds gives your dragon 
 some badass attitude.
  
  After killing enough baddies youll gain experience which you can use to upgrade your dragon. Youll 
 have the option of choosing from flying speed, life, health regeneration, fire power, fire breath, 
 mana charge, or use your XP to buy spells that unlock at certain levels. The spells show some creativity 
 by the developer and range from boosting your health recharge rate to summoning gigantic volcanoes 
 that will spew fire and brimstone on nearby enemies. Your spells will come in handy against enemy 
 lairs and also in killing the rather simple AI.
  
  Artificial intelligence in I of the Dragon seems relegated to the simple tasks of guarding and 
 attacking villages. Often enemies wont attack you until you get too close to them or their lairs. 
 This makes hit and run tactics very effective and doesnt make the game much of a challenge. The 
 game is really only tough when the computer has sheer numbers on its side. The AI just isnt smart 
 enough to coordinate complex attacks on you or the friendly human villages. Attacks on villages 
 are either scripted or occur when you destroy an enemy lair. The monsters spawned by said lair 
 will attack the human village by default. You can usually pick the enemies off before they reach 
 the village though so youll almost never have to worry about losing a town.
  
  From a visual standpoint, I of the Dragon is fairly average. All the characters suffer from having 
 low-poly models and if that wasnt bad enough the game does have a tendency to freeze up during 
 large firefights. This is probably caused by the impressive visuals of the weapons effects. Fireballs, 
 streams of plasma, and magical spells can all be seen streaking the skies and are reminiscent of 
 the way insect artillery appeared in the film Starship Troopers.
  
  The appearance of these weapons effects does give the game some graphical shine but thats overshadowed 
 by the rather bland layouts of the different levels. Aside from different types of mountains, I 
 of the Dragon suffers from using the same land palette textures over and over again. The ground 
 will usually be barren except for the odd boulder or tree. 
  
  Music in I of the Dragon will change depending on what youre doing. Cruising the high skies youll 
 hear soothing ambient tunes while quickly changing to militaristic beats once you enter battle. 
 The selection isnt that great but its adequate enough. Some of the enemy attacking sounds seem 
 too generic and borrowed from sound clip websites. For instance, when you eat a particular animal 
 alive youll hear Flipper-like dolphin soundsentertaining but bordering on mediocre.
  
  The overall single-player campaign of I of the Dragon will leave you under whelmed. In the 15-20 
 hours it will take you to finish youll end up doing the same tasks over and over again. If the 
 developers added more mission variations then it could have been a lot better than what it is. 
 The premise is interesting and flying around as a dragon is just plain cool but ultimately it lacks 
 the polish to stand out from the crowd.

Review:  The game has good 3D grafics, with many nice and colourfull efects; but, some certain-few details 
 are not "worked" enough. It's sound is it's weak point, coz it's there is no music.. Actually you 
 have to adjust the sound effects and the music volumes and all will fix (70% all exept 100% music) . The 
 music is not like an epic melody or something, but it's one with the game. The efects are really 
 good and realistic.
  The gameplay is quite strange and different comparing to usual RPGs, but also when you use to it 
 you will like it very much. You must select one of the three available dragons:
  1-- the Fire-Manipulator who is expert in using fire attacks and fire breath weapons and fire based 
 magic, very powerfull.
  2-- the Great Magician who lives to use magic, devastating waves of magic or superpower divine 
 healings. It uses some acid breath attacks that freeze but no powerull enough.
  3-- the Evil-Magician, he is like a necromancer or something, who uses asid breath attacks and 
 black magic. Magic to lower enemy's stamina ,health or even instantly kill an enemy's soul!
  The storyline doesn't seems good at all at the start of the game coz it's like only a reason to 
 kill enemies (e. g. 1st mission: kill monsters and their lairs to reatch level 3.. (?) ) .
  Allthough, as the time passes you find out many exciting parts of the story and you end up like 
 it very much..
  It's value is good, especially or those who like dragons very much-Dragon-Lovers_
  
  P. S. I 
 get an error in the loading of the 6th world part-stage, I hope a patch will be released soon..
