:::Review:::
Whether you're a serious armchair pilot or an arcade maniac who likes to blow the hell out of anything 
 and everything in existence, Apache is the game for you. Whether you're a serious armchair pilot 
 or an arcade maniac who likes to blow the hell out of anything and everything in existence, Apache 
 is the game for you. This helicopter combat simulation throws you in the cockpit of the Apache 
 attack chopper and lets you duke it out in four different theaters: Fort Hood, Cyprus, Yemen, or 
 Korea. In Fort Hood, you will learn the basics of helicopter combat. The other areas are full combat 
 arenas where your training will pay off. In Apache, you can choose to fly single missions or opt 
 for a full campaign in any of the three combat regions. A variety of mission typesranging 
 from escort to search and destroy sortiescan be flown in varied weather conditions and at 
 different times, even at night. Apache looks great throughout, featuring graphics that accurately 
 portray the surroundings without ever sacrificing system speed. Apache's gameplay is enhanced by 
 a switch that allows players to toggle between a realistic flight model and an arcade mode. This 
 feature lets gamers who want the thrill of low altitude destruction to jump into the cockpit and, 
 within minutes, start filling the skies with hot lead and missiles. The realistic flight mode gives 
 serious pilots the accuracy they crave, and is based in part on the flight experience of actual 
 helicopter pilots. Other treats included in the game are an amazing multi-player option (up to 
 16 players can duke it out simultaneously) , brilliant sound effects, and gorgeous external views. 
 Apache does have a few flaws: loading times between screens are too long; and the minimum installation 
 occupies over 25 megabytes of hard drive space. These minor problems, however, are hardly worth 
 complaining about in light of the overall quality of Apache, one of the finest helicopter simulations 
 ever made.

Review:  My beloved ones, this is the first game i bought in '95 when i got a brand new IBM machine on about 
 100MHz. I played it constantly till 97' arraises upon my machne, and I said: it's enough. New age 
 of gaming, new machines, new games. My simulation went to the shelf. I don't know, i'm writin' 
 this review for good old time sake, maybe. Maybe couse i was younger and ignorrant (didn't know 
 that better exsists) but i was simply adored by this game.
  This is the game that everybody should, not only play the stuff, but have it securely locked in 
 a gold stash... for All times.
