:::Review:::
Belief & Betrayal is a paint-by-numbers adventure that amounts to little more than a lame rip-off 
 of the Da Vinci Code. 

  Apparently, there is no escape from the Da Vinci Code phenomenon. Hack novels about ancient Christianity 
 have been clogging bookstore shelves for a good three years now thanks to author Dan Brown, and 
 this trend has now come to adventure gaming. Artematica Entertainment's take on yet another insidious 
 Catholic conspiracy is Belief &amp; Betrayal, a subpar point-and-click affair that somehow manages 
 to spin a yarn even more ridiculous than one of Brown's potboilers. Absurd scripting, annoying 
 voice acting, and nonstop nonsensical pixel hunts make it no surprise that this dire scheme has 
 been kept under wraps for the better part of 2,000 years.  

  You play Jonathan Danter, a reporter for a magazine called the  Manhattan Mirror  who is dragged 
 into the investigation of yet another Earth-shaking secret that the Catholics have been keeping 
 from the world. Sooner than you can say "Knights Templar," the journalist and his newfound friends 
 from a shadowy Vatican secret society called the Legacy are scouring Europe for clues. Their goal 
 is a MacGuffin called the Imago Sanctissimus, a mysterious ancient artifact that can apparently 
 answer all questions about everything like some kind of Magic 8-Ball.  

           Meet Jonathan Danter, the most unconvincing journalist in the history of adventure gaming. 

  Many plot points make no sense, beginning with the bizarre opening when Danter dumps a work assignment 
 in Miami and immediately flies to London after a phone call from a Scotland Yard detective who 
 tells him that his life may be in danger. Danter doesn't seem the slightest bit like a real character. 
 He laughs off huge revelations like the news that his Uncle Frank didn't actually die 10 years 
 ago, as his family always pretended, and that the not-dead guy was actually a spy for the Vatican 
 who was recently murdered as part of a bizarre series of ritualistic serial killings. You would 
 think that these sorts of surprises would prompt a few shocking gasps, but Danter just keeps loading 
 on the quips and unloading his big catchphrase, "Cat's whiskers!" Yes, seriously.  

  Danter has to be one of the most irritating protagonists ever to grace an adventure game. He's 
 obviously supposed to be some kind of a bad-boy reporter with an attitude, but he's characterized 
 more like an obnoxious teen than a pro journalist who travels all over the world writing exposes. 
 Horrific voice acting doesn't help; his lines are often read so quickly that you get the impression 
 that the actor was late for a bus. The only saving grace is that you also occasionally get to take 
 control of Danter's partners. Kat, a cool spy type, and Damien, a stereotypical computer nerd, 
 are voiced extremely well. So they seem far more believable and far less grating, even if they're 
 swimming upstream against the overall absurdity of the plot.  

  The gameplay isn't any more impressive than the story and acting. Belief &amp; Betrayal is a traditional 
 adventure in every way, which means that it looks and plays like a game from a decade ago. You 
 guide 3D protagonists through 2D screens, pointing and clicking to look at and manipulate objects 
 just as in Sierra's classic adventures from the late 1990s. Visuals appear to date from that era 
 as well. The game is locked in 1024x768 resolution, which leaves it blurry and pixelated on a modern 
 widescreen monitor. Even worse, most screens are impenetrably murky. Quest items are hidden away 
 in dark corners and are often impossible to discover without guiding the cursor through pixel hunts. 
 The sheer annoyance of having to scroll around looking for a needle in a haystack results in a 
 great deal of tedium. These searches are made even more frustrating due to the way that just about 
 all of the game's screens are cluttered with a half-dozen or more objects that serve no purpose 
 but to waste your time and provide Danter with the opportunity to make another inane wisecrack. 

           Cue the standard awful Christian secret.      

  Even when you can locate vital items, the game doesn't provide a great deal of feedback letting 
 you know how to use them, or even if they are useable. You frequently need to click on points of 
 interest two or three times to find a hidden object, and many times you're not given any clues 
 that such multiple clicks would be rewarding. Near the end of the second chapter, for instance, 
 Danter finds a pile of rubbish in a London alleyway that conceals a bottle of wine. But you won't 
 find this out by clicking on the pile once, twice, or even thrice. You have to incessantly click 
 on it to get beyond Danter's initial "ew, I'm not sticking my hands in  therereaction, and then 
 click again to prompt him to start kicking the rubbish more than once. Only then is the bottle 
 of wine revealed. This is probably the most extreme example of this missing feedback issue in action, 
 although you will frequently wander by important objects due to the absence of even the slightest 
 hint that you're on the right track. Anyone who finishes this game without a walk-through deserves 
 some kind of cash prize.  

  The only really noteworthy feature of Belief &amp; Betrayal is its occasionally controversial storyline, 
 but even the revelations that it holds about "the very foundations of the Church" aren't going 
 to wow anyone these days. Couple this been-there, done-that vibe with an infuriating lead character 
 and tedious gameplay and you've got a recipe for making sure that these ancient Christian secrets 
 stay hidden.

Review:  B & B is a decent game, no bells & whistles, but still a very nice adventure.
  After the first screens, you wouldn't expect much from this game. But if you have the patience 
 to play more than 30 minutes, you will begin to like it. The puzzles are challenging, the graphics 
 are not bad, and the story... the story worths every single minute of gameplay.
  The thing that really lets the gameplay down is the lack of any real guidance for the player. While 
 the controls may be straightforward and the puzzles fairly standard, it still took me about half 
 an hour to find the inventory. 
  The action and the dark senses of this adventure goes beyond, and grows as you advance through 
 the game, the death of some of the characters will upset you and make you involve even more in 
 the story.
  I am sure you will enjoy this game.
