:::Review:::
It's Ace's lowbrow humor that makes this a fun game to play. 

 Dude, pull my finger. Did that make you laugh? Then you're probably going to like Ace Ventura. Borrowing 
 from the Ace Ventura cartoon series, the game features all the same gags, mannerisms, and obnoxiousness 
 from the world's famous pet detective - the kind of stuff that's so stupid, you have no choice 
 but to laugh. And it's the humor that keeps the game afloat. The gameplay you've seen a dozen times 
 before.   

 Once again, Ace is on the case, this time traveling the earth looking for a lost creature. Masters 
 of click-and-solve games like The King's Quest, Nine, or Timelapse will be able to finish the entire 
 game in no time flat. In fact, a lot of it is so simple, you'll figure out that the game is partly 
 designed for young children. The objects and scenes have that bright, bulky Fisher Price quality. 
 And if you ever actually get stuck, a special button on Ace's watch delivers audio clues that take 
 out most of the guesswork. There's even a setting that lets parents edit out some of Ace's choice 
 phrases, although even without the parent setting on, Ace's language barely goes beyond third-grade 
 bathroom humor.   

 The various puzzle-filled scenes are sporadically broken up by arcade-lite action. Slightly challenging 
 tasks like swimming through the murky waters of the deep, avoiding trash and oil slicks, and getting 
 in a basic laser fight are a nice way to mix things up.   

 Although the Ace Ventura game doesn't claim to break new ground, it possesses one nice feature that 
 all developers of endlessly-clicking adventure games should take note of. When you click on an 
 object that you don't need, Ace pipes up with such witty things as "Yeaaaahhhh righht!" and "not 
 enough upper body strength." That alone saves hours out of wandering around, which is usually nothing 
 more than absolutely frustrating.  

 All told, it's Ace's lowbrow humor that makes this a fun game to play. As in a lot of adventure 
 games, long, drawn-out stories are told in between each level. But refreshingly, the scenes are 
 actually entertaining - a good thing, since there's no way to skip them. You'll likely cruise through 
 this title with ease, but you'll have plenty of fun getting there.

Review:  Vale, este juego me vino con el peridico. Como fantico de las aventuras grficas no poda desaprovechar 
 la oportunidad de tener un nuevo juego del gnero (no se puede decir que haya muchos) , aunque Ace 
 Ventura no me parece un gran personaje.
  
  Hay que decir que nos encontramos con los clsicos grficos en 2D que se llevaban en el 96 (por 
 cierto, gran ao, aunque no por este juego) , con algo ms de estilo de dibujos animados. El doblaje 
 est en espaol (eso es bueno, creo que la voz de Ace Ventura es la misma de la serie) y el resto 
 del sonido no es nada de otro mundo.
  
  El juego en s es corto, ms que nada para alguien con un poco de rodaje en el gnero, que no tendr 
 que pensarse dos veces los retos que nos proponen en el juego y los resolver al instante.
  
  Si eres un fan de este personaje, te gustan las aventuras grficas, lo encuentras a un precio 
 asequible y te va en tu nuevo ordenador (porque esa es otra) , comprarlo no sera un gran error.

Review:  The gameplay of this game is really hard. You have to solve puzzels where you don't know how to 
 solve. You have to try clicking evrything with mostly the same boring answer, NoOooOo ... This 
 game has no difficulty or learning curve, you just need to be lucky; you click on the right thing. 
 Out of that, the storyline is awesome and REALLY funny !
  The voice is just like Jim Carry (a. k. a. Ace Ventura in the movies) , I wonder if he did the voice 
 for this game. The game is not really short, that makes it great but at the same time boring.
  About the graphX: The game consists of chambres, those chambres are just one picture.
  You have 
 to click somewhere on the picture to go to another chambre or to zoom on an item.
  How are those "pictures" ? Well ... like in a cartoon with sunny colors. I'd say: it's like other 
 simple adventure games (can't mention something right now) but with sunny colours.
  I give it 7.4
