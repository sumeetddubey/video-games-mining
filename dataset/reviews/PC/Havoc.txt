:::Review:::
Imagine a gritty, Road Warrior-flavored version of Spectre VR with slopes, rough terrain, lots of 
 loud, violent explosions, and the occasional goofy arcade sound-effect, and you've got a pretty 
 good idea. 

 Submitted for your approval - I have this sorta casual, standing code concerning multiplayer action 
 games such as Doom, Quake, Marathon 2, and the like. Take the number of possible networked players 
 and multiply it by the number of times in 15 minutes you feel the need to hurl some unprintable 
 epithet at one of them: If the result equals or exceeds 100, it's probably a good game.   

 Havoc and I are hitting 144 just about now, and that's just when I'm playing the single-player games. 

 Havoc - an unsung semi-hero of a game from the folks who brought us the similarly unsung (but eerily 
 cool) Sensory Overload - is a fast-paced land-vehicle combat game that fuses the viewpoint and 
 weaponry of an extremely simplified tank title with the brainless fluidity of an arcade driving 
 game.   

 Up to 16 (!) players take the roles of corporate mercenaries piloting nimble cycles, muscular hovercraft 
 or fat, nasty heavy tanks across 35 levels of twisty, mountainous battlegrounds bristling with 
 gun turrets and crawling/flying with stupid but violent - and annoyingly quick - enemy armor units. 
 Tons of weapon types abound, and the interface sports a small but useful rear-view camera in the 
 low left field of view. Indeed, much of the new and interesting profanities you'll find yourself 
 uttering will be directed toward whichever heavily armed thing just shot you four times in the 
 face and went roaring by you in a blur, all but thumbing its nose at you and formally inviting 
 you to follow, usually while you're busy trying to kill something else for whatever power-ups or 
 gate-exit keys it will yield. The designers at Reality Bytes know this kind of drive-by is going 
 to piss you off, and they know it will probably end in quite the merry high-speed chase across 
 ridges and gorges. One has to admire (if not actually enjoy) this kind of calculated, clinical 
 evil.  

 Havoc is definitely redolent of an arcade game. Imagine a gritty, Road Warrior-flavored version 
 of Spectre VR with slopes, rough terrain, lots of loud, violent explosions, and the occasional 
 goofy arcade sound-effect, and you've got a pretty good idea. Vehicle control is simple and brutal, 
 satisfyingly devoid of anything like subtlety, and the picky player who prefers something more 
 exotic than bikes, hovercraft or tanks is always free to go suck eggs. Havoc is perhaps a tad no-frills, 
 but it plays great, and best of all is the fact that gamers on Windows and Mac platforms can play 
 together via modem or LAN... and in the end, nobody wants to shoot at anybody in quite the same 
 way that Mac users want to shoot at Windows users.
