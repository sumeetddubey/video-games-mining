:::Review:::
Sound like standard empire builder fare? Yes and no. 

 The year is 2380, and you're a tough, greedy colony founder laying claim to exploitable planetoids 
 in the far-flung fragmented sectors dominated by the golden rule - whoever has the gold (or the 
 Traxium, or the Barium) makes the rules. Unless the other guy simply has more missiles.   

 You must build your own fledgling colony from the ground up, putting into place living quarters, 
 radiation filters, hydration-hydroponics domes, mining facilities and the like. Although individual 
 planetoids are sprouting colonies like tough mechanical mushrooms, the shadow of the government 
 and the TetraCorp megacorporation falls across everything; federal transports arrive every month 
 or so, bringing potential new employees, supplies to purchase, and empty cargo bays to fill with 
 the ore each colony leader hopes to sell to the Federation. Eventually, individual asteroid colonies 
 will reach out and touch each other - sometimes with alliances, trade, gifts, and cooperation, 
 and sometimes with multiple-warhead missiles. Just how fragile certain allegiances are will become 
 immediately apparent, even at the so-called beginner level of difficulty. Don't get attached to 
 your first colony.  

 Sound like standard empire builder fare? Yes and no. Fragile Allegiance is a very tactical game, 
 with colonies represented at the individual building level. On the Asteroid View screen, you can 
 watch your colonies, which are beautifully and vividly displayed as clusters of structures grouped 
 together in the depression of a crater. Events such as ship liftoffs (all these ships can be individually 
 named, so you can feel even worse when you lose them) and missile launches are animated as they 
 happen; there's a funny little feeling inside, as an interplanetoid missile strike zips right out 
 of your silos in real time. Various types of ships and devices, of which there are many, require 
 specific ores, and you must keep constant track of which ores are available on your asteroids, 
 which must be purchased from the Feds, and which can be acquired through six alien nonplayer races. 
 You must also track which weapons can be (carefully) purchased on the black market, which disgruntled 
 supervisors may flip out and sabotage valuable sensor arrays before they leave in a huff, who is 
 allied with whom, and... ooops, that little radiation leak you got a vague warning about six minutes 
 ago turned out to be not so little, and your whole colony just did the Chernyobl Shuffle. Game 
 Over, just as soon as the local TetraCorp rep tells you, unnecessarily, what a moron you are. Insert 
 coin, bozo.  

 The good news is that Fragile Allegiance's imposing, sprawling mass of detail incorporates a number 
 of game tutorials and player-assist routines to keep your bewilderment to some kind of bearable 
 minimum; the bad news is, they don't help. A couple of ferinstances: The 'tutorials' - rather than 
 being step-by-step interactive demos to give first-time players help with their first few timid 
 steps - are nonstop, real-time animated movies narrated by a cultured female British voice. Of 
 course, by the time you have tracked the real-time movement of the onscreen 'turorial' cursor, 
 the scene has changed and the voice has merrily rambled on to another topic and screen full of 
 well-meaning but essentially meaningless icons that will only acquire meaning once you actually 
 play and use the control key to examine them; it's like the old comedy routine of the housewife 
 frantically trying to keep up with the cooking show on television, only this time it's not funny 
 because it's you.   

 Fragile Allegiance, graphically, has perhaps the most integrated look an empire builder has ever 
 sported, with very tight and clean control panel interfaces and completely iconic button-based 
 commands. Ultimately, it's very slick. Initially, it may be confusing, but holding the control 
 key over each screen element will give a pop-up description. The game supports eight-player interaction, 
 but a really good idea would be to progress through the various single-player scenarios first and 
 acquire the basic sense of what makes a colony work and how to fight with others.   

 Lukewarm-to-enthusiastic gamers who find many empire builders dry, ugly, and unengaging will probably 
 appreciate the more personal nature of Fragile Allegiance. On the other hand, veteran, teeth-clenching 
 types who eat Civilization for breakfast will probably consider Fragile Allegiance a public menace 
 for the very same reasons. One logistical misstep or well-placed warhead can ruin your whole fragile 
 day, and probably will. Proceed with caution.

Review:  This was the game I played over and over again in middle school. I don't understand why all the 
 PC Gamers and Gamespot reviewers gave this game bad reviews. I loved building up your asteroids, 
 setting up your fleets, customizing ships, and watching missiles take off and smash your enemies 
 (if you have spy satellites) . 
  
  Something different about this game was the ability to buy illegal weapons and information about 
 people you can hire, and the different races. I really liked how I could hire some colony managers 
 to take care of some of my asteroids (while I busied myself with my "war asteroids") . 
  
  This game also was nice because you can pick who your opponents were, and their difficulties varied. 
 If you just wanted to smash somebody, you picked the Rigellians. If you want a challenge, maybe 
 you picked the Braccadians? (don't remember how to spell) .
  
  I wish that they would put this game on steam, at least then I would be able to play it. It hasn't 
 worked for me since windows 98...

Review:  The first time I played the game, after playing countless other strategy games, I was pretty terrible. 
 It took me 2 weeks to learn the different tactics which are applied to this game. Firstly The game 
 offerers a new type of battle ground; open space and asteroids. Unlike other strategy games where 
 you would say be limited to the asteroid, this one offered the option of expanding beyond those 
 borders. Aside from all that there was also a whole new battleground, instead of having to attack 
 the enemy by force, the option was given to send in agents to swiftly destroy or cripple the asteroid 
 leaving your ships with no work (a down side was no ground units) , or if you feel like it use missiles 
 and leave your ships with no work. This game is all about politics and true strategies that would 
 be experienced on a real battleground.
