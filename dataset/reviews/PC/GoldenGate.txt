Golden Gate doesn't force its puzzles on you, and it doesn't require a nonsensical puzzle solving 
 genius, either. 

 The creators of Golden Gate, Ix Entertainment, have taken great pains to convey the beauty of San 
 Francisco in their "360-Degree Non-Linear Graphical Treasure Hunt" by utilizing over 2000 watercolor 
 paintings as the panorama for your quest. The watercolor graphics contain a touch of impressionistic 
 softness that really sets the look of Golden Gate apart from other first-person adventure games, 
 and this effect is successful in conveying the lush beauty of the San Francisco landscape.   

 
 In Golden Gate, you stroll through San Francisco's famous landmarks, keeping an eye open for the 
 clues you will need to unfold secrets of the past. Objects found and collected will aid your effort, 
 but you are never bombarded with a bulging inventory, wondering where or when you are ever going 
 to use that "one-legged pink flamingo statue." Golden Gate doesn't force its puzzles on you, and 
 it doesn't require a nonsensical puzzle solving genius, either. This is a relaxing quest, a vacation 
 of sorts, that recommends use of awareness and logical talents to solve its sequential conundrums. 
 (One item that is required early is the Avalon Necklace, found after completing the Chart Wheel 
 Puzzle in Fisherman's Wharf. This item is needed to "see" eight video-clues, so try for that one 
 first, as the video clips are both crucial to the game and historically interesting.)  

 There are over 70 minutes of ambient soundtrack throughout Golden Gate. Each area of the game is 
 accompanied by an original musical score reflecting the unique mood of the location. The quality 
 of music is so high that you may find yourself taking advantage of the "jukebox" mode on the CD 
 and leaving it on in the background of your next cocktail party. The music is a perfectly complements 
 gameplay, and it immerses you in Golden Gate's seamless scenario. As you move through locations, 
 scenes scroll into each other. If this effect bothers you, you can change it via the hidden taskbar 
 at the top of the screen.  

 Golden Gate is a beautiful adventure, a haunting mystery, and a fine substitute for paying the outrageous 
 rents required to see these San Francisco vistas for real.

Review:  Honestly, I picked this game up in the bargain bin of an obscure little gaming store in an obscure 
 little town in Michigan. 
  
  Why? I was feeling homesick.
  
  Now, I've played (and torn my hair out playing) Myst and this game is quite similar in some respects, 
 such as puzzle solving (not nearly as obscure) , point and click slide show animation (based entirely 
 on photographed-then-watercolored photos of Bay Area locations) , and a strange, but entertaining 
 story.
  
  The graphics are, well, wonderful for 1996, and quite unique in the fact that they took photographs, 
 painted watercolors over them, then digitalized them. Entirely real locations with additional painted 
 bits. It gives the game style.
  
  The sound is minimal at best, and throughout the game your given a vaguely disquieting sense that 
 aside from an occasional creaky boat, or gibbering seagull, you are the only person wandering the 
 city. It's a great effect, but most likely unintentional.
  
  All in all, it's a fun game to blow some time on, and if you find a copy in the bargain bin, it's 
 well worth the few bucks it might cost you.
  
  
  Of course, the main reason for my recommendation: This game made me want to visit Angel Island.
 
  
  That's quite a feat in and of itself.
