:::Review:::
If this haphazard collection of minigames was the best the developer could muster for an Apprentice 
 game, The Donald may be due for a firing spree. 

  Opening up a PC game to find that it contains no manual of any kind is usually a good indication 
 that you're not going to be in store for a particularly involving game. This is the case with The 
 Apprentice, the PC game based on the titular hit reality show starring everyone's favorite New 
 York real-estate mogul and occasionally creepy sound-byte provider, Donald Trump. Instead of a 
 unique spin on the business tycoon genre, or even a halfway-decent minigame collection, what we 
 get is a small series of minigames that look like they were programmed in Flash, rehash many of 
 the same game concepts repeatedly to pad out the experience, and are universally not fun. This 
 could have just as easily been a really lousy downloadable freeware game, were it not for The Donald's 
 scowling mug appearing on the cover. Needless to say,  Apprentice  fans won't have much fun with 
 this one.  

          Want to work for The Donald? Then sell those delicious hamburgers!      

  Here's the 
 setup. You start out by picking your gender (which barely matters, since all you see is a black 
 outline of a person anyway) and a team name. You're then paired up with four other former Apprentice 
 contestants -- yes, they actually went and got Omarosa to lend her likeness (or, at least, a single, 
 static shot of her) to this game. You're competing against a team of five other contestants to 
 get hired by Mr. Trump. To do so, you'll have to run around doing the silliest of imaginable tasks. 

  So how do you get hired by Trump? By selling fast food as quick as you can, selling souvenirs around 
 Manhattan's various neighborhoods, and building lamps, among other things. There are a few basic 
 minigame concepts that you will see assorted variations of in this game. One is a Diner Dash-like 
 game where you have to put together varying types of food orders and deliver them to waiting customers 
 posthaste. Another is an assembly game where pieces of a three-tiered product will move along a 
 conveyor belt in random order, and it's up to you to adjust the directions of the conveyor belt 
 to get the pieces in the right order. Yet another asks you to buy merchandise and transport it 
 to a part of town where you'll make a profit selling it. The last primary variety of game is a 
 simple picture puzzle where the pieces are jumbled, and you need to assemble it correctly. So, 
 there you have it: a collection of games that you can play better versions of for free or significantly 
 cheaper elsewhere on the Internet. Not only are these games overly simplistic, they're just not 
 that much fun. So why would you pay $20 for such a scant collection of lame games? Oh, right. The 
 Donald is on the box.  

  There is one more game type to play if you happen to lose one of the minigame challenges. If you 
 lose, you go to the boardroom to be grilled by Trump and his assistants. He'll ask you and two 
 of your teammates direct questions about why you failed. Then, it's up to you to unscramble a group 
 of letters to form a word. That word never answers The Donald's question. It's just some business 
 term like "wealth" or "accrue." Solving the puzzle saves you and drops your opponents' respect. 
 The opponent with the least respect at the end is fired. In this case, maybe getting fired is a 
 blessing.  

          Thank god.     

  Most offensive of all, however, is how cheaply The Apprentice handles its license. This game presents 
 itself horribly. It looks like it was programmed hastily with Macromedia, with all the characters 
 appearing as weirdly drawn cartoon versions of themselves. The minigames all look cheesy and cheap, 
 and visually, very little ever goes on in them. On the audio front, you do get a few choice lines 
 of dialogue from a fairly bored-sounding Donald Trump -- or maybe it's just a bad sound-alike; it's 
 impossible to tell -- but that's the extent of the audio highlights.  

  It's not surprising that someone would put together a dumb cash-in game based on  The Apprentice 
 . What is surprising is how wildly off the mark this game is in how much it completely misses the 
 point of what makes the show entertaining. Not to mention that you can be over and done with everything 
 this game has to offer in a matter of 20 minutes flat, as that's about as long as it takes to complete 
 a single "season" of the show. In the end, The Apprentice is not merely a cheap cash-in on a license; 
 it transcends mere cash-in into insultingly awful territory. Stay away.

Review:  The Apprentice falls under a category of games that expose popular movies and people. This game... unfortunately... is 
 the worst of its kind. I thought that I might learn something about the business world from the 
 Trump, but all I learned is that when a game has only one CD inside... with no instruction manuals 
 or bonus features.... don't even consider adding it to your game collection.
  
  The game is set up so that there are a small amount of mini games to choose from. All of the mini 
 games are boring... repetitive... and just plain stupid. The Apprentice does not deserve to be on 
 the shelves of a video game storeand should feel privileged to be allowed in any discount pile 
 or even on the side of a low quality cereal box. But hey, I'm giving it one point above the minimum 
 rating. So what's that one point worth? It's easy to install... and easier to un-install.
  
  Donald Trump... I hope to god that you didn't look at this game before releasing it to the public. 
 To the person that gave this game permission to be sold... fire him... fire him right now before 
 he releases a Martha Stewart version of The Apprentice Game.
  
  Peace Out

Review:  The Good: Nothing.
  
  The Bad: The graphics looks like it was made by flash. The sound is the worst. A really bad collection 
 of minigames. $20.
  
  From the tv show where 10 people are in a competition to win a job to work with Donald Trump. Like 
 the show survivor, they made it into a game. The game survivor contained abysmal graphics, the 
 worst gameplay, and the collection of the minigames is the worst ever. The apprentice, has the 
 same situation. This game wouldn't even be a good freeware game.
  
  What activites are they're? One of the activities is that you must sell around $70 of burgurs. 
 Who knew that as simple as working in McDonalds will get you a job with Donald. In this type of 
 minigame, you must do a certain burger combination of the burgers. I don't want to be mean, but 
 I found a free game that is better then this minigame. Another one is to put a belt in the right 
 order. And, the worst ever, you must solve a jigsaw puzzle within the time limit. These jobs get's 
 you mininum wage, and some of them aren't even jobs. And still, you get a chance to work for Donald.
 
  
  If you lose, you're with two other people, and when Donald asks you a question, you must unscramble 
 a word before the other two people do. These answers has nothing to do with the question at all. 
 Anyway, you drop the other two people's respect. And if you get the lowest, you're fired!
  
  For the final word, this game has graphics that looks like it was made with flash, and the 
 sound sounds like it was made with a $2 microphone. The minigames here is seriously the dumbest 
 ever, and you can beat the game in 20 minutes. I suggest that you only try this game if you're 
 drunk, and/or if it's free.
