:::Review:::
The fantasy aspect of Legends '98 extends beyond teams and scheduling and into actual gameplay. 
 

 If things had gone as planned, Accolade would have shipped Legends Football '98 a year ago - with 
 the name Legends Football '97, of course - and the current release would be the upgrade to an already 
 successful football game. When it became clear there was no way the product could ship on time 
 and still have all the features envisioned for the game, Accolade wisely decided to postpone the 
 release for a year. Now, Legends Football is finally here, and even though another year of work 
 has gone into the game, and it's sitting on store shelves, the game is still not ready.  

 The big selling point for Legends '98 is that it includes teams and players from four different 
 eras of football: 1932, 1950, 1968, and 1997. There's obviously a lot of potential for fantasy 
 match-ups here, and Legends '98 lets you structure those match-ups however you like. Regardless 
 of how you mix and match teams from different eras, it's up to you to decide which rules will be 
 in force. You'd think the 1997 Packers would probably be a shoo-in against the 1932 Bears, for 
 instance, but not if that Packers team had to slash its roster, and each starter played both sides 
 of the ball. As de facto commissioner you have the power to create custom teams, leagues, and schedules 
 regardless of which era you're working with.   

 It's an intriguing concept, but the problem is that the fantasy aspect of Legends '98 extends beyond 
 teams and scheduling and into actual gameplay. Before I get into specifics, however, I've got to 
 point out that I tested the game using 15-minute quarters because, well, because that's the way 
 football is played, damn it. Some might argue that many of my complaints about unrealistic results 
 would be eliminated by changing the quarter length to five or ten minutes, but to me that would 
 be the same as playing a baseball simulation using three or six innings for each game. No, for 
 a football sim to be realistic and fun it has to produce realistic results when played according 
 to the real rules. And whatever else you have to say about Legends '98, it sure as heck doesn't 
 produce realistic results.   

 Taking control of my long-suffering Minnesota Vikings, I began the 1997 season using 15-minute quarters 
 (all other realism options, including penalties, injuries, and fatigue, were activated) . After 
 simulating the first week of play, I decided to check out the stats - and almost fell over at what 
 I saw, as several teams racked up over 600 yards in passing and no one in the league fell below 
 250-plus passing yards. Yes, it was ludicrous - but what made it even more dumbfounding was that 
 rushing yardage was abysmally low. Only four teams managed to break the century mark on the ground, 
 around a dozen managed to pile up between 50 and 90 rushing yards, another dozen fell between zero 
 and 50, and two somehow managed to lose rushing yardage for the entire game.   

 If passing yardage had skyrocketed because of 15-minute quarters - which I don't think is a valid 
 excuse, but I'm mentioning it anyway - then rushing yardage should be inflated, too. What these 
 numbers told me was that computer-controlled teams in Legends '98 don't even begin to play like 
 their real-life counterparts; instead, their play selection is more like what you'd expect from 
 two kids passing on every down in a video game.  

 Continuing to simulate the season, I reached week three and decided I'd control the Vikes at home 
 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers - and it was here that I saw firsthand how those numbers were 
 getting put up. After one quarter of play, the score was tied 42-42; I returned four kickoffs and 
 one punt for touchdowns, and Trent Dilfer threw five scoring strikes (three from the Bucs' side 
 of the 50-yard line) . Mike Alstott and Warrick Dunn, the bread-and-butter guys of Tampa's offense, 
 barely touched the ball - but of course there's no reason they should when Dilfer's on track for 
 a 20-touchdown game. That same week, offensive powerhouses like the New York Giants and Baltimore 
 Ravens scored 11 touchdowns each.  

 So it's pretty clear that Legends '98 isn't the game for players in search of a realistic football 
 simulation. That in and of itself wouldn't invalidate it from being a fun little arcade exercise, 
 but sadly Legends '98 is a big letdown in nearly every department you care to look at. Player graphics 
 are chunky and blocky - you can't even make out the numbers on the players' jerseys - and there's 
 almost no visual distinction between players: A lineman and a wide receiver look almost identical. 
 Players and coaches on the sideline are a two-dimensional wall, and, what's worse, even those subpar 
 graphics break up as the "camera" pans from the sideline back to the field.  

 Incredibly, Legends '98 doesn't have mouse support, forcing you to navigate myriad menus using a 
 gamepad, joystick, or keyboard, making an already cumbersome process even clunkier and more confusing. 
 Because play selection and pass receivers are color-coded based on the Gravis Gamepad, you get 
 anomalies such as a receiver running downfield with the word "green" under him - which might make 
 you think it's a player whose last name is Green, since names are displayed for other selected 
 players. Another interface problem is that if you decide you want the QB to run on a passing play, 
 you can't jump, dive, or spin - those buttons will simply make him throw to one of the receivers. 
   

 And the list of problems goes on. There are no instructions in either the manual or README file 
 for defensive moves, no way to change turf type in preseason games (which are often not played 
 at either team's home stadium) , almost no penalties (the only one I saw was when I purposefully 
 jumped offsides) , no box scores so you can easily see the score of a simulated game, incorrect 
 displays in the stat screens, no decimal points are used in averages for running and passing, and 
 if you switch between team and individual stats you'll get incorrect displays. And the play-by-play 
 commentary is nothing but "third and eight!" or "Complete!" - a big letdown after something like 
 NHL '97 or even Madden '97.  

 Legends '98 promised to combine the intensity of a Madden '97 with the statistical realism of FPS: 
 Football Pro - and delivers neither. It's hard to believe that this is the best Accolade could 
 come up with after an extra year of work.
