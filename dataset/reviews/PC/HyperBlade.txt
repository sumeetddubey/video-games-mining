HyperBlade should provide a half-pipe of joy for sports and action game fans alike. 

 If the recreational, violent world of Activision's HyperBlade were a reality, it would be every 
 hockey fan's dream - and every hockey player's nightmare. In the fantasy future where the newfangled 
 game of HyperBlade takes place, the rules governing popular sporting events - at least the humane 
 rules - have become pretty scarce. As the member of a "blading" team (maybe the term "team" should 
 be replaced with "mercenary squad") , you must compete in several international arenas to become 
 head of the class - or lose your head trying. Combining elegant, silken 3-D graphics with ultrarealistic 
 character movement and exhilarating yet harsh gameplay, HyperBlade is sure to win over those sports 
 gamers who want to see a little bit more blood hit the ice.  

 Well, you're not exactly on ice in HyperBlade, you're just trying to put your opponents on ice, 
 so to speak. Your team consists of three players, each armed with a "jak" (a throwing-slashing 
 device) and clad in about as much protective shielding as they can afford to wear. Two of these 
 teammates are controlled as your offense, and one is a goalie. You can customize your team by selecting 
 players of varying skill at the start-up screen; some players excel in speed, others in strength, 
 etc. A typical match begins when an electronic puck or "rok" is ejected into the air. The competitors 
 then skate around the huge hyperbolic arena, vie for possession of the rok, pass it around, and 
 toss it into the goal. The rules are just that simple, because after that, anything goes.   

 Between the two goals at either end of the arena, there are several jumps and obstacles to maneuver. 
 You can send your player catapulting into the air with strategically located ramps or activate 
 turnstiles which make a salad of the next poor fellow who runs into them. Trip mines and missile 
 projectiles can also be picked up and deployed, toppling any opponent who is trailing you.   

 
 Toppling isn't the only evasive tactic at your disposal, as good sportsmanship quickly gives way 
 to merciless brutality. There are several attack moves that you can test out on your competition. 
 Body-checking an opponent will send him sprawling helplessly onto the court, losing the rok if 
 it's in his possession. To really make the opponent cry out in agony, you can try slashing. And 
 if you slash him enough times, you'll actually be able to decapitate him, carry his disembodied 
 cranium over to the goal, and toss it in as if you were in some sort of Aztec basketball tournament. 
 Pretty sick ideas here. But watch out for the other team's goalie, because he or she may swoop 
 down and unjustifiably kick the crap out of you simply for treading on the wrong turf.   

 The developers of this game seem to have gone all out to create a believable atmosphere. A lot of 
 time went into rendering the skaters' actions and, judging from their incredible fluidity of movement, 
 the effort was well worth it. At times, your skater will have to perform dramatic rail slides and 
 aerials off the sides of the arena, or go for a power shot during the climactic last seconds of 
 a round. The celebratory explosions, sirens, and uproarious crowd cheers, accompanied by a pulsating 
 soundtrack, add to the dramatic tension of each match.   

 As a competitor in the Hyperdrome, you're bestowed with all the glory of an internationally competing 
 sports hero. But by the same token, you're constantly reminded of the fact that you're only a sacrificial 
 dupe, risking your neck for the enjoyment of a sick, fury-driven crowd. This is the sinister, immersive 
 environment that HyperBlade creates for the player. Little nuances, like the despondency with which 
 the players keel over and die, and the participants' preliminary stretches that seem to say "another 
 backbreaking day at the 'drome," effectively suck you into the dark theme. Whether you're 
 play this over a network or just try and beat the computer, HyperBlade should provide a half-pipe 
 of joy for sports and action game fans alike.
