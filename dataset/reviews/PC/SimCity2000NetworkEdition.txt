:::Review:::
Although Maxis' latest SimMutation was not developed to give you the network carnage-fest experience 
 of a WarCraft II or a Command & Conquer, you'll still have your chance to raise a little hell in 
 the land of Sims. 

 "Hey! What happened to my bridge?" screamed a SimCommissioner.   

 "Oops, seems you needed to own the land on both ends of the bridge to keep me from bulldozing 
 it down," I answered.   

 "So, that's the way you want it, huh?" he replied. "Okay, let's play."  

 Welcome to SimCity 
 2000 Network Edition. Although Maxis' latest SimMutation was not developed to give you the network 
 carnage-fest experience of a WarCraft II or a Command &amp; Conquer, you'll still have your chance 
 to raise a little hell in the land of Sims. However, if you're looking for a new fast-paced network 
 game, don't get too excited. This version is essentially SimCity 2000 with a few gameplay enhancements 
 and features that elevate it to the network level of amusement.   

 The premise of SimCity 2000 remains intact - build a city from the ground up  but now you 
 can strive to create a land of milk and honey (or bread and water) for your Sims with up to three 
 other SimFanatics. Although you won't be able to inflict disease or provoke a riot in a neighboring 
 community - you're still limited to natural disasters and traditional demolition techniques - you 
 can chat with fellow SimCommissioners, create contracts to swap resources, and vote collectively 
 on city ordinances. It's now city by committee.  

 In addition to network play, the algorithm wizards at Maxis have added a few new features to the 
 urban development simulation experience. Gone are the days of simply zoning property on a whim. 
 Now you must factor in the cost of purchasing the land before you develop it. The purchase even 
 goes through an escrow period before you are entitled to it. Conversely, if you're tight on cash 
 you can sell land back and if its value has increased due to your business savoir-faire, you can 
 make a profit on the deal. Sadly, the ability to lease your land to others is absent from the property 
 management toolbar. And, except for a modest overhaul of the toolbars and fewer natural disasters, 
 die-hard SimCity fans will find little difference in the aesthetics of the game. No city-destroying 
 monsters in this one either.  

 Only when the race to gobble up the land is over (and this will take quite a while to accomplish 
 in any mode but African Swallow) , will you truly experience the networking nuances of this game. 
 That's when the ability to shrewdly bargin for precious resources will separate the SimMasters 
 from the SimNovices.  

 If you're a SimFanatic on the verge of joining SA (SimAnonymous) in order to get your next SimFix, 
 this new twist on SimCity 2000 will certainly appeal to you. At least now you'll have some companionship 
 on your never-ending journey to provide the proper balance of zoned property to a race smaller 
 than the people of Liliput. Just remember to own all the property you build a bridge on.

  And that how i know the game. Its because my dad friend bought Sim City 3000 and look that i love

  And 
 in the game once you know how to do it you win the game each time and get to the big building and 
 then you destroy all the town with disaster and you start over again. And the best disaster is 
 to make a nuclear reactor blow up!!!!

  And 
 there a nice multiplayer

Review:  It might not be Sim City 4, but it is everything I expected!
  
  The networking was easy to set up and can be done over the internet, which is much better than 
 games where you almost have to know the other persons great great grandfather from China to get 
 in!
  
  After starting, the game plays out just like normal, but there is more than one person controlling 
 the city!
  
  The graphics are amazing for a 1996 game, but the music leaves a bit to be desired. It is the same 
 song over and over again, and it doesn't even loop.
  
  Overall this game is a lot of fun, but it feels like they rushed the concept a bit. If you like 
 Sim City, this game is for you. If you don't, your weird but this game isn't for you.
