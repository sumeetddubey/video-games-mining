:::Review:::
Even after playing the game all the way through a handful of times, I still couldn't tell you what 
 80% of the main plot was about. 

 The interactive movie is still an undefined animal in its early evolutionary stages, based on a 
 vague vision shared by filmmakers and game developers. The concept that the viewer can make choices 
 that will instantaneously affect the outcome of a motion picture is compelling. However, even with 
 new strides in compression technology, the computer isn't an ideal film or video-playback machine, 
 just as the VCR and film projector aren't adequate as computing devices that keep track of your 
 input and choose appropriate movie clips to string together. So for the time being, innovative 
 projects like Psychic Detective are as close we get to the dream of a true interactive cinematic 
 experience.  

 Together with noted animation and production house Colossal Pictures of MTV's Liquid Television 
 and Aeon Flux fame, Electronic Arts has assembled a valiant but jumbled effort with this campy 
 supernatural thriller. The whole movie-game is filmed from the first-person perspective, so be 
 prepared for lots of jerky camera movements and in-your-face conversations. You can use your psychic 
 powers to jump into the heads of other characters and see through their eyes, or you can keep your 
 point of view and try to control others' minds by "throwing" mood suggestions such as aggression, 
 affection, or submission.   

 At first glance, Psychic Detective appears to be a highly approachable game with film-like qualities 
 that draw you into its rich storyline. Upon closer observation, though, the game plays like a number 
 of miniature plot lines mashed together with no unifying thread. I found myself opting not to interact, 
 just so I could attempt to have a congruous experience from one person's point of view. If you 
 play the game the way you're intended tomind-hopping, psyche-reading, and emotion-throwing -- it 
 is a triple CD set of visual impressions that travels liberally through multiple perspectives, 
 times, and settings resulting in a mysterious combination of clips that only a real detective could 
 unravel. Even after playing the game all the way through a handful of times, I still couldn't tell 
 you what 80% of the main plot was about.  

 Methinks that Hollywood has a very different idea of what an interactive movie should look and feel 
 like. Psychic Detective has too many story branches and mind-hopping options for its own good. 
 Instead of being like a good movie enhanced by interactivity, Psychic Detective is a more like 
 a movie (I still couldn't tell you if it's a good one or not) clouded with interactive options 
 that eventually detract from the project.
