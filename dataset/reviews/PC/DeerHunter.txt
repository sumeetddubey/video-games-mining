:::Review:::
While Deer Hunter may be fun and charming the first few times you play the game, it doesn't go much 
 beyond that. 

 After countless fishing games, someone realized there was a market for a deer hunting game. And 
 although extremely simple in its graphics and interface, Deer Hunter has managed to capture the 
 hearts of PC hunters everywhere.   

 You start the hunt by choosing one of three weapons: rifle, shotgun, or bow. You can then try to 
 get a feel for your weapon at the target range, or you can pick a place to go hunting from three 
 locations: the autumn woodlands of Arkansas, the forests of Colorado, or the snowy landscape of 
 Indiana.   

 Once you have selected an area to hunt, you'll see a screen that shows a map of the immediate area 
 you are hunting. From this screen you move a symbol that represents your hunter and his field of 
 vision. When moving the symbol on the edge of tree lines and along game trails you will come across 
 signs of activity such as deer droppings, rubbings, and beds. At this point you click on the hunt 
 button to load up a first-person view of an area you selected. - (though not a true 3D first-person 
 view as in Quake II, but more like a static drawing of a landscape a la Riven) . Actually, the whole 
 setup is rather reminiscent of Sierra's S. W. A. T. From this view you have several options - you 
 can either pull out your weapon, use binoculars to take a closer look at things, use the deer call, 
 or rattle deer horns together to try and lure a big buck into range. But just as in real life, 
 big bucks are wary of hunters.   

 The deer AI is pretty good; for instance, the deer run away if you let them get downwind of you 
 on the map screen. In the first-person view, however, the deer appear to be a little more tolerant 
 to the presence of a hunter than in real life. For the first PC deer hunting game, the AI will 
 do - but the jerky interface, which makes it very difficult to aim, simply won't.  

 Deer Hunter may be neat to show your hunting partners for five minutes - or to play every once in 
 a great while - but for the most part the game has little in the way of longevity. It's fun to 
 blast deer and all, but after a few kills, the limited animations and play mechanics lead you rather 
 quickly to the conclusion that while Deer Hunter may be fun and charming the first few times you 
 play the game, it doesn't go much beyond that.   

 Don't get me wrong. I think the game is solid, and anyone who enjoys deer hunting will enjoy seeing 
 it visually realized on the computer screen. But for those of you who don't like hunting, Deer 
 Hunter isn't going to change your mind.

Review:  Deer Hunter is a simple little hunting game that is far beyond mediocre as others may say. Deer 
 Hunter was a favorite of mine growing up. You must hunt for deer, of course and you have very little 
 choices. You have a few well done locations to hunt in. However, for gameplay issues, you are only 
 in one spot, and you must wait for a deer to run out of the woods and you must shoot it before 
 it runs back into the woods, which commonly happens if you miss once or twice. You have locations 
 that look like photogrpahed nature, but the graphics on some things don't look too great. However, 
 the woods designs are quite nice.
  
  You only have a choice of three weapons, a rifle, a shotgun, and a bow. You also have a call, a 
 pair of binocular and a few other useful items for your hunt. You can hunt in a treestand if you 
 want. The size of the deer range, and if it is a good one, it goes into the trophy. You could get 
 some pretty big bucks.
  
  Overall, it's a plain and simple underesitmated hunting game.
