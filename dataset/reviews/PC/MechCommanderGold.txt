:::Review:::
Its new features can be easily taken for granted, while its new campaign feels familiar enough that 
 MechCommander Gold ends up just as frustrating as the original. 

 FASA Interactive was onto something with MechCommander, which combined the complexity and detail 
 of the MechWarrior simulations with the scope and style of an action-packed tactical real-time 
 strategy game. Unfortunately, its unreasonable difficulty and other design oversights prevented 
 MechCommander from being all it could have been. One year later, MechCommander Gold sets out to 
 right those wrongs by adding more control functionality and other features intended to improve 
 the game substantially. It also includes a new campaign on top of the original set of 30 missions. 
 However, one year later, all its purported new features can be easily taken for granted, while 
 its new campaign feels familiar enough that MechCommander Gold ends up just as frustrating as the 
 original, if only because it still has so much going for it.  

 For example, MechCommander still looks fantastic - the six BattleMechs added in the new Desperate 
 Measures campaign blend right in with the previously available models, and like all the rest, each 
 one of these is precisely animated and articulated in spite of its small size onscreen. MechCommander's 
 attention to detail - how the mechs topple trees, accelerate to a run, fall to the ground from 
 an explosive hit, and detonate when they sustain too much damage - is still astounding. The new 
 campaign spans a dozen missions on the planet Cermak, whose ominous cityscapes and industrial wastelands 
 make a perfect setting for all these mechs, new and old, to do battle. However, the game's interface 
 screens, in which you manage your mechs and purchase components, haven't stood the test of time 
 quite as well and look cluttered and confusing.   

 Also, MechCommander Gold doesn't sound any different than before, and while the muted, bass-heavy 
 weapon-firing effects still sound right on, your mech pilots' muffled and repetitive commentary 
 will quickly grow tiresome once again. At least the game's dynamic soundtrack, which responds to 
 whatever is happening onscreen, remains effective.  

 You'll be able to coordinate whatever is happening onscreen better than before, thanks to several 
 notable control enhancements. Then again, all these enhancements seem like they should have been 
 a part of MechCommander a year ago. You can now issue waypoint movement commands, order your mechs 
 to attack with their energy weapons to conserve ammunition, and initiate artillery strikes with 
 a hotkey rather than by clicking on the interface. You can also adjust each mission's difficulty 
 by choosing from three different settings, which makes the game a lot less frustrating. Unfortunately, 
 this doesn't help the game's replay value any since the settings merely adjust your units' weapon 
 and armor strength, rather than the force and number of your enemies. In addition, players who 
 were dismayed to find that they could not save their progress during the original MechCommander 
 missions and that each of those missions was shrouded in a Command &amp; Conquer-style fog of war 
 for no apparent reason will find that these design decisions remain firmly in place.  

 Fortunately, many scenarios in the expansion campaign have on-site repair bays you can use to bring 
 your walking tanks back into fighting shape on the fly, leaving you some room for error where there 
 was little or none in the original campaign. This, along with the added control functions, helps 
 make MechCommander more enjoyable and easier than before. If you're experienced with the original 
 release, you'll find you can beat many of the expansion campaign's missions on the first try, whereas 
 the original scenarios took ten times as long. Even so, MechCommander Gold isn't an easy game by 
 most standards and still demands equal parts strategic planning, tactical attention, and luck. 

 MechCommander Gold's map editor enhances the game's value to whatever margin such supplements ever 
 can, while its ten new multiplayer maps and handful of new weapons are more a footnote than anything 
 noteworthy. As such, there's very little in MechCommander Gold to justify purchasing the game all 
 over again. And the fact that the Desperate Measures campaign isn't sold separately suggests the 
 game isn't intended for those who've already played MechCommander anyway, but is instead designed 
 to appeal to those who passed up the original for one reason or another. MechCommander Gold is 
 a subtle enhancement to a nearly excellent real-time strategy game. However, its limited scope 
 will feel frustratingly familiar to MechCommander veterans, although newcomers should enjoy the 
 game in its more refined state.

Review:  Some say it's too tough, others say it's impossible. But I've beat it several times and I keep 
 returning for more. It's a thinking man's game. But each mission has one or more solutions you 
 just have to find it. I like the concept that it's mostly combat; you don't have to worry about 
 capturing planets or building factories. Your resources are limited but if you don't tear them 
 up too bad you get to keep what you kill. So by keeping your warriors alive, selling captured mechs 
 and weapons that you don't need and by wisely spending the resource points you get from winning 
 a battle and selling your excess you can build a juggernaut. If your more plucky than lucky you 
 can still fight and win even with smaller and shot up captured mechs. The strategies that have 
 helped me more than anything else are:
  1. as much as possible keep the battle long range. Your enemy seems to delight in mechs that have 
 massive up close firepower. 2. If you have to defend or take and hold a position use mine layers 
 (in a big way) .
  3. If you have the resource points by all the mech refit trucks that come up for sale, you'll probably 
 need them. And if you have a moment before the mission ends, and can take the time, using the refit 
 trucks to repair your mechs in-game will save a lot of resource points.
