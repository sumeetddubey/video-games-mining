Strange Adventures is an addictive little game that you can lose yourself in for a few minutes at 
 a time. 

 Cheapass Games is known by board-game aficionados as a publisher of simple, fast, and surprisingly 
 fun games with fairly low production values and very low prices. Strange Adventures in Infinite 
 Space translates almost everything that is fun about this type of gaming to the computer without 
 feeling like a computer port of something you'd have found 20 years ago in  Dragon  magazine. Paradoxically, 
 the concept and mechanics of Strange Adventures are very similar to those of the old magazine games. 
 The graphics are extremely dated, and the sound is minimal, but the basic idea and implementation 
 are outstanding.           Strange Adventures is easy to pick up and play.    

 The game's concept is simple: You're presented with a playing field of roughly 15 stars. Your task 
 is to explore as many of them as possible in 10 years, bring back as many valuable artifacts and 
 exotic life-forms to your home planet as you can, and defeat as many aliens as possible along the 
 way. Traveling from star to star is measured in days, and passing through nebulae significantly 
 increases your travel time, so you have to plan your travels somewhat. Once you reach an unexplored 
 system, you are presented with an encounter. It can be an alien race, an artifact, a new life-form, 
 or perhaps a friendly starship that will join your flotilla. As you proceed from system to system, 
 you collect your findings and fight (or trade with) aliens in preparation for bringing your booty 
 back to your home system.   

  Your starship has upgradeable components that you can improve as you find new items in your travels. 
 Many of the things you find will be useful to you on board your craft. Early on you have basic 
 weapons, shields, and drives, but after a few chance encounters with some new ships, as well as 
 the acquisition of a new weapon or two, your little armada can become quite formidable. Because 
 this is completely random, you'll find some games where you're completely on your own, and others 
 where you're a miniature fleet admiral. Part of the fun of the game is taking advantage of opportunities 
 to fight when they're presented to you by chance.   

  Starship combat involves a pauseable real-time system that takes weapon ranges, ship speed, and 
 component types into account. There are a number of alien races you can encounter, and there is 
 even a combat simulator in which you can test out various weapons and strategies against different 
 enemies. One of the most amusing episodes we experienced was the sight of a ship being harassed 
 by a single tiny fighter. Because the ship was only armed with slow missiles, it could never get 
 them to hit the fighter, which kept outmaneuvering the attacks. However, the fighter could not 
 inflict enough damage to punch through the larger ship's shields. The result was a standoff that 
 was as whimsical as the game itself.           Single sessions don't last long, but there's plenty 
 of replay value.    

 The randomness of the game makes it difficult to plan a strategy, since so much depends on what 
 your encounters present to you. If you're lucky to find an improved interstellar drive early on, 
 you'll likely be able to explore most of the planets and get a high score. However, it's quite 
 possible that at some point on your return journey you'll run into a previously undiscovered black 
 hole and have to choose between turning back and going a different way or proceeding and possibly 
 being blown up. Since the game penalizes you heavily for taking longer than 10 years to carry out 
 your mission, you'll seriously hurt your score if you retreat, so you have little choice but to 
 proceed. These types of random encounters make Strange Adventures seem a bit like an adventure 
 game, where you don't quite know what's going to happen and are in a sense just along for the ride. 
   

  The game's short length is what makes it so engaging. In a longer game, the random nature of the 
 encounters and lack of player input would become frustrating, but since you can finish a game in 
 five to 15 minutes, you can always just start another one immediately afterward. Strange Adventures 
 is an addictive little game much like Bejeweled or Tetris, but instead of being a puzzle, it's 
 a little adventure that you can lose yourself in for a few minutes at a time. For $15, it's a great 
 buy that will end up being one of those games you keep running in the background and fire up for 
 a while when you need a break. Designers Rich Carlson and Iikka Keranen have managed to capture 
 the feeling of "what will happen next?" that marked gameplay in very early computer games, with 
 a style that is attractive today.
