:::Review:::
The thrill of being able to fully and freely explore the game's imaginative and remarkably lifelike 
 worlds often proves to be the biggest incentive for pushing past Myst IV's near-impenetrable puzzle 
 barriers. 

  The latest in the beloved Myst series of graphical adventure games capably continues the traditions 
 that started more than 10 years ago. Like its predecessors, Myst IV Revelation is a deliberately 
 paced first-person-perspective adventure game whose controls are almost instantly intuitive -- and 
 yet its incredibly complex and challenging puzzles are about as far from instantly intuitive as 
 possible. However, as with most great adventure games, there's a cohesive underlying logic to the 
 Myst IV's lengthy series of complicated trials. Furthermore, this latest chapter in the Myst series 
 features some dazzlingly beautiful sights and amazing sounds. Much of the game is truly a wonder 
 to behold, and while unraveling the story will probably be an interesting incentive for longtime 
 fans of Myst, it's the thrill of being able to fully and freely explore the game's imaginative 
 and remarkably lifelike worlds that often proves to be the biggest incentive for pushing past Myst 
 IV's near-impenetrable puzzle barriers. Then again, solving the game's puzzles can be very rewarding; 
 just be sure to bring plenty of patience and a keen eye for detail.  

          Prepare for a lengthy, highly challenging, and graphically stunning adventure in Myst IV 
 Revelation.     

  Though your familiarity with previous Myst games is not necessarily assumed by Myst IV Revelation, 
 its storyline is heavily intertwined with previous entries in the series. Longtime Myst fans will 
 catch numerous references to earlier games, and they will most appreciate the ability to gain a 
 lot of new insight into Myst's main characters, including the Da Vincian scientist Atrus and his 
 scheming sons, Sirrus and Achenar. Even if you aren't already familiar with these characters, there's 
 a good chance that they'll readily endear themselves to you, thanks to the game's use of live actors 
 in its full-motion video plot sequences. The actors portraying these characters do a particularly 
 fine job (some of the other performances aren't quite as strong, but they're OK) , and they help 
 give Myst IV a personal touch and a surprisingly distinctive personality, seeing as very few games 
 feature live actors anymore. At any rate, though the story loosely ties together the events of 
 Myst IV, it's mostly just there as a setup for you to explore a series of wondrous, otherworldly 
 locales. If you've played a Myst game before, then you know not to expect a lot of dialogue or 
 character interaction here. At the least, you can look forward to discovering and reading through 
 the various main characters' journals during the course of the game and discovering their ambitions 
 and their secrets along with some important clues. These journals are lengthy, but they are expressively 
 narrated and packed with interesting detail.  

  As in previous Myst games, your character's persona is undefined, but it's evident that whoever 
 it is you are, you're Atrus' friend and you're willing to help him. After all, Atrus is a remarkable 
 individual -- he has the power to write "ages," which take the form of completely different worlds 
 that seem to spring forth from Atrus' books (he humbly explains that he merely  links  to these 
 ages, rather than creates them) . Your journey through Myst IV will see you through several unique 
 ages: Tomahna, a beautiful cove in which Atrus and his remaining family reside; Spire, a gloomy 
 and equal parts bizarre and awe-inspiring world of floating cliffs and perpetual storms; Haven, 
 a lush prehistoric-looking land filled with strange creatures; and Serenia, a utopian society that's 
 reminiscent of the legends of the lost city of Atlantis. Each of the game's settings is incredibly 
 designed. The different ages are highly distinct from one another, not only in terms of the sights 
 and sounds you'll experience while there, but also in the nature of the puzzles you'll be solving 
 in the respective environments.  

          You'll explore the game's different ages on your own, but you'll encounter several key 
 characters throughout.     

  Unlike many other adventure games, Myst IV lets you go about some of your objectives -- and visit 
 some of the different ages -- in no particular order. This free-form structure is both liberating 
 and bewildering. Myst IV doesn't ever lead you by the nose from one location to another, it instead 
 invites you (and challenges you) to find your own path. Navigating is as simple as can be. A context-sensitive 
 cursor in the shape of a hand (you can even choose a right- or left-handed version) changes to 
 indicate when you can move toward a distant area, examine an object, or use an object. Unlike last 
 year's Uru: Ages Beyond Myst, Myst IV is not a fully 3D game, which means you'll be moving from 
 node to node -- from one picturesque scene to another -- as you click around. Transitions from node 
 to node are occasionally animated, but mostly, Myst IV harkens back to its predecessors just by 
 crossfading from one scene to the next. This effect works fine. You'll hear a few footsteps, and 
 the crossfade generally takes about as long as it might take for your character to walk forward 
 a few paces to the next scene, so your imagination will readily fill in the gaps between nodes. 
 No imagination is necessary to take in all the splendor of what you actually  will  see, though. 
     

  Within each node, you're free to investigate all around you by moving the mouse in any direction 
 to rotate your view. Some clues can and will be above or below eye level, and in general, there's 
 a lot to take in at practically every location. Of course, not every single node in the game packs 
 in some sort of mission-critical clue or puzzle. In fact, Myst IV goes so far as to throw some 
 red herrings at you -- aspects of the environment that seem interesting and with which you can interact -- and 
 yet these things are just there for curiosity's sake, if not to draw your attention away from the 
  real  puzzles. In turn, since Myst IV's scenery can be  so  dense with detail, it can be difficult 
 to tell -- especially when first starting out -- exactly what you can and cannot interact with. You'll 
 invariably end up searching for "hotspots" onscreen -- places where your cursor changes to indicate 
 that you can do something there. Even so, you're liable to miss some of these hotspots unless you're 
 really on your toes -- and sometimes this means overlooking a subtle but important clue. Of course, 
 there's generally no sense of urgency while playing Myst IV, thanks partly to the serene landscapes 
 and soothing ambient music. It's important to be patient and to take your time while playing.  
 

          You don't need an engineering degree to solve Myst IV's puzzles, but we figure it'd probably 
 help.     

  The game has a couple of noteworthy twists beyond the simple point-and-click mechanics of its predecessors. 
 For one thing, in Myst IV, you get to be a photojournalist of sorts. You begin the adventure with 
 a camera and an image viewer. The camera may be used at any time, either to take snapshots of the 
 pretty vistas or -- better yet -- for committing important clues to a permanent visual record. Symbols, 
 patterns, and secret codes are hidden throughout Myst IV. You may not recognize their significance 
 right away, but if you find something unusual looking you might as well take a picture of it in 
 case you need to refer back to the information later. By giving you a camera with which you can 
 take note of important clues, the creators of the game gave themselves license to build some meticulously 
 complex puzzles that require you to decipher links between locations that may, at times, be quite 
 far apart. However, it's usually pretty apparent when it's worth your while to snap a photo of 
 something (these tend to be the things that you may zoom in on to investigate up close) . Since 
 you'll frequently be using the camera to keep track of potential clues, it's best not to clutter 
 up your film reel with pointless pretty pictures.  

  Since Myst IV involves a lot of open-ended exploration and features some multipart puzzles whose 
 solutions are spread throughout the ages, you'll be comforted to know that the game includes a 
 rapid transportation option to cut down on some of the needlessly time-consuming backtracking that 
 has negatively impacted other adventure games in the past. Here, after you visit a key area, you 
 gain the ability to instantly teleport back to it at any time. This ability ("zip mode") isn't 
 explained and is there just for convenience, and purists may choose to toggle it off if they wish. 
 However, zip mode is a small blessing in Myst IV. It doesn't ruin the sense of exploration since 
 you can't teleport to areas you've never visited, nor can you use zip mode to cross between ages. 
 Instead, much like the camera, it's a gameplay device that's necessary to facilitate some of Myst 
 IV's ambitious puzzles. Once you finally discover the hidden logic to one of Myst IV's complex, 
 interweaving natural or mechanical networks, you'll want to be able to quickly manipulate these 
 systems to see what happens rather than spend a lot of time trudging from point to point. Zip mode 
 really doesn't seem like a big deal in the context of the game, but it does a lot to help mitigate 
 any sense that you're wasting time going back and forth.  

          Amid the wonders of Myst IV's environments, it can be difficult to tell what's a clue to 
 an important puzzle and what's not.     

  You only find one inventory item in Myst IV: an amulet that lets you hear, and sometimes even see, 
 recent memories of what occurred in a particular location. The amulet will glow and chime when 
 it can be used, and using it often reveals obscure clues or more bits of story. If nothing else, 
 the amulet helps keep the world of Myst IV from feeling too lonesome for its own good. It's true 
 that you'll see nary a soul during most of the game, but at least you'll be able to  hear  what 
 once happened at the various places you'll visit. It's an interesting narrative technique, actually. 
 Oftentimes, you'll be able to piece together parts of the story just by making inferences. For 
 example, on Haven, you'll encounter the carcass of some huge aquatic beast, and the amulet reveals 
 how the beast met its end at the hands of one of Atrus' sons. This turns out to be one of several 
 similar clues for one of the game's most complicated puzzles.

Review:  Ah, Myst.
  
  What a game. No other game series has defined the adventure genre quite like Myst. The Myst games 
 have a reputation to uphold when it comes to exploration, and Myst 4 is no exception.
  
  The story in Myst 4 takes off a few years after Myst 3, Yeesha is a girl of 9 or 10, and Atrus 
 is an older, more reserved man. He is experimenting with a wavelength emitter, when it explodes. 
 You are sent help out, and get drawn in immediately. The story keeps going until the awe-inspiring 
 conclusion.
  
  The graphics are gorgeous, just like every other Myst game. The environments seem to move, the 
 plants and animals seem alive.
  
  The Ethereal soundtrack will blow you away with the likes of Jack Wall and Peter Gabriel.
  
 
  The Controls are like Myst 3, but without the rapid transport system. 
  
  The Problem with the game is some devilishly tricky puzzles, but that's part of the Myst series, 
 and if you get stuck pulling out your hair, there is a help guide courtesy of prima. 
  
  All in all, this is a worthwhile entry into the Myst series, and definite pick up for adventure 
 gamers and Myst fans alike.

Review:  Revelations is the fourth game in the Myst franchise, and the second game to be developed by a 
 team other than Cyan Worlds. That's not to say I wasn't worried, because initially I was. First 
 of all, Ubisoft Montreal isn't exactly known for point-and-click adventure gaming; they're more 
 along the lines of Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six first-person shooters. Second, it's easy to 
 be fooled by the Cyan Worlds logo on the box -- considering the fact that they had almost nothing 
 to do with the development of this game -- that is, unless you count Rand Miller reluctantly reprising 
 his role as Atrus. So, naturally, one would be concerned if Ubisoft Montreal might muck up the 
 works and alienate the Myst fanbase. Then I realized something. Exile was a great experience, and 
 it took Myst to new heights. THAT game was developed by Presto Studios. I'm happy to say Revelations 
 eased my concerns, and fulfilled my expectations.
  
  The time-honored tradition of pre-rendered backgrounds and images holds very true here, and even 
 more so with loads of worlds and environments to explore. Keep in mind that Revelations is the 
 biggest Myst game to date -- so big that it had to be packed in one DVD rather than separated on 
 multiple discs. Ubisoft Montreal did major, major work on this title -- overhauling everything to 
 the point of combustion. And that's a good thing when you consider the fact that the Myst games 
 have always been about creating huge, beautifully-realized, surrealistic worlds.
  
  And with these beautiful worlds come fiendishly mind-numbing puzzles. For every new Myst game, 
 they seem to get much harder and more challenging. Of course, it'd be easy to just look up the 
 solutions on the Internet, but where's the fun in that? The only bad part about this is; many of 
 the puzzles are far too challenging for their own good. To its credit, it certainly keeps the player 
 busy. But one of the key charms of the Myst games is the sense of exploration -- to find and take 
 in new worlds. If a particularly difficult puzzle is standing in your way of progress, exploration 
 seems limited in its scope. Needless to say, you might have to rack your brain numerous times if 
 you ever hope of solving some of these fiendishly challenging puzzles.
  
  The story is quite engaging. If you've been following the Myst story like I have, you'll already 
 be familiar with Revelation's villains -- the brothers evil. Sirrus and Achenar. For the first time 
 ever, you get to enter those Red and Blue Books and see what worlds lie within them. You'll also 
 get insight as to what those two have been up to during their imprisonment. But that's not the 
 key mission objective here. Atrus' daughter Yeesha has been kidnapped by Sirrus, so you gotta find 
 her before he puts a sinister plan into action that will destroy Atrus and his family from its 
 core.
  
  Follow it all up with a unique journal system and a hauntingly beautiful song by Peter Gabriel 
 (who also does a voice-over in this game) , and you've got the makings of a truly memorable adventure 
 game. You might be frustrated by some of the puzzles, but you'll definitely have a wonderful time 
 exploring these worlds.

Review:  This game is very similar to the other Myst games, but still a little different.
  
  This is a really great game. It has great graphics, beautiful music, and a pretty neat plot. The 
 game looks like a moving photograph which gives it a pretty nice feel when you're playing it. It's 
 full of difficult puzzles and all that stuff, just like in the other Myst games. The only possible 
 bad thing about this game, is that it doesn't quite have the same on your own, clueless feel that 
 the previous Myst games had. It still has quite a bit of that, but the plot in this game is presented 
 to you through actors rather than reading books and stuff in people's houses. Some people may like 
 that, but I really liked the old way too. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it feels a bit 
 more modern. Which can be great, but you might miss that classic Myst feel after a while. But don't 
 get me wrong, this game is great. Once again, if you're into puzzles or adventure games, this is 
 a must.

Review:  To start off, the graphics are flawless. The different worlds that you travel to (something not 
 uncommon in the series) are in most aspects stunning. You can tell the creators spent a lot of 
 time on the worlds with each one having its own personality. Your interaction with the game has 
 been modified even higher, as you are able to respond to your surroundings much easier and clearer.
 
  If you are a fan of the series then you won't be surprised that the plot is great. During a visit 
 to your friend Atrus, he confides in you of a personal matter concerning his sons. From there the 
 story takes off as his daughter is suddenly kidnapped and his two sons are suspected. You are then 
 thrown in a search for the daughter and the two sons who will lead you through a plot of uncovered 
 secrets, to redemption or destruction.
  The puzzles you find are great and add to Myst's usual formula. There are some that are hard and 
 frustrating and others that are so simple you overlook what you are looking for and thus equally 
 challanging. Each problem will make you jot your pencil down in your notebook and write about what 
 you believe is a clue. (I recommend the pencil and the notebook) A great new feature that goes 
 along with helping you remember clues in this game is an item that you acquire during your travels, 
 a camera. This can be used whenever you see something that looks important or something interesting. 
 At anytime you can take a picture of what you want and compare notes with your album for the next 
 puzzle you find.
  I recommend this to anyone enjoys the series or likes adventure puzzle games. I don't recommend 
 it to someone who has never played the series before, as they will be confused in some areas. Warning: 
 The game takes 4GB (a lot of memory!) and will need a good updated computer.

Review:  I have spent much time playing through the first 3 games and reading the first 3 novels. I have 
 quite a bit of knowledge about the Myst Universe and going into this made that experience that 
 much better. At the same time, with all that experience, this game had to change things up a bit 
 in order to properly hold my interest. In most ways, it did a good job of this. Read on to get 
 the scoop.
  
  A very important feature of the Myst games are the visuals. The games rely on visual beauty to 
 result in the player's complete immersion. This game fares no differently. Everything is pre-rendered 
 (well, the environments) but is done with a much better 3D engine, and there are some things that 
 actually happen in front of you. For the most part, everything is integrated seamlessly and you 
 will enjoy the experience thoroughly. The real problem is the integration of live action with CGI. 
 Don't get me wrong, the acting is actually done pretty good, especially with a fairly impressive 
 performance done by the girl who plays Yeesha. The integration hasn't quite perfected yet though, 
 and so when there are people on the screen, they stand out as being obviously having been inserted 
 there like in the olden days of Green Screens and bad insertion. Now this isn't detrimental, but 
 it definately can take from the striking beauty of the game sometimes. Speaking of which, the game 
 really is nothing short of breathtaking. Each environment is detailed and full of life. It all 
 feels so real. The fact that it looks so good helps it along quite a bit as well.
  
  Another important feature that involves immersion is sound. The Myst games have generally excelled 
 in this as well. Here is no exception. The acting (here I specifically refer to the voice acting) 
 is done wonderfully (though I still believe Myst 3 is the best so far) . I kind of miss the original 
 Sirrus and Achenar styles from Myst 1, but the new ones still do them justice. The sound effects 
 are of course done wonderfully. With how important the sound effects are, it is good that they 
 are all done well here. The music is also set at a good volume and fits into the game far better 
 than the other games have managed. That's quite an accomplishment. Great score, great voices and 
 great effects.
  
  Of course there is also the most important feature to consider, and that is the gameplay. The controls 
 take a slight step forward by allowing you to freely look around, but you still click to move and 
 interact. You can also move the cursor while the screen stays still, and when your cursor pans 
 to the edge of the screen then your view will change accordingly. This is extremely clunky and 
 annoying, and you will likely only use this 'still-screen' function when interacting with puzzles. 
 When moving and looking, I NEVER used this version and stuck with free look. Another slight problem 
 is the rather large hand that is the cursor in comparison with the surroundings. Oftentimes, when 
 interacting with precision puzzles, this makes this complicated and can get frustrating. One last 
 complaint is that there is no option to inverse the mouse when doing free look. For those of us 
 that play FPS and use inverted mouse (which is a lot of us by the way) , this will be extremely 
 disorienting throughout the game. Still, with all the complaints, the game controls just fine when 
 you use it right.
  
  The story in this game, is very good as well. We had the story of Crime in part 1, Revenge in part 
 2, Righting Wrongs in part 3, and here we have Redemption. Like Exile, this game's story is very 
 touching in the end, and has you feeling anger and sorrow for those you would not have thought 
 you could. The only thing about the good story here is that the twists are pretty easy to figure 
 out as you go along. The storytelling is well done though, and you will find that this game excels 
 just as its predecessors.
  
  Enough babbling though... what about the darned puzzles? This game has 4 ages to travel to, but 
 really only 3 of them serve as real puzzle areas (the intro place is mostly easy and not nearly 
 as long as the others) . You have one that is nature based, which was the bane of my existence. 
 The puzzles were solveable with the given clues, but some required precision that I for some reason 
 could not master (get to the point of Mangree calls, and you will understand) . This is Haven. You 
 have another that is mostly logic and science, which was right up my alley and I enjoyed this very 
 much. The puzzles there were also well done and stuck to the theme. This is Spire. Lastly you have 
 a combination of these in Serenia along with some new approaches (the best puzzles are in Serenia) . 
 Having a couple of timed puzzles was a nice new approach, but ended up causing more frustration 
 than necessary. Other than that, the puzzles are done well, creative, and can be solved as long 
 as you pay attention to what is going on in the game. It is extremely helpful that the game let's 
 you take screenshots of any clue you find and view it in-game. The best new feature in the game 
 in my opinion, and I am very glad for it. There is also an in-game hint system for those of you 
 who get stuck, which I fortunately never had to use.
  
  Overall, this game take everything that was good in the others, puts it together and adds in some 
 nice user-friendly features (the hint system, the screenshot system) to create a very good adventure 
 game that can only be expected from something carrying the Myst game. It is just unfortunate that 
 this game does not include a neat making of video to watch upon completion, and as the past games, 
 there is no reason to play this again except for story, since you will know all the answers to 
 the puzzles, though at least the game is a reasonable length of time.
  
  Either way, this is an adventure game worth playing, and if you have the patience for puzzle-centered 
 adventure games, you are in for a treat. Enjoy.

Review:  I've always loved Myst. I would play it as a child with my dad by my side as we tried to solve 
 the intriguing puzzles that presented themselves to us all over a mysterious island. The original 
 Myst was a very intelligent game aswell as Riven and Myst III: Exile. Now I have Myst IV: Revelation 
 to marvel at and I must say it keeps the intelligence the last three games had and presents new 
 things on the table for me to be amazed with.
  
  Myst IV follows the footsteps of the previous titles by presenting a deep story, lots of reading 
 material, and many many many confounding puzzles. The game strays away from it's siblings by putting 
 out a new level of graphics, character to character interaction, and incredible new ages to explore. 
 When I say character to character interaction I mean that you feel like you're actually there and 
 not some invisible camera watching events happening and changing things from behind the scene. 
 Right off you're involved with the characters in helping with some tasks here and there before 
 things start to go wrong- which is where the game really starts.
  
  There really isn't that much MORE to say about Myst than what can be said about the other games. 
 It's beautiful, immersive, clever, intelligent, and greatly difficult. But the difficulty never 
 stops me from tinkering with each puzzle trying to find answers. Myst IV: Revelation is something 
 to cherish and place next to your Myst Trilogy.

Review:  I find it odd that almost every review cites the impossible puzzle barriers in this MYST installment. 
 Personally, I found URU and its expansion packs to be more challenging puzzle-wise. Really, Spire 
 is the only semi-challenging part; the rest of the challenge comes from the seemingly unable-to-be-mapped 
 areas of Haven and Serenia. That duty was a challenge in itself!
  
  But my main issue deals with the great psychological potential this game failed to reach. Those 
 who have played certainly understand the interplay between the entire family, the brothers especially, 
 which flows through the game. The developers treat this delicious dysfunction to perhaps 1/3rd 
 of the content it demanded. So much more could have been developed - perhaps more expansion on 
 the distrust between the two, constructing some extra devious puzzles or 'flashbacks' based on 
 this relationship. Instead, we are given their individual prisons and asked to basically solve 
 the 'puzzles' on each, with no real depth involved. We finish both ages with a ride on the associated 
 technology... and that's it! Neither never became OUR personal prison, as they should have, at least 
 in some small (or involved) fashion. Yes, we were treated to some slight depth involving their 
 separate private hells, but not nearly enough, and personalities were not sufficiently fleshed 
 out to really build up a sympathy or empathy for any character. Sounds like I'm asking for a 500 
 pg book! Well, I guess I expect more from THIS series than any other. This game could have really 
 expanded in such a satisfying and entertaining psychosis-driven direction. The game tries, but 
 just does not deliver.
  And the comparative absence of Atrus in this game is a bad call. I went back to contact him (on 
 RIME) many times to get his reaction about something, and got the same loop... very poor development 
 of a character who should have been all through this game. HIS DAUGHTER IS MISSING! Same RIME loop 
 plays...
  One point deduction just for the loop! :)
  
  Haven't played End of Ages yet, but it's happening soon. I certainly hope it demands more emotional 
 involvement than Revelation. And, for that matter, just what was the revelation? Only four locales 
 to explore? And one more thing, Peter Gabriel is not necessary to the success of your game - it 
 is the game content, the full development, the utilization of those development dollars that counts, 
 not overpaying an overrated musician (just a very much needed rant there) . That's all, and enough. 
 If you've read this far, thanks!

Review:  Myst. a word in the gaming world that can be taken two ways, a horrible game that has no point, 
 or an amazing experiance that pulls you in. I watched my dad play the original myst when i was 
 younger and had no idea what was going on and lost interest then went on to play doom. Now coming 
 back to myst (and still loving doom) i realized how great it really is. Especially in this forth 
 enstallment. the graphics are great, you feel like your really in the worlds that are shown. the 
 music in the background made me want to buy the score and put it on my ipod. you get so involved 
 in this game that it becomes your second life. when playing this game i learned another language..... not 
 speak but write it. now i realize how nerdy that might seem but it was amazing to see what this 
 game can make you do. the feeling you get when you finally solve a puzzle is lierally one of the 
 best feelings i have ever felt.

Review:  This has to be the most amazing game, that i have ever played. This game was teh only game i have 
 ever played that i could not stop playing till i finished it, and then i was regreating that it 
 ended. The game has amazing visuals even in comparison with todays games, and astounding sound, 
 and music, it is realy obvious that teh designers of this game payed much atention to details, 
 and that is easily observed by the gamer. It would be great if Myst VI would come out and if it 
 would be similar to myst 4 (not 5, which i think was a downfall) teh puzzles are chalenging, in 
 a very fun way, (i would prefare them to be more chalenging, but i guess its just me) and all are 
 related to the game's theam, just exploring teh worlds is a pleasure, althou i have to admit that 
 i didnt like the spire world, I gues it felt just too real , the loneliness, and emptines of the 
 rock prison, with the sound of the wind gave me many times a chill, and i wished to leave as soon 
 as possible, but i wanted to go through all the locations in that area anyway.
  
  The story itselfe is compelling, and wery interesting, I am tryly amazed at teh beauty, and the 
 use of actors in teh game, that is what i think realy i enjoyed, because i have not experienced 
 this in many other games, after playing the demo of this game i rushed to teh store the next day 
 to purchase this game, and i also bought hte 10th aniversary edition which included teh previous 
 parts of the game, I have to admit thou that i played only this one.
  
  Once again, this game is truly outstanding, and any person who enjoys either a good story , or 
 a puzzle solving game iwll be greately pleased with the unique and amazing visuals, as well as 
 audio, and the atantion to detail taht distinguishes this game from many others.

Review:  This has become the game (to date) of which I measure all other adventure/mystery games. Beautiful 
 is the one word I'd use to sum this one up.
  
  Graphics excel, sound excels, interactivity excels, story excels, puzzles excel, blah-blah-blah. 
 99.9% of everything I liked about this game. Each Age was just large enough (a little more and 
 inertia would've settled in) . Puzzles were just hard enough. Characters were developed to the point 
 I felt empathy towards Atrus' entire family. I felt like the friend your character plays. Oh, and 
 a great climatic ending! Fantastic!
  
  So I guess I have to pick one complaint. Here it is --- the puzzles involving sound were too sensitive 
 to error. We knew the solution to a couple of the monkey puzzles, but couldn't quite tune the instruments. 
 To the point we resorted to the walk-through because we thought we were missing something, only 
 to find it told us the same thing --- just keep trying.
  
  To sum up, (and re-iterate again and again) , I loved this game! Thank you Ubisoft Montreal!

Review:  Ok, I am a long time Myst junkie ever since the first came out. Watching these games progress is 
 like watching a kid grow up, starts out very innovative and cool with Myst, and slowly matures 
 in every aspect until now, we're faced with a game with amazing sound, amazing graphics, drop dead 
 INCREDIBLE storyline, amazing character, and pull your hair out hard puzzles. This game is not 
 easy at all. The puzzles are EXTREMELY hard and require you jotting down every and any detail throughout 
 the game. However, the rewards are immense if you complete the puzzles and you simply feel very 
 accomplished. This was definetly my favorite game in the series, had a huge world (s =D) , and simply 
 was fanominal. However, i refuse to play Myst V =) . Looks like myst stripped of its awesome gameplay 
 and something more like a normal video game. This game will forever be the last and best Myst game 
 for me and made my playing experience worthwhile.

Review:  Once again, a game that challenges even the most skilled logical thinker. Myst is an adventure 
 game that will give you all that you want from the genre. These puzzles are not tough, they are 
 almost impossible. Infact that may be the only thing holding this game back, well that and the 
 point and click. Yes Myst IV is a hugely immersive game but it could have been stunning without 
 a point and click structure. Putting that aside, Myst will let you touch almost everything in the 
 environment and gives a perfect physical reaction when you do. The graphics in this game are stunning 
 and the sound is just as creepy as ever. Don't be suprised if you find yourself using a walkthrough 
 to get past the puzzles, or at least to them, because they are truthfully insane and some are virtually 
 impassible. In the end, Myst IV Revalation is a game that andy adventure fan should own and love.

Review:  Myst IV: Revelation is the fourth game in the Myst series and fifth in the franchise if you include 
 the spin off Uru. It once again pulls into the strange world of Atrus, a strange man who can write 
 entire worlds into existence within a book, yet is constantly being dragged down by common family 
 matters, and continues the franchises legacy of creating mesmerizing world of wonder to explore, 
 all filled with mind warping puzzles designed to make your cerebrum implode.
  
  Like its predecessors, Myst IV utilizes prerendered graphics, meaning youre once again limited 
 to just moving from one bubble to another. However once you fire this game up, youll immediately 
 see why this method is best for a game like this. I dont care how realistic you think the Half-Life 
 2 engine is, I dont care how powerful your graphics card is. There is no game today using real 
 time rendering that is as detailed and realistic as Myst IV. And these are no longer just static 
 images that look pretty any more, no, no, no. The worlds of Revelation are brimming with life. 
 In fact the engine they used to create every scene is called the ALIVE engine, and for good reason. 
 Why the previous games had a few bits of animation here and there, Myst IV animates practically 
 everything! Stand on a balcony on Tomahna, the first age, and youll see branches and leaves blowing 
 in the wind, insects and birds flutter by, water rushing past swiftly beneath you towards a waterfall, 
 and all of it as detailed as if you were actually standing right there on that very balcony. 
 
  
  This game is the most immersive Ive ever played. Not only is everything around you animated to 
 act like you were really standing there, but the producers spared no expense to fill the world 
 with details to add to the experience. As you pan around each scene, youll hear footsteps corresponding 
 to the movement youd be making if you actually were turning around, and each sound matches the 
 surface youre standing on perfectly, whether its wood, stone, metal or turf. If you click on 
 an object that you cant actively manipulate, youll tap it, producing another highly realistic 
 sound depending on the object and what its made of and whether its hollow or not. Tap some still 
 water and youll send a few ripples across the surface.
  
  Another interesting feature that pulls you in just that much further is the new hand system. 
 Instead of a flat, cartoon hand curser that you had in the previous games, youve got a small, 
 3D hand that moves around and changes depending on what you can do. If youre facing a path you 
 can go forward on, it points. If you hold it over a button you can press, the finger extends to 
 push said button. If you hold it over something that can be examined closer, it whips out a small 
 magnifying glass with a soft flourish like sound (though dont ask where it got the magnifying 
 glass, I havent the slightest idea) . And perhaps coolest of all, if you hold it over a door knob 
 or a lever, it will turn into a hand about to grasp something, and when you click it will actually 
 take hold of the item, but instead of manipulating it right away like most Myst games, you actually 
 have to click and drag to move the item, whether youre opening a door or pulling a lever, making 
 you feel like youre actually holding and moving the object in question.
  
  Unfortunately, because the little 3D hand ends at the wrist, it has a slight severed look to it, 
 which many people find a little unnerving and creepy but you do get used to it right away.
  
  Of course the Myst games arent all about the worlds, theyre also about puzzles. Puzzles designed 
 to make you think. And by think, I of course mean tear your hair out and leap from your window 
 naked, screaming at the top of your lungs in frustration. There is no denying it, no getting around 
 it; the puzzles in Revelation are hard. Really, really hard. See, first you have to figure out 
 where the puzzles are. Then you have to figure out what the puzzles are. Then you must figure out 
 how the puzzles work, what the puzzles do, why you need to solve this puzzle in the first place 
 and then of course, finally, how the hell to solve it once youve got all the rest of that figured 
 out. Thankfully, most of the puzzles do make some sort of sense if youve done enough investigating 
 around the world. Luckily, the game employs a nifty little tool to help you out there, a camera. 
 If you see anything that you think might be a clue or a hint, you can snap a picture of it and 
 then type in a series of notes for each picture you take. Its handy, though you will still find 
 yourself scribbling madly on pieces of loose paper scattered around your computer. However, there 
 are still several puzzles where you arent given any help whatsoever, you simply have to stare 
 at it and fiddle around until you think youve figured out the pattern or the sequence or whatever.
 
  
  Well, its not entirely true that you arent given any help whatsoever. The game also includes 
 a little hint system for each age, offering you two subtle hints for each puzzle before finally 
 giving you the full answer. Some people think the answers shouldnt be so accessible, but really 
 they arent that much more accessible than this little thing I like to call the Internet.
  
  And of course theres also a story, a very good story I might add that not only expands on 
 the Myst franchise as a whole but really offers you an intriguing look at the history of not only 
 Atrus himself, but also his family, including and especially his two sons from the very first Myst 
 game. Its well written and very interesting and really adds a lot to this game, making it so much 
 more than a beautiful puzzlefest.
  
  I think, besides the incredibly hard puzzles, the only other problem I have with this game is that 
 once its over, thats it. Theres almost no replay value whatsoever, but then thats the case 
 with most adventure games. You can go through it again of course, which can actually be fun, to 
 re-experience the world, but the challenge is gone as even if you dont remember everything, you 
 still remember enough to breeze through the puzzles quite easily.
  
  This is without a doubt the most immersive and detailed game Ive ever played in my life, and I 
 dont think its very likely well be seeing another game this detailed and this stunning for a 
 very, very long time. If youre looking for something to really challenge your Mensa abilities, 
 this is definitely for you. And if youre looking for the ultimate in escapism, this is definitely 
 for you.

Review:  Myst IV: Revelation is one of those games that you can just delve into and never come out of. Each 
 age was more creative and different than the last and I loved the graphics. I liked the characters 
 that I met and although they were a bit cheesy at times as actors, they really added to the story 
 and I did not feel so isolated. The animals and rock structures were beautiful, the music was pretty 
 good. I felt that the games and puzzles were very hard and had to get help a few times. But perseverance 
 paid off if I wanted to solve them on my own. The ability to move from age to age in any order 
 got to be my own worst enemy because I was always going back and forth looking for any clue I had 
 missed. I probably spent too much time looking at useless, but beautiful things, hoping they held 
 a clue. The crystal age was so cold and scary, that I had to walk away from the game at times. 
 The island age was also creepy in its own way because of the many creatures and worn out structures 
 and carcasses. But this all added to the need to play and find the answers. The main instigation 
 to play that Myst IV gave me was the "Need to find out what the heck happened here!"

Review:  I probably don't need to go into too much detail here. This game is simply an amazing adventure 
 game and is generally recognized as such. The element that gets me into any game has always been 
 the story and nothing changes here. All of the characters are not simply given rudimentary importance, 
 but are detailed and play a pivotal role in the game as well as the choices that the player will 
 make. The puzzles, for the most part, fit exceptionally well into the gameplay and made intuitive 
 sense. The kicker is that the game is also beautifully rendered - from haunting atmospheres to 
 more wild and adventurous ones, to completely ethereal - Myst IV delivers on graphics.
  
  In all, an extremely enjoyable and rewarding experience. Well done, Myst team.

Review:  The Myst series is arguably one of the greatest adventure sagas of all time. The fourth installment 
 suffers some problems, however; most notably in the story and dialogue.
  
  Another ten years have passed since the conclusion of Exile, and once again you're left to your 
 imagination on what happened between then and the present. The game opens up with you on a tram 
 ride with Atrus' now ten year old daughter, Yeesha. After a failed experiment by your good friend 
 Atrus he travels to Rime (from realMyst) in order to get replacement parts. After exploring Tomahna 
 and activating Atrus' backup power, you end up nearly killed when the walkway collapses. After 
 you come to and find Yeesha missing, you must set out to discover what happened to her.
  
  While the storyline itself doesn't sound bad at first; the execution of it was rather poor. The 
 game is filled with cheesy dialogue, and contrived plot segments that just don't fit with the theme 
 of the Myst saga. The story isn't by any means terrible. It could have been a whole lot worse, 
 but it could have been a whole lot better too.
  
  The gameplay in Revelation is more similar to Exile than to Myst and Riven. You are able to walk 
 from one scene to another, and look around in any direction you want. Revelation like its predecessors 
 also sports the same mind bending puzzles that are common in the series. Some of Revelation's puzzles 
 can be a bit troublesome, however; particularly the Mangree puzzle on Haven, and the sound crystal 
 puzzle on Spire. I'm also not particularly fond of the Dreamworld puzzle.
  
  Revelation's graphics are probably some of the best in the series. While they don't reach the photo-realism 
 of Riven; they come pretty darn close. A lot of time and work was put into the detail of Myst IV's 
 worlds, and it shows. Haven is a thick jungle, Spire is desolate, and Serenia is bright and colorful. 
 Each of these worlds (and Tomahna) have the same amount of atmosphere that is present in all Myst 
 games.
  
  Revelation's audio is great, for the most part. The sound effects are immersive, and the music 
 is excellent though sometimes over the top. The voice overs and acting, however; are abysmal. Myst, 
 Riven and Exile had fairly solid acting, but Myst IV is just plain bad. Even Rand Miller who reprises 
 his role of Atrus seems to be a little off sometimes.
  
  Revelation is a good game that has some issues in the story department. It could have had much 
 better writing, but you can't change the past. Regardless of the plot issues, Myst IV is a must 
 have for fans of the series, and a good a place to start as any for new comers.

Review:  With a bit of shame I have to admit I've never played one of the earlier Myst games. But nonetheless 
 I liked this game a lot,: it's graphics are awesome and the story keeps me interested. The one 
 minor point in this game is that I became somewhat inpatient (?) with the puzzles to be solved, 
 so that I was glad there are walk-through sites on the net. And just when I got used to the difficulty, 
 the game ended, sob.
  
  Whoever doubts about buying this game: the game is fun even if you haven't played the previous 
 sequels, it does not effect your comprehension of the storyline. And I think anyone with a bit 
 of patience and a walk-through at hand can enjoy these great graphics. With the 10 euro I paid 
 for this game I'm glad I experienced it.

Review:  Ask any adventure fan what two elements make a great game, and they'll probably say a good story 
 and a good puzzle design, This isn't to say the game is perfect, as no game ever is, but as adventure 
 games go , it's dame near flawless. It boasts mind-bending, yet logical puzzles, graphics the like 
 you've never seen in a game of its class and a story worthy of its own noval. Not to mention the 
 highest production values seen in any adventure game in recent memory.
  Although there's no main character in Myst (you play a faceless, nameless hero,) each adventure 
 revolves around a D'ni named Atrus and his wife, Catherine, had three children: a daughter named 
 Yeesha and two sons, named Sirrus and Achenar. Although Yeesha plays the part of a perfect daughter, 
 both Sirrus and Achenar abuse the power bestowed upon them and create all sorts of havoc. They 
 wind up destroying several ages written by their father, ultimately forcing Atrus and Catherine 
 to imprison their sons in two isolated Ages. Play the game and enjoy it.

Review:  This is the best Myst sequel I've played, and I"ve played them all. Its refreshing after Uru to 
 see Myst return to its original style of navigation, and the creators of Myst have seemlesly included 
 video in the game, which is cool to see as a contrast to all of the rendered cutscenes that are 
 so popular nowadays. While nothing can top the inovation of the first Myst game, Revelation omes 
 close. From Prince of Persia to Myst, Ubisoft seems to have little it can do wrong. The addition 
 of the new lightining feature was great, it enables you to explore without so much backtracking 
 (Not that I'd have minded going back and forth through some of the beautifully crafted worlds) . 
 The addition to the Myst series also was filled with alot more life then previous instalments. 
 From playful homo-somethings to vicious predators to the numerous humans in the game, Myst IV has 
 so much life in it, you'll never feel alone, as you often did in the other games.

Review:  My first games were the King's Quest games from way back, and when Myst arrived in the 90's, that 
 excitement about adventure games was rekindled.
  
  Myst IV in no way innovates beyond what was done in the previous games. Better graphics, better 
 integration of live-action video beyond what was done (very badly) in the past. But the gameplay 
 remains the same as over the past decade or so. If you're looking for something to revive the adventure 
 genre, this game won't do it.
  
  However, this game does succeed on an artistic and storytelling level in a way that few adventure 
 games do. The Myst story is unique and engaging, and the latest (what we now know is the penultimate) 
 chapter in that series is perhaps the best chapter in that story (I won't give anything away, of 
 course) .
  
  The game is difficult. Sometimes insanely difficult. It does include a built-in hint system (whose 
 responses are often puzzling in themselves) for those who are looking for a prod in the right direction.
 
  
  The game suffers from occasional bad acting (as the other games have) , but is by far the best of 
 the series in this regard. The graphics and sound are both stunning and immersive.
  
  Now, this review might sound negative so far, but the game is very high quality and exceedingly 
 fun, and for those who enjoy adventure games, this one will certainly not disappoint (although 
 the puzzles might frustrate!) .
  
  It is too bad that the creators of Myst could not turn their creativity not only to the excellent 
 story that really draws people to Myst, but also to the genre itself. If Myst V is to be the final 
 game in the series, let us hope that they also reinvigorate the genre as a whole, lest this be 
 not only the penultimate adventure game in this series, but also the penultimate adventure game 
 period.

Review:  This is an incredible game. I am a big fan of all four of the Myst games and of the Adventure genre 
 in general. I have enjoyed each of the Myst games more than their predecessors and this time is 
 no exception.
  
  Myst IV is a very similar game to Myst III. The interface and overall feel of the game is almost 
 exactly the same. The game is played by moving through a sequence of more or less static images 
 (as opposed to a full 3D environment to walk through) , each of which provides a 360, all around 
 view from where you're standing. You are provided with a cursor that functions in a similar fashion, 
 but this time it fits more into the immersiveness of the game. Your cursor is a hand which points 
 when you can move to an area, makes a grasping gesture over things you can manipulate and even 
 extends a finger for buttons you can press.
  
  The graphics are absolutely amazing. As one would expect from a Myst game, there is an incredible 
 amount of detail and realism to the world. The biggest thing that sets this game apart from Myst 
 III is the amount of dynamic elements that have been added to the world. In previous games, there 
 was very little motion on the screen. Maybe a fire or an animal here or there, and of course an 
 animation when you do something, but in Myst IV, the world is literally teaming with animals. From 
 the very beginning, you can't help but enjoy watching birds fly around and land almost within touching 
 distance from you. There are various kinds of bugs that buzz around you as well as a handful of 
 larger animals (none of which can actually attack you although some appear quite dangerous) . You 
 can get close enough to some animals such as frogs that you can poke them. At which point they 
 usually hop away.
  
  There's also a lot more movement of non-animal elements such as moving water. There are rivers, 
 waterfalls and oceans that all are captivating to look at as they flow and sway. In addition, to 
 motion effects, there's also a greater degree of weather effects as well. Lots of lighting and 
 clouds that float through the sky. In one world, the environment will actually darken a bit occasionally 
 as a cloud covers the sun.
  
  The previous games suffered a great deal from a sense of loneliness. You almost never encounter 
 another person. In Myst IV, there are quite a handful of people that you meet and who talk to you. 
 At the beginning of the game, you obtain an amulet which allows you to experience memories of past 
 events. There are a lot of these memories in the game, each of which offers the opportunity to 
 at least see or hear another person.
  
  The sound effects are really great but I'm afraid that the music is the exception to my "better 
 than its predecessors" point of view. I thought the music in Myst III was exceptional and I'm afraid 
 the music in Myst IV isn't quite as good, although it's still very good. There is one song with 
 vocals in the game that pops up in the middle of the game in a two minute animated sequence that 
 was one of the most captivating sequences I have ever experienced in a game. I was almost brought 
 to tears listening and watching the sequence. That made the entire game for me.
  
  The puzzles are not much different than they were in Myst III although there are fewer of them 
 and they do tend to be more integrated into the environment that Myst III's were. I will have to 
 say this though, they are very hard. I was disappointed by Myst III because I thought the puzzles 
 were too easy. This game is much harder. I think that developers could justify that by the fact 
 that there's a hint system built into the game with varying levels of detail (I'm afraid I had 
 to consult it to get through one of the puzzles) .
  
  I was a little disappointed by the fact that there was less direction in the game than in previous 
 games. I was often unsure of what I was doing and why. In fact there's an entire age that, after 
 the fact, I have no idea why I needed to go to and work through all the puzzles because I didn't 
 end up with something I needed later in the game. In Myst III, you knew that you had to go through 
 each age to find a symbol you needed later.
  
  Another element of the game that has it's positives and negatives is that almost the entire game 
 is open to you right from the beginning. You are more or less free to move from age to age as you 
 desire. You are not trapped in any of the ages. This does however mean that you can't expect the 
 find the solutions to an age's puzzles solely in that age leaving you to hunt through all of the 
 ages. The ages themselves are really quite large and definitely leave you with a satisfying sense 
 of their dimensions. I would have also liked to have had more ages (there are only four main ages) .
 
  
  This game has had more moments that took my breath away than any other game I've played, and for 
 that, I highly recommend it.

Review:  Myst is the reason I started gaming again after a long hiatus. Of course, that hiatus also included 
 going to college, graduate school, working and getting married. But let's admit it, that "real 
 world" stuff is just excuses. The Myst franchise is so good that there is not another single adventure 
 franchise that I can even think of that comes close to the quality and depth Myst gives us. There 
 is only one other adventure game that I wish fervently for a sequel to: Grim Fandango.
  
  The second and third Myst's were not as good as the original. The fourth (Uru) , which was supposed 
 to become an on-line game was good when compared to other adventures, but was clearly the worst 
 Myst game. I thought I saw the direction the Myst franchise was going. But, lets admit it - even 
 the bad Myst games are ten times better than most other pure adventure games.
  
  I was pleasantly surprised by this game!!! This game is good - possibly as good as the original. 
 One of the things I like in a game is character development (see my review, for example, of Gothic 
 II) . In a world like Myst, where there are usually no characters other than the protaganist ("friend") 
 it is amazing to see actual character development. And yet this game does it. The transformation 
 and/on non-transformation of the two brothers is wonderfully done, and the Myst writers deserve 
 Kudo's for getting this kind of character development into an adventure game.
  
  The acting job was a bit over the top or a bit wooden at times, and yet the storyline was so strong 
 I found myself willing to overlook it. The puzzles were wonderful, with minimal frustration despite 
 their difficulty. This game doesn't suffer too much from the pixel hunt garbage that mars so many 
 other adventure games. And the music, especially the Peter Gabriel dream-sequence, is gorgeous. 
 Of course the environments are varied and interesting - we expect that from Myst, and this game 
 delivers.
  
  I am glad adventure games like this show up once in a while, to make me believe that the genre 
 is not completely dead. Myst proves again that you can make a great game without having to incorporating 
 action elements. I hope to see more in the future.

Review:  This is my first go at this type of game and I don't see any rhyme nor reason for most of these 
 puzzles. There is a huge lack of direction, so even if you're on the right track towards solving 
 a puzzle, you don't know it and can subsequently get sidetracked. Some puzzles are relatively easy, 
 but I've come across quite a few where I don't have a clue. This is after hours of scratching my 
 head. I guess what keeps me going are the graphics, sounds, and gameplay (short of having a clue) . 
 Not even the hints help on some of these and others, it's like you can either be a guinea pig and 
 go with blind luck, or need ESP to know just what you're supposed to be working towards. So if 
 you're not good at solving hard puzzles (like me) , you'll run into a lot of dead ends and the good 
 qualities can only take me so far before frsutration sours the experience.
  Graphics are limited to 1024x768 and while the colors and such are good, there's a slightly annoying 
 blur. If you don't pay attention, it's not bothersome. I was expecting 16x12 resolution though. 
 Also, this is an 8GB install and took over half an hour to load (exceedingly long) and then a few 
 more minutes to defrag the hard drive.

Review:  Myst IV is Excellent in all respects except one. An element of silliness has been allowed in. After 
 many hours of (happily) searching and thinking, in a beautiful environment, at a sensible and leisurely 
 pace, having at last worked out the solution, the player is confronted with the most annoying difficulties 
 in implementing the result of all his or her hard work. This is because activation of the solution 
 depends upon racing against the clock (most un-Myst-like) with hopelessly inaccurate and ambiguous 
 mouse-control. This element was not present in MYST, RIVEN or EXILE. 
  So: What could be a first class product is badly spoiled by silliness. Myst-lovers like to rely 
 on brains, not manual dexterity. Nor do they need to go there to be utterly frustrated.

Review:  I was swept up into the game the minute it started. The opening scene set the tone for the rest 
 of the game. Yeesha being indulged by her father, letting her pick me up in the transport by herself, 
 something that would have never been allowed had Catherine been at home. Atrus welcoming me, having 
 me assist him with one of his experiments. The chance to explore Tomahn; something I've dreamed 
 about for a long time. The interaction continues through all the ages; and sometimes, depending 
 upon what you do and when you do it, creating a different scenario.
  
  I know that many will find the puzzles extremely difficult and will think they are puzzles just 
 for puzzles' sake. I found that most were logical and that all the clues you'd need were there 
 for the finding and I resolved all the puzzles without any tips or hints, except for the last puzzle... but 
 more about that later. I do know the puzzles weren't "typical" Myst puzzles, they didn't have the 
 organic feel that the other Myst game puzzles had. But then, these puzzles weren't written into 
 the Age by Atrus. They were never part of the original age, but constructs of the two brothers. 
 The brothers, projecting their evil purposes to others, built locks and safeguards throughout each 
 of their prison ages to prevent others from doing as they would have done in the same situation. 
 However, being the crafty Traveler you are, you are able to pick up the clues they've managed to 
 scatter (they're evil; doesn't mean they're smart) all over the place and figure out what needs 
 to be done to accomplish your goal. Even if you don't find the clues for some of the puzzles, you 
 can experiment around until you get the right combination. After all, if you were truly placed 
 in that situation in real life with no clues, how would you normally go about discovering what 
 you needed to know. You'd experiment until you found the solution.
  
  And all the while you can take in the beauty of the Ages, pick up snippets of insight from Yeesha's 
 amulet and interact with the various objects and individuals. There were times when my breath was 
 taken away, times when I jumped or flinched as a fierce looking creature came bounding my way, 
 times when my heartt-strings were pulled.
  
  There were two endings that I have seen so far. Some have said there is a third, but I've heard 
 anyone saying they've seen any but the two I saw. One ending I saw by accident, because I knew 
 what I wanted to do, but wanted to save my game in case it wasn't correct. Unfortunately at that 
 particular point you can't save the game and I wasted so much time that I saw one of the two endings 
 even though I hadn't made a choice.
  
  I know many will say that the game is too short. Actually that's what I'd say, but then you'd have 
 to understand my perspective. I don't ever want a Myst game to end so, no matter how long the game 
 is or how long it takes me to complete, the end still comes too soon.
  
  However, being the honest person I am, I do have to say there were a few times when I was disappointed. 
 Some of the sequences in Dream seemed to be more than a little hokey and the last puzzles was just 
 down right irritating. Even after I figured out what I needed to do it would have taken me months 
 to have positioned the icons correctly just for the first puzzle and then you had to do the same 
 for the second one. I worked on the first part of this puzzle all day Saturday... and I truly mean 
 all day, and then almost all of the day Sunday before I gave up and looked at the 3rd level hint. 
 Looking at the hint gave me no help at all, but it could have been because my brained was fried 
 at that point. This morning when I looked at the hint it finally made sense to me and I was able 
 to complete both the first and second part of the puzzle. I really hate using any kind of help, 
 but after looking at (and understanding) the hint, I don't think I'd have ever completed the game 
 without it.
  
  The last scene where Atrus thanks you for your help was very poignant to me. I was very involved 
 with Uru and was saddened when the Live portion was cancelled. The last two sentences made me think 
 that it wasn't so much Rand speaking as Atrus about his sons, but more of Rand speaking as Rand 
 about the demise of Uru: Live and the hope for future projects. I don't know that I have what he 
 said verbatim, but it goes something like this:
  
  "Endings are just another form of beginnings. The harder the ending is to face the more hope we 
 bring to the next beginning."

Review:  I was expecting a lot from this game, and in a way, it exceeds my expectations. The graphics are 
 extremely beautiful (more than Myst Exile) , and the immersion is almost total. This is exactly 
 what I was expecting, even better.
  
  But there are a lot of problems, hardware problems. I guess if I had the most recent graphic card 
 available, there would not be any problems, however, I do not. My ATI 7500 32 MB, even if it meets 
 the minimum requirement, is not able to display everything correctly. Moving the camera displays 
 weird ghostly shapes. The mask used to separate animation from still picture are rendered incorrectly. 
 For example, when viewing water through a gate, the water animation shows correctly but the part 
 of the gate where you can see the water become a gray shape with holes (where the water is displayed) .
 
  
  Since much of the fun of Myst comes from its graphics, the problems I encountered were enough to 
 convince me to uninstall the game.
  
  Before buying, I would recommend that you make sure you have the most recent hardware (and drivers 
 of course) to play this game, or wait a little for an update from Ubisoft.
  
  From what I have seen of Myst, if you are a fan of the series and have a pretty up to date PC, 
 this game will be bring you hours of fun.

Review:  Myst VI follows in the path of all the other Myst's before it with supurbe graphics and great music 
 and sounds. However it also follows in the series gameplay deperment too. This game is basicly 
 a point and click game that all that you need is a mouse, some time, and alot of pactience. I enjoyed 
 Myst personaly but i found the puzzles to be a little to difficult and causes you to pay a little 
 bit to much attention to EVERYTHING. In fact the diffuculty is my only real complaint with the 
 game. Simple put the game has great graphics and sounds but the gameplay is lacking. The puzzles 
 in the game require you to take note of everything around you so if you are not one that looks 
 closely at things then i suggest you not even try this game because you will not make it far. However 
 if you are a fan of the Myst series and just wondering if this one lives up to the others then 
 yes it truely does and if you enjoy this type of game then im sure you will enjoy Myst IV. Just 
 be warned the puzzles can be thought but the satifaction in completling one is worth it.

Review:  The death knoll for PC adventure games has been rung quite often over the last several years, but 
 with games like The Longest Journey and Syberia, the genre has managed to stay afloat, even with 
 an admittedly waning fan base. With the exception of last years underwhelming Uru: Ages Beyond 
 Myst, Revelation is the first title in the series since 2001s Exile, and unlike Uru, it continues 
 the saga of Atrus and his treacherous sons Sirrus and Achenar. The resulting experience is visually 
 and aurally gorgeous, easily the most beautiful adventure game of all time, and a logical progression 
 in the series. Some new tweaks and an intriguing method of storytelling help keep the exploration 
 fresh  but the impossibly difficult puzzles will keep even the most logical of players stumped. 
 Myst IV is not for the impatient type, but if you are willing to struggle through the often laborious 
 brain-teasers, you may find the final reward surprisingly fulfilling.
  
  In Revelation, the player once again finds himself in the role of inventor Atrus friend, and during 
 a brief and effective introduction to the game mechanics, you meet the scientists sweet young 
 daughter. He is still writing linking books: volumes in which he creates entire worlds, called 
 ages, which can then be visited and explored at will. While attempting to repair his newest creation, 
 Atrus tells you that his villainous sons Sirrus and Achenar are held captive in ages created to 
 imprison them, much to the worries of his elegant wife Catherine. Soon, you find yourself exploring 
 four beautiful, distinct ages as you piece together the fate of Sirrus and Achenar, and while the 
 story is told mainly via flashback episodes and journal entries, the lonely exploration feels less 
 isolated than in previous incarnations, if only because the human element is stronger here than 
 in the earlier Myst titles. When the game finally draws to a climactic close, the impact is, as 
 the title implies, enlightening indeed. 
  
  Revelation is played from a first-person view, using a simple point-and-click interface familiar 
 to players of the previous Myst games. You do not have traditional three-dimensional access to 
 your environment, although you have full view of your surroundings at any given time. Instead, 
 you click from one area to the next, and with the sound of a few footsteps, you arrive at the chosen 
 location. The icon that you use to interact with the environment is simple but effective: you move 
 a hand over the scenery, and when it shows a pointing finger, you can click to move to that node; 
 if it opens, you can manipulate the item it is hovering over. Those that complain that the Myst 
 series is nothing more than an interactive slideshow will probably not find Revelations presentation 
 any less tedious, but adventure gamers will feel right at home, and players that tire of pixel-hunting 
 will be glad to learn that the interface makes it fairly simple to discover important items that 
 might be sitting around in need of attention. 
  
  While Myst IV features arguably the best story in the series, it really is all about the puzzles, 
 and it will come as no surprise to fans that the mind-benders here can be almost insurmountable 
 obstacles. The initial puzzles are solved easily enough, but the difficulty ramps up significantly 
 once you have access to the prison ages. Fortunately, the game provides a few caveats to ease the 
 burden. Unlike in other adventure games, where you collect various inventory items that you then 
 use in combination with each other, Revelations puzzles are solved by manipulating levers, pushing 
 buttons, and using other objects in similar fashion. While the puzzle itself is solved on location, 
 it may require you to interact with items in other areas, or to use clues from different ages entirely. 
 To help keep track of these clues (or red herrings, in some cases) , you have a camera, which you 
 can use to snap a picture of pretty much anything you can see. You can then refer to the picture 
 later, rather than needing to travel to the remote location to take another look at the clue, or 
 worse, make copious notes or drawings of journal entries and environmental anomalies. 
  
  Another helpful tool is the zip mode, which allows you to travel to places within the age that 
 you have already visited without having to trek through every locale in-between. This terrific 
 tool was actually implemented in Myst III, albeit in a different manner, but it is very welcome, 
 as it eases the constant traveling across the same environments so common in the genre. Even better, 
 Revelation features a hint book in its option menu that gives you three levels of hints, depending 
 on how stuck you are. Rest assured, you will need help level three more than once, although even 
 then, it is hardly a walk-through. Most of the puzzles are quite logical, although this doesn't 
 mean that even the most intelligent of gamers are quick to find a solution, with or without hints.
 
  
  This isnt to say that the story takes a back seat as it has in previous installments, and the 
 remaining interface item is an amulet you pick up near the beginning of the game. The amulet is 
 your connection to past events, and when it glows, you can click on it to trigger audio and visual 
 flashbacks. Not only do these flashes give you important puzzle clues, but they also reveal much 
 about the games characters and their motivations. Its actually a clever storytelling mechanism, 
 and keeps the solo exploration from becoming too stark. What real human contact you do have is 
 presented with live actors that personify the revered characters perfectly, and make you care about 
 their fates with little direct communication. 
  
  The challenge for any adventure developer is to encourage the player to struggle through mind-bending 
 puzzles for the reward waiting at the end, and thankfully, Revelation does a good job at offering 
 the player just desserts for a job well done. The alluring scenery actually serves as an initial 
 reward, but the cutscenes you trigger after solving a conundrum are often awe-inspiring. Still, 
 the headache resulting from the tiresome contemplation of impossibly exacting quandaries gets wearisome, 
 and Myst IV's slow pace can often dwindle to a stop. PC adventures have increasingly been gaming's 
 best storytelling medium, and with Syberia and its sequel, difficult head-scratchers have been 
 replaced with more mild puzzlers, in favor of narrative. For better or for worse, Revelation stays 
 unabashedly true to its roots; fans will rejoice, but it will not bring those that dislike slow-paced 
 exploration and puzzle-solving any further understanding of the series' unique pleasures. 
  
  If any title's graphics are tantamount to how it plays, it would be Revelations, and it is 
 impossible to convey the artistry involved in its unique, colorful, and absolutely resplendent 
 environments. Whether it's Spire's gorgeous misty sights, Tomahna's lush vegetation, or Haven's 
 Jurassic vistas, there is nothing in the game that fails to visually impress. When looking about, 
 your view will focus on certain objects and others will blur, bringing a realism heretofore unseen 
 in an adventure game. Here, impressive visuals aren't just a fringe benefit, they are part of the 
 gaming experience, and could not have been improved in any significant manner. It also looks fantastic 
 on lower-end systems  but let buyer beware: the game ships on two DVD's only, and after a lengthy 
 installation, takes up significant disk space. 
  
  Almost perfect, too, are the evocative sounds and music that accompany your travels, and again, 
 it compliments the visuals of each age to brilliant effect. As you move your hand-cursor over various 
 objects, even if you cannot interact with them, you can tap them, and the resulting noise differs 
 depending on the male-up of the item you touch. As with its brethren, Myst IV is not just a game, 
 it is a journey that does not require a destination to enjoy. 
  
  Patient gamers need wait no more: Myst IV: Revelation is worth its price, not only because of its 
 refreshing return to old-school puzzle-solving, but for its surprisingly cohesive story. While 
 there is no true replay value, it will keep even the most intellectual of players scratching their 
 heads for a few dozen hours. Those new to the series will be pleased to see that Myst III: Exile 
 also ships with it, and still is a beautiful title, four years after release. Adventurers will 
 find little truly new to the series, but most should find Myst IV to be a pleasant return to the 
 genre's roots, and the experience and its splendid conclusion are, indeed, revelatory.

Review:  All of you know the Myst series started several years ago, now in his fourth incarnation.
  Every year the game has always improve graphics and atmosphere giving much more attention to the 
 solution to solve puzzles and go on with adventure.
  It's not my genre in truth, but I've found it very interesting and very, and above all very well 
 structured, so I feel to suggest the buying to everyone, especially to them who loves the Myst 
 series but also to the people who loves Myst style games and not essentially the series.
  Someone can think that this game it's frustating but believe me give it you a chance and take patience, 
 you'll see it in a different way.

Review:  Myst 4 is the new installment of the long running Myst series. It is definitely known for its mind 
 bending difficulty, but it is still not known very much at all.
  
  The gameplay is definitely not ordinary. It's the only one of its kind. You are in a first person 
 view [this is not a shooting game, nor a violent game ] and there is a little hand in the middle 
 of the screen. Instead of just moving around freely, you have to move from node to node. This all 
 sounds a little dissapointing at first, but its a very, very, VERY fun and simple system. You mainly 
 just have to look for clues and such things of that nature, and solve a lot of fun, difficult puzzles. 
 Most of the puzzles aren't as hard as getting place to place, but with the help system on, it should 
 only be very hard, instead of insanely hard.
  
  The graphics and sound are definitely the highlight of the game [not that the gameplay isn't, though] . 
 The graphics are crisp, clean, and just, plain stunning. But if you think there's a catch. that's 
 were you're wrong. It's able to run on an average system [like 128mb RAM, 1.5 GB hard drive etc.] . 
 And there's no annoying, downright silly crashes like in Doom 3. The sound is also stunning. Like 
 when you click on an object, your little hand taps on it and it makes a sound. That does sound 
 kind of, well, dumb, but it adds to the shocking realism of the game.
  
  This game is REALLY long. It's only really long because it is so difficult. But no one, even with 
 a doctorette in engineering can beat this game in less than 30 hours.
  
  Overall, this is definitely the best adventure game ever. Maybe it's even the best. But I can guarantee 
 if you like solving puzzles, or even if you don't, you'll love this game.

Review:  I typically don't like non-action oriented games, but this game is an exception. I dont really 
 need to mention all the features, as they are pretty much the same as in Riven. (never played Uru) . 
 The atmosphere, sound, and graphics are all so convincing you do actually feel like you are in 
 the world. This, in my opinion, is the best part of the game. The puzzles are hard, but none are 
 sensless. They all have very logical processes that u need to follow and understand in order to 
 finish. The problem is, there are alot of stupid gamers (such as myself) . Although a hint book 
 is avaiable, it would ruin the game, and I would only resort to it if I was unable to progress. 
 Either way, this game is very good. The narrative techniques are unrivaled by any other game ever. 
 The story is very good, and picks up pretty quickly. There are plenty of twists, and I enjoyed 
 it thouroughly. Even though I had not really remembered much from the old games of the series, 
 I was still able to get the plot just fine. I will admit though, there were a few references I 
 did not understand. Also, the game is very long. Expect to play this game for around 35-40 hours 
 before it ends, and the ending is very statisfying. Don't get me wrong, this game is far from the 
 best game ever. I would say get it if you are open-minded, or value story, graphics, and logical 
 gameplay over action.
