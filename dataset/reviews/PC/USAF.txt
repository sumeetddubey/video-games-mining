:::Review:::
Graphical flaws aside, USAF continues a revered tradition of accessible and diverse Jane's flight 
 simulations. 

 A straight line runs from Chuck Yeager's Air Combat, one of the most revered and influential PC 
 flight sims, to Jane's new survey sim USAF. The Jane's tradition of accessible flight simulations 
 with plenty of planes and options has given us Air Combat, US Navy Fighters, Advanced Tactical 
 Fighters, and Israeli Air Force, with steady improvement and little deviation from the formula. 
 USAF is no exception, but is poised to take the survey sim into new territory.  

 The appeal of this sort of simulation is because of several factors: It has a lot of planes, numerous 
 gameplay options, and moderate realism levels. Together these three elements create a package that 
 gives the more casual fan a taste of air combat without the burden of too much detail. Hard-core 
 simulation fans often shun such games for these same reasons, because the generic controls and 
 lack of extreme realism or detail seem too far removed from the real-world complexities of in-depth 
 sims like Flanker 2.0 and Falcon.  

 There's no question that USAF falls in the midrange on the realism scale. With eight flyable planes, 
 you can't expect the refined flight model and sophisticated avionics of a stand-alone simulation. 
 But for this trade-off you get those eight planes, each with unique cockpits and distinct, if not 
 precise, flight models. To simplify things, controls are shared among the eight planes, so that 
 the F-117 uses the same radar functions as the F-16, and so on.  

 USAF pushes the envelope by taking on several generations of air combat. Planes and missions come 
 from Vietnam, the Gulf War, and the near future, creating a broad canvas of action rarely seen 
 in a flight sim. You can fly in the F-15, F-16, F-22, F-117, F4, MiG 29, F-105, and A-10, plus 
 some variations on these. This diversity serves as a sort of history lesson on the development 
 of jet combat, as you go from the fast gunfights and rudimentary radar of the F-105 and F4 to the 
 hi-tech stealth precision of the F-22. All three eras (past, present, and future) are ably served 
 by full-blown campaigns illustrating the many roles of air combat. The four campaigns include a 
 present-day training situation, Vietnam, the Gulf War, and a hypothetical near-future European 
 conflict. Campaigns are semidynamic, meaning the missions are scripted with some randomization, 
 and resources are tracked throughout the course of the campaign. If you use missiles and lose airframes 
 carelessly, you'll probably find yourself short on funds later in the campaign. It's not the true 
 dynamic battlefield found in the likes of Longbow and Falcon, but the missions are tight and the 
 campaigns are satisfying.  

 The rest of the play options feature the stunning array of game types that are the trademark of 
 the Jane's line. You can create almost any encounter you want with a quick mission option. Air-to-air 
 and strike missions can be configured to pit any aircraft or group against any other in any situation, 
 altitude, and position of advantage. Want to try a wing of Phantoms against a single Strike Eagle? 
 It will take you about a minute. You can also simply start a random quick mission that will choose 
 all these settings for you. Scripted stand-alone missions take on specific historical encounters 
 and elaborate hypothetical scenarios that cover the entire range of air combat. USAF is playable 
 online via Jane's Combat. net matching service, and will also form the core of the forthcoming Jane's 
 World War: a massively multiplayer persistent-world air-combat arena. It will be your first point 
 of entry to this ambitious project, but the beta and final launch dates of Jane's World War are 
 uncertain as of this time.  

 Visually, USAF is inconsistent. The detail on the planes and objects is good, and while terrain 
 looks decent from high altitudes, you'll see some real problems with it once you get down low. 
 The landscape textures have visible seams. There's also an odd kind of texture pop-in as the terrain 
 visibly smoothes during flight. Even the trees and bushes look funny: small, blinking, and quite 
 distracting. Frame rates are adequate on a high-powered system, but the terrain problems in Pixel's 
 Israeli Air Force persist in this newer simulation. In high-altitude aircraft this isn't a problem, 
 but with the mud runs of the A-10 and F15, it becomes more of an issue.  

 Graphical flaws aside, USAF continues a revered tradition of accessible and diverse Jane's flight 
 simulations. There are more missions and planes in this one package than in a dozen other recent 
 sims, and its diverse features and the important place USAF will have in Jane's World War will 
 keep it flying for a long, long time to come.

 combat. Good selection of aircraft and armarments. Good training regiment. No support to fix current

Review:  I was used to playing the world war two flight simulators, and then i found this game at our computer 
 desk, I thought it wouldnt be much more diffrent. I was wrong. this game is vary complex, and it 
 can't be made simple through the options, you still have to adjust every single thing, while in 
 a dogfight, the ground quality is vary good, one of the best ive seen, and i would recomend this 
 game to those people who like complex flight simulators. this game also has a mission editor, so 
 you can create your own works, but i haven't gotten it to work, evry time, it wont let me see the 
 map or the flights.

Review:  USAF has many astounding features that makes it a wonderful flying experience. It is compelling, 
 and the excitement rarely dies down while playing. It is one of the greatest flight simulators 
 that the Jane's company has created. The game features several campaigns, as well as single and 
 training missions. Every action the player takes is recorded in the pilot logbook, and the player 
 is awarded points, ranks, and medals based on mission performances. There are 4 campaigns, two 
 are historic, and two are futuristic. Each has a set of missions that must be completed in order 
 to successfully finish the campaign. This game also allows the player to fly any of 8 different 
 aircraft. Also, during the game, if the player's plane is destroyed, all is not lost, because the 
 player can switch flights and fly another aircraft. However, deaths are recorded in the logbook. 
 The graphics look very realistic. Aircraft models are almost exact, and the terrain is created 
 using satellite photos of the area. Trees, houses, and other objects are visible when flying close 
 to the ground. Explosions and other special effects also look good. The game does not feature music 
 while playing, but there are different music themes at each menu. The voices are well done, but 
 the voice acting could use a little bit of work. Sound effects are all good, too. The game has 
 a long enough campaign and many missions to play through. It also supports multi-player online. 
 Overall, USAF is a great game. The best feature is the ability to fly eight different aircraft, 
 and the pilot logging system. This game is a very entertaining, and thrilling experience.
