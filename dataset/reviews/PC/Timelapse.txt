:::Review:::
Timelapse's intriguing storyline and fairly well designed collection of puzzles should bring GTE 
 kudos. 

 "When in Rome, do as the Romans do." Words of wisdom for anyone who sets out on this adventure from 
 GTE Entertainment. Myst-ically influenced, with a first-person perspective and still-framed graphics, 
 Timelapse is one expedition where the ability to assimilate is an important advantage. The adventure 
 begins when you respond to a message from a scholarly comrade, Professor Alexander Nicholas. He 
 believes several ancient civilizations - Egyptian, Mayan and Anasazi - are somehow genetically 
 linked to the mysterious city of Atlantis, and he needs your help to unlock the mystery. Arriving 
 on present-day Easter Island, you embark on an adventure transcending time, space, and occasionally 
 logic. Get ready for one heck of a history lesson.  

 Timelapse contains a wide variety of puzzles, ranging from simple to mind-bending. While some puzzles 
 - like playing the lizard in a game of Simon (the colored light game) - teeter on being more bothersome 
 than challenging, others - like matching up symbols using the three-dial Mayan calendar - are practically 
 impossible. A few can be solved using luck rather than skill. But the majority of puzzles have 
 been designed with some relevance to each culture, which results in a genuine feeling of immersion. 
 You might actually believe you were looking at Egypt during the height of its empire if it weren't 
 for the absence of intelligent inhabitants.  

 Fortunately you can use several objects on your expedition - the professor's journal and a camera. 
 The camera, which can take up to 36 pictures, will provide comic relief for most players ("See, 
 this is where I stabbed the crocodile. Cute huh?") , rather than help with the game. The journal, 
 while lengthy and often a real chore to read, provides a fairly detailed account of the professor's 
 discoveries of the civilizations you're exploring. If carefully read, it can offer some useful 
 clues and background information, but you'll still need to apply some good old-fashioned brain 
 power to successfully make it through the game.   

 While moving through Timelapse is often a lengthy series of point-and-clicks, some locations can 
 be reached using a hyperlink feature which moves you multiple steps in only one click. This is 
 especially useful when exploring the Mayan temples. Your inventory is limited to one item, so remember 
 where you found the object that disappeared when you picked up that second item because that's 
 where you'll find it waiting for you.   

 Although some of the gameplay is quirky and you'll spend a lot of time surveying each civilization 
 looking for clues, the experience will be a visual delight. Timelapse is truly an optical masterpiece. 
 Each world is displayed in beautifully detailed, high-res graphics that tantalize the senses. Combined 
 with well-designed sounds and motion - like the waves pounding against the shores of Easter Island, 
 and the creatures on the Anasazi terrain who scurry across your path - the realism is admirable. 
 Hands down, Timelapse is one of the prettiest adventure games of the year.  

 Timelapse's intriguing storyline and fairly well designed collection of puzzles should bring GTE 
 kudos for delivering an experience that will appeal to both the novice and the hard-core adventurer. 
 And if they aren't careful, players might just come away from Timelapse learning something about 
 several amazing ancient civilizations - or at the very least, realize how much they forgot from 
 their high school history classes.

Review:  This game is a very "puzzly" game. The game has lots of puzzles which you have to figure out in 
 order to finish the game. You are a archaeologist trying to find what happened at the ancient days. 
 Like the Nubian Empire or some Native American area. The game is SUPERBLY HARD! I cannot tell you 
 how hard it is! It's probably one of the hardest games I ever playe din my whole life. The game 
 may seem fun, but it seems "lonely".
  
  The game is a fun game, it can teach alot of history subjects to players such as myself (educational) . 
 The game is okay, not too good, and not too bad.

Review:  Timelapse is surely one of the best adventure games I ever played. 
  What really got me into it was the magnificent graphics, which is near perfection, the interesting 
 storyline and great gameplay.
  
  The puzzles here are very good and all of them make sense in the development of the story. The 
 difficulty level is just right; not too intricate that you can't solve them, not too easy to the 
 point of taking away the fun. It's just a matter of finding the most logical solution. I wish all 
 adventure games would be like that!
  
  There are some similarities with Myst, as you will have several ages to visit, that you can complete 
 in any sequence, only here they are based in real historical civilizations (except Atlantis of 
 course, but that would be another discussion...)
  These ages are very well created, both graphically and in terms of sound effects, and you will 
 certainly get immersed. It features good live-acting and a background music that's adequate for 
 this kind of epic game
  
  There are a few glitches in the game though, making a couple of puzzles a bit annoying to solve, 
 which keep me from giving it a higher score. 
  
  Overall, I can say Timelapse is a very good game, for anyone who's looking for a nice epic adventure 
 in the style of Myst.
