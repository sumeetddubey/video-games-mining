:::Review:::
Mission Studios has essentially taken the Jetfighter III engine and wrapped it all in a cinematic 
 narrative that would have shamed Digital Pictures. 

 Journey with us now back to the days of yesteryear, when games needed DOS 4GW, hardware configuration 
 was manual, and the horizon only stretched as far as the fog filter. If you like to gnash your 
 teeth over Windows 95 games, maybe you should pick up Jetfighter: Full Burn for a blast from the 
 past that will remind you of all the things you don't miss about those thrilling old DOS days. 

 Mission Studios' Jetfighter series has built a strong following with its easy-to-grasp and generally 
 technologically competent sims. Unfortunately, it's returned to the well one too many times with 
 Full Burn, a shameless rehash of Jetfighter III that features sadly outdated technology.  

 Full Burn is the Wing Commander of jet sims. Mission Studios has essentially taken the Jetfighter 
 III engine, added some modest texture smoothing via 3Dfx support (the only hardware acceleration 
 it supports) , and wrapped it all in a cinematic narrative that would have shamed Digital Pictures. 
 The core of the game is virtually identical to Jetfighter III, with a few minor additions. The 
 F/A-18 and F-22 are back and flying, along with the newly added Russian MiG-42. A fair combination 
 of tutorials, instant action, and narrative campaign provide plenty of diverse and generally interesting 
 missions. Multiplay, however, is still limited to Kali and IPX.  

 Full Burn has decent frame rates, but the graphics simply don't pass muster. Grafting hardware support 
 onto an old DOS engine hasn't done much. Objects lack the definition of more recent sims, terrain 
 is blotchy, the instruments are blocky and hard to read, and the horizon fogs out almost right 
 in front of your nose. As a sim, it is definitely low-end on the realism scale and seems even less 
 accurate than its predecessors. All the planes feel the same, and though stalls are modeled, few 
 other physical elements are. (Actually, stalls seem over-modeled and inaccurate.) Enemy AI is average, 
 and wingmen don't seem particularly aggressive or tactically sophisticated. There are no advanced 
 mission editing or loadout options, and avionics are beyond simplified.   

 The point of Full Burn seems to be to create a user-friendly sim with lots of video and a "virtual" 
 air base that you can walk around. The video, however, is grade Z cheese. Two sets are included: 
 one for the Russian side, another for the Americans. The story centers around pilots fighting a 
 war over Norway, and we get everything from their stilted briefings to their boring home lives. 
 It takes six clips to do what one could have done better, and all the actors seem to be refugees 
 from an Andy Sidaris movie. If the scenery wasn't largely virtual, they would have eaten it.  

 
 Even with all these negatives, there is still a place for Full Burn on the hard drive of gamers 
 who want jet-fighting action without the fuss. The sim element is about at the level of a Wing 
 Commander, with no complex instruments to learn or difficult physics to get in the way. Combined 
 with the narrative element (weak as it is) , it could appeal to gamers looking for a quick and engaging 
 action-based fighter sim. The main reason it's not a total wash is that the missions themselves 
 are interesting, and the gameplay is generally entertaining. It's not a very good sim, but viewed 
 as a narrative action game it delivers some entertaining moments.
