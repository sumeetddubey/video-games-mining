:::Review:::
Interplay has managed to combine top-notch graphics, sound, and gameplay with a detailed historical 
 framework to create a title that is both addictive and entertaining. 

 Most historical simulations share a common problem: their developers, after devoting hours and hours 
 to detailed period research, don't seem to have enough time left over to create decent game frameworks 
 that use the information properly. The end result? Many gamers think historical sims are boring 
 or drywhen, in fact, if combined with solid gameplay, these games can provide unparalleled 
 realism for adventure and strategy fans. In their latest release, Conquest of the New World, Interplay 
 has managed to combine top-notch graphics, sound, and gameplay with a detailed historical framework 
 to create a title that is both addictive and entertaining from start to finish.  

 Gamers will first notice Conquest's incredible landscape graphics. In the standard strategy tradition, 
 players move their various pieces (including explorers, colonists, and soldiers) through a blacked-out 
 world, uncovering beautiful mountains, plains, and rivers. The first player to discover any landmark 
 gets to name it. After mapping out some of the local terrain, the next step is to build a colony 
 and make it self-sufficient. To this end, players can build sawmills, metal mines, housing, and 
 farms to generate the resources and space necessary to expand, and eventually, to build more colonies. 
 Then comes the hard part: convincing the natives and other countries of the world that you are 
 a force to be reckoned with.  

 As with any good strategy game, combat is an inevitability in Conquest of the New World, and Interplay 
 has done an excellent job here as well. Combat takes place on a simple three-by-four grid; each 
 competing combatant controls three different unit types (infantry, cavalry, and artillery) and 
 attacks other forces with varying success, depending on the skill of the army's leaders. This abstract 
 warfare system works extremely well, offering players a chance to affect the outcome of their battles 
 through tactical skill, while keeping each individual conflict relatively short (most battles take 
 between three and six minutes) .  

 Thanks to its outstanding featuresthe naming of geographic markers (nothing is as satisfying 
 as mountains and rivers named after gastrointestinal disorders) , historical atmosphere, customizable 
 play (you can align yourself with a nationality that matches your particular style) , and network 
 options (up to six players can compete) Conquest of the World manages to take an interesting 
 era and make it into a fantastic strategy game.

Review:  Games should be patterned after Conquest of the New World. It is a very simple game that is a bit 
 weak on graphics by today's standards but it is fun, strategic and addicitve. I would certainly 
 put this game in my all time top twenty. If there were a well done remake of this game that updated 
 it and slightly expanded it, CNW could be in my top five. 
  
  Very simple engine that incorporates exploration, resources, town building, stratigic combat, technology 
 research, trade, etc., and does them all very well. This game is actually quite similar to Master 
 of Orion 2 as far as game play although combat and technology are very much smaller (and of course 
 it is not set in space) .

Review:  When I first played this game I could not believe the graphics and the sound! It took me a while 
 to master the movement of the units. It took me a longer time to figure out how to settle, but 
 once I did I kept playing the game for hours!
  
  The battle mode is extremley fantasic, the sounds and the music background, it made it alsome!
 
  
  When you first settle you only have a few materials, so you can only build a few buildings! The 
 buildings you should build first are woodcutters 3 min, a house or two, a dock, a metal mine or 
 two and a gold mine!
  
  you should have your scouts exploring on their own! and have all army units in your settlement 
 to defend against raids!
  
  As you get more into the game you will have the choose to level up your settlement, max level is 
 4 except for playing as the natives, which level 2!
  
  As you get further into the game you can create more settler units to expand your colony.
  
 
  This game is excellent and addictive!
