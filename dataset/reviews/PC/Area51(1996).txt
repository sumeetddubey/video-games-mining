:::Review:::
Area 51 comes up short in gameplay, graphics, and sound effects. 

 Every once in a while, a company releases a computer game that sets new standards for the industry 
 - offering outstanding graphics, stunning sound, and truly addictive gameplay. Area 51 is not that 
 game. A repetitive, derivative shooter that offers nothing in the way of original features, Area 
 51 is inferior to many of its predecessors. For fans of the genre, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake, and even 
 Doom are far better choices.  

 Area 51's plot involves an alien infection at the famous "secret" military base. You are a soldier, 
 a member of the Special Tactical Advanced Alien Response Team. According to the manual, you have 
 been trained to deal with this exact situation. (I question the "training" involved, when the manual 
 later advised me, "shoot anything that moves.") Once past the opening screen, you are given several 
 options to configure the program to your taste. Unfortunately, there's no setting available that 
 makes the game interesting or fun. A practice mode allows you to shoot mindlessly at the mutants 
 until you've vented your anger at paying good money for the program. One positive note is the ability 
 to adjust the mouse sensitivity - it has a tremendous influence on your accuracy.  

 Once you've begun the game, you're off on what literally looks like a roller-coaster ride. The graphics 
 are low-res, which allows for an impressive frame rate. Your task is simply to shoot everything 
 that moves, except for members of your team. You have no control over how you move or where you 
 move. You simply shoot at barrels, ammo crates, windows, paintings (?!?) , machinery, and the occasional 
 mutant. The game may actually retain your interest the first time you play. Once you replay it, 
 though, you'll realize how little randomness is involved. If you play it enough, you'll be able 
 to hit the mutants simply because you have memorized their locations. When you die, enter your 
 initials into the Roll of Honor; after all, anyone who plays this game long enough to qualify deserves 
 some sort of reward.  

 Area 51 comes up short in gameplay, graphics, and sound effects. Many shooters crowd the PC game 
 market, but this one has very little to recommend it. If you see it on a store shelf, be afraid. 
 Be very afraid.

Review:  This game is terrible. There is absolutley nothing about this game that i can say is good. Its 
 graphics are like Pong. The sound is like Pong. Even the the everything is like Pong! Area 51 brings 
 nothing new to the table, and what it does bring to the table, is smelly and has mold on it. So 
 I would reccomend this game to no one because it is completley broken. So if you see this game 
 at the store and say It looks interesting. You should be saying It looks like crap. Yeah..... this 
 game sucks hard. Really hard. Really really hard.
