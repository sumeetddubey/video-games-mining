:::Review:::
There are a few flies in the ointment with Terracide, the biggest being the issue of control.

 You'd be hard-pressed to find a game that's more derivative than Terracide, an unabashed Descent 
 clone coupled with a tired "save the earth from destruction by alien invaders" story. But that's 
 not nearly as damning as it sounds. After all, plot is usually the last thing any self-respecting 
 action hound cares about anyway. And you only have to look at games like Dark Forces, Duke Nukem 
 3D, and Total Annihilation to realize that just because a game borrows liberally from a renowned 
 predecessor doesn't mean it can't shine in its own right.  

 And in many ways, Terracide does indeed shine. Gameplay will come as second nature to anyone who's 
 played Descent or even Hellbender: Flying a funky skull-shaped assault ship, your task is to exterminate 
 every enemy you encounter in the winding corridors and dark rooms of several invading enemy vessels. 
 You're given specific goals for each level, such as knocking out computers and other equipment, 
 and you'll also square off against your erstwhile Earthlings in some outer-space dogfights. But 
 at its core Terracide revolves around blasting enemies to smithereens - and I've got no problem 
 with that at all.  

 Thanks to native support for several popular 3D cards, the scenery graphics here are the best yet 
 seen in a spelunkin'-and-shootin' game. The lighting effects are especially tasty, with close-in 
 firefights lighting up passageways with the glow of destruction; when you toast an enemy, you can 
 see transparent concussion rings traveling from the center of the explosion. Sometimes it feels 
 as if Terracide developer Simis went overboard trying to flex its 3D muscle - you'll run into all 
 sorts of mirrored objects such as cubes and spheres that serve no purpose other than to prove the 
 reflections are accurate, and the main menu is fully three-dimensional too - but the overall effect 
 is pretty impressive.  

 Enemy graphics aren't quite as impressive, due mainly to an absence of detail - the bad guys look 
 like ornery polygons more than anything else - but with a 3D accelerator the smoothness of the 
 animation makes up for any visual shortcomings.   

 Another strong point is the arsenal. Five of the weapons - phasers, bombs, chain gun, rockets, and 
 bouncing bombs - boast three levels of firepower: grab two extra phasers, for instance, and you 
 can cycle between standard, rapid-fire, and scatter-fire. And that's not all - if you pick up a 
 couple of extra weapon mounts you can fire three weapons simultaneously. There's even a guided 
 missile that you steer to the target, perfect for landing hits on an especially strong opponent 
 who's lurking around a corner or just over a rise in a corridor. Toss in a few oddball weapons 
 like a gravity bomb (draws enemies toward you) and a teleport bomb (sends the target through a 
 teleport) , and you've pretty much got everything you need to kick some rogue Terran ass.  

 Multiplayer options are just as strong as the weaponry, with support for up to 16 players over a 
 network and free Internet play on Mplayer. In addition to deathmatch play, there are also options 
 for capture-the-flag and team play.  

 So far, so good. But there are a few flies in the ointment here, the biggest being the issue of 
 control. Regardless of what input device was used - and I tested a SideWinder 3D Pro, an F-16 CombatStick, 
 and the keyboard - it was almost impossible to line up shots on a consistent basis because the 
 ship wouldn't stop turning when I wanted it to. Releasing the left-arrow key should cause the ship 
 to stop turning left immediately - not a half-second later. An argument could be made that such 
 drifting is meant to recreate the sensation of moving in a zero-gravity environment, but if that's 
 the case, an "unrealistic" mode would be much appreciated. There are some other weak spots - the 
 enemies don't have a lot of personality, the levels have a "samey" feel despite differences in 
 layout and appearance, and the space-combat sequences are little more than toss-offs - but they're 
 minor compared to the control question.  

 But the bright spot is that Terracide is enjoyable enough to try to deal with the sluggish controls. 
 If you enjoyed Descent or any of its ilk, Terracide definitely has enough going for it to invest 
 some time, at least on the demo. If you can cope with the controls - and if you've got one of the 
 cards that Terracide provides native support for - then this one's a keeper.

Review:  And you probably have.
  
  The game is very basic. Of course shooting things can be a lot of fun. and In the terminology of 
 the days. Turning up the sound blaster can make the game almost scary when your low on health and 
 you hear the huge foot steps of one of those walking thingies. The only problem with those is, 
 the foot steps make them sound a lot bigger than they actually are. Actually, if you approach one, 
 you will laugh and cry at the same time for ever fearing one. But thats not the point. Game play 
 is a major issue here, and the controls are a bit clumsy. But if you can master them, and learn 
 to dodge (something I never learned) you can win this game easily. As it is with myself, I just 
 rely on shooting things as fast as possible. I found a joystick was needed to play this game at 
 all effectivly. But the amount of movement and hard turns, especially in space battles, kept breaking 
 my sticks! hahaha.
  I can't recommend this game as a good investment. And although graphically its decent, ive only 
 played the ATI version. the games low controls, lack of creativity, rather stupid missions and 
 all well to known story, make it a game to just play when you are really really bored.
