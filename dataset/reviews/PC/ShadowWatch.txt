:::Review:::
The game's most notable and impressive feature is the slick, hand-painted artwork that gives Shadow 
 Watch the look and style of a graphic novel. 

 Red Storm's Shadow Watch is the sort of game that grows on you. Initially, the turn-based strategy 
 game may put you off due to its odd implementation of movement commands and its stringent constraint 
 that prevents you from continuing on if any of your team members die. But if you stick with the 
 game for a little while, you may just find yourself hooked by its unique look and addicting gameplay. 

 The events of Shadow Watch surround the development of the International Space Station that's being 
 handled by a multinational consortium of private corporations. As leader of the consortium's security 
 force - code-named Shadow Watch - you lead a small group of operatives in a series of missions 
 to protect the project and the personnel associated with it. The game's branching campaign engine 
 is pretty impressive, as the game can begin in a different location each time you play it. Also, 
 as you speak with nonplayer characters between missions, the path of the campaign will twist and 
 turn according to the tone and nature of your conversations. The ever-changing campaign adds to 
 the replay value, but you will notice that in some cases the game channels you toward certain types 
 of missions no matter what dialogue options you choose.  

 The missions of Shadow Watch take place in 18 different locations scattered across three geographic 
 regions: Hong Kong, Baikonur (in Kazakhstan) , and Rio de Janeiro. Essentially, you must clear each 
 location before moving on to the next one. Missions include basic surveillance, raids on heavily 
 defended installations, hostage rescues, and some good old fashioned thievery. For each mission, 
 you may select a group of up to six operatives, each of whom must survive for the mission to be 
 a success. This is an area in which Shadow Watch differs from other tactical combat games, where 
 you can typically replace lost team members with new recruits. But Shadow Watch limits you to the 
 same six characters each time you play. And since each character has a very narrow area of expertise, 
 you must carefully develop each one so that he or she becomes more potent and reliable as the game 
 progresses. Fortunately, because you only have a small number of characters to keep track of, you 
 can make sure they all develop into hard-core fighting machines. Your troops can train between 
 missions and learn much-needed skills, as each one has a unique tree of ten skills that he or she 
 can eventually master.  

 The game's most notable and impressive feature is the slick, hand-painted artwork that gives Shadow 
 Watch the look and style of a graphic novel - and a good one, at that. The interface screens and 
 static menus look great due to the stylish illustrations, but the actual gameplay unfolds with 
 hand-painted characters moving fluidly against hand-painted backdrops. The overall effect is both 
 unique and attractive, and it sets Shadow Watch apart from other tactical-combat games. In addition, 
 Shadow Watch has an excellent musical score, which is reminiscent of the music in Rainbow Six. 
 The game's sound effects are also top-notch, though the quips uttered after a character is shot 
 can be repetitive and annoying. You view each mission from the same top-down isometric angle typical 
 to many other tactical-combat games. Although Shadow Watch does a decent job of making walls and 
 other obstacles transparent as you direct characters behind them, it's often very difficult to 
 see doors and windows in those transparent walls. This can be frustrating as you discover enemies 
 walking through unseen doors to pump bullet after bullet into your characters' backs.  

 However, the game's most potentially frustrating feature is the movement system. Shadow Watch is 
 a turn-based game that relies on the conventions of map grids and action points for maneuvering 
 your characters around. But instead of using the mouse to click on a destination, you must guide 
 each character step-by-step through each mission. What's worse, at the beginning of the game, most 
 characters have very few action points to work with, and only a few can earn more as you proceed. 
 As a result, missions can seem tedious and unnecessarily awkward. Yet while it isn't the most sensible 
 of movement systems, it'll likely grow less annoying after you bear with it through several missions. 

 Besides that, the only real problem with Shadow Watch is the sometimes-bizarre turn sequence that 
 seems to give the computer a distinct advantage. For example, during your turn, you may only get 
 to issue a movement order to one character before the game returns control to the enemy side. So 
 instead of setting up a well-coordinated move involving three or more of your characters, you may 
 find that the first guy you moved is a sitting duck for enemies who have lined up to shoot him. 
 This can be extremely annoying, especially considering the no-casualty restriction on each mission. 

 Rather than forcing you to keep the same six characters alive the whole time, the game instead could 
 have greatly benefited from a larger pool of available troops. Not only would that have significantly 
 enhanced the replay value, but it also would have allowed for more flexibility in the missions. 
 However, aside from repetitive sound bytes and a few questionable design decisions, Shadow Watch 
 is an entertaining tactical-combat game. Its artwork is superb and its gameplay can be a lot of 
 fun, despite its shortcomings.
