In exchange for your money, you're getting a quality flight simulation with continued support and 
 some of the most experienced opponents to ever play online. 

 For several years now WarBirds (originally known as Confirmed Kill) has graced the unfriendly skies 
 of the Internet, billed as one of the most intense and realistic World War II flight simulators 
 ever attempted for the computer. In WarBirds you don't fly against computer opponents; instead, 
 you face hundreds of other human pilots connected to the same server. Over time, the game has been 
 improved, more historical aircraft have been introduced, and the graphics have undergone tremendous 
 improvement. Until now, interested parties have had to download the entire game. Now, you have 
 the option of buying a boxed version in the store.  

 WarBirds can be played on iMagic Online with hundreds of other human opponents, or offline with 
 several generic missions and practice missions. WarBirds also supports head-to-head for those who 
 want to play with other humans but don't want to pay the monthly online charges. Playing WarBirds 
 online costs $10 a month and $2 an hour after four hours. Expensive, especially compared with other 
 games of a similar nature? You bet, but in exchange you're getting a quality flight simulation 
 with continued support and some of the most experienced opponents to ever play online.  

 Now Warbirds features a 3D graphics engine using Microsoft's Direct3D, and the results are pretty 
 spectacular. Aircraft are gorgeously modeled, the terrain flows smoothly, smoke from ground fires 
 wavers, and aircraft flame and explode in the skies. While computer-assisted art with many individually 
 modeled gauges is still used in the cockpit, the rest of the plane is drawn internally as it is 
 seen externally - as a 3D model. This way you can visibly see damage to your aircraft when you 
 glance out of the canopy. System requirements aren't as stiff as other 3D-accelerated games, but 
 a Pentium 90 is required. A separate, non-Direct3D version is also included, and WarBirds is also 
 available on the Macintosh.  

 Getting into the air is a pretty simple affair, but learning how to fly your aircraft is a completely 
 different matter. There are over 50 aircraft airframes and models to choose from, each with unique 
 flight characteristics and modeling. Learning the advantages, disadvantages, and quirks of an aircraft 
 can literally take tens of hours, and much of that learning cannot be done shooting at dummy drones 
 offline. Choosing a plane and learning its nuances is probably the hardest aspect of WarBirds. 
 Expert pilots know how to fly a variety of aircraft equally well and know how they perform in the 
 game. Aircraft may even have some physical limitations that prove detrimental to your health when 
 you fly. Those who want to skip the complex learning curve of flying altogether can jump in the 
 gunner's seat of a bomber and let someone else fly.  

 Online there are four countries that battle each other for supremacy in the air and on the ground, 
 each attempting to conquer the others by disabling and capturing all of their airfields. It's a 
 rather simplistic strategic system to give the players something to do; a much more detailed system 
 is in the works. Typical arenas usually house between 40 and 200 pilots and over 20 airfields of 
 various sizes, which can result in some extremely hairy dogfights. Because this is an Internet 
 game, you will run into another frustration: lag, which is especially prominent in these large 
 dogfights. Despite all of the prediction and anti-congestion technology built into the game, Internet 
 lag, bad ping times, and packet loss can quickly kill the enjoyment of a dogfight.  

 WarBirds promotes a huge virtual pilot community, which stretches into all professions and people. 
 There are over a hundred "squadrons" or groups of pilots that team up whenever they can online, 
 conventions are held every year in Texas, and Interactive Magic Online's technical support is some 
 of the best in the industry. The boxed version includes everything needed on a CD-ROM as well as 
 a 72-page manual, a reference card, and $30 of free online time. When you're flying against hundreds 
 of human opponents, it's the best kind of action there is. Try it out and see if you agree.

Review:  The learning curve is high but well worth it. Expect to swap rounds with some of the best pilots 
 in the WWII air combat sim universe. There's a wonderful range of aircraft to fly - from the standard 
 P-51's & 109's to more obscure models like the C205 Macchi, and ground vehicles too. The graphics 
 are stunning with the latest release from 2008 with new weather models. Online trainers are competent 
 experts, but free too - so you're not left alone to figure out the tricks of the trade. Fly alone 
 or join a squadron and work as a tight group to capture airfields and win the war for your country.
 
  
  I only wish the producer - IEN Entertainment, would do something about the rampant cheating from 
 a single player - 'vulche'. It's caused a lot of people to leave the game... Each user has to pay 
 about $20.00 USD a month and it's ridiculous to have a single player - 'vulche' - exploiting the 
 game. Evidently, IEN cannot prove that he is, in fact cheating, so they allow it to continue. It's 
 a shame because this could have been a great game going into the future.
