:::Review:::
If you've never taken up arms in the Kohan universe, this is your second chance to introduce yourself 
 to a new brand of real-time strategy game -- and you shouldn't miss it again. 

  Kohan: Ahriman's Gift is billed as a "stand-alone prequel" to this spring's excellent fantasy-themed 
 real-time strategy game, Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns. Those who have never played Kohan: Immortal 
 Sovereigns will find Ahriman's Gift a substantial revision of the old RTS build-and-rush formula, 
 which introduces a slower pace and a focus on tactics. However, those who played the original will 
 simply find the same game in a new package.
 
 Kohan: Ahriman's Gift is not an expansion pack to the original game. Aside from the addition of 
 some new units (like the crossbowman, who functions as a sort of heavy archer) and very minor tweaks 
 to the original units, Ahriman's Gift plays just like Immortal Sovereigns. Ahriman's Gift does 
 include new campaigns, but these seem easier to complete than the ones in the original, which had 
 a few extremely difficult missions. For the most part, this is a rerelease with new maps, campaigns, 
 and a few new multiplayer game types.
 
 The Kohan game engine attempts to eliminate the frenetic pace and mouse-clicking that had become 
 associated with so many real-time strategy games, as well as to introduce a strategic depth reminiscent 
 of classic turn-based games. It succeeded in the former by organizing units into companies. Players 
 choose the composition of the frontline and support units, and the company then functions as a 
 single entity. Because you will have far fewer companies than other RTS games have units, micromanagement 
 is greatly reduced, while the fact that each company has multiple units means that you still feel 
 like you're commanding a substantial army. You can't give specific orders to the individual units, 
 and you can't give orders to companies once they have become engaged in combat (except to order 
 them to rout) , and the result is a feeling of larger-scale strategy.
 
 The focus on cities is imperfect, however. Because there are few on-map resources to control, cities 
 are self-contained production engines that drive your war effort. In the Heroes of Might &amp; 
 Magic series, the turn-based system to which Kohan is sometimes compared, castles are essentially 
 useless without the special resources that can be found only in mines scattered across the map, 
 and simply marching from castle to castle does you little good if you don't have the resources 
 to take advantage of a castle's production. Kohan's improvement-based system means that taking 
 enemy cities will rapidly shift the balance of power in your direction, and the most effective 
 way to do that is by massed force. In the end, there is less maneuvering and tactical gameplay 
 than there could be.
 
 A problem with the Kohan combat is that while units have certain special bonuses (for example, paladins 
 are more effective against shadow units) , these bonuses are not enough to overcome the standard 
 real-time strategy focus on sheer numbers. Kohan is still about building the largest army (regardless 
 of composition) and throwing it at the enemy. Hero units are also not powerful enough to make up 
 for enemy numbers.
 
 The last problem with Kohan is that it lacks atmosphere, and this hasn't changed with Ahriman's 
 Gift. The fantasy setting seems rather flat, and the feeble back story doesn't really add anything 
 to the game. The graphics, while clean and sharp, are also somewhat uninspired, and this is made 
 worse by the small units that don't allow for the game to express much visual style. The appeal 
 of Kohan is definitely in the gameplay.
 
 The artificial intelligence in Ahriman's Gift is still remarkably good and will challenge the newcomer 
 even on the easy level. The computer's tactics are generally quite good, and you'll find that just 
 when you think you've concentrated an overwhelming force against your enemy, it has somehow managed 
 to bring forces to bear against your weakest spot.
 
 Whether or not you buy Ahriman's Gift has everything to do with how much you enjoyed Immortal Sovereigns 
 in the first place -- if you even played it at all. If you've never taken up arms in the Kohan universe, 
 this is your second chance to introduce yourself to a new brand of real-time strategy game -- and 
 you shouldn't miss it again. However, if you merely enjoyed Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns, full price 
 is a lot to pay for a set of new campaigns. And if you absolutely loved the original, then you 
 probably already own Ahriman's Gift, so you don't count.

Review:  The game finally adds realism to the RTS genre by it's multiple methods. 
  
  Adding morale: In most games today the units you create have some jihadist courage, you are perfect 
 and infallible.
  
  Supply lines: Instead of having to need someone to help regenerate health, units do it automatically 
 (as long as one of the group is in the supply line) .
  
  Modes of Attack: Archers who get attacked by melee units stow the bow and pull the sword out (alas 
 you suck still) .
  
  Experience: Every group that kills a unit gets it added to it's experience, and when you kill enough 
 your group upgrades to different levels of combat effectiveness. Good thing being a recruit doesn't 
 detract from it.
  
  Leaders: Like Warcraft every group of units has to have a leader, whether a normal leader or a 
 kohan (adds effects) .
  
  The only problem is when lines of battle have been drawn it usually ends up being a ****

Review:  Kohan is one of the best strategy games. It is different than that of age of empires or settlers 
 but still it has achieved enormous success. Success of such games is less because they require 
 much time to be spent on developing compare to other types of games. The best part of Kohan is 
 it's virtual world of Khaldun and all the monsters, heroes and units. The another positive point 
 for kohan is that heroes gain experience and gradually new powers and spells and the company achieves 
 new levels such as - Regular Veteran and then Elite. I think that more levels should be added to 
 make this game better.

Review:  Kohan: Ahriman's Gift is a pretty good game and adds on well with the original Kohan: Immortal 
 Sovereigns game. The storyline is good and the game plays also exactly like KIS. The only differences 
 are the storyline, more characters, and different technology tweaks. Basically, if you enjoyed 
 KIS, the KAG is a great game to further reveal many other details in the Kohan universe. As for 
 replayability, I beat the game and then I never really picked it up again. Sure it's got multiplayer 
 and if you're into that sort of thing then I'm sure the game will be better for you, but I just 
 never got much out of it after I beat it. Bottom line: I would recommend this is you've already 
 played KIS and loved it or if you see KAG sitting on some clearance shelf somewhere.
