:::Review:::
This is the most addictive game I have played in years. 

 WARNING: Prepare to sacrifice many of the unimportant things in your life (such as eating, sleeping, 
 working, talking to others, etc.) if you get your hands on Chaos Overlords. This is the most addictive 
 game I have played in years.  

 The concept is simple enough. The game itself is a turn-based strategic gang battle (see Urban Turfwar) 
 played on an 8x8 grid. You are a Chaos Overlord (read: Futuristic Kingpin) whose sole purpose in 
 life is to control as many city blocks as possible, therefore assuring a healthy nest egg for your 
 retirement. You accomplish this goal by hiring gangs (read: Guys With Bats) and influencing local 
 merchants in secured blocks to pay for insurance. Your gangs can also perform other tasks such 
 as chaosing (read: Looting) an area to fatten your wallet and rumbling with rival gangs (read: 
 Opening Up a Can of Whoop-Ass) . In addition, some of your more intelligent gangs can research new 
 equipment. This is very important because, as everyone knows, he who owns the most toys (especially 
 the Plasma Generator) wins. You can even equip your gangs with such items as cool hats and boom-boxes 
 to make them better diplomats and looters, respectively.   

 By including six goal-oriented scenarios and four timed scenarios, Stick Man Games has developed 
 a product that overcomes the monotony found in so many other strategic wargames. Goal-based scenarios 
 range from Eliminate, in which you must seek out and destroy a rival Chaos Overlord's Right Hand, 
 to the ever-satisfying Kill 'Em All. General philosophies such as Greed (the acquisition of cash) , 
 Power (the acquisition of property) , Acceptance (heightening popularity) , and Dominance (a combination 
 of all of the above) determine your overall score in the time-based scenarios.  

 Chaos Overlords includes four levels of Artificial Intelligence: Goon, Criminal, Crime Lord, and 
 Homicidal Maniac (read: Game Over) . After you learn the game, you should be able to rise to Goon 
 level easily, but even the Criminal level is challenging. And go ahead and forget about winning 
 on Homicidal Maniac.  

 The graphics in Chaos Overlords are superb. Although small, the pictures of the different gangs 
 and pieces of equipment are each very unique and detailed. The combat animations are smooth and 
 can be very satisfying as you watch your Shock Troopers mow down a few rival Nancy Boys. The ambient 
 soundtrack is also very appealing. The CD tracks complement the experience rather than overpowering 
 the game. I can even hear the music in my head as I drift off to sleep.  

 Perhaps the best feature in Chaos Overlords is the ability to play against up to five human opponents 
 via a network, modem, or the Internet. Human opponents offer the best challenge and, of course, 
 the most satisfying experience. There is nothing like the feeling of destroying a rival Chaos Overlord 
 in Ohio. You can even set a time limit for each player's turn, allowing for relatively fast gameplay. 

 Although not for action gamers, Chaos Overlords should overjoy anyone who likes turn-based strategy 
 wargames. But if your health starts slipping from spending too much time in front of your monitor, 
 please, please give it a restthe game will still be there tomorrow.

Review:  This game is sweet, and caught my attention from a demo cd almost 10 years ago, it's a great classic, 
 yet rare, hard to find, turn-based strategy game. It has the capabilities of multiplayer, and yet 
 unlimited times to play against the computer for single play, which i tend to favor most for some 
 reason. The graphics aren't the greatest, since it is almost 10 years old, but none the less, it 
 is a greaet game for the price if you are into this kind of game. I would highly recommend it. 
 There is no other game like it. The only thing that I hate about the full game is playing it in 
 windows xp, because it needs DOS to truly function properly.
