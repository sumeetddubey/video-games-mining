It gradually introduces bass-fishing techniques while stripping away long stretches of inactivity 
 by placing you right where the big ones are biting. 

 Since the inception of its Trophy Bass line five years ago, Sierra Sports has been the proverbial 
 big fish in the relatively small pond of fresh-water fishing simulations. About the only other 
 PC bass-fishing sims have come from budget-software king WizardWorks. But even without the pressure 
 of serious competition, each iteration in the Trophy Bass series has featured significant improvements, 
 culminating in last year's stellar Trophy Bass 3D.  

 You'd think EA Sports would have challenged Sierra's supremacy in this subgenre a long time ago, 
 but it's been only in the last few months that the company decided to venture from the world of 
 big-time spectator sports into the great outdoors. Its first effort was Deer Hunt Challenge, which 
 tried to jazz things up for hunters by adding a series of arcade-style "missions." These missions 
 were quick, point-and-shoot affairs that started out with the prey in sight and that placed a premium 
 on a quick, accurate trigger finger. Not every hunting-sim fan enjoyed these quick-and-dirty levels, 
 largely because of the linear design - if you didn't win a mission, you couldn't move on to the 
 next one.  

 Nevertheless, the overall response to this twist must have been fairly positive, as the same feature 
 is a major component of Championship Bass. Championship Bass still gives cyber-anglers the usual 
 options of heading out for single-day fishing trips and competing in bass tournaments lasting from 
 one to three days. But the game's Bass challenge mode, comprising a sequence of five-event "levels," 
 is the game's most unique feature. And for the most part it achieves exactly what EA Sports probably 
 hoped it would: It gradually introduces bass-fishing techniques while stripping away long stretches 
 of inactivity by placing you right where the big ones are biting.  

 With each outing, you're given access to a limited number of lures, but there's no need to worry 
 you don't have the right rig - there's always something in the virtual tackle box that'll get the 
 attention of those lunkers. All you've got to do is figure out which one you should use, where 
 to cast, and what type of retrieval is best for the situation. Bass-fishing novices can access 
 pro tips on all this stuff, but the text and audio presentation is a little bland compared with 
 Trophy Bass 3D's video clips. Finish in the top three at the end of a five outings, and you move 
 on to more challenges - and hopefully pick up even more knowledge and skills that you can use when 
 you decide to enter a tournament against computer opponents or against real folks over the Internet. 

 But while these fast-paced angling sessions result in plenty of bites and catches, they start to 
 veer away from anything even remotely realistic because of the addition of 27 challenge bonuses. 
 They're the fishing equivalent of power-ups, and you earn them by catching a "bonus bass" - they're 
 the ones with fiery red eyes. The bonuses include bonus timers that give you more time to find 
 that monster bass to jack up your total poundage; bonus casts that increase accuracy or distance, 
 or that provide you with specialized techniques like skipping or "no splash" landings; bonus boat 
 modes that endow you with stealth or the ability to navigate shallow water; fish flags that point 
 you to where really big bass are hanging out; and bonus lures that expand the contents of your 
 tackle box, usually with just the right lure for the situation. The bonuses are all very silly, 
 but they'll probably appeal to casual gamers. However, there's no way to turn off the power-ups, 
 so hard-core simulation players or bass-fishing veterans will probably bypass the challenge mode 
 and head straight for a fishing trip or a tournament - and it's here that it becomes apparent that 
 the game is no serious match for the ultrarealistic Trophy Bass 3D. Only six lakes are featured 
 in Championship Bass - Buggs Island and Lake Lanier in Georgia, Sam Rayburn Reservoir in Texas, 
 Lake Mead in Nevada, Lake Toho in Florida (where's Lake Okeechobee when you need it?) , and Table 
 Rock Lake in Missouri and Arkansas. These are all top-notch bass lakes, but they're few, compared 
 with the 15 in Trophy Bass 3D.  

 Then there's the game's perspective. When casting, you're presented with a behind-the-angler view 
 - but once the lure hits the lake you're switched to an underwater view similar to Trophy Bass 
 3D's "lurecam." There's nothing wrong with that except for the fact that there's no way to switch 
 back to a perspective from the boat, so you never really get the sensation of being outdoors. In 
 Trophy Bass 3D, the third-person perspectives gave you a chance to see weather effects and watch 
 your rod bend as your angler struggled to reel in a trophy fish. But in Championship Bass, the 
 action is presented from cast to catch from a distance of about two feet from the lure or fish. 
 This lets you appreciate the excellent fish graphics, but it doesn't make you feel very much like 
 you're really fishing, and it seriously detracts from the most exciting part of bass fishing: watching 
 a big lunker leap out of the water as it tries to shake the hook. You see the jump all right, but 
 not from a very satisfying perspective.  

 While Championship Bass' water and fish graphics are definitely superior to those in Trophy Bass 
 3D, it falls short in another area that many PC fishermen will feel is more important: The game 
 has no support for force-feedback joysticks. If you've never experienced great force-feedback effects 
 in a fishing simulation, you naturally won't miss it in Championship Bass - but if you've played 
 with force feedback before, you'll be praying that EA Sports puts out a patch that incorporates 
 this vital feature. Fishing is all about the sensation of touch and feel, and as such, force feedback 
 can be immeasurably effective for simulating it.  

 Championship Bass definitely won't replace Trophy Bass 3D on gamers' hard drives, especially since 
 it retails for $39.95 (though you might find a better deal at your local software store) . But it's 
 a good first effort for EA Sports, and it will certainly provide satisfaction for casual fishing 
 fans, whose main concern is seeing the fish take the bait.
