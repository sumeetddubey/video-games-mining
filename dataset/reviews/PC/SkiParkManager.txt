What is otherwise an enjoyable and challenging game is hidden beneath an unintuitive interface, 
 questionable design decisions, compatibility issues, and an overall lack of polish. 

 Ski Park Manager is similar in many ways to other recent resort management games, and true to its 
 name, it lets you build and manage your own ski resort. Unfortunately, what is otherwise an enjoyable 
 and challenging game with an interesting premise is hidden beneath an unintuitive interface, questionable 
 design decisions, compatibility issues, and an overall lack of polish. In addition, the absence 
 of any kind of tutorial ensures that you will be forced to wrestle with the game until you either 
 learn to work around the shortcomings through trial and error or give up and move on to something 
 else.           The game's grid view helps you see the contours of the mountain.    

 You begin the game with an underdeveloped mountain area and a set amount of money -- based on the 
 difficulty you select -- to invest in ski lifts, support buildings, landscaping, and other ski resort 
 features. Each scenario has a list of objectives, including a required number of ski lifts and 
 visitors, visitor approval percentage, and profit. Once you have selected one of the various mountain 
 areas to use, you position ski lifts, lay out ski runs, construct housing and support buildings, 
 and hire staff to help run the resort. When the park is opened for business, visitors will trickle 
 in and use the facilities, and you will collect money from admissions, concessions, ski rentals, 
 housing, and the other businesses you have built in the resort. The success of your resort depends 
 on the happiness of your visitors, and the happiness of your visitors depends on the quality of 
 your ski runs and other resort features.   

  The game's 3D terrain engine lets you view your mountain only from four preset isometric angles, 
 which can make it difficult sometimes to get a sense of the mountain's contours. Likewise, the 
 lack of a usable overhead view can make it difficult to lay down ski lifts and runs, since it is 
 unclear which sections of the mountain are higher than others. The game's optional grid view helps 
 to a point, but you'll still find yourself ending up with ski runs that aren't exactly what you 
 expected them to be.   

  Another part of the game that isn't entirely clear is the ski run construction tool. The tool lets 
 you choose which level of difficulty you wish to designate the run, and you string together sections 
 of the run by clicking your way down the mountain. When a particular section is unusable, part 
 of the highlighted section will turn red, which indicates a conflict of some sort. Often, this 
 will mean that you inadvertently guided your ski run through a building or other structure, but 
 occasionally it will turn red for no apparent reason, forcing you to change your ski run layout 
 or even abandon the run altogether if an alternative cannot be found.           Investing in research 
 will give you more options when improving your resort.    

 The game's graphics do a mediocre job of conveying the information necessary to build and manage 
 your resort. On one of our test systems, the pointer icon actually covered up important pricing 
 information, and while the game includes an adjustable view, none of the zoom options provides 
 an appropriate angle for constructing a longer ski run, forcing you to frequently zoom in and out -- and 
 sometimes rotate -- while placing a run or a lift. Support for higher screen resolutions or an overhead 
 topographical view may have eliminated some of these issues. Unlike the graphics, the game's sound 
 doesn't adversely affect gameplay, but it conveys the same lack of polish that reminds you that 
 you're playing a budget-priced game. On top of these issues, Ski Park Manager had some problems 
 running on one of our test systems that met the game's recommended requirements.   

  If you're willing to look past its shortcomings, the underlying game is actually fairly deep. The 
 game begins with a basic set of resort improvements, and you can invest in research to develop 
 new buildings, businesses, activity centers, lift types, and other features. You also have the 
 option to buy advertising to attract different types of visitors to your resort. You can even pay 
 to improve the skills of your employees through training. The number and type of visitors depends 
 in part on a resort's reputation, which can be adversely affected by visitor injuries and deaths 
 but also improved by young ski champions who train at the resort. The game also includes a wide 
 variety of mountain areas to choose from when building your resort, and the difficulty settings 
 give expert players a reason to play the same area more than once with different objectives. One 
 feature that would have provided some additional play value is a sandbox mode for letting you build 
 whatever resort you like without budget or research constraints.   

  While the game's numerous shortcomings detract from its appeal, serious fans of management strategy 
 games who are tired of the theme parks and golf courses may enjoy the different challenges and 
 premise found in Ski Park Manager. Those willing to put in the effort required to learn their way 
 around the game's peculiarities will eventually uncover a fairly enjoyable game that had the potential 
 to be very good. Those who don't have that kind of patience should instead pick up a more enjoyable 
 budget-priced management strategy game.
