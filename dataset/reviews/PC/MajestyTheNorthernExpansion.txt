:::Review:::
The Northern Expansion costs about half the price of a new game, and significantly extends the longevity 
 of the original. 

 Cyberlore's Majesty was last year's surprise strategy release. Dubbed "the fantasy kingdom sim," 
 Majesty combines elements of city-building games such as SimCity and Pharaoh with unit-focused 
 real-time strategy games like Warlords Battlecry. As the ruler of a kingdom in a medieval fantasy 
 setting, you construct buildings and recruit heroes to do your bidding. You don't control the heroes 
 directly, but rather assign bounties for completing particular objectives, which they attempt on 
 their own. You can also cast spells to aid them. It's a novel concept that many players have found 
 creative and refreshing. Cyberlore Studios has followed up this success with an add-on pack called 
 Majesty: The Northern Expansion.  

          The Northern Reaches of Ardania are treacherous and covered in snow.     

  The Northern 
 Expansion is a true add-on pack, so you must own the original game to play the add-on. Furthermore, 
 it's a good idea to have finished the original game or at least played it extensively, because 
 the quests in The Northern Expansion are quite difficult. There is one quest (Scions of Chaos) 
 marked as "beginner" level, but this is much more difficult than the beginner quests in the original 
 game. The rest of the quests are clearly aimed at experienced Majesty players. Several of the secret 
 quests in The Northern Expansion are incredibly tough, and without having played a fair amount 
 of the original Majesty, you'll undoubtedly find the expansion pack to be tough sledding. The Northern 
 Expansion is obviously designed with hard-core Majesty fans in mind.  

  True to its name, The Northern Expansion extends the map of Ardania northward and adds a baker's 
 dozen of new quests, as well as some enhancements to multiplayer play. When you install the expansion, 
 you'll be presented with an enlarged map from the original game, which shows the new northern lands 
 but also preserves the quests from Majesty so that you can access the combined games just by running 
 The Northern Expansion. The Northern Reaches of Ardania, complete with snowy graphics, are filled 
 with a range of new monsters, new lairs, and new buildings. The game also tweaks many of the individual 
 hero classes. One of the new buildings, the sorcerers' abode, adds six new spells to the game, 
 including the very useful change-of-heart spell, which lets you induce a hero to flee (or a fleeing 
 hero to go berserk) . Proper spellcasting is as important to Majesty as well-planned building construction, 
 and the spells added in The Northern Expansion are a significant addition to the game.  

  Another new feature is special events, which trigger things like waves of monster attacks or the 
 appearance of random heroes. While the manual touts the special events as a reason to replay old 
 Majesty quests from the original game, they don't really add that much. You'll find that the old 
 scenarios will play pretty much the same as you remembered them, albeit with some new monster attacks 
 perhaps thrown in.  

          The scenarios in The Northern Expansion can be very difficult.     

  Multiplayer enhancements 
 include a build-tree editor, which can be used to limit the number and types of buildings you can 
 construct in a multiplayer game. There's also a map view mode that lets you combine your field 
 of view with that of your allies. The freestyle (skirmish) mode is also customizable, so when added 
 together, The Northern Expansion provides quite a bit of additional gameplay. But of course, as 
 with most any expansion pack, the fundamental play style in The Northern Expansion remains the 
 same as that of the original game.  

  The decision to recommend an add-on pack hinges on two things: price and longevity. The Northern 
 Expansion costs about half the price of a new game and significantly extends the longevity of the 
 original. Therefore, if you're a fan of Majesty, you'll want to own it. If you've never played 
 the game but the concept piques your interest, expect the game and expansion to be bundled together 
 and made available for purchase at a later date.

Review:  This update to a Great Game is very disappointing. Sure, there are a few new features, extra buildings 
 and spells, and a few new monsters, which makes things a little interesting. However, the designers 
 must have listened to the the 'complaints' and made the WRONG changes. They even changed some of 
 the older quests (which was actually altered with a patch for the original game) . It seems that 
 the designers wanted to take this fun, slow-paced BUILDING STRATEGY game into the Real-Time Stupidity 
 market. Many of the quests in the update are fast and furious, which does not work with this style 
 of game. In the original game, a player could build in a nice, slow, and RELAXING manner, and that 
 has changed in many up the Northern Expansions additional programming. In the end the designers 
 pleased neither the old crowd of good customers nor did they attract the masses of RT Stupidity 
 they tried to bring in. Most disappointing.
  I recommend a try, but in the end, uninstall and play the original ... without any patches.

Review:  Majesty overall is what it actualy says on the box, a Fantasy Kingdom Sim. Now... in Majesty, you 
 are a king, and you control an entire empire (or little village depending on your skill) and complete 
 various quests and missions. The Northern Expansion basically adds a bunch of new buildings, quests, 
 and lots and lots of snow. The game has great graphics and the monsters look phenominal. One of the 
 flaws about Majesty though is your assistant who you wil hear repeating himself ALOT especially 
 if your building a chain of statues or wizard's towers. The game has decent quite music so it can 
 easily be drowned out by custom songs if the music is disliked. One great feature in Majesty is 
 the Freestyle Quests, in where you create your own quest to your liking, and you play it through. Overall 
 I highly recommend this to The Sims fans, and Midevil-ish fans.
