:::Review:::
If you've ever played Activision's Interstate '76, you'll no doubt notice its influence in Streets 
 of SimCity. 

 Some games are so precisely targeted at a specific group of gamers that they have almost no appeal 
 to anyone else. Maxis' Streets of SimCity is such a game. This driving and auto combat game lets 
 you tool around the streets of a SimCity 2000 metropolis in an arcade-style atmosphere. You can 
 head out for a calm, uneventful excursion, pick up and deliver packages, race against other drivers, 
 or blow your fellow motorists to tiny bits with rockets and machine guns. The game includes over 
 50 SimCity maps and comes with the SimCity 2000 Urban Renewal Kit, which you can use to create 
 your own maps.  

 If you've ever played Activision's Interstate '76, you'll no doubt notice its influence in Streets 
 of SimCity. The game loads up to a funky 70s-style theme. It utilizes a channel-changing metaphor 
 for selecting scenarios and tells you all about the "stars" of each "show." And of course, there's 
 the obvious similarity that both games involve a lot of fast-moving firepower. Unfortunately, this 
 isn't half the game I76 was, except possibly for die-hard SimCity fans who want to see their creations 
 from street level.  

 Streets of SimCity lets you drive five different vehicles, including one that resembles the VW Bug, 
 a Ferrari-style sports car, and a large utility van. You can customize your car (or truck) with 
 a meager array of weapons and modifications, such as armor, airfoils, and radar detectors.  

 The game includes 30 scenarios that are arranged into five pseudo-campaigns. The stories for these 
 are pretty well done and often humorous: One has you playing the role of a granny who must race 
 and fight her way past a group of invading aliens. The gameplay for all scenarios is pretty much 
 the same, however, and you must win one scenario before proceeding to the next. Money you earn 
 in one scenario can be used to upgrade your car for the next. You can also pull into a garage during 
 missions in order to get repairs and supplies.  

 As you drive around town, you'll see a number of objects on the streets. These can be power-ups 
 (ammo, armor, repairs) , packages (which can be delivered to earn money) , and targets (cows, mailboxes, 
 signs) . You'll see pedestrians, too, but they are immune to your attacks and your driving - this 
 isn't Carmageddon, after all. As you pick up certain items, you'll get status messages and clues 
 regarding a scenario's objectives. These flash quickly into the top corner of the screen and can 
 be easy to miss. Occasionally, your character will say something of importance to the mission at 
 hand, but again, these utterances are easily missed.  

 The graphics in this game are decent but are not spectacular by any stretch. Even with 3Dfx acceleration, 
 Streets of SimCity doesn't look quite as good as I76 without it. Also, the game runs sluggishly, 
 even with the acceleration. Since the cities are SimCity 2000 maps, the streets are angular and 
 turns are sometimes difficult to handle. On top of that, the game controls make it all too easy 
 to oversteer, which often leads to overcorrection and the inevitable crash. Also, the steep ramps 
 leading to bridges in this game almost always cause your car to catch air - even when you're just 
 coasting.  

 Streets of SimCity includes some nice touches, including the cool-looking Hunter car, an enemy vehicle 
 that resembles Jesse "The Body" Ventura's car from the "Jose Chung" episode of the X-Files. Also, 
 the game's racetrack editor is handy and fairly intuitive. But the game's negative points far outweigh 
 its merits. The first-person dashboard view makes it difficult to predict upcoming turns, while 
 the third-person camera angles often block your view with trees, buildings, and other objects. 
 Also, the in-dash radar is a blocky low-res display that is difficult to read. This game also crashed 
 quite a bit and displayed the occasional glitch - such as cars resting on their sides atop high 
 buildings.  

 There's no question that this game will appeal to SimCity fans who are eager to take a spin through 
 their virtual cities. For those users, this game can be quite fun. But if you're just looking for 
 a good auto combat game, you should stick to I76.

Review:  Do not buy this game, unless it's under two dollars or maybe it's a free download. But either way, 
 it's more of a way to waste time during those long, boring days. 
  To describe this game in one word... Broken.
  That about covers it. With odd, instant acceleration, 
 turning on a dime, "custom"-and i use that word loosely- cars and terrible graphics, this game 
 offers almost nothing.
  
  But that's not to say don't play it. it has multiple stories including delivery man, cop, a battle-royale 
 thing and others. The best one is where you play as an old granny set out to buy a new house. Soon 
 you discover that aliens have infiltrated the earth and have set out to destroy you. Why? I'm not 
 too sure. But anyway, you soon get machine guns and start.
  
  This game revolves around one thing, randomness. It's not unusual to see an enemy flying over a 
 desert hill to explode, after they run into you and a couple of buildings of course. There is really 
 no point, other than to run around holding space for gun.
  
  The best part is the hovering system. I can't quite figure out why the air gauge takes anywhere 
 from 3 seconds to 5 minutes to empty. But it's pretty fun flying around.
  
  So with all it's faults it still manages to be a broken oddity, having nothing to do qith the sims. 
 At all. Ever.
  
  Goodbye.

Review:  The game was good at first. I loved the graphics, but that was one of my first PC games so I didn't 
 know. I love how you can make a city, and I still do love how you can do that. But cmon, know racing! 
 Ok, for one you just ride around city, woppdy du da. But, when there are those choting guys, it 
 gets better. However, it's likr you can't finsh the game! Like, I tried killin them all, but I 
 couldn't! It's bad for that! It would be better if it had racing. However, It still is a good game! 
 So keep it up!
