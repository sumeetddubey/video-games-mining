:::Review:::
EA has done this sequel right, making a good game much, much better. 

 How do you make a good thing better? This is the question Electronic Arts faced trying to follow 
 up last year's smash hit, NBA Live 95. Well, how about adding faithful renditions of all 
 NBA courts? Or create-your-own custom teams? Or kicking bass beats that play during time-outs? 
 Or tip-dunks? Or more fancy jams and passes? How about all of the above?  

 That's exactly what EA has done with NBA Live 96. Although they're not known for drastically changing 
 their game engines (remember Lakers v. Celtics, Celtics v. Bulls, etc.?) , the folks at EA have 
 rebuilt NBA Live 96 from the ground up, using their much-ballyhooed Virtual Stadium technology. 
 Despite some slight player pixelization, you will find this game plays more like real basketball 
 than its predecessoror any other PC basketball sim, for that matter. It's easy, when you're 
 on the court, running the break, with the crowd roaring, to feeldare I say it? in 
 the gameand that will keep most players coming back for more.  

 Besides the audiovisual enhancements, the biggest improvement to NBA Live 96 is that the refs no 
 longer rule the game. Although too many defensive stands still end in fouls, you can turn the sensitivity 
 up (eliminating the pushing, shoving Laimbeer-ball of NBA Live 95) and still not spend the 
 entire game watching your opponent shoot free throws. This creates a fast-paced, physical game 
 with all the excitement, continuity and strategy of real NBA action. If you prefer a different 
 style of play, you're in luck because everything from the rules to the fouls to the difficulty 
 levelis fully adjustable.  

 Add to this new function the stellar gameplay comprehensive stats, play diagrams, shot charts, trades, 
 and player photos and comparisons (you can pick any two players and see how they stack up against 
 each other in every conceivable way) , and it's clear that EA has done this sequel right, making 
 a good game much, much better.

Review:  This brand new NBA live game is not something to be pleased with, but it still has the ability 
 to just satisfy newbies. Its graphics are innovative and it is the first time I ever played such 
 a game. Although, there are some drawbacks which should be fixed in the next version of NBA Live. 
 Some difficulties in the players' movements are obvious, and the options the player has are limited. 
 There is a great authenticity when talking about the teams and the players but I would like them 
 to give us the ability to create our own players and have them playing in one of the twenty-nine 
 teams. The music and the sounds are quite impressive, despite the problems which occur when your 
 sound system is different from the ones compatible.
  To sum up, i would like to say that I am very grateful that EA sports still tries not to dissapoint 
 its fans and give it their best shot.
