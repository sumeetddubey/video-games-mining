:::Review:::
For a change, here's a bloodless first-person combat game. In addition to lacking blood, it also 
 lacks replay value and fun. 

  If you play first-person shooters, chances are you and your buddies also played "army" as kids. 
 You toted plastic Uzis and water pistols around the neighborhood and argued over who shot whom. 
 Paintball is the grown-up version of playing soldier, which instead uses CO2-powered guns that 
 fire gelatin capsules filled with paint. Considering the worldwide popularity of paintball, you 
 can't blame Infogrames for publishing High Impact Paintball, a first-person shooter based on the 
 sport - but then again, if you played the game, you'll probably feel as if someone should be responsible. 
 The game's subpar graphics and poor sound, coupled with a buggy 3D engine and tedious gameplay, 
 will make real paintballers head for the woods; and these same elements will make first-person 
 shooter fans quickly return to their copies of Unreal Tournament and Quake III Arena.   

  The first thing you'll notice about High Impact Paintball is that there simply isn't much to it. 
 It does feature a few different play modes like free-for-all (which is deathmatch) and capture 
 the flag, which both work as you'd expect. Speedball mode is an elimination game, and siege lets 
 one team try to sound an air horn in the defenders' base. These different modes seem to offer diversity, 
 but when you get only two maps per mode, they don't. Furthermore, these outdoor maps are relatively 
 small, square-shaped areas with some scattered trees, low fences, and junked cars for obstacles, 
 so you really don't have much to do but occasionally duck behind a wall. Only a couple of the maps 
 have any substantial elevation changes to add some sort of tactical depth, and there's little in 
 the maps that creates any sense of orderly flow or purpose, let alone the feeling of being in a 
 real environment.   

  The terrain graphics themselves compound the problem with the map design, since they aren't anywhere 
 near state of the art. The hills are boxy, and they rise sharply from the ground without any sort 
 of gradual curvature. Since textures are limited and repetitive, the ground color is unrealistically 
 uniform. Fog effects aren't volumetric - instead, they create the impression of an overcast day, 
 although they do that decently enough. And the 3D engine itself is buggy: Expect to get snagged 
 on static scenery repeatedly, sometimes with no way of getting unhooked. In addition, collision 
 detection is a big problem in High Impact Paintball - paintballs sometimes pass through objects, 
 and players can walk through trees. The game's player models and skins are thankfully a bit more 
 complex and lifelike than the terrain graphics, and you can choose different shades of camouflage, 
 as well as male or female models. The animation is passable: Player movements look relatively lifelike, 
 but players almost seem to glide across the landscape instead of run along it.   

  From the main menu, you can hear hard-driving guitar riffs, which give you false hope that the 
 game's sound might make up for the graphics' mediocrity. Unfortunately, during combat, there's 
 no optional music - only ambient birdsong that does little to make you feel as if you're actually 
 in the woods. Since the guns are air powered, the lack of punch when you fire them is understandable; 
 but there are no other sounds to convey excitement in their place. At times you can barely hear 
 other players' footsteps, and when players are hit, they simply shout, "I'm hit!" The lack of excitement 
 and tension is almost painful.   

  The gameplay in High Impact Paintball does nothing to pick up the slack left by the limp graphics 
 and sound. Paintballs fly in a random trajectory with each shot and often miss their intended targets. 
 This might be realistic, but it sure isn't fun. And there's often no visual confirmation of a hit. 
 You only occasionally get the satisfaction of seeing a paintball hit an opponent, since the balls 
 sometimes pass right through and splat on the ground. The fact that the computer opponents' artificial 
 intelligence is so lacking makes matters worse. Sometimes you'll spot teammates employing sensible 
 tactics like ducking behind cover, but you'll often see a defending team just milling around its 
 flag. On the hardest difficulty level, the computer players' aiming abilities increase, but their 
 tactics don't improve. To compensate, there's a multiplayer mode over the Internet or a LAN, but 
 after repeated tries, I found only one active server that was populated solely with bots.   

  There's nothing wrong with giving paintball fans a computer version of their sport, nor is there 
 anything wrong with creating a shooter that's devoid of ricocheting gibs and plumes of blood. However, 
 it's reasonable to expect a game about small-arms combat - even a nonlethal version like paintball 
 - to get the adrenaline pumping with quick action or mounting tension. Unfortunately, High Impact 
 Paintball has neither.

Review:  What the hell is this!! The worst excuse for a shooter and by far the worst paintball game ever 
 made and i have never played any other one. The gameplay is slow and boring. There is like 3 or 
 4 different gun and couple of barrels to change your shooting and you can choose from only two 
 different people. Next there is 3 maps which are all gay and blocky with items your supposed to 
 beable to hide behind but you cant. Also the maps are so bug which they shouldn't because there 
 supposed to be small with lots of things to hide behind. The graphics are so bad and blochy that 
 you cant even tell what is what and who is who. If that isnt all the AI are the most supidest AI 
 that you could ever evem magine and they don't even shoot at you until there like 10 feet away 
 and when they do shoot at you they never miss.
