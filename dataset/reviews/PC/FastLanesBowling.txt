:::Review:::
Fast Lanes Bowling lacks substance and ultimately won't please bowling fans, be they hardcore or 
 casual. 

  In the grand scheme of things, today's bowling games aren't that much different from the games 
 we saw hitting arcades and arcane home consoles 20 years ago. While some bowling games tend to 
 take advantage of technology and the advancement made in virtual physics over the years, others 
 just let you hurl a ball down a lane at some pins. Enlight Software's budget-priced PC offering, 
 Fast Lanes Bowling, attempts to combine zany locales with tried-and-true bowling mechanics, but 
 the game lacks substance and ultimately won't please bowling fans, be they hardcore or casual. 

          Fast Lanes contains 12 different lanes to roll on.     

  There are six gameplay modes to choose from, though most of them are just basic variants of the 
 standard game of bowling. You can play in open play, practice, tournament, skis, and challenge 
 modes if you want a regular game. Golf mode gives you different pin configurations each frame and 
 a set number of rolls to hit them all in. The game calls that number par and uses basic golf scoring. 

  The gameplay in Fast Lanes is pretty basic, though it could have been streamlined a bit. You can 
 position your bowler, aim for a specific spot on the lane, pick different ball weights, and control 
 the amount of spin put on the ball. Once you've decided on all of that, hitting the space bar starts 
 your roll in motion. The game uses a "three-click" system that is lifted from most modern golf 
 games. The first press starts the meter going. Then you press the space bar again on the power 
 meter to set the strength of your roll. Finally, the indicator swings over to the accuracy portion 
 of the meter, where you must press the spacebar a third time to determine the positioning of your 
 roll. And that's pretty much it. Some bowling simulations take things like the quality or depth 
 of the oil on your lane into consideration so that the lane quality deteriorates over time. If 
 Fast Lanes Bowling makes any attempts to emulate oil dispersion, it certainly doesn't make it clear -- lane 
 oil has little or no apparent impact on your rolls. As such, all you need to do is find a sweet 
 spot to place your ball and get good at timing your rolls, which is quite easy to do. Once you've 
 got your timing down, rolling strikes is easier than it probably should be.  

  Fast Lanes contains eight different characters, including male and female bowlers, a robot, and 
 an alien. The bowlers don't animate very well, and many of them use the same animations when reacting 
 to a particularly good or bad roll. The game also has 12 different locations to bowl in, ranging 
 from your average bowling alley to castles, pirate ships, and the moon. The environments look OK, 
 but they also aren't very exciting.  

          The no-frills approach to bowling used here isn't very exciting at all.     

  While 
 Fast Lanes contains bad music, you can thankfully turn it off. Unfortunately, the game doesn't 
 exactly have interesting sound, either. It plays back the sounds of balls rolling on lanes and 
 striking pins pretty well, but that's about it. Also, each lane uses the same sound, even though 
 you could imagine that bowling on a pirate ship or striking pins shaped like little rocket ships 
 would probably sound slightly different from your everyday bowling noises. Different ambient sound 
 is used in some locations, though.  

  In the end, Fast Lanes Bowling is a textbook example of a budget game. Its no-frills approach is 
 inoffensive but also quite drab. Though there haven't been many released recently, there are better 
 bowling products available both on the PC and on consoles, so fans of the sport would do better 
 looking elsewhere.     Editor's note 02/20/04 : The review originally suggested that the game does 
 not model oil dispersion, which is incorrect. GameSpot regrets the error.

Review:  En primer lugar me parecio algo "tiezo" ya que no entenda la influencia tiro-interaccin. Sigamos 
 con la movilidad,
  en realidad es fcil ya que solo debemos ubicar al jugador en el lugar adecuado, tener en cuenta 
 la curvatura que va
  a tomar la bola y corregirlo. En cuanto a grafcos puedo decir que los personajes no son maravillosamente 
 notables, 
  pero son compensados con unos escenarios fabulosos, en donde se recrea muy bien cada lugar, pero 
 me pregunto; para un 
  juego de bolos se necesita ms? La movilidad es secundaria ya que lo nico que hacemos es ubicar 
 una lnea, pero
  se puede decir que es aceptable. La msica no es algo que uno pueda notar ya que las melodas son 
 tan poco notables que
  no nos damos cuenta de si esta sonando algo o no, definitavamente aqui se cuelga. Las opciones 
 del juego son su "kernel"
  ya que tiene buenos modos de juego, para destacar (definitivamente) el modo de Golf, ya que ningn 
 juego de bolos que yo
  halla visto ha incorporado tan novedosa opcin.
  
  En conclusin, si buscamos un juego con grafcos espectaculares y msica del carajo, el juego se 
 raja, pero si buscamos
  un rato de diversin, es el juego para eso.
