The Blackstone Chronicles isn't a bad game. It's just average to a fault. 

 John Saul, the popular horror writer upon whose serial novel The Blackstone Chronicles is based, 
 has stated that the idea for the story originated as an adventure game. Centered around the shell 
 of a former asylum, both the books and the game deal with the ghosts of said sanitarium, the former 
 figuratively, the latter literally. But while both mediums deal with the same issues and characters, 
 it's hard not to wonder if Saul took most of the good ideas for the books. They were effectively 
 creepy, while the game seems hollow and halfhearted.   

 The story is somewhat promising, especially for those familiar with the books. Oliver Metcalf, a 
 central character of the books, has returned once again to Blackstone, his home for years and the 
 location of the asylum his father, Malcolm Metcalf, ran. The ghost of his father has lured him 
 back by kidnapping his young son, Josh. Now Oliver must find his son in the asylum, currently in 
 renovation to be opened as a museum. Assuming the role of Oliver, you wander around the asylum, 
 speaking to the ghosts of patients, solving puzzles, and searching for your son.  

 Mental institutions and the treatments that occur therein are great material for horror. But at 
 no point does The Blackstone Chronicles really grab hold of you and make you feel suspense or terror. 
 The situation is right - anguished souls, a child in danger - but the game fails to make much use 
 of them. The ghosts aren't particularly engaging, and you only really learn about their problems 
 through text kiosks located in their former rooms. Making matters worse is the fact that the game 
 is only populated by disembodied voices, and the voice acting is competent but not particularly 
 impressive. The situation with your son never seems pressing, and the fact that he occasionally 
 inexplicably talks to you (accompanied by a still photo of the tyke in a dirt cell) only serves 
 to make matters seem that much less believable.  

 The asylum looks great. The graphics are detailed and realistic. Movement through the asylum follows 
 the "node" formula: You move from spot to spot, at which point you can look in predetermined locations. 
 It harkens back to Myst, lacking the more free-form movement found in recent games following a 
 similar formula. The movement feels constricting, and you'll often only be able to access one or 
 two spots in huge rooms.  

 The puzzles are equally constricting. For the most part, they are quite simple and straightforward 
 inventory-based puzzles. Clues are abundant (perhaps too abundant - you'll often feel like the 
 continual prodding toward a solution is bordering on the condescending) . The only thing making 
 puzzles difficult is that logical solutions will be hampered by little more than chastising from 
 a ghost, and you often can't pick up objects until you perform some deed for a particular spirit. 
 I don't know about you, but if a child of mine were in mortal danger, I don't think I'd put down 
 that crowbar I needed just because some disembodied voice told me to.  

 The Blackstone Chronicles isn't a bad game. It's just average to a fault. The premise is great, 
 the art is good, and the puzzles are well integrated. But some more detail in the story and the 
 spectral characters would have given the game a bit more emotional background to draw you in. As 
 it stands, it's a little too short, a little too easy, and a little too uninteresting to recommend.

Review:  Do not listen to what the people in the game review business are saying about this game. And, for 
 the record, do not listen to what they say about adventure games in general, as it seems that reviewers 
 on top game sites seem to be only attracted by shallow games that involve shooting and slaying. 
 That says a lot about them and their level of intelligence. This game is fantastic. It portrays, 
 through an intense journey through the human mind, the image of a killer. One who is, maybe, similar 
 to Jigsaw or Hannibal Lecter, but much more subtle. It describes the evil side of human nature 
 and the negative turns that a brilliant mind can take on its voyage to knowledge.
  
  Maybe this game doesn't have high end graphics, but it does have an amazing atmosphere and a great 
 storyline. While it may be a little bit short, it ensures a satisfying experience and it wraps 
 up very well, without giving the impression that it had no closure. If you're not scared of a scary 
 story that is disturbingly close to the reality of the human mind capacities, then you're in for 
 a great ride in the depths of a story created by of one of the best thriller/horror writers in 
 history.
