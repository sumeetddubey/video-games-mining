Even though it packs in a lot of value, if you weren't particularly enchanted by Heroes IV, Winds 
 of War probably won't change your mind. 

 Winds of War is the newest expansion pack for developer New World Computing's long-lived Heroes 
 of Might and Magic series. The series has enjoyed such longevity because of its relatively simple 
 but addictive formula: You create armies of heroes and fantastic monsters from your home castle, 
 then explore and conquer colorful maps laden with treasures and enemy strongholds. However, the 
 Heroes series seems to be running out of steam. The previous edition of the series, Heroes III, 
 was followed by what seemed like an endless series of unremarkable expansion packs and repackaged 
 "special editions." Heroes IV went on to make many fundamental changes to the series, and for many 
 fans, these changes weren't for the better. Heroes IV was then followed by the unremarkable The 
 Gathering Storm expansion pack, which added a substantial number of playable campaigns and stand-alone 
 scenarios, but only a few new features. For better or for worse, the same can be said of the latest 
 expansion pack, Winds of War.           The powerful frenzied gnasher is one of the three new creatures 
 in Winds of War.    

  You can count the new additions that Winds of War makes to Heroes IV on the fingers of one hand: 
 six new campaigns, a respectable 25 new scenario maps, a few new creatures, a few new structures 
 to find on the map, and an updated map editor that includes the new creatures and structures. That's 
 about it. Some of the campaign and scenario maps feature the same kind of unusual objectives and 
 conditions that previously characterized the campaigns of Heroes IV and The Gathering Storm, such 
 as missions in which you start without a stronghold and are simply tasked with freely exploring 
 and fighting monsters.   

  Winds of War's new campaign and scenario maps are fairly substantial and should keep most interested 
 Heroes fans occupied for many hours, and though they're generally quite solid, they don't offer 
 much in the way of new experiences. The expansion's three new monsters are very powerful and they're 
 expensive to recruit, but they don't appear in every mission. Other than that, Winds of War plays 
 more or less the same as Heroes IV did; there are no new playable factions, no significant rebalancing 
 of the existing playable factions, and no real improvements to speak of. The game's campaign editor 
 has been updated, but only to include the few new features, and it makes maps that can be played 
 only by players who own Winds of War -- just like The Gathering Storm's editor.           Is this 
 screenshot from Winds of War? Or The Gathering Storm? Or the original Heroes IV? It's impossible 
 to tell.    

  Furthermore, Winds of War looks and sounds more or less exactly the same as Heroes IV before it. 
 The game's colorful monsters and hero units are still represented by the same colorful, prerendered 
 sprites and are still based out of the same colorful strongholds on the same colorful overland 
 (and subterranean) maps. Fortunately, the game's graphics, and its grandiose orchestral and symphonic 
 soundtrack, have held up well over time; however, if you're a Heroes fan who has already spent 
 many hours playing through Heroes IV (and possibly The Gathering Storm) , you may be disappointed 
 to see and hear pretty much the same thing you've been seeing and hearing for over a year now. 
   

  Even though it packs in a lot of value, if you weren't particularly enchanted by Heroes IV, the 
 new expansion probably won't change your mind. Then again, if you're enough of a Heroes fan to 
 have played Heroes IV and The Gathering Storm, and you can't wait to play more, you should consider 
 picking up Winds of War. The expansion is extremely similar to the previous games, but if you care 
 more about the series' engaging turn-based gameplay and colorful presentation, you'll find enough 
 in Winds of War to keep you busy for some time.

Review:  I can't remember much about Winds of War, well, probably it isn't worth remembering both in terms 
 of its campaign layout or its new features. Winds of War had a pretty ordinary campaign but it's 
 still engaging enough for hardcore fans to enjoy. However, there are some steep challenges that 
 maybe only hardcore fans will be bothered to attempt, such as escaping an unbalanced situation 
 and starting your castle from scratch whereas your enemies' were already highly developed.
  
  Of the new creatures, the MegaDragon is something to behold and rather fun to use albeit a 
 little taxing on your already tight resources. The Catapult and Frenzied Gnasher are just fillers 
 I felt. Why is there only three? If there's one for each faction, and the campaign is built around 
 the new creatures, then this expansion may be something to root for. Ultimately, I play it just 
 because I feel the need to as a fan of the series, and it's still fun enough, but The Gathering 
 Storm is better.

Review:  The second expansion to Heroes of Might and Magic IV adds about the same amount of content as the 
 first one, but the second one gets brownie points for the silly names given to each of the campaign's 
 main characters. My personal favorite is the King Spazz Maticus who wants to take over the world.
 
  
  Like the first expansion, each campaign focuses on a different character. One of them, of course, 
 being Spazz Maticus. Unlike the first expansion the campaigns in Winds of War are fairly entertaining, 
 but only because of the names.
  
  A new building type with a different version for each faction has once again been added. Along 
 with that are some new scenarios to add to the replayability, but once again... no random map generator.
 
  
  I don't know if it was intentional, but Winds of War seemed like a comedy relief expansion to me. 
 I laughed and laughed because the names were so delightful, then I laughed some more. Seriously 
 though, like The Gathering Storm, Winds of War isn't really worth tracking down unless you really 
 liked Heroes IV and want more campaigns and scenarios as there's nothing else of note added.

Review:  Heroes III is so much better than this sequel. Besides the AI bugs, the combat is wholly less satisfying 
 than Heroes III.
  
  The heroes actually fight in the battles now, but they die so often it is more annoying than useful. 
 The castle sieges were a lot of fun in 3, but in 4 they made a lot of changes that take the strategy 
 away. Anyone next to the castle wall can hit anything on the other side of the wall -- this makes 
 no sense. The larger battlefields aren't as big as they seem since several inches around is just 
 decoration and you can't move there. The over-land graphics are brighter but they also border on 
 too "bright and busy." The interface wastes lots of space with blank areas that that could have 
 been better streamlined. 
  
  In single player maps, there are some never-patched bugs in which the enemy AI just sits in the 
 castle and does nothing. Not much of a challenge.
  
  Everyone who playes Heroes III is aware this game was pushed out the doors before the publisher 
 went bankrupt. 
  
  Buy Heroes III.
