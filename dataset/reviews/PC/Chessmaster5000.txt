Mindscape's fantastic new adaptation of the classic can teach you how to play, how to improve your 
 game, and how to gracefully get your butt kicked over and over by a computer. 

 What do you get if you combine over twenty attractive chess sets, a simple easy-to-use interface, 
 and one hell of a chess engine? Chessmaster 5000. Mindscape's fantastic new adaptation of the classic 
 can teach you how to play, how to improve your game, and how to gracefully get your butt kicked 
 over and over by a computer.   

 There are numerous chess sets, ranging from standard staunton to dinosaur pieces for children. Some 
 of the sets are 2-d, while others are 3-d or perspective. All of the sets are very strong visually, 
 and show a great attention to detail often lacking in computer chess sims. Chessmaster's audio 
 is also impressive. Setup options include thematic, digital, and simple sound effects, all of which 
 have their own strengths. I found that the simple sounds worked best for me. They were unobtrusive, 
 but helpful in letting me know when the computer had made its move. The theme sounds, like when 
 the dinosaur pieces thump across the board, are sure to appeal to children.  

 Chessmaster 5000 offers up an impressive assortment of features designed to enhance your chess playing 
 experience. You have complete control over the level and style of play, which eliminates the frustration 
 of constantly playing against a computer opponent that always wins or loses. There are over sixty 
 preconfigured chess personalities, ranging from Alekhine to Kasparov, that you can face off against, 
 or you can take on a human opponent in a hotseat (taking turns on a single computer) , modem, or 
 LAN competition. Two extra goodies included on the Chessmaster 5000 CD are over twenty well written 
 tutorials and a 27,000-game chess database. The game is an excellent trainer, with natural language 
 advice- that lets you know in plain English where you should move and why, positional setup so 
 that you can concentrate on your weak spots, and a practice opening move mode.   

 Sharp graphics, nifty sound effects, and a fierce 32 bit chess engine make Chessmaster 5000 the 
 finest chess software I have ever used. Infinitely variable skill levels ensure that Chessmaster 
 5000 is an excellent personal chess trainer and opponent for almost any level of player. Any fan 
 of chess is sure to find this a purchase well worth their time.

Review:  Chessmaster 5000 is an amazing chess game. Mindscape has done a superb job in constructing this 
 masterpiece. Chessmaster allows you to pick from a long list of Chess Master greats and you can 
 either watch them battle one another or you can see if you can match them or be brutally handed 
 by their superior movements. The only way I've beaten Bobby Fisher was to cheat and make all my 
 pawns in the front row into queens and I removed his entire front row within 10 moves, yet he still 
 lasted over 40 moves! Freaking, Amazing!
  I would recommend this game to anyone who would like to have a chess game that truly challenges 
 the mind as well as offers an great way to view the masters of the game battle it out to the finish.

Review:  My "Chessmaster 5000" CD was in a bargain bin a few years back for a surprisingly measly $10. Not 
 being much of a chess player, but a bargain hunter at heart, it was hesitant buy. But I tell ya 
 folks, without a doubt it was the best game I've ever bought. Now I can't stop playing it.
  
  I believe that it's overall performance was and still is absoulutely brilliant and unmatched 
 in it's field.
  
  Ideal for a learner or a genius, it's that versatile. It has so many tutorials to teach you the 
 program functions and how to play the game or better your technique, its amazing.
  
  For those who like it simple, use a 2D layout. Or if you want to spice it up, use a 3D layout. 
 There's also ample peices and boards to select from. You can also create your own layout if you 
 wish.
  
  There are so many programmed players included (non-fictional and fictional characters) ranging 
 from a complete balloon head to an total genius (the Chess Master himself) , that most people still 
 haven't had the chance to beat them all.
  
  You can also change any attribute you like regarding a players strategy. Their attack and defence 
 methods, how fast and smart they are, or how crucial or trivial yours and their individual Chess 
 peices are to them.
  
  The graphics in my opinion are awesome. The programmers deserve a big pat on the back for a job 
 well done. The console, boards and peices are very realistic and there are so many different choices 
 for this game, calling it supeior would be putting it down.
  
  It's audio capabilities are also fantastic. With the choice of either very dynamic and thrilling 
 3D orchestral sounds (keep in mind each peice is assigned with its own individual sound for every 
 possible move it can make) that make you feel like your back in the medieval days or other simple 
 yet effective set that would satisfy most ears and sound cards that don't support directX. You 
 can change the music as well if you like, I generally don't myself because the classical music 
 makes me feel like a "master" even though I get absolutely plastered by the easiest player.
  
  I've given this game a 10/10 and I really havent had the need to search for better. I have 
 seen and played others, even updated versions of this, but still havent found one that beats this 
 yet. Have you? If so, let me know... gotanque@hotmail. com
