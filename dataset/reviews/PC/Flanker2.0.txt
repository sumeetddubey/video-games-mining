:::Review:::
Just observing the aircraft in flight, especially at high altitude with contrails streaming, is 
 enough to evoke admiration for what the developers have achieved. 

 The original Su-27 Flanker was released in 1995 and was almost immediately recognized as having 
 one of the most outstanding and realistic flight models to date. While the game was repackaged 
 in 1997 with all the accumulated patches and a mission disc, Flanker fans have never seen an update 
 to the graphics engine. The Flanker series always had the advantage of running well on lower-end 
 machines, providing an uncompromising flight model without compromising your wallet. But with the 
 arrival of Flanker 2.0, this circumspect approach to system requirements has been jettisoned in 
 favor of more eye-catching graphics. Was it a fair trade? For the most part, yes.  

 Like its predecessors, Flanker 2.0 quite obviously models the Su-27 Flanker (and its naval variant, 
 the Su-33) . Just like previous versions, Flanker 2.0 is not a sim for the occasional flier. It 
 is incredibly detailed and will seem daunting at first, even to reasonably experienced sim fans. 
 For cautious players or those without previous Flanker experience, there is an excellent set of 
 tutorial missions that covers every meaningful aspect of the aircraft in some way. Nevertheless, 
 it will take you many hours to become proficient at this game.  

 The first thing veteran Flanker pilots will notice is that the controls are similar enough to the 
 original Flanker, such that they can quickly get into the game. There is also a wonderful joystick 
 configuration tool in the setup options that allows for very flexible joystick customization even 
 if you don't have a programmable controller. The in-game cockpit lacks a 2D view, but the 3D view 
 is easily readable and quite functional. The only problem is that while the HUD can be toggled 
 to display in English, the cockpit instrumentation apparently cannot, despite the manual's assertion 
 to the contrary.  

 Discussing the accuracy of flight models seems presumptuous coming from a reviewer whose real-world 
 supersonic jet experience is limited to one ride on the Concorde. That said, Flanker 2.0 feels 
 as tough and realistic as its predecessor. One way this realism comes across is that the plane 
 feels quite sluggish to the novice, yet the twin engines pack a lot of punch and can move the plane 
 remarkably nimbly if the pilot knows how. Weapons are also difficult to judge, but Flanker 2.0's 
 weapons model is more realistic than most other sims - perhaps too realistic, because SAMs are 
 incredibly hard to defeat, and their kill ratio seems unusually high. This adds to the difficulty 
 level of the game and can be very frustrating. One reason might be that SAM-tracking radar can 
 maintain a lock even through mountains, which is clearly a bug.  

 One of Flanker 2.0's most attractive features is that it lets you fly the naval variant, the Su-33, 
 which means operating off an aircraft carrier. While carrier operations basically consist of takeoffs 
 and landings, they can be challenging. As with all things in Flanker 2.0, practice improves performance, 
 and in addition to the tutorial missions, the game includes an adequately comprehensive manual 
 that will help you overcome such challenges. Even so, Flanker 2.0 has several problems. For one 
 thing, the aesthetic appeal of the visuals is achieved at the cost of some hefty hardware requirements 
 if you want to experience the game fully. While the game allegedly runs on a system as down to 
 earth as a Pentium 166 with a 3D card if you turn down all the textures and detail, this really 
 robs Flanker 2.0 of one of its best features, which is the marriage of a superb flight model and 
 great graphics. However, even on a fast machine like a P2-450 with 128MB RAM (with a 32MB TNT2 
 Ultra video card) , gameplay was choppy at 800x600 with the detail levels suggested in the manual. 
 As such, you'll need serious hardware to run the game smoothly at 1024x768 with all the detail 
 on, although the result is beautiful.  

 Flanker 2.0's sound also falls somewhat short of the mark. Veterans of other sims will find the 
 radio chatter to be conspicuously sparse, and the aircraft sounds are also quite subdued. This 
 is a strike against the game's ability to immerse you in the game environment, although simply 
 becoming proficient at flying the aircraft and not being shot down with regularity should be enough 
 keep you involved. The sparse audio is most likely due in part to realism issues (in a tightly 
 sealed cockpit, sounds you might expect to be loud are probably muffled) and in part to Flanker 
 2.0's concentration on modeling the aircraft first and the environment second.  

 One of the things that made the original Flanker so attractive was its superb attention to detail. 
 For example, radar lock was established not just by pressing the Tab key but by holding it down, 
 because apparently there was a delay in the real Flanker's radar lock-on as well. In Flanker 2.0, 
 this detail is evidenced by the padlocking system. Padlocking, the continuous visual lock on an 
 enemy aircraft or missile, can be the most realistic or the most frustrating aspect of Flanker 
 2.0 depending on your perspective. First, there is no way to automatically padlock like in many 
 other sims: You must visually acquire, or "tally" your target before you can do so. This can involve 
 some slow panning, which can be aggravating. On the other hand, it is arguably more realistic. 
 There also does not seem to be a way to padlock enemy missiles at all.  

 The out-of-the-box campaign also isn't anything spectacular if you've played Falcon 4.0. There is 
 no attempt to model the real-time dynamic campaign present in MicroProse's game; Flanker 2.0's 
 campaign simply consists of one mission after another like its predecessor's. The campaign once 
 again takes place over (and on and around) the Crimean Peninsula. However, the mission builder 
 is extremely powerful and ensures that the game will not go stale in single-player mode.  

 Considering all the features Flanker 2.0 offers, the game has shipped with fairly few bugs. There 
 are some problems, like the fact that in-flight refueling doesn't actually result in any fuel being 
 transferred, but these are outweighed by the fact that the game is incredibly stable, and almost 
 everything works as it should.  

 It is inevitable that this kind of hard-core simulation will be compared to Falcon 4.0. There is 
 certainly no reason to try to determine which game is simply better than the other, if such a determination 
 were even possible. However, with the amount of time necessary to become proficient at a game like 
 this, it is reasonable for aspiring pilots to wonder which game is more appropriate for them. This 
 is where the unique philosophy of each game becomes apparent: Falcon 4.0 tries to be a simulation 
 of what it's like to be an Air Force fighter pilot. The fact that the simulation involves an F-16 
 is only one of the many facets of the game that collectively make it so ambitious. On the other 
 hand, Flanker 2.0 is purely a simulation of the Su-27 Flanker aircraft. The game exudes a pride 
 in the aircraft that is palpable even to the uninitiated gamer. Just observing the aircraft in 
 flight, especially at high altitude with contrails streaming, is enough to evoke admiration for 
 what the developers have achieved. Flanker fans now have a simulation that they can embrace wholeheartedly, 
 without having to apologize for the graphics.
