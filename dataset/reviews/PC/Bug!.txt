Take a traditional two-dimensional platform game, add a third dimension, and you have Bug! - the 
 latest offering from Sega Entertainment. 

 Take a traditional two-dimensional platform game, add a third dimension, and you have Bug! - the 
 latest offering from Sega Entertainment. Premiering on the Saturn almost a year ago, Bug! was designed 
 to show off the system's impressive 3-D capabilities while simultaneously delivering "Mario-killing" 
 gameplay. While the Sega Away Team certainly got the first part right, the little Italian Plumber 
 had nothing to fear from this insect. Now that Sega Entertainment has decided to bring many of 
 its hits to the PC, Bug! has once again appeared on my desk - and very little has changed in the 
 interim.  

 Let me say right off that there is nothing inherently flawed about Bug!'s gameplay. My main gripe 
 is that it fails to explore any new territory. The creation of a third dimension should have revolutionized 
 the platform game (in much the same way that Virtua Fighter revolutionized arcade beat-'em-ups) , 
 but in the case of Bug!, the 3-D is more of a gimmick than a bold experiment. By narrowly constraining 
 your movements to a simple back-and-forth traverse of narrow passages, you will quickly forget 
 that this game is 3-D. To make matters worse, this game manages to include almost every clich&amp; eacute; 
 that has permeated the genre since its inception. From the sickeningly cute characters (which you 
 can kill by jumping on their backs) to the wisecracking attitude, almost every aspect of the game 
 seems strangely familiar. While there is validity to the phrase, "If it ain't broke, don't fix 
 it," it is Bug!'s subsequent failure to inject anything new into this mix that dooms it to the 
 realm of mediocrity.  

 Aside from its lack of ingenuity, the actual play mechanics in Bug! are fairly well done. The animation 
 is smooth in 320x240 VGA (although you will need at least a Pentium 133 to truly enjoy the SVGA 
 mode) , and the control is quick and responsive. In addition, the individual levels are huge, with 
 plenty of secrets scattered throughout. Populating these hovering "mazes in the sky" are numerous 
 SGI-rendered characters that are very detailed (and often humorous) , but seem to lack the personality 
 of traditional hand-drawn art.   

 In conclusion, Bug! is a visually stunning game that, despite its revolutionary look, fails to deliver 
 anything new to a tired genre. While certainly not a bad game, its lack of ingenuity will taint 
 its chances of appealing to existing platform game fans - and of creating new ones.
