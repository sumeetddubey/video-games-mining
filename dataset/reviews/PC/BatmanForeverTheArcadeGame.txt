Holy mediocrity, Batman! 

 Holy mediocrity, Batman! Acclaim's new "Batman Forever: The Arcade Game" represents the latest in 
 a long series of ho-hum movie licenses from the Acclaim/Iguana duo. Although certainly better than 
 many of their past efforts, this title's uninspired gameplay and uneven presentation fail to capture 
 any of the excitement found in the film.  

 Featuring gameplay inspired by such classic arcade titles as Streets of Rage, Final Fight, and the 
 original Street Fighter, Batman Forever attempts to inject a little graphic panache into a tried 
 and true concept. For those unfamiliar with the above titles, gameplay consists of beating up countless 
 henchmen as you travel from left to right (imagine standing in a line at the bank while it is being 
 robbed) . Once you have completed the trek, you must face one or more "Super Villains" in order 
 to progress to the next round. Ultimately, you must fight the Riddler himself in order to save 
 Gotham from his evil schemes.  

 Acclaim has never been shy when it comes to boasting of their state-of-the-art motion-capture studios 
 just outside New York City. With these facilities available, one would expect smooth, realistic 
 character animation to be the highlight of the game. Sadly, this is not the case. In stark contrast 
 to the smoothly animated neo-gothic backgrounds, the motion-captured characters appear to have 
 only a handful of frames per move. As a result, Batman and Robin stutter about on screen as if 
 lifted from a cheap stop-motion film. This problem is exacerbated by the gameplay's hectic pace. 
 With several onscreen henchmen jumping in and out of the screen at any given time, the erratic 
 movement makes it almost impossible to follow the onscreen antics, much less control them.   

 
 Although Acclaim has implemented a rudimentary combo system, it's hard to find time for strategy 
 when you're fighting off six henchman. As a result, gameplay often boils down to simply executing 
 a single move over and over again at a lightning pace until you are the last person standing. In 
 fact, I strongly suspect that it is possible to score highly on some levels without ever looking 
 at the screen. While this may make Batman Forever an excellent purchase for those without monitors, 
 most everyone else will demand a little more for their $40.

Review:  What is it about superhero games and games inspired by movies that tend to make them less than 
 great? Is it that the developers take less time over them, or that they just don't translate very 
 well? Whatever the truth, Batman Forever is a fun game featuring, as you might have guessed, that 
 most iconic of DC superheroes - Batman. 
  
  Using some rather nice motion capture effects, Batman Forever sets you on a side scrolling mission 
 not unlike Double Dragon where you'll face tons of henchmen plus some of the Dark Knight's finest 
 enemies. Ok it's shallow fun, but it looks and plays a lot better than most side scrolling fighters 
 and Gotham City looks suitably gothic and moody. 
  
  If you're a fan of the bat then you'll be pleased to learn that you can make use of a few of his 
 special weapons, the bat-o-rang which has been with Batman from his earliest days is included and 
 proves to be invaluable along the way. All in all I'd say this is an essential game for fans of 
 Batman, and an entertaining game for everyone else. Enjoy!
