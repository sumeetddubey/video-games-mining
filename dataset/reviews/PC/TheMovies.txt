:::Review:::
The Movies proves to be an accessible and good-spirited tycoon game, and its moviemaking tools offer 
 a surprisingly deep amount of control. But the disconnection between these elements is noticeable. 
 

  There are two distinct experiences offered in The Movies, the latest game from Peter Molyneux's 
 Lionhead Studios. The bulk of The Movies centers around a familiar business-management "tycoon" 
 experience, where you play master and commander of your very own Hollywood movie studio, hiring 
 and firing staff, building facilities, and, of course, producing and releasing movies. You can 
 choose to either let your studio machine determine the content of your films, or you can go hands-on 
 with the game's built-in moviemaking tools, which peg a good balance between accessibility and 
 flexibility. Both parts of The Movies can be engrossing and time-consuming, but they feel more 
 like parallel products rather than an integrated whole.  

          Now you've got a friend in the movie business -- you!     

  Kicking things off in 1920, 
 The Movies starts you as the chief of a small upstart movie studio, putting the challenge before 
 you to slowly cultivate it into a top-grossing, award-winning cinematic machine staffed with the 
 best and the brightest talent -- both onscreen and off -- the industry has to offer. Well, as less 
 of a challenge and more of a suggestion, the free-form (or so-called "sandbox") nature of The Movies 
 means you can go about your business however you see fit, without a "wrong" or a "right" way. The 
 game starts out extremely slowly by carefully guiding you through the process of hiring studio 
 staff (like janitors and builders) , helping you decide which cinematic hopefuls will be actors 
 and directors (and which ones will be extras or film crew) , building your first set, and releasing 
 your first movie. This handholding remains pretty intensive for your first few decades as a movie 
 mogul -- and that's a good thing, because there's a lot to digest.  

  The core moviemaking process itself can be pretty dense. First, you'll need a screenplay, which 
 means you can choose to write your own (more on that later) , or you can hire a staff of screenwriters 
 to do the heavy lifting for you. Even with the latter hands-off approach, you'll still have to 
 determine the genre of your film, with the given choices of action, comedy, romance, sci-fi, and 
 horror. Different genres have greater general interest in different eras, so even if the film itself 
 is good, the wrong genre at the wrong time could spell box-office disaster. Once you have your 
 screenplay in hand, it's time for casting. The size of your cast and crew will grow over time as 
 you produce bigger, more-sophisticated movies. But in the end, you're always going to need a director, 
 some actors, a movie crew, and, usually, a handful of extras. Who you choose to fill these roles 
 will ultimately affect your end product. How experienced is your crew? What sort of mood is your 
 talent in? Do the director and the lead actor get along well? Though it can make the process of 
 casting your movies quite maddening, it's actually rather impressive to realize the minute details 
 that can have an impact.  

  You don't have much control once shooting commences, though that doesn't mean you shouldn't keep 
 a watchful eye over the production. Though most of your employees are basically just automatons 
 doing the job assigned to them, actors and directors are much more complicated, emotional creatures, 
 requiring significant quantities of your attention. Their true characters will often be revealed 
 under the duress of filming, informed by a dozen or so different stats unique to each person. Most 
 of your problems basically come down to stress -- and how your talent deals with it. A stressed-out 
 actor or director won't turn in a very good performance, and he or she will often turn to food 
 and drink for comfort. This is tolerable in moderation, but some people have a greater proclivity 
 toward vice than others, which, if left unchecked, can bring a production to a screeching halt. 
 In turn, this can send the cost of your production through the roof as you send the person to your 
 own private in-studio rehab center.  

          The Movies lets you choose whether you want to be a studio boss, a filmmaker, or both. 
     

  There are stress factors aside from production, too, most of which are rooted in your talent's 
 ego. If your talent feels he or she isn't getting paid enough, his or her trailer isn't nice enough, 
 he or she doesn't have a big enough entourage, or he or she's generally unhappy about his or her 
 personal appearance, the talent will get grumpy right quick. Most of these problems are solved 
 pretty simply with pay raises, better trailers, personal assistants, makeovers, plastic surgery, 
 and/or press exposure. There's a lot of information to sift through, and the game usually does 
 a superb job of surfacing what's relevant, though at times the screen can become totally cluttered 
 with pop-up info bubbles. It can be fascinating how your talent grows and changes while living 
 under the spotlight, but over time you'll see the same sorts of behavioral patterns emerging over 
 and over again -- which means the constant micromanagement can get exhausting.  

  Talent will grow old and eventually retire (unless he or she quits or is sold to another studio 
 before hitting the age of 70) , which brings us to one of the more peculiar quirks in The Movies. 
 In the beginning, you'll have a surplus of hopefuls looking to join your studio. But this can taper 
 off quickly. Problems start to arise when you expand your studio lot with new sets and various 
 facilities and soon find that you don't have enough builders to maintain the grounds. You'll find 
 yourself pulling people off of jobs -- jobs they might already be really good at -- just to fulfill 
 a lesser position that is of more immediate urgency. Abstractly, as a mechanic in a strategy game, 
 this isn't inherently bad. It just doesn't feel appropriate -- it just ain't Hollywood.     

 
  Maintaining and developing your studio facilities can prove just as consuming as pampering your 
 stars, and is often just as necessary. The moviegoing audience will stop showing up if you use 
 the same sets over and over again, so regularly building new sets helps alleviate that. Most of 
 the facilities and sets you can choose to build aren't available from the outset, instead slowly 
 unlocking over time. You can, however, speed things up (giving yourself a technological edge over 
 the competition) by investing in a research and development facility and staff. You'd be surprised 
 at how some novel sets and slick special effects can turn a stinker into a blockbuster. Well, maybe 
 not  that  surprised.  

          Movies may be an art, but a little R&amp; D science can help give you the edge you need. 
     

  There is a whole lot going on in The Movies, but the game is smart about letting you determine 
 your own pace, and you can even scale the amount of assistance the game provides. Once you find 
 your gait, the experience can be really addictive, and the constant production pattern of making 
 movies and improving your back lot make it quite easy to ignore the fact that, all of a sudden, 
 it's four in the morning and you're still playing.  

  If you want to get  really  involved in the fake filmmaking process, The Movies includes an incredible 
 set of in-game moviemaking tools that let you create your own little masterpieces. At its most 
 basic, you're given a timeline and the frame for a story arc. Anyone familiar with digital video 
 editing will find this to be like a Playskool version of something like FinalCut or Premiere. You 
 fill in your story by dragging and dropping prebuilt shots, of which there are literally dozens 
 to choose from for any one portion of the story arc. Like the rest of the game, the moviemaker 
 can be tuned to give you just the amount of control you're comfortable with. If you're happy with 
 just dragging and dropping a few scenes into a timeline and letting that be that, you can operate 
 that way... though the real fun here is getting really crazy with the details, such as lighting, 
 the mood of the performances, the backdrop designs, the types of camera angles used, and so on. 
 You can even add subtitles, sound effects, your own custom musical score, and, if you've got a 
 microphone, your own dialog. Given the dozens of different sets you'll eventually have at your 
 disposal, in addition to the five different genres you can work within and the insane amount of 
 control you can take over virtually every single detail of your movie, there is a great amount 
 of potential here for budding virtual filmmakers.  

  Unfortunately, you can pour hours into creating your own perfect piece of  machinima , and it will 
 have minimal impact inside the game itself, as the game judges the quality of the films rather 
 mechanically, without much capacity to discern between what's garbage and what's  art . In a way, 
 this is acceptable, since the end product of the movie you've made is really the best reward. Plus, 
 the game makes it quite easy to export the movies you've made into a common video format that you 
 can share with others. There's even an integrated tool that makes it easy to upload your movies 
 to the Internet for all to see. Really, with the inclusion of a sandbox mode that lets you skip 
 the "game" part of The Movies almost entirely, it's pretty apparent that the whole package was 
 designed with two separate, largely unrelated goals in mind. It's not a deal breaker, but it does 
 mar the illusion that you're running your movie studio in a living, breathing world.  

  The amount of control you're given in The Movies and the sort of social-experiment focus it takes 
 on are just a few of the qualities shared with EA's wickedly popular suburban lifestyle simulation, 
 The Sims. This is amplified by the fact that The Movies is pretty shameless in the way that it 
 cribs its  visual style from The Sims. When you're looking at 
 your studio from the ground level, it's not particularly impressive. Models look natural but simple, 
 textures are generally clean-looking, though a little flat, and fancy lighting and particle effects 
 are few and far between. What impresses, though, is the way that you can seamlessly zoom out from 
 ground level to bird's-eye view in one smooth motion, without any load times. It's worth mentioning, 
 though, that despite the relatively modest system requirements listed by the publisher, The Movies 
 can really test the upper limits of your machine, and the frame rate can chug on even a high-end 
 PC when you max out all the quality settings.  

  The sound design is a good match for the general cinematic tone of the game. The background music 
 that plays while you manage your studio will change as you progress through different time periods, 
 from brassy big-band accompaniments, to buzzy Hendrixian guitars, to funky wah-wah sounds, and 
 beyond. There's some good, funny voice work in the game, with different news readers and disc jockeys 
 delivering era-specific parody over your studio's PA system, though all the "dialogue" in your 
 movies is spoken in a Sims-esque gibberish that's not nearly as fully realized as the made-up "simlish" 
 language.  

          A slick graphics engine lets you go from fly-on-the-wall view to bird-in-the-sky view without 
 batting an eye.     

  This is a game of high quality, and it shows in virtually every aspect of its execution. But all 
 told, The Movies comes just shy of its lofty ambitions. Being a movie studio boss is completely 
 absorbing, and there is really no other game, or, really, any piece of software that makes it as 
 easy to build your own little movies. But the connection between these concepts is tenuous at best. 
 Thankfully, its best qualities shine through more than enough to make The Movies a game well worth 
 playing.

Review:  After playing 3D Movie Maker for too long, I was give this little gem for Christmas. I didn't like 
 it at first because I thought they'd make the movies for you after seeing the horrific Baggage 
 Boy Movie. But I played on it more, and soon I realised how creative you can be.
  
  This game trys to make it like running an actual movie studio, and in opinion it does a pretty 
 good job. You'll need to hire actors, directors, set builders, movie crew and much more to make 
 any movie you want.
  
  I'll be honest though, you can't excally create the movie you rreally want to make. Its not like 
 3D Movie Maker where you control what the actors do. You get a HUGE selection of scenes to choose 
 from where you have a bunch of options to edit the scene.
  
  The graphics arn't perfect but they are acceptable at best. All the sets are well designed and 
 the people look quite realistic, but some of the backdrops are a little blurry and arn't fully 
 detailed.
  
  No big deal though. The Movies is one of the best simulation games you can buy today. The studio 
 running, the movie making, and the editing makes this a game definietly worth buying if you're 
 a big fan of movies. Give it a look!

  Lionhead's The Movies product is finnally here, from 2002 to now. And to say the very absoulute 
 least, its good and it isn't. For as powerful as your PC may be, its safe to state that first of 
 all, the game is a complete memory hog. And considering what a joke the actual game is, its really 
 not worth the memory it hogs.
  
  
  
  The Movies is made soley for people who take the time to figure things out. The Movies sets up 
 the old-school, washed-out look tycoon interferance as you would assume coming from a movie making 
 mash of mud. Upon starting a new game, you are given a huge, empty lot, where you must make your 
 movie studio. Making buildings like actor sign-ins and crew staff offices, random people are just 
 to name a few of your jobs in the process. You can decorate your lot with trees and plants, but 
 they don't do much to keep your lot rating high. You can litterly 'pick up' people off the ground 
 and place them in certain buildings to hire them for staff or actors. You'll build your studio 
 up to your own pace, adding scenery and staff buildings, and making the so-called ultimate studio. 
 The Movies lets you continue to micromanage your studio, or create your own movie masterpeices, 
 which is the flow of the game's cash.
  
  
  
  Much like Windows Movie Maker, upon making a movie, you are given a large timeline. From here you 
 can add sound effects, music, and mostly scenes, plus selecting your movie genre as rommance, comedy, 
 action, horror, or scfi. The scenes are actually pre-set animations with actors protraying annimations 
 like "Walk" or "Stand"; after picking one out of 100 pre-set animations, you'll have to adjust 
 the camera, choose your set, varying from living rooms to horror offices, adjust how fast the actor 
 walks or what manner he stands, as well as adjust the actor's clothes; Although this is severely 
 disapointing and lacking any real depth, its not much to ruin the entire game. You'll be doing 
 this for pretty much as long as you want til you decide your movie is done. Once completed, your 
 movie will soak up a good puddle of in-game cash, while you can then export iy to all your friends, 
 making them as funny or as violent or as sexy as you want.
  
  
  
  Of course, you won't want to do anything outside of moviemaking. That's because the micromanagment 
 element is absoulutly broken. Your actors appearantly have a huge alchohol addiction, because unless 
 you place 60 bars in your studio, they'll quit and leave. And unlike real-life studios, all the 
 actors love to drink alchohol, and they do it both onstage and offstage. Might I also state that 
 the actresses have a condecending demand to keep up with the changing fashion, but since they can't 
 change their own clothes, you have to manually change their clothes to make them happy. Your stars 
 always need attension, always need trailers, and always need alchohol. A few other problems make 
 the micromanagement uncomplete. Even if you make your stars happy, they still scream in rage when 
 you click on them for no apperant reason.
  
  The Moviemaking element just isn't that great either. The actors, during talk scenes, make gibberish 
 similar to EA's The Sims, but the actors portrayed in The Movies are no better than the Sims. They 
 get made at the stupidest things, and their acting is atrocious. Even with their experiance at 
 max, they barely ever move their lips when talking, and they make strange contorts and gestures 
 with their bodies. They bounce up and down on stage, and there is absoulutly no way to circumverate 
 it. Expert players can, of course, adjust the camera at different angles to make it less goofy, 
 but its still pointless. 
  
  
  When trying to adjust makeup for a certain actor, you'd assume he would stand still, right? Your 
 absoulutly wrong; the actor bounces up and down and rotates his body every time you select a new 
 option. Why Lionhead Community made the actors so agervatingly stupid is a complete mystery. It 
 feels almost like Lionhead Studios was actually trying to ruin your movies.
  
  
  The graphics, for a 3 disc game, are also quite horrible. Even on the highest settings, the sets 
 look sketchy and PS1-like, while the actors can look pretty bad up close. The game utilizes (or 
 hogs) more memory than 6 modern games on your computer, and its absoulutly mind-boggling why such 
 a game with so damn bad graphics takes so many computer resources.
  
  We definetly do not want to forget the aweful game community. It consists of 20 year-old drunks 
 arguing madly over each others opinions, and they talk so whitty and condecending on the forums. 
 The Movies also has a pretty lousy variety of in-game content. For a memory hog, you get about 
 111 different props in the game and sets for your movies. Without mods, the game feels even more 
 lacklustered. Apperantly the producers never knew that Half-Life 2 offers more content in return 
 for a not-comp-hog superb game existed. Half-Life 2 has more editing props and content than this 
 peice of garbage. And considering how much of a memory hog The Movies tends to be, its more than 
 fair to compare these 2 games.
  
  In the very least, The Movies is a fairly decent pick. It hasn't much to offer other than a 24 
 hour demo to show you how unfinished it is. The last thing that can be said is not to believe the 
 hype. This really is a horrible game.

Review:  I was somehow late to buy, install and play this game. I started at december 2008; went in reasonable 
 addiction since. 
  The game has two main parts; both having good and bad features. Once you select "Game" in main 
 menu, u click on "New game" an intro is displayed: "Welcome to the dawn of movie industry" You 
 start at January 1920, with support of very useful Tutorial. (Bubbles helps a lot with basic commands) 
 From 1920 to 2005; with Lionhead Motion Picture Awards every 5 year ("The Movies" Oscar's ceremony, 
 except you cant reach the scene for saying "Thanks to my family, husband, productor, director etc., 
 hehe) and nine achievement awards. You start with an empty lot and 150 k of dollars, stars behave, 
 their wants are neverending, they want higher salaries, better trailers, more people around them, 
 they get stressed in movie shots, they got bored away while theyrent in movie shots. Micromanagement 
 is the main focus on this "Tycoon" or "Story" part of the game.
  "Sandbox" part is for comfortably writing your own scenarios, you can start with a studio full 
 of buildings, 100.000.000 dollars, buildings dont decay, starts dont behave options. Free to create 
 some absurd horror  romantic  comedy movies, on sci- fi scenes with action prop's.
  Graphics, character animations, colors all are nice. Music is great, from 1920's old school jazz 
 to 1980's funk, 1950's rock & roll Playability, controls; i give 99 by 100, not flawless completely, 
 because i had difficulty to open some minimalized star cards while i had eight stars. Shortcuts 
 to important offices (production, casting, scenario) is very good idea, to salary  finance screen 
 as well.
  
  "Tycoon" or "Story" part for pc tycoon gamers, "Sandbox" for amateur "machinima" creators; and 
 The Movies addiction is quite possible if you belong to both side like me

Review:  This game is perfect if you like working on movies. and uploading Videos on You tube. I spended almost 
 all my times doing movies and uploading them to a website. What I like the most is the stars and 
 what they do when they are depressed. Best of all the paparazzi! though I didn't like the Rehab. The 
 Characters get drunk to easy. I extremely loved the sets and the crew. This game is the best and 
 I consider it for anyone. I Almost forgot. The thing I didn't like is the costumes. i had a problem. 
 when I was creating a horror film. I will make the guy dress up as in alien. in a basement. then 
 when I wen tot do a subway scene. The guy had a alien suit 0.0
  I'll say it a million times If I have to . I loved this game .I would sped more that 13 hours playing. Next 
 time you go to game stop Buy this game. Take my advice you will love it!

Review:  The Movies will definitely get a reaction from you. Generally it's one that involves loud cursing 
 and throwing the manual across the room. The steep learning curve will turn some off. Not so much 
 for the controls - they're well-devised and intuitive - but actual gameplay 
  Making quality movies is nigh on impossible for the first ten hours or so of gameplay. Until then 
 you have to make pieces of trash that aren't going to attract any new stars to your studios or 
 win your studios any awards. In fact, awards are so hard to achieve, you may just give up and turn 
 on the sandbox feature, where it's all about the creative aspect about making movies. But who wants 
 that? Don't we all have a deep desire to turn a profit and get some big names into our studio? 
 Doesn't any studio? Alas, this is hard to do. 
  Another problem is creating directors. Good directors are hard to come by and rarely visit the 
 studios, and when you decide to take one of your stars and turn them into a director, they become 
 disillusioned with the career change and quite often become addicted to drink and food, and therefore 
 have to enter the studios rehab for 12 months.
  Still, it is rewarding when you finally succeed. Things start to look up and you begin to think 
 you can take over Hollywood. Only to find that the studio is bound to start falling in prestige 
 once again.
  Overall a really good game and definitely only for those who like a challenge -there's no slacking 
 off in this game, not for a second.

Review:  The idea of making your own studio in Hollywood sounds great. It's addictive, you just can't stop 
 playing , you have to upgrade and make better movies. But, in the other hand, your competitors 
 always have more cash than you. They also make better movies. After you get some awards , your 
 studio starts growing and you become one of the big guys on Hollywood. With Custom Scripts you 
 can make the movie you always dream of. The only problem is the humor tone, every movie is funny.
 
  Pros and Cons
  + Price
  + Addictive;
  + Several Kinds of Movies;
  +++ Custom Scripts [ JUST LOVED THIS ONE ] ;
  + Game Engine and Style;
  + Lots of actors;
 
  + Lots of buildings;
  + Good timing ( not so fast, not so slow) ;
  - Lack of money;
  - Doesn't matter the movie style, it's always funny.
  
  Worth: Playing? Yes Buying? Yes
  
 Aproved!

Review:  The movies is a game 3 years in the making. It has 1 expansion pack. The game is deep and best 
 with the expansion, but novelty value is becoming a problem. Mods are good, but Lionhead needs 
 to get their F'N minds off of Fable 2 and make another expansion. The game is still selling. Make 
 a add-on pack like the sims 2 at least. Maybe I should of saved this for my blog. The game is very 
 unique but it needs more side tools. Maybe a simple prop or set creator? HHHHHEELLLLLOOOOO???????? 
 Anyone home Lionhead? Time to cash in. I'll say it again. WE NEED ANOTHER EXPANSION!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Get to work before the websites close down. now, the movies is a great game, but Novelty value 
 wears offf fast, so think fast Lionhead!! Okay, maybe I'm off topic. The game finally gets the 
 movie-making formula right, and the expansion makes it worthwhile despite making the whole stuntman 
 thing commlicated.

Review:  This is the first ever game that allows you to make movies, however it is a very addictive game. The 
 graphics are superb but the gameplay itself isn't necessarily outstanding first of all you can't 
 make proper blockbusters like you would see in the cinemas it only alllows you to make simple movies 
 which is ok but not that special. It has variety of costumes and film sets to help make your movie 
 that's cool. The most irritating bit in the game is your own film stars that you hire all they want 
 to do is get drunk! The management in this game is simple but boring at the same time. This game 
 has a lot of potential but doesn't live up to the hype.
  
  Graphics - The models up close are brilliant.
  
  Gameplay - It has a lot of potential but does 
 not live up to the hype.
  
  How long the game lasts - This will last you up to at least 90 hours of gameplay.

Review:  I love this game because it is just plain fun and addicting. Every time I play this I find myself 
 glued to my computer for several hours at a time. The very first time I played this game I was 
 amazed at the simplictic control scheme. However, this game has plenty of content for hardcore 
 players as well such as the option to make your own movies or fix the computers movies. Also you 
 can edit your movies and put in your own music into your movies. Then you can post your movies 
 online on the movies website. The award ceremonies are something that adds some competition. It 
 is really fun to try to beat out the computer and win all the awards. I am yet to collect every 
 single award in one ceremony, because it is pretty difficult. This is a game that is really fun 
 and is a game that anybody with a computer should buy!

Review:  The movies has you playing as the owner of a Movie studio. You start out in the 1920s and make 
 your way all the way to present times.
  
  The main "Career mode" has you designing the layout of your studio and hiring new actresses, actors, 
 crew, writers etc. You unlock new buildings automatically throughout the years which allow you 
 to make bigger movies and scripts. You do have the ability to make a movie from scratch although 
 it is a bit difficult in the career mode because you still have to worry about the happiness of 
 your actors. There is a sandbox mode that allows you to just play around with the buildings. It 
 is easier to make your own movie in this mode because you do not have to worry about the actors.
 
  
  There is also an awards ceremony held every five years in the career mode that allow you to receive 
 bonuses if you win. In the beginning of the careeremode it can seem a bit tedious with only one 
 or two sets available early on but once you can make bigger sets and better scripts (The computer 
 scriptwriters do a good enough job of writing scripts for you in the career mode) it becomes a 
 much more enjoyable experience.
  
  You also have the ability to post your videos online and depending on how well your movies are 
 received you can purchase (using earned points online) new costumes, sets etc.
  
  The great career mode and online community help to make The Movies a wonderful and unique game 
 making it an easy game to recommend.

Review:  This game is great! When I first tried it, i was amazed of the many possibilities, the funny animations, 
 plus quite sharp graphix. 
  This game has something for everyone. It's said to be a "business strategy" game, but I didn't 
 care nearly as much for that part, as for the movie-making part. Anyway, you can have fun for hours 
 and hours with this game, and in the end you will be proud of what you have made. 
  
  When you want to make a movie you first have to make a script, and it works this way: There are 
 tons of different scenes where some characters perform some kind of action. There are sorted into 
 different categories such as violence, romantic, traveling, incidental etc. You simply choose some 
 you want, and put them in a line next to each other. Though this might sound like it will look 
 stupid in the end, then it won't! When you've done that and the actors and crew have all the scenes 
 shot, you can edit your movie in post production. (this might take a long time if you have many 
 scenes, but you can switch it off eventually, so that your movie will be shot instantly, that is 
 if you're not really into the business part) . In post production you can add music and sound effects, 
 cut scenes (so they will fit each other perfectly) , and the coolest thing of them all: Add your 
 own voice-over! This feature is just what makes it so great. Then when you've added a dialogue 
 (you need a mic) , you can also make that actor LIP-SYNC it. OMG! 
  If you're not the lucky owner of a microphone though, you can just have the actors "mumble" and 
 then add subtitles :D
  
  Now, be proud of yourself. Your first movie, directed, written and voiced by you! Then you put 
 it online and you get some response. Usually good response, if your movie isn't totally lame 8-) 
 
  The community is very large, and people are friendly and mature. Also many movies in there, some 
 of them are quite fantastic actually. Almost professionally made. (With a lot of mods I think)
 
  
  Just a plain fun and original game, you should definitely check it out ASAP. I'm sure you'll love 
 it, no matter who you are :)

Review:  The Movies is a tycoon game. You get to have your own studio and make movies. You play throughout 
 the movie history, beginning in the 1920' and progressing through time like in any other tycoon 
 game. The tycoon game is great and you will be able to build all sorts of sets and to hire actors, crews, extras 
 or janitors and builders. You will unlock certain clothing and sets while advancing through time. Releasing 
 a movie at a perfect time is essential. You will need to see what's going on in the world and check 
 out the latest headlines in order to know what kind of a movie the public wants to see.
  Another great part of this game is the movie-making part. You will be able to make your own movies 
 by selecting preset animations. There are dozens for every possible situation. The amount of data 
 found in this game is great.
  The graphics are good, not cutting edge but they do the job. The sound is pretty good as well eventhough 
 there is no voice acting for the actors in the game, the soundtrack is pretty relaxing and sounds 
 like a 1960 Steve McQueen movie. The gameplay is good and you will get familiar very quick with 
 the controls.
  This is a very good game, and if you ever wanted to have your own film studio, this is the game for 
 you.
  
  My Score 8.7

Review:  Making a movie is not an easy job, as you'll find out in "The Movies." There are buildings to construct, 
 talent to discover, and staff to hire. You have to start at the bottom and work your way up to 
 having a profitable, well-known movie studio.
  
  Time progresses from the 20s to present time, more costumes and sets become available. You can 
 either create your own Stars or hire ones that show up on your doorstep hoping they'll get a job. 
 You will be a part of the entire movie creation process from hiring the actors and scriptwriters, 
 to choosing the cast, sending the movie to be shot, and then released.
  
  "The Movies" can be as hard or as easy as you want it to be. In the sandbox mode you decide if 
 the stars act out, how much money you get, and how often you get help, among some other settings. 
 Help is always there (if you want it be) to guide you along when you first start playing. This 
 made learning the game very easy and the way the tips and reminders are delivered fit naturally 
 in with the gameplay.
  
  The movie making aspect is incredibly detailed. I didn't play with it a lot, but long enough to 
 be impressed. Fans have already created excellent videos that can be seen on "The Movies" community 
 website.
  
  If you decide to buy "The Movies," you can count on hours of involved gameplay. There are multiple 
 strategies to try, movie scripts to develop, and awards to be won. "The Movies" is one game you 
 shouldn't miss out on playing.

Review:  At first i was annoyed with this game. I found the main mode far too repetetive and basically very 
 boring.
  You basically hire people to construct buildings for you and you create your studio. Then you hire 
 actors and train them for your movies.
  
  After 2-3 hours i began to think that you cannot make the movies yourself but the next day i began 
 to play again and then i noticed that you can buy a custom scriptwriting office... and that's when 
 the fun began! 
  
  Making movies is so much fun. There are so many options and choices you can make. You have control 
 over the actors appearance, the objects in the set, the weather, what happens in the scenes etc!
 
  There are about 40 sets which is all you will need (but you can download some) . 
  You also have thousands of different actions of what will happen in each scene. Once your script 
 is written then it will be produced by the people in the studio and after that you can add in your 
 own music, sound effects and can even add in voice recordings which will automatically be lip syncronised 
 by the character you choose.
  When you are happy with your movie it can be posted online.
  
  The graphics of this game are excellent! So much detail is put into things. 
  The music and 
 sound effects are great.
  
  The main mode is hard but making movies can be quite simple seeing as you choose everything, but 
 it takes a while to get used to.
  
  I conclude that this game is brilliant if you fancy making your own blockbuster but if you plan 
 on buying it just to run a studio, look elsewhere because the movies hardly makes running a studio 
 feel fun.

Review:  The film industry may be massive and sprawling today, but it is important to remember that it wasn't 
 always that way. The rise of Hollywood is a story of style, money and glamour, mixed in with some 
 fantastic cinema. So, here is a tycoon game which allows you to play through that rich history 
 of film, from the roaring twenties all the way into the 21st Century. Also, I don't know about 
 you, but I have always wanted to have a game in which I could make the most wild, dramatic and 
 cinematic films imaginable, and then watch them to my hearts content. I am pleased to say that 
 The Movies answers this burning desire well, and though there are some minor qualms, they are extremely 
 easily overlooked.
  
  The premise of The Movies is remarkably simple. You begin in 1920, where you set up your movie 
 studio, build the facilities and sets, hire staff, and then throw open the gates and let the talent 
 in. You can then begin work on you first feature, and watch as your cast and crew rush around to 
 different sets, filming scenes, whilst also occasionally relaxing with a break in their trailer. 
 You are given a view above the studio very similar to that of Rollercoaster Tycoon (from which 
 you can zoom in and pan around) , and if you have played that game, the principle mechanics of The 
 Movies will resonate clearly. The general aim is to eventually build your studio into the biggest, 
 richest and most successful company in Hollywood, keeping your staff, actors and directors happy, 
 maintaining repair on the facilities, and successfully producing high earning motion pictures to 
 rake in the cash and keep the public satisfied.
  
  There are two very clear cut aspects to The Movies. The first is the typical tycoon game that has 
 spawned a multitude of copycats over the years, and can more than often in some titles feel stripped 
 back and unsatisfying. Thankfully, the tycoon aspects of the game are extremely strong. Everything 
 from hiring staff such as builders and janitors is simple, as is constructing buildings and sets 
 along with hiring more complex staff such as film crew and scriptwriters. One nice touch is that 
 although people who think they have the qualifications necessary for a certain job will queue outside 
 the appropriate building, any given person can be tasked to perform any action. Thus, it is possible 
 to employ a director or actor as a temporary janitor, though doing so will lower their esteem and 
 probably result in them leaving the studio. For the purposes of an easy life, everyone other than 
 directors and actors (including extras) does not age, and are all employed at the same pay-scale. 
 Budgeting is also easily handled, thanks to the studio expenditure graphs, where you can also set 
 the salaries of your actors, et cetera.
  
  Looking after actors and directors is a bit more complicated. Each individual actor or director 
 has a happiness threshold, which is calculated in terms of how satisfied they are in terms of studio 
 facilities, their salary, their personal trailer and entourage, their "star rating" (basically 
 how famous they are, ranked across all stars in all of the studios) , their appearance and style, 
 and how well they think the filming of their latest production is going. They also have a bar devoted 
 to how stressed they are. If they become stressed, they may indulge in one of their vices, such 
 as over-eating or drinking. Stressed actors perform scenes worse, and take longer to do anything, 
 whilst unhappy directors lower the quality of the picture, so it is vital to keep the talent happy. 
 If they are always kept in the newspapers (by having the paparazzi take photos of them doing stuff, 
 or by promoting their latest film at the Publicity Office) , and are appropriate fed, watered, housed 
 and attended to, most stars will remain contented with their lot.
  
  Creating films is as easy as eating a piece of cake. Creating good films is slightly more challenging. 
 To make a basic film, you start by getting your scriptwriters to decide what genre of film they 
 are going to write, either Horror, Comedy, Action, Romance or Sci-Fi. They will then set about 
 writing the script, give the production a title, and deciding what scenes to shoot. You then take 
 the script to the Casting Office, where you can assign your actors and directors. They then rehearse, 
 after which they commence filming, by running all over the studio, filming the individual scenes. 
 After filming ends, the completed film can then be taken to Post-Production, where effects and 
 music can be added, and to the Publicity Office, where the film will be hyped to the public. Finally, 
 the film can be released, and various different publications will review it, and give their rating. 
 All of these factors will eventually affect how much money the film makes. It is also possible 
 to make entirely freeform films of your own design, or alter the script, by dropping it into the 
 Custom Scriptwriting Office, where you can choose from almost limitless possibilities concerning 
 what scenes to shoot, how the actors should behave, what costumes they should wear, what the lighting 
 should be like, and everything else conceivably imaginable. Technically, a film can last as long 
 as you want, but be warned that shooting a film longer than ten minutes might take upwards of twenty 
 years to complete. All of this is done in an accessible way, and handy tutorials are also provided 
 to explain some of the more complex features, both in Scriptwriting and Post-Production.
  
  Another fun aspect of the main campaign is the Lionhead Motion Picture Awards Ceremony, held every 
 five years from 1925. This is basically the game's version of the Academy Awards, where the best 
 in moviemaking, acting and studio management is rewarded (such as Best Direction or Highest Charting 
 Movie. There are a number of awards with associated rewards attached, which will slowly grow in 
 number, as new categories are introduced. You will be competing against a number of rival studios 
 (such as Lionear Productions and Old Rope Cinema) for the awards, and also for a higher prestige 
 ranking in studio and start charts. If you keep your stars happy, have a good income and a decent 
 output of films, you can expect a good rating. The basic rule is that higher your ranking, the 
 more awards you will win, and the more staff you will be able to recruit and retain. 
  
  Graphically, the entire game is on a par with The Sims 2 which is perfectly sufficient, though 
 the people themselves often look rather too symmetrical across their faces. Music is almost completely 
 perfect. The main campaign has music from the station KMVS, with a variety of hosts across the 
 generations, all of whom embody their particular era superbly (for example, William MacDuff is 
 the host in the 20's and 30's, and is always derogatory to the film industry since he was a theatre 
 actor) . All of music the station puts out is the same as that which you can use to score your films, 
 which was entirely inspired by pre-existing film scores (such as a tune which sounds remarkably 
 like Indiana Jones) . There are lush, sweeping orchestral crescendos, light Jazz and Honky Tonk, 
 and later some Rock and electro Funk, all of which fits in just right.
  
  Though both the moviemaking and tycoon aspects of The Movies are great, they don't especially fit 
 together well. It is altogether possible to go through the entire campaign without producing any 
 films yourself, simply leaving it to the whims of your scriptwriters and directors. When producing 
 a film during the main game, you will often feel as if you are wasting time, since your films invariably 
 take longer to film because they are more complex. Making films in the sandbox mode can remove 
 this fear, but then the tycoon aspects are all but removed to concentrate on filmmaking. In conclusion, 
 The Movies has come as close as any game ever has to making a freeform film production game. It 
 is a solidly entertaining experience, with massive replayability and a lingering appeal that will 
 always see you coming back for more.
  
  That's a wrap people. Take five.

Review:  This game is highly addictive... I've been playing non-stop for a week now and can't get enough. 
 Download the employee mod and the bigger studio lot though, and you'll be very happy! Hours and 
 Hours of entertainment are guaranteed with this game, and that's just the Tycoon part of the game. 
 I haven't even gotten really all deep into the movie making part of the game, but so far it too 
 is incredible. There's so much to do in this game that you won't easily be bored. And with the 
 modders out there providing new content, you'll have a wealth of new sets to play with for some 
 time. There is a big gap between the movie making part of the game and the tycoon part, but I don't 
 think most people will mind. It's kind of fun to take a break everynow and then from running the 
 studio to craft a masterpiece. Or sometimes you can use the advanced movie maker to just tweak 
 what your hired writers are putting out for the maximum rating. You won't be disappointed with 
 this game. Recommended game!

Review:  This game is about your Movie Production Studio. In it you can hire actors, directors, extras, 
 etc. to make your movies. You can customize your studio lot (buy plants, benches, etc.) . You have 
 a custom scriptwriting office where you can desing your movies, the makeover department, the bar, 
 and so on. It's a very fun game, I recommend it to you.

Review:  It is sad that this game didn't take off like it should have. Both this and the Exp. are great 
 games!!
  
  This game is not only great for those that enjoy making little skit movies but it also is great 
 for those that like "The Sims" the style is the same with not so much headache. The game should 
 have been as great a seller as "The Sims 2" however it wasn't and now because of that "Stunts and 
 Effects" is the only Exp. that will ever come out for this game. That is just sad. I can't help 
 but wonder why this game didn't skyrocket. It has everything a game could ask. Including am "Online" 
 community that passes all others when it comes to working together and sharing movies.
  Hopefully time will tell if there is a demand for yet another edition of this game. Much like "Fall 
 Out" it had its following and those people wanted more. One can only wonder if the new heads of 
 MSN (they took over lionhead) will here the call and answer it.
  
  Everyone should look into checking this game out. It is worth it.

Review:  A game very original because of the idea of making movies your own, same as tycoon but i prefer 
 it because of its ''free'' making limit of movies maybe it has a lot of limits but you cant lost 
 the fun in it, you search and focus deeper into the game to make your studio the best of all and 
 making your actors and movies a lot better, i can say that the form of one to make movies will 
 in the game or give you money or going to the bottom of the barrel i mean if you get distracted 
 with one thing in the game you dont know that your losing something in the studio, like people 
 you are seeing hos the movie going but your not taking care that are people or actors in the waiting 
 line and they get bother and they flee, of course you can grab them again and select them, but 
 i would be better if you could choose them and hire them instead of gain more money to hire them 
 and wait for them to come.

Review:  I've never played a game quite like The Movies its odd, and unlike any other game. And I love it. 
 The game itself is one of the most addicting games for me, simply because I love reading the reviews 
 of my films. You can make you own films using a series of pre-made cut-scenes and you are able 
 to release make profits and read reviews. Now onto the graphics, to be honest there fairly simplistic 
 pretty nice nothing you've never seen before, nothing really special in this department. Sound, 
 not bad I personally like the sound of the game not really much to say about this department. Gameplay, 
 in terms of gameplay anyone who buys this game is virtually guaranteed to enjoy it at-least slightly 
 the gameplay is fantastic. Overall the game is a excellent game with many merits and while it may 
 have its problems its more than worth your time.

Review:  Basically, its a game where you make movies and own your own movie studio, but that isnt the cool 
 bit, constantly whilst you play, the local radio in the game is on, and the guy is hilarous, he 
 takes the mick out of all the things that happened in the 20th century, because the game spans 
 from 1920-2000.
  
  The idea of the game is you have to make your actors, films and studio as prestigious as they possibly 
 can be, and how good you are doing is represented in star ratings, from 0-5 stars for each thing, 
 so you can see how well you are doing. Every 5 years in the game there is an awards ceremony, which 
 helps boost your studio and gives you improvements that help you do even better and get more awards.
 
  
  The actual film making is another part of the game, you can hire scriptwriters to make the scripts 
 for you, or you can make the scripts yourself, which is fun and you can choose from a variety of 
 costumes, actors, sets, props and backdrops to make your film look as cool as possible. You can 
 build up quite interesting stories, but the number of different types of scenes is limited, so 
 you have to be quite clever to make a film which actually makes sense.
  
  Definatly worth getting if you like comedy+modern world history, and if you love making films, 
 but it isnt the best game ive played.

Review:  This game really draws you in.
  
  After the first 2 days of owning the game, I've spent more then 6 hours playing it. On the family 
 computer, that's almost all my pc time!
  
  The graphics are excellent, and give it a sim-ish look. There can be the occasional glitch when 
 you're trying to look into a building, and the camera options are limited, but It does it's job.
 
  
  The base of the game is very simple; Make and manage the best Hollywood studio. THis may seem easy, 
 but it's not. The game drops you right in where you need to be during the tutorial. The halp bubbles 
 can be annoying, sometimes, but most hide a tip you didn't know before.
  The sounds always work right, and the sound is simply beautifull during the awards ceremonies. 
 
  
  The game makes the movie buisness a breeze.
  
  
  It could have some more options, but it is a must-try anyways!

Review:  Overall, this is a fun game, about running a film studio and producing movies. There's a great 
 deal of micromanagement required, and it's very overwhelming. It's kind-of like 'The Sims' meets 
 'Sim City' on a Hollywood lot. If you enjoy the game, there's a lot of replay value.
  
  But, I wouldn't recommend it as video software. I've tried to make a movie several times and I 
 always end up with video-soup. You have to select from a limited set of clips that come with the 
 game, so you can't film anything original. You do have some freedom in regards to 'What prop to 
 use' or 'Is your actor going to act scared or angry', but you have no control over the scene's 
 plot. (The most freedom you have is the ability to record your own voice on the film.)
  
  Some of the game-created movies are funny-as-all, but that's because they're so random and don't 
 make any sense. They're funny if you view them as part of a game, but they suck as actual videos.
 
  
  Pros: -Awesome soundtrack, very suitable and matches the era. Radio announcers are funny.
  -Interesting.
 
  -Sims-like actors and customization. (Yes, give your actors Boob jobs!)
  -Some film customization available. (Choose Ray-guns for Sci-Fi, or Gloks for Action.)
  -Awards 
 ceremonies are cool. (If you win any.)
  -Lots of fun.
  
  Neutral: -You can customize your actors eyes, hair, clothing, and all cosmetic stuff. Not really 
 necessary, but sometimes good.
  
  Cons: -Big Problem: There's never enough people to hire!
  - (see above complaints about trying 
 to make your own movie)
  -Moving/deleting items is difficult and time-consuming, with a weird lag to boot.
  -Can't make 
 changes when game is paused, so renovating can waste years of gametime. (see 'Weird Lag'.)
  -Too many costumes for everday wear. (You really only want to dress your actors in the best tuxedo, 
 but you have to search through 500 sets of robots, lizards, and spaceman suits before you can find 
 it. It's kind-of pointless.)
  -A few obvious, confusing glitches. (ie Retired actors continue to film movie for a while after 
 they 'retire'.)
  -Memory hog. (BSOD happens every so often, and is really annoying.)
  -Takes about 2 minutes to load a game but only 5 seconds to save.

Review:  The Movies is a sim game that focuses on the creation of your own movie studio. You get to make 
 your own movies, your own stars, your own studio lot, and watch it potentially thrive in the movie 
 business. Granted, the Movies is far from a perfect experience with a few issues here and there, 
 but if you really delve into this game, your in for quite a fun, and potentially long ride.
  
  The premise of the main single player game is that your th founder of a movie studio right 
 from the early start of movie making in the 1920s. After the lengthy tutorial that you are forced 
 to go through at the start of the game, you are free to manage your studio for as long as you desire. 
 You can also play in a sandbox mode which allows you to turn off certain aspects of the game, such 
 as your staff's mood, building degeneration, etc.
  
  When managing your studio, you'll have to hire plenty of staff, including your stars, directors, 
 builders, janitors, scientists, and more. The larger your studio gets, the more staff you'll have 
 to hire, and the more you'll have to keep track of.
  
  The basic sim game here is decent, but it gets repetitive really quickly. You'll have to constantly 
 keep track of your star's and director's moods, and keep them happy if you want them to give good 
 performances. This involves giving them trailers, letting them have snacks to eat, letting them 
 take breaks to keep their stress level down, etc. It sounds like alot and sounds complicated doesn't 
 it? But all of those things require basically the same action- dragging those stars to the necessary 
 facilities to fullfill their needs.
  
  Fortunately, the sim game isn't the main focus of The Movies. The main draw of The Movies is making 
 your own films. The advanced movie maker the game has is surprisingly robust and entertaining to 
 use, and only gets more powerful as you get later into the game. Not enough can be said about the 
 satisfaction of making your own movies here. You don't have to wait terribly long to get into that 
 action either, for the advanced movie maker is unlockable very early in the game.
  
  The movie maker does have a minor issue however. The movie maker comes with hundreds of scenes 
 available, so there's no worries about running out of scenes to use, but some people might be a 
 little disappointed that they are stuck with the camera angles the game gives them. The camera 
 angles given are well placed most of the time, but the ability to adjust the movie camera yourself 
 would of been nice.
  
  Graphically, the movies looks pretty good. The game has some nice textures for its buildings, and 
 the animation is very well done. The character models look decent all around, though their expressions 
 aren't terribly impressive. Sound wise, the game has some cheesy voice acting from the radio hosts 
 you get to listen to over the years in the game, but its entertaining to listen to them. The actors 
 themselves however don't get any actual lines, and instead just mumble. Kinda like the sims themselves 
 actually- so if you found the sims' mumbling entertaining, you'll have more enjoyment with it here.
 
  
  All matters considered, if your looking for a unique experience that you really want to delve into, 
 The Movies is unquestionably a worthy investment.
  
  Pros: The Movie Maker is surprisingly robust and entertaining to use. There's a good sense of satisfaction 
 to managing your own studio if you like sim games. Great graphics.
  
  Cons: The sim game of The Movies gets repetitive very quickly. You can't adjust the movie camera 
 yourself in the Movie Maker.
  
  Recommendable for: If you want a unique experience related to the movie industry, this is the game 
 for you.

Review:  Well, I don't like the Sims. Looks like a waste of time, so I'll treat this one from the Tycoon 
 player POV.
  You get to start a film company and design its lot, it's finance (treated very lightly here) and 
 the HR (also treated lightly) . The main thing to do is get good actor, script a movie and start 
 filming it.
  The game does pose a little challenge as your company grows and you get to deal with quite a few 
 actors that on the roster, plus taking care of your lot's design and maintenance, but these tasks 
 tend to be repetitious.
  But, this game has its unexplained, attracting aura. When you start, it just suck you in to do 
 these tasks. 
  One more attraction is the presentation of the game - the guy in the radio , in first listening, 
 is cynically funny, making fun of human existence in the last century. Obviously, once you start 
 the game again, you better shut him up or here the same always-trying-to-be-so-funny jokes.
  The heart of the game is actually making the movies, and here the Sims player can come alive - 
 casting, directing, choosing costumes...
  Not only that this is not a slice of pie I want to chug, creating a movie this way consumes a lot 
 of time. I actually tried to create a 3-scene movie and it took me about 30 minutes. The movie 
 turned to be (surprise) a piece of crap.
  What drove me to try and be a better manager was the Oscars. Once you win one, you get bonuses, 
 but the game loses credibility here, because if you are doing good from the beginning, you'll get 
 these bonuses and still do good in the game without too much effort.
  Well, I feel I slashed it a little bit ( or, maybe, too much...) . This game is absolutely playable, 
 even fun to play once or twice. If you play it more than that, you better get a job.

Review:  The more you unlock the more you can control but look out. With more control comes more responsibility. 
 Between finance management and director/actor personality clashes and addictions, it can get tough 
 to keep track of everything. With any success, you'll find:
  
  The positives: A terrific opportunity/medium to create and tell stories. Five genres to pick from: 
 Romance, Comedy, Sci-fi, Action and Horror. The Movies Online provides a platform on which to display 
 your work and to share your movies with others as well as receive ratings - it's also where you 
 can watch others' films and rate them, too. Not enough can be said to describe how great a creative 
 outlet this game can be. Sandbox mode lets you cheat so you don't have to worry so much about actors' 
 moods and studio finances and you can make as long a movie as you want without long shooting schedules.
 
  
  The negatives: Frustrating for control freaks. Random glitches can ruin gameplay. For example: 
 If a character in previous scenes has red lipstick and blue nail polish on, regardless of the costuming 
 in later scenes -say the character is not supposed to be wearing any make up for whatever reason- 
 then the character will still be wearing the lipstick and nail color they had on before and it 
 can be very hard to change, even in a re-shoot. Filming anything of substance takes a LONG time 
 in-game and a studio can quickly go into debt making one of these films - even if there are other 
 movies being released. Lastly, if you're computer is even a little bit slow, this game can crash 
 at any instant. Mid-scriptwriting, it may crash and everything WILL BE LOST. Autosave apparently 
 doesn't work while putting the scenes together and I'm pretty sure the same goes for post-production.
 
  
  Minus the glitches and performance problems, The Movies is a terrific game and I would definitely 
 recommend it to anyone who has longed for such a creative outlet.

Review:  This game is very fun. This game allows you to make your own movies with scenes that you can move 
 and edit. Then you run your studio and make all the rules, which actor/actoress that you want, 
 how good you want your film, what advertizing you want, etc. 
  
  In story mode you play as a studio that you make. You must now manage stars, make movies for to 
 increase your profit, train actor to be better at roles, and much more. As your studio you must 
 rise to the top with rival studios and make awesome films.
  
  In sandbox mode you can make your studio as exactly you want and can make the best movies becuase 
 of no limits options you can put in. Making movies is a truely awesome feature. You can add voiceovers, 
 sound effects, subtitles, and music. The best feature about making films is that you can realease 
 them on the movie's website where other users can comment them and you can comment their films. 
 However, the game has some limits on scenes but the awesome feature to share movies online makes 
 up for that.
  
  The movies is a fun game that I recommend you all play whenever you can play.

Review:  I waited a long time for the movies to come out as I thought it would be exactly what i wanted. 
 
  
  Who wouldn't want to create their own movies and pretend to be a leading director in Hollywood? 
 
  
  You can to an extent do this in the game which gives the movies something but the entire game seems 
 limited somewhat. I don't mean the normal tycoon type part of the game as it does have some fun 
 parts and additions such as the radio presenters and the change in atmosphere as you advance through 
 the years. I mean the advanced movie making part, the part I bought the game for. 
  
  The actual creation of movies allows you to select a scene, put voices and subtitles over them 
 in a wide range of different sets which does give quite a lot of depth in creating a movie. The 
 problem is that the same actions are often re-used (at least by me) and the actors are not very 
 "controllable" as you can not freely decide where they are positioned in the scene... this can leade 
 to an actor suddenly changing position halfway through a fight or a conversation! The entire system 
 seems set to annoy you with actors clothes constantly being re set when you change scenes...
  
  All of that said I wouldn't say that the Movies is bargain bin material and is worth more than 
 $5 or 5 depending on where the person reading this comes from. It has a very good tycoon system 
 and gives you a lot of playing time but do not expect a 10/10 movie creating game.

Review:  Developed by Lionhead Studios (led by visionary designer Peter Molyneux) , the game puts players 
 in charge of their own Hollywood movie studio, with authority over everything from project approval 
 and budgeting decisions to conception, scripting, directing, and editing of the movies the studio 
 produces.
  
  The business sim aspects of The Movies put players in charge of developing the studio and keeping 
 it running smoothly. Beginning with an empty lot, players build their business by purchasing the 
 facilities and equipment they'll need to produce a feature film, from actors' trailers and wardrobes 
 to stages, lighting, and cameras. They'll have to decide which movies are made, how much is spent 
 on the productions, and even how they'll treat their star actors. Will they abide distracting on-set 
 romances and childish tantrums for the sake of the art, or send actors packing when they don't 
 recognize the producer's ultimate authority? 
  
  The movie-making aspects of the game are designed to give players realistic cinematic tools and 
 near-complete creative freedom. Inspired players can take charge of every step in the process: 
 hiring the talent, approving the script, shooting the scenes, and editing the final product in 
 post-production. The game's 3D actors, props, sets, and editing tools are designed to allow creative 
 players to take extensive control over every shot and put professional polish on their final film.
 
  
  Whether players prefer to spend their time schmoozing the front office or shooting on the soundstage, 
 in the end, the studio will live or die by the financial success of its movies. There is lots of 
 money to by made by following trends, sticking to popular genres and actors, and staying on schedule, 
 but a well-run studio can stay afloat with independent films and pet projects as well. Even if 
 the player takes no direct role in the creation of the films themselves, responsible budgeting 
 and proper marketing can make nearly any movie profitable. 
  
  For those players who would rather pour themselves into the movie-making gameplay without worrying 
 about all the paperwork, the game also features a sandbox mode, which gives them freedom to use 
 any of the studio tools without worrying about balancing the budgets or winning the box office. 
 Films created by players in the game can be uploaded and shared on the Internet, so virtual producers 
 and directors can share their favorite creations with a real live audience.
  
  In addition to the complete game and manual materials, the "Premiere Edition" of The Movies includes 
 ten exclusive in-game costumes, a 20-song soundtrack on CD, a "mini-guide" to making great movies, 
 and five trailers from the game's "This Is Hollywood" promotional series.

Review:  The Movies is a tycoon game, that has a Sims-like cartoony art style and some features similar 
 to what you would find in a Sims game.
  
  It's a tycoon game first and foremost - the game functions mostly as a tycoon game. But The Movies 
 tries to fit into multiple genres and the end result is that the game is a mish mash. It becomes 
 very confusing as what you are supposed to do, or accomplish. This game tries to be a tycoon game, 
 a Sims game, and a movie-making game.
  
  The problem with the tycoon part being the main focus of the game, is that it is actually very 
 boring and repetitive. The game starts in the 1920's. You are starting up a movie studio. You have 
 a huge empty lot you start out on. You then build things like an actor's studio, a movie production 
 studio, and sets to shoot movies on.
  
  Then you hire actors, producers, extras, and other people like janitors, scriptwriters and research 
 scientists. Then you pick up your people and put them on the building and then they shoot a movie. 
 You have no control over what the movie is about - you have to play two or three hours until you 
 discover how to write custom scripts.
  
  Your actors and producers have egos and they also have needs, that's how the game relates to the 
 Sims. You have to make sure your sim actors are happy, or they'll be in a bad mood and then make 
 bad movies.
  
  You level your actors up by putting them on a set and making them practice a certain movie genre 
 (romance, horror, sci-fi, etc.) They'll then make better movies if their level goes higher.
  
  Ultimately, this game is the most repetitive and boring game you could buy. The first time 
 you play it through, it's okay, but toward eight or nine hours of gameplay, even with all the bells 
 and whistles that you discover and unlock, it's still doing the same exact thing. Build sets, put 
 your people making movies, and do it all over again.
  
  The game doesn't have any bugs - the gameplay and the graphics aren't bad, bad by themselves. The 
 gameplay is not broken. The problem is that the gameplay is bland, uninspired and repetitive. You'll 
 be bored soon. I only had one major sit down with the game. I played it once for an hour and a 
 halfish just to experiment with the game to see how I should play it, and then I played it for 
 six or seven hours straight to see how much depth there was to the game, or basically, how much 
 content is in this game? I was trying to get my money's worth.
  
  After that major seven hour sit through, I knew I had seen what I would see every time I started 
 up the game.
  
  The bottom line is that the game has only two to three hours of actual gameplay that is new, or 
 that you can learn, or really have fun with. That time is not bad time as the game from a gameplay 
 standpoint is not broken. However, anything beyond that amount of time is just that same repetitive 
 gameplay that gets boring quickly.
  
  I paid $15 for the game, not the $40 or $30 it used to be, so I'm not as upset about the value.
 
  
  I felt that the game is only worth about $8-10 - just about the price of a movie ticket - about 
 two to three hours of entertainment.

Review:  If you want to be a film maker youll love this game if you want to be a movie studio manager you 
 can be. Lionhead have got a Sims Esq. feel in this game and is great fun. It is truly up to you, 
 if you want 20 actors and directors turning out 10+ films per year This is the game for you if 
 you want 4 people turning one film a year you can. This game is very scalable and is now very cheap. 
 It is very addictive. A must have! This is where tycoon meets The Sims to make a great game.

Review:  The movie is much more a software to make movies than a game. I've been waiting for this game because 
 I wanted to make my own movie and that's what the Movie does and it does it very well. But if you're 
 only about playing the game, the movie fall short. The game play is not that engaging and I found 
 myself liking more the small budget game Hollywood Mogul than The movie when it came to play. But 
 if you want to make movies, this game is what you need. It will give you full control (although 
 I would say that the expansion Stunt&amp; effects is a must) over making a good movie. But you must 
 remember that good movies take times to make. So in clear, a fun but not so engaging game and a 
 great movie making software.

Review:  The Movies is a very fun PC game that will have you coming back for more each time you play. You 
 run the studio, you can do everything from making stars chum and hang out together at the studio 
 bar to recording your own voice using a microphone for a movie.
  
  When playing The Movies, you can't get bored. You can hire staff, fire staff, make a movie, record 
 your voice, make stars interact with each other and much, much more. The possibilites are unlimited.
 
  
  So, you want to run your own studio, eh? Well you need to know what you're getting into.
  
 
  Sandbox mode is my favourite mode because you can make your layout the way you want it. The game 
 starts out with the build button flashing, which is letting you know that you need to build some 
 sets, buildings and facilities. When that is done, you're ready to run the studio!
  
  The Gameplay in this game has a lot of variety, you can crash and burn with making horrid movies, 
 or you can win it big making a box office hit! You decide everything, you can decide how many writers 
 you want working on a script (1-5) or you can run your own. You can have your stars interact to 
 get good ratings and more. This game never gets old, but if it does, I'd reccommend a trip to the 
 asylum with you!
  
  The Graphics are okay, but what can you expect from a computer game? They're are still great though, 
 especially for having over a hundred people moving at once at the studio at any given moment.
 
  
  This game is definately a buy because it has more than you'd want in any game!

Review:  Living Peter Molyneux's promise of making your own movies is a tempting one, and it's nice to be 
 able to do so with a budget that amounts to the cost of a computer game. That in itself makes 'The 
 Movies' a worthwhile purchase, as anyone who's been involved in making even a five minute short 
 will attest to the logistical and financial headache therein. And although 'The Movies' frees up 
 both logistics and finances, you will very quickly come to appreciate those headaches - even (and 
 especially) if you haven't been involved in movie making before.
  
  After a brief tutorial that sums up the basic controls, you are whisked into the gameworld, which 
 gives you an empty lot and some money to build it up. Creating actors, directors, extras, crew, 
 and maintenance personnel, you are tasked with making your studio lot a success, and here is where 
 the game flies into its full simulator mode. For those who remember, Molyneux branched out and 
 made a theme park simulator in the early 90s, appropriately titled 'Theme Park'. Once the anticipation 
 of creating your own roller-coasters was met with playing the game, you soon realised that the 
 game was more focused on running the park than the actual fun of the rides itself. For better or 
 worse, The Movies meets that anticipation the same way: the rides (movie-making) aren't so important 
 as the success of your property (the Studio Lot) . It's just that, in order for your property to 
 succeed, you better make sure your rides are great.
  
  Here is where 'The Movies' deviates from it's 1994 cousin. In 'The Movies', you can forget, for 
 as long as you like, the logistics of running your studio and dive straight into the nitty-gritty 
 of your film, and the tools therein are simple enough to allow anyone to make the film their own 
 way. A short way into the game, you are given the tools to 'write' your own script, so that you 
 can tell the story you want to tell, not one generated by the game's own algorithms.
  
  To make a film, you start off by having the script written. Then, when it's ready, have your actors, 
 director and crew rehearse, before sending it off to be shot. What makes the game a real success, 
 however, is that you have more to pay attention to than mere logistics. You also have to monitor 
 the moods of your actors and your directors, and also their egos. It's certainly a fun and novel 
 gameplay mechanic to send your leading man to a bar to blow off steam, only to have him become 
 an alcoholic, thus requiring you to send him to rehab. When he gets out of rehab, you may find 
 that giving him a trailer will bolster his mood, until he starts to get jealous about the salaries 
 of other stars. Once you fix his salary, you may find your director gets annoyed, and assigning 
 an entourage to your director may placate him or her -- for a while. So give your director a makeover 
 and have a paparazzi take photographs to bolster their self-image ... until your leading guy gets 
 jealous and, well, so on and so on.
  
  The above description makes much of the core gameplay in 'The Movies', and it can be irritating 
 having to micro-manage a bunch of humans. You'd think they'd have no trouble knocking off to the 
 bar for a quick boozing-up when stressed or bored, yet it is up to the player to tell the characters 
 when to indulge, which seems at odds with reality, and breaks the immersion somewhat. Which is 
 saying something, because the amount of charm in the game is incredible. The character models and 
 especially their animations are wonderful, and being able to zoom in close to watch the characters 
 interact, or even watch them shooting your latest masterpiece (read: flop) . The audio is also great, 
 if understated, with cinematic scores meeting period-related radio broadcasts and in-film sound 
 effects (once you research putting sound into films, that is) .
  
  And here is where the review falters, because there is so much depth to the game that describing 
 it all is just insurmountable. The game interface is wonderfully simple, however the screen can 
 fill with annoying pop-up help balloons which obscure the task you were trying to undertake. But 
 the sheer depth of the game will make you want to keep playing, and although you will tire of certain 
 tasks, making you save and quit, you'll want to come back 20 minutes later to try for your next 
 masterpiece.
  
  If only you weren't tasked with micromanaging your stars -- even a small measure of autonomy on 
 their part would make the game more pleasurable. Perhaps a more accurate name for 'The Movies' 
 would be 'The Producer', because although you can direct a short machinima film, you will spend 
 more time producing, and in that sense, taking care of your stars' moods and egos certainly fits. 
 There's no Oscar for Best Producer, and The Movies certainly echoes this, as sometimes it feels 
 like a lot of stress and micromanagement for scant reward, because as soon as one film wraps, you're 
 in the thick of it minutes later.
  
  Ultimately, the charm of 'The Movies' will win out, but some small gameplay grievances prevent 
 it from stealing hours, days and weeks from you as you sit before your screen in a darkened room, 
 your skin going even more pale as you perfect your talent. Instead, you will take breaks all the 
 time (which is good OH&amp; S) , only to be drawn back into the magic spell that 'The Movies' weaves.

Review:  The Movies is one of those games that is so innovative and clever yet it is underated and ignored 
 by so many.
  
  The Movies allows you to take control of a movie studio, real world examples include Warner Brothers 
 and Universal Studios in much the same fashion as Roller Coaster Tycoon and other games of that 
 nature: you hire builders and janitors, make some buildings, make some sets and boom! - you're 
 away. What makes The Movies so special, however, is its starts system that it is pretty much The 
 Sims. So aswell as building and maintaining your lot and making movies (as I'll come onto later) 
 you have to maintain your stars. Now your stars arn't as stupid as The Sims, if they need some 
 food they'll get some food, if they need the toilet they'll go to the toilet... providing you have 
 the facilities required. Instead of telling the stars exactly what their every single movement 
 should be you just have to make sure they can do the movemetns THEY want to make. For example, 
 you don't need to tell them when they need the toilet but what you do need to do is make sure there 
 are plenty of fancy, state-of-the-art toilets for them to use to keep them happy. If you can't 
 fullfill their needs they'll start to get angry and/or depressed and if that happens they won't 
 work well on set and won't get on well with other stars. Other things that get on their nerves 
 is a low salary so you've got to keep ahead on that, you need to make sure they have a nice trailer 
 and make sure they have plenty of other stars as friends. But it gets even more detailed than that, 
 stars can become jealous of other stars' trailers, wages and frienship groups so you'll have to 
 be a little left wing and treat everyone equally. You can even assine paparatzi to stars in compromising 
 positions to boost them in the charts but it could upset them and lead to depression... then they 
 might turn to the drink and then they might get addicted AND THEN you'll have to put them in rehab 
 for a year. Yes, this is how deep the game goes.
  
  Making movies is the real joy of this game. After completing the main game you can use the sandbox 
 mode of the game and start at any date with any amount of money with everything unlocked and some 
 easy options on, such as building construct instantly. With these you can concentrate on soley 
 making movies; no annoying stars, no paparatzi, no award ceremonies to worry about. Nothing. Bliss. 
 Anyways, this is when you have free time to make the script of your dreams, film it, put it in 
 post production, export it to WMV format and then do whatever you want with it. Perfect.
  
  In the main game however you'll have to put up with some random pre-writed scripts spat out by 
 your script writers but you can still make it your own by adding in your own voice acting and the 
 like.
  
  As for the graphics, they arn't spectacular but they're good enough. It's just a shame about the 
 bugs that are present, even in the patched version of the game. There are many instances of parts 
 where objects will be sort of phasing through your stars hands and skins showing through bits of 
 cloathing and things of that nature. Luckily it doesn't ruin the game though. The Moives is also 
 a very difficult game and with no cheats you can't do what everyone does with the Sims: cheat!
 
  
  Not to try and load off some advertising on you but to check out an example of a Movies movie, 
 check out my film: http://uk. gamespot. com/users/ChestyMcGee/video_player? id=JXM7lTKv5b8OvzLX

Review:  The movies is a great game if you have the patience to make movies, because a movie can take hours 
 to make. A nice feature is posting your movies and viewing other peoples movies, because that's 
 the point of making a movie, but with a few online constrains.
  There are a couple of playing styles in the game, as you can either have the computer make movies, 
 to make the game go faster; interact with the characters, even though the interaction between them 
 didn't seem to affect gameplay that much; or focus on business by micromanaging your crew and actors 
 and such.
  Making movies is easy, and should be done because the beginners computer made movies are so cheesy 
 and always seem to include a fire with no story. Intermediate are also bad with no story. There 
 are three to four steps in creating a movie. First there is the script, which have multiple steps 
 depending on the level of difficulty (which you can choose and change before the script is made) . 
 Then the cast reads and rehearses the script. During the filming, right clicking the set goes to 
 a close up where you can change the mood of the scene. Finally there is advanced editing mode where 
 you can add props and subtitles when the actors speak gibberish. The movies is a solid game that 
 can be spent hours on.

Review:  The Movies is a completely different game to most. It's the kind of game that people wished for 
 a long time to be real - and now, it is - a game that offers you the chance to script, film and 
 edit your own short movies.
  
  Gameplay: The game takes a long time to get used to, and to navigate, but once you've got the jist 
 of all this film making lark, you'll be unstoppable. The game can seem a little complicated, and 
 at time gets slow and unbearably frustrating, but at the same time, you're having fun - so this 
 aspect is getting an 8.
  
  Graphics: The graphics of The Movies are similar to that of The Sims 2, or any other simulation 
 games. They're not spectacular, but they're good enough to like a lot - so here it gets an 8.
 
  
  Sound: The music does get slightly repetitive, it uses the same types of music, or similar-sounding 
 music for every movie you make in a specific genre, and the sound effects can get annoying - 7.
 
  
  Value: The Movies is a decent game that you can now find reasonably cheaply online, anything from 
 &pound;20 or less is acceptable, and &pound;15 or less is a real bargain, but make sure you like 
 this sort of stuff. Value: 8
  
  Tilt: I'm going to tilt the game up with a 9 to bring the final score to 8.2. The Movies is a greatly 
 fun game that will immerse you for hours at a time as you try and bring out some great movies, 
 that your virtual public (and the real public when you post them online) will enjoy. Have fun!

Review:  What can I say...
  
  The Movies (and I'm also referring to the Stunts &amp; Effect Expansion) is IMO arguably one of 
 the best and an Essential for anyone who loves both Empire Builders and Machinima!
  
  For those who are Empire Builder enthusiasts, that particular side of the game will be good to 
 get into. It's pretty straight foward...
  Start off as a fledgeling studio in the 1920's and work your way through to Present Day. The gameplay 
 for the Empire Building side of The Movies is cross between Theme Park and The Sims. Now if that's 
 all you're interested in, the game will keep you busy for a while.
  IMO that's not where The Real gameplay is...
  If you thought this game didn't have any multiplayer 
 to this what so ever...
  Go into sandbox mode and build all the sets you need/want for any films you want to make and build 
 a Custom Script Writing Facility, a Post Production Dept. with all the other necessities for you 
 studio and you're in buissness!
  From there get your team together and then just cut sick piecing and editing your movies... TMO 
 is where the true action is!
  Once you've completed your films, you can upload them on TMO where the public can view and download 
 them and where as a member you can also review other films as well as upload your own!
  
  If you want to cut sick making Easy-Made Machinima, go buy The Movies and The Movies: Stunts &amp; 
 Effects expansion!
  
  This game goes beyond being a game, it's a machinima network....
  
  Oh yeah before I forget here's the TMO web address:

Review:  Poor movie making tool, all scenes are already preset, you just choose which one. As a 'sim' it's 
 a good game, with plenty of details.
  
  With the starmaker's depth of facial control, you'd have thought that more could be done in the 
 actual movie making part, at least more than preset scenes with changed actors.
  
  Overall, I was very let down. Was not the 'movie making' tool it clamed to be.
  
  Buy it as 
 a sim, not a moviemaker
  
  And I'm sick of this 100 words rule. (This is filler) (with more filler) (I tend to talk to the point) (Really, 
 I've said what I need to)

Review:  I bought this game the day it came out, over a year ago I think. I have been occassionally tempted 
 to revisit the title, and I have even sat and contemplated buying the expansion.... But the keyword 
 is VALUE.
  
  To repeat what the other major reviewers have said, a major weakness of this game is the disconnect 
 between the movie making aspect of the game, and the Tycoon-type studio management aspect of the 
 game.
  
  The largest weakness, however, is not the disconnect between the games major aspects, but rather, 
 the largest weakness is the amount of limitation in the movie maker itself. The fact is that the 
 game just doesn't come close to delivering on its promise, and the game has little or NO REPLAY 
 VALUE.
  
  1) The game's many sets are beautiful, and the props are great, but every set seems to be more 
 or less a one-trick pony . Aside from dimming a light, switching a backdrop, or adding some fog, 
 not much can be done to create a personal feel for your sets. Basically the scene is going to look 
 exactly like the way the game designers wanted it to look. After awhile, attempting to customize 
 your movie sets will hold as much creative appeal as lighting a sparkler on the fourth of July, 
 and the most you will be able to get out of the experience is a few OOHS and AAHS , but that too 
 will grow old fast.
  
  2) There are many, many scenes to choose from, but you will never find the right one to tell the 
 story that you want to tell. Forget trying to create a little movie that someone else might like 
 to watch, you will never even create a movie that you would want to watch. For instance: I like 
 Westerns, and I wanted to shoot an opening scene where the lone stranger rides across a desolate 
 stretch of prarie, gets off of his horse and wipes sweat from his forehead. The only problem is 
 that there is only one choice for showing a man riding a horse, and the shot works better for riding 
 off into the sunset than riding into town. As for my lone stranger wiping sweat from his forehead, 
 the game just doesn't offer such a scene. In fact, 90 percent of those cool cinematic ideas that 
 you might come up with will not be possible, and you will find yourself recycling the exact same 
 shots over and over again within only the first 10 or 12 hours of play. Weakness 3) Jump cuts, 
 Jump cuts, and more Jump cuts.... This game does not let you set your camera angles, and so when -- 
 or if -- you find that perfect scene to tell the story you want to tell, you will be hard-pressed 
 to follow it up with a scene that doesn't leave you with a nasty Jump cut.... Imagine this, two 
 people are standing in the middle of the room arguing, and then the next scene Jumps to a different 
 angle, displaying a different part of the room, and one person is down on one knee, apologizing 
 to the other person . It doesn't take long before these nasty Jump cuts leave you feeling a little 
 jarred and disoriented.
  
  4) Sliders don't really give you much control. When you adjust a slider either you will alter a 
 camera angle, or you will slightly modify the way an actor acts a scene. The choice is not even 
 yours to make. essentially, what the sliders do in this game is offer a variation on the same scene, 
 like an alternate ending to a movie. Basically the sliders give you no more control than the DVD 
 menu on Army of Darkness . But if that is your idea of self-expression then Hey, It's your bag 
 baby .
  
  I could go on for another ten pages, but I won't. My final thoughts on this game are that the actors 
 in the game don't really do what you would ask them to do. The sets are not something that you 
 build, but rather they are things that the game designers already built. As a standalone movie 
 maker, this game only holds about five or six hours of fun for people who know anything about making 
 movies. As a standalone Tycoon game it might hold 20 hours of playing time.... Altogether, count 
 on twenty-four hours of addictive play, and then you can plan on bringing the game disc to your 
 local recycling center.

Review:  The Movies is such a disappointment to me because it is not that great for all the hype that it 
 got. I brought it home and opened it up to find my first problem, it has three disks and takes 
 up a monstrous amount of space! I have never had a game that tried my computer so much before. 
 My second problem is the crappy overhead graphics that make me wonder why so much space is needed. 
 I will admit that creating the buildings and making a great lot is fun at first, but the weak changes 
 in what you get from the buildings is not fun at all. The little sim characters are horribly needy 
 and never seem to be able to do much of anything themselves. The number one problem for me, though, 
 is the lack in openness when making the movies. I could not really direct my actors, but only choose 
 from options of scenes and change of the clothes and the background. And it doesn't matter how 
 good or bad your movie really is anyway, because that has no effect on your rating. I wanted to 
 be Scorcese, yet I got higher ratings for crap that the sim writers came up with or making drivel 
 that lasted longer. I am sorry that I picked up the game (even at 19.99) and would sell it in a 
 heart beat now that I have experienced how bad it is.

Review:  I typically consider tycoon games a waste of time, but since i found Lionhead Studios' Black & 
 White fairly entertaining I decided to try this one. The Movies was entertaining, but it does have 
 some problems mostly with limitations.
  
  The Movies is essentially two products in one. The first product is the tycoon portion of the game 
 where you are the head of a movie studio, and your goal is to become the best of the best by managing 
 your directors, actors, and hiring new crew, janitors, extras, script writers, etc. You also have 
 to manage your studio of course, by placing new sets and other features on your studio lot. Dealing 
 with your actors and directors is a lot like playing The Sims, as they have needs that they expect 
 to be met. Unfortunately they tend to let their personal needs get in the way when you're shooting 
 films, and you often have to drop them at the local bar, or restaurant to lower their stress. This 
 can really drag a movie's shooting on as the actors\directors whine between scenes and just leave 
 the set if they're not getting their way, you can force them to complete a scene but it doesn't 
 come out as well and this brings your score down. I wouldn't have a problem with this micromanaging 
 if there was any logic behind it, but I suppose it wouldn't be very challenging if the actors pretended 
 to be in a good mood for the entire shooting of a film. I found this part of the game to be fairly 
 tedious, however.
  
  The second product of The Movies is the hyped movie making tool. The movie making tool is good 
 enough to pass off as satisfactory, but it's extremely limited. You have to choose from a selection 
 of pre-designed scenes for every set, and you have to place actors, extras, etc, on pre-placed 
 mannequins who are performing specific actions. You also can't decide where the camera is placed, 
 which is a lot bigger of a problem than some might think for this hampers creativity. Personally, 
 I found the movie making tool to be too limited to be fun to tinker with, but I've seen many enjoy 
 it, so...
  
  The graphics are as good as they need to be. The tycoon portion of the game is a typical isometric 
 perspective allowing you to survey the studio lot. The movie maker and movie player are of course 
 more "down to earth" allowing you to effectively design your dream film (*cough*) , and view it.
 
  
  The audio is satisfactory. The voices can be irritating since in-movie voices are pre-recorded 
 gibberish and the actors repeat the same line over and over. Fortunately the other bits of voice 
 acting are in English, and are superb. I found the radio personalities that occasionally pop up 
 over the course of the game (depending on the era) to be fairly entertaining, and well acted. The 
 music is so-so, some of it is good, some of it is bad, but none of it is truly spectacular, or 
 truly awful.
  
  I liked The Movies. It's an addictive tycoon game, despite the simplified movie maker product that 
 was bundled with the game. Could it have been better? Yes, a more powerful movie maker could have 
 been possible, or at least a larger variety of scenes to choose from. Fortunately the game comes 
 with a large variety of sets, costumes, etc. making the game offer enough variety. This title is 
 a great addition to any tycoon game fan's collection but Movie designers be warned: You have to 
 earn the Custom Script Writing Office in the full game before you can design your own films in 
 that portion, or the sandbox mode.

Review:  This is the only good game that succeded to be the ultimate movie studio sim. The graphics are 
 OK, but not great. The zoom level is nice,&amp; there are some good-quality textures. Unfortunatelly, the 
 sound is not very great, the music is acceptable, but the voice acting is horrible, in an unknown 
 language like in Sims,&amp; some sound effects are bad (shotgun sounds like when someone opens a 
 beer can) . But the gameplay is a masterpiece. Build on your lot staff buildings, research labs (to 
 research cloathes, technology, etc) , actor trailers, restaurants, bars &amp; a lot of scenes. Wild West, War, Cemetery, City, 
  Ship, everything! Film scenarios or make youreself 
 new ones, putting all your crazy ideas into it. The actors have needs, like in the Sims. The game 
 starts in the early '20-s till future... Earn prizes &amp; battle with the other studios for actors 
 &amp; scripts. A cool game, that will attract you for days, weeks into it! Play &amp; Watch!

Review:  The movies is a very good game, no not very good: AWSOME is the real name, i love making movies 
 and such... it is so good, you get creative, you know? It is, in my opinion, the second best PC 
 game ever (next to The Sims 2) the graphics are just so good your eyes basicly bleed when you see 
 it the first time (believe me i still have to pay the medical bill) and the sound is just origanal 
 and the voice acting is good. The humor via the radio is as funny as crap, and the easiness of 
 making a studio, making movies, stars, money is just so put together it makes this game so GREAT. 
 The game can get HARD when you must do the award mission stuff and i've only gotten to the second 
 to last set because the last set wants you to be 100% perfect and how is that possible? But whatever, 
 this is a great game.

Review:  Like many other sim and tycoon games, the Movies does the best job, combining the two into this 
 incredibly fun and imaginative game.
  
  The campaign game is still and open-ended game but has to challenge you with cleaning up in the 
 award shows but if you just want to make movies and not have your actors **** at you for not having 
 a trailer big enough to fit their ego, then you can just go into sandbox mode, TURN OFF their whiny 
 moods, and get a heck of alot of cash and just go out and make stuff. and thenn put it on youtube 
 and see how many people like it! so far my 5 films have totaled up to about 1200 hits in 3 months, 
 pretty good. So I would recommend this to anyone who like watching/making movies and for a good 
 casual game.

Review:  The Movies, designed by Peter Molineux is one of the best PC`s video game ever!
  The game shows a big influence of the other big game of the kind Sims.
  But I even prefer The 
 Movies to the Sims, because I love see the movies and this game is just out of the human world.
 
  It&acute; s funny and original, taking us into a world of savage competion.
  Then you got the awards. Make the masterpieces of the century and win the awards.
  Actors, Sets, 
 Crew, Director, Scriptwritter, it`s all there!!!
  It`s a game beyond your imagination!
  Show Time for the big screen...

Review:  Your a movie company owner in 1927. You start out with a lot ond some cash and work your way up 
 from there. The beginning of the game is bad, with little too do, lots of nagging from a simulated 
 helper. Your movies are garbage and you get one star reviews.
  
  But then your naggy helper shuts up andgives you the wheel. You set up the script, choose the cast 
 and film the movie. You can build sets, from deserts to alien worlds. Every now and then theres 
 an awards ceramony, and you win awards for various things. The ceramonies are a pain, but they 
 dont really effect the gameplay much.
  
  You play the game from 1927 and keep on going and going. THis game has +20 hours of gameplay and 
 is great. WOrth the buy.
  
  My personal favorites I made:
  The attacking monkeys!
  The attacking monkeys! 2
  The attacking monkeys! 3
  the attacking monkeys! 4

Review:  The Movies is an interesting game. I'm sure many people have been hoping for a movie related game, 
 many shareware based games confirm this. So Lionhead have developed a great movie sim, but like 
 a lot of simulation based games it can get bogged down a little with micromanagement, especially 
 with the stars that you employ.
  
  You start the game with a small amount of money, a plot of land and a beginner script. From here 
 you need to do the rest, build the lot, hire staff, make films and repeat. All well and good, but 
 you'll find that your studio's success is limited until you unlock the custom scriptwriting office. 
 Once unlocked, the full potential of the game is realized. Personally I think that the custom office 
 should have been available from the start, but it's a minor quibble. The custom studio allows you 
 to make you own personal creation down the the finest degree and with the addition of the expansion 
 pack even more so. The Movies is a deep, interesting, intelligent and compelling game that requires 
 your utmost attention, if you go into this for a casual game play experience, you won't like it 
 at all. Which is probably why it hasn't done so well sales wise. All most gamers want these days 
 is a brainless frag fest.
  
  Peter Molyneux has again created a classic sim game. This one stands right up there with his other 
 titles, Syndicate, Theme Park &amp; Theme Hospital. Excellent.

Review:  The Movie is a great game with a lot of options, I like this game because you tell the star where 
 to go and making the movie is of course the best part, I always play on freestyle so I can make 
 movies right from the get go, you can also make your own star and even put yourself in the movies 
 if you want you can even make up funny names and put them in movies.
  
  I think the funniest thing you can do in this game is change your stars wardrobe.
  
  The best 
 part about the freestyle is you can build the Studio the way you want to.

Review:  I really anticipated this game because it was developed by Lionhead Studios owned by none other 
 than Peter Molyneux. The first time I launched the game, it welcomed me with a tutorial that really 
 helped. Of course you have the option to turn it off if you think you could handle it on your own. 
 Anyways, I really like going through tutorials so that I would have the basic concepts of the game. 
 It's really essential in simulation games because it would help you get started. After playing 
 for an hour I already have a good grasp of the controls.
  
  You get to customize your studio, hire actors, crews, extras, etc. It was really fun to create 
 your own scripts for a movie. I even tried recreating some favorite scenes from Hollywood movies 
 although it was very time consuming. I liked the fact that time has an impact because the years 
 will go by and your actors get old as well. Overall, it's a very good game and if you really like 
 simulation games, this is for you. Might as well buy the expansion pack if you really like extra 
 stunt men and other objects they have included.

Review:  This is not a comprehensive review, more a tale of my experiences with the game. When I bought 
 it, I even said to myself the specs are low here of a game this age its not an FPS, I suppose. 
 For the record it says 800 MHz on the box. My 2.8 GHz should have coped easily. Alas it was not 
 to be. The first few hours were ok. My fav feature was the yelp characters gave when you picked 
 them up. But as my studio got bigger and busier, the game started to slug. And chug. And stammer. 
 Load times were bearable, but only just. I finished out my studio, but uninstalled when something 
 better came along (which has higher printed specs and smoother running, I might, nay must, add) . 
 The specs are a total and utter lie. Remember this.

Review:  I really wanted to check out this game and see what it was like i thought the game would involve 
 making movies but it doesnt. While the movie is shooting all you can do is change a little of the 
 scene and the background. The game is pretty much like the sims but sims is way better, heres what 
 you do first you start in silent movies which isnt too good first one been a comedy picking up 
 a dumbbell where they cannot pick it up which isnt funny at all its boring. 2nd was a western love 
 story or something its alright and so on it goes but it does get better in time. You will need 
 to hire extras, people who will have the star role, director, backstage people etc. All together 
 the game is pretty good movies you make can be uploaded to the net at lionhead. com. I only got 
 it for &pound;1.49 anyway at WH Smiths shop in the UK cheap and its worth it shocking price.

Review:  The Movies includes some of the best simulator strategy I've ever seen, with make-your-own-movie 
 script writing and editing. The story mode is unique, as well.
  
  One of the best features of the game by far is its replay value. Even after you complete the story 
 mode, you can play a Sandbox file, giving you many more possibilities that can make movie production 
 a lot easier. The custom script writing tool probably stands out the most, allowing you to create 
 your own characters, costumes, and plotline in a snap. To date I have made more than 6 hours worth 
 of custom movies, and am still making some today.
  
  The Movies, although not good sales, is probably the most underappreciated game out in stores today, 
 and needs some recognition. I strongly believe it's worth the 40 dollars to get it, even the 70 
 dollars to get it and the expansion pack.
  
  Even without the expansion pack, It has a great online community in which you can post your movies 
 on the official website for viewers to watch and review.

Review:  Have you ever dreamed of creating your own blockbuster movies? With The Movies, you can do just 
 that. In The Movies, you get the chance to build your own movie studio, write your own scripts, 
 hire actors and more. With money and wage issues, can you create a succesful movie?
  
  The Movies lets you play in one of two modes. The first is a career mode, where you are in charge 
 of an empty movie studio. You start off in the year 1920, when movies were black and white and 
 had terrible sound. As you progress through the game, you find yourself able to create more advanced 
 movies, with colour and sound. Can your studio be the most succesful?
  
  If you don't like the career mode, you can instead play the sandbox mode. In sandbox mode, you 
 have the chance to play how you want, with no limits or restrictions. Any movies you create can 
 be uploaded to the The Movies website, or anywhere else on the Internet.
  
  The game features many advanced options for creating your movie, including voiceovers, lip-synching, 
 loads of sets and the ability to customize the look of your actors and staff. If you're able to 
 write your own scripts, you have the script writing office, and if you're stuck for ideas, you 
 can hire script writers to write the scripts for you.
  
  The graphics are impressive in The Movies. They're not perfect, but they're still clear and you're 
 movies will still look good. The graphics are definately no reason to stay away from The Movies. 
 If you've played other games of the type, you'll be quite impressed. The graphics are still fine 
 for your movies, and there are no problems with the camera.
  
  The sound is great in The Movies. One of the nicest sound features is the radio station, which 
 tells you news about the latest movies. The voice work is quite clear, but you need a good microphone, 
 otherwise it sounds bad.
  
  The Movies is a good game to buy if you're looking to make your own movies to share on the Internet. 
 You can upload any movies you make to the official The Movies website, or even here on GameSpot. 
 And with a huge range of features to be used, you'll be creating impressive Hollywood movies in 
 no time at all!

Review:  GAMEPLAY:
  Strong gameplay, very easy but can take a while to get used to but once your done and ready, you'll 
 be the best studio or movie maker around. A problem in gameplay is you might have staff shortages 
 but it really isn't a big deal. The effects and movie tools are great and easy to use and play 
 around with.
  
  GRAPHICS:
  The people and sets look great, as well as the props that you can place all around your studio. 
 Great graphics overall.
  
  SOUND:
  The DJ can make you laugh sometimes and its fun to add sound effects in your movies and you can 
 play your own music and hear it on the radio
  
  VALUE:
  Make any kind of movie you want

Review:  When I first bought this game, I must confess that I was a little disappointed. I was hoping for 
 a challenge, and back then, I didn't think I would get it. How wrong I was. A day or two ago, I 
 loaded The Movies back on to my PC, and started playing. After the first movie awards (held in 
 the game in 1925) I realised that I had been playing this game all wrong. Instead of acheiving 
 the goals set out in each certificate, I was just making movies, hiring staff and actors, all to 
 reach that 5 star, number 1 movie studio and to produce a 5 star movie. To do that, I realised 
 I would have to do my utmost to reach the goals set out in each certificate. So the graphics aren't 
 that great, and some of the radio announcers can be downright irritating at times. but the gameplay 
 is challenging. To reach that final goal, the very last certificate, the Holy Grail of the Lionead 
 Motion Picture Academy, you're going to have to pull out all stops. Just having the best script 
 won't cut it. You have to have the best stars, cutting edge technology, new and interesting sets. 
 You also have to keep your stars happy. or else they could find employment elsewhere. Winning awards 
 will also help you to reach that goal of Top Dog in the inudstry. No one said running a movie studio 
 was easy, but as they say, you reap what you sew. So get out there, write the scripts, win awards, 
 and keep your lot looking pretty. And eventually, you will get that 5 star, number 1 movie studio 
 you have always dreamed of.

Review:  From the guys that brought you fable comes The movie a tycoon game based on creating your own movie 
 studios and well making movies ! Although they may feel like mini shows . The movies is unique 
 as it is original . It does alot of things right, but does more things wrong than right .
  
  It will start off by giving you a tutorial on how to play the game which truly does help you 
 learn the basics of the game, and will keep showing you until you get the hang of things .
  If you choose to start the main game mode, you will start off by choosing your cast, director, 
 script writer and so on to get things rolling for you . After that well you make your first movie, 
 and your journey begins as your try to to become the best studio around .
  
  Well the journey isn't easy, well atleast later . At first the game is easy as you will be able 
 to advance through the ranks rather quickly aswel as keep your current rank steadily . You can 
 gain points to your rank by having tons of grass, or keeping your cast happy which trust me is 
 fustrating, aswell as have the set clean . Once you get to atleast 1960 in the game the game gets 
 way to hard, and after 1980 it's just way hard to atleast keep yourself in the top 5 ranks . It's 
 difficulty really brings the whole aspect of the game down, especially since it focuses on the 
 tycoon part, and not the movies .
  
  Movies will do bad if your crew isn't experienced, or the stars aren't happy and such which is 
 totally unrealistic to real life . Not that a game is supposed to be like real life, however it 
 just increases the difficultly of the game and makes the game hard to enjoy . It's not to say the 
 movie portions of the game aren't well done . It's an easy tool, and you will have fun making your 
 mini movies although you will soon realize that making a great movie like real life will take you 
 days if not months to do . Just do what everyone does and make a short film as in 2-5 minutes that 
 always helps .
  
  The movies doesn't look bad infact great for a strategie type game, although the characters don't 
 particularly are high detailed . The textures in the game are good, especially the water effects, 
 and the presentation is well done . The audio in this game is up to you . You have to put voice 
 acting in the movies so there we go . But the the music choices of classical scores is superb, 
 and will lighten up the mood if your somewhat furstrated .
  
  Overall : It's innovative, original, and something refreshing from what is out in the market . 
 It could have been excecuted alot better, as being able to add more content to your movies, or 
 atleast a free room of your movies instead of picked senarios . There is a big departure in the 
 game from the movie creating, seeing as how it focuses on the the tycoon, but hey it's still worth 
 playing . Just don't expect to make the next Lord of the rings movie ..

Review:  I purchased this game hoping to make loads of wonderful, lovely films, but the film creation system 
 is boring and slow. It's almost as if the designers of this game did not want to really allow people 
 to have fun creating their own movies, and were just pretending to permit fun and simple creation 
 to boost sales.
  
  I do not trust Molyneux any more than I trust any game designer presently. Moly is so very likely 
 to promise the moon and stars but deliver a water-logged photo of a showerhead. And there is no 
 marriage in Molyneux, no honeymoon, no family of joy. There is only his wallet.
  
  Remember, kids, if you ever meet a game designer from a major studio of the early twentifirst century, 
 execute him with a micro-laser for me. Enslave him and send him to Martian skyscraper fossil mines.. 
 Do something unpleasant to him, anything! Just do not let that person ever have a job that involves 
 quality of craftsmanship, especially if they've worked for any game design company besides Elixir.

Review:  With tons of tycoon games being released lately, the question of whether we need yet another came 
 to mind when Lionhead Studios announced The Movies, where players must build and maintain a movie 
 studio while making their own films. Although a tycoon game has never been made where a movie studio 
 is run, many were still skeptical as to whether the legendary Peter Molyneux could pull it off 
 successfullybut their fears were misplaced, as it seems Molyneux has hit the gaming jackpot twice 
 this year; once with Black and White 2 and now with The Movies.
  
  The Movies opens in the 1920s and players receive a large empty studio lot and $150,000 to start 
 them off. The first thing players must do is hire some staff for the Staff Office, and get some 
 builders for their lot. From here on, players can build almost anything that comes to mind with 
 regard to the words movie studio, from Casting and Production Offices, to various Sets to shoot 
 movies on. After players build a Scriptwriting Office and hire a scriptwriter or two, the scriptwriters 
 can be put to work on writing a Comedy, Horror, Romance, Sci-Fi or Action movie. Once a script 
 is finished, the cast of the movie must then be chosen at the Casting Office, and then the gathered 
 crew can start rehearsing the script, after which the movie begins shooting.
  
  Like any tycoon game, The Movies is based on a drag-and-drop principle, where buildings and other 
 items have to be placed on the lot strategically because your lots attractiveness counts. Players 
 studios get a rating based on their capital, lot attractiveness, hired movie stars, and quality 
 of their resulting productions. At the beginning of the game there are 5 competing studios but, 
 as the game progresses, more rival studios open to make the players life even more difficult. 
 When movies are being made, a temporary ratingout of a maximum 5 starsis given to the script. 
 Each star has 5 segments for a single rating, so ratings are subsequently incrementally increased 
 with a one-fifth minimum. When the actors are finished rehearsing the script, a second temporary 
 rating is given to the movie, based on the actors starring in the movie and the first rating together. 
 When the movie is done shooting, it then moves to the Production Office where the movie can be 
 released and a final rating is given to it based on various elements such as script novelty, actor 
 experience, and even crew experience. Players can view the movie from this screen and read some 
 short media reviews to better help them improve their following productions. The quality of the 
 movies also depends on what mood the actors are in, how experienced the crew is, whether the director 
 gets along with the actors, and other small factors. Actors and directors can also grow stressed 
 during the job, which results in them seeking comfort through drinking or eating. If players dont 
 pay enough attention to the eating and drinking habits of the actors and directors, an addiction 
 can form and trips to a rehab center become necessary. Its great to see that the progressive mood 
 of the cast and crew has been thought through in such great detail.
  
  As players progress through The Movies timeline and get closer to the present day, new technologies 
 become available. Production Offices become available for adding subtitles, soundtracks, and voiceovers 
 to your movies. As time passes, better Scriptwriting Offices also become available for purchase 
 as well, so stronger scripts can be written, which in turn results in movies with better ratings. 
 New technologies can also be researched in the Lab, so that, over time, players can make full-color 
 movies with higher quality features.
  
  After some time, a Custom Scriptwriting Office becomes available, where players can write their 
 own scripts based on standard shots and actions. At first glance, this feature seems a little shallow, 
 but its surprisingly deep. Players can make sophisticated movies with the Custom Scriptwriting 
 feature, but must be careful that the movie isnt too long for the current cast or they will get 
 fed up and wander the lot during shooting. The custom scriptwriter is basically a drag-and-drop 
 timeline for preset scenes, and they are automatically linked to each other. This is not where 
 the custom scriptwriter ends though; if players want to gain total control of the movie they can 
 change details such as lighting, backdrops, and camera angles. Though this may not appeal to all 
 players of The Movies, its an extremely decent feature that gives players considerable control 
 over their masterpiece in the making.
  
  In the Sandbox mode players can create movies without having to worry about competing with other 
 studios and maintaining a good studio rating. This mode seems to be in place for people to just 
 express their creativity and produce great movies, after which they can export the movie to common 
 video formats, or even upload the movie for others players to see and judge. Publisher Activision 
 has already announced upcoming award shows for productions made within The Movies, where players 
 can win actual real-life prizes.
  
  Graphically, The Movies is reminiscent of EAs popular series, The Sims. The models are realistic 
 and, when viewed up close, everything looks extremely strong. But the real stunner here is that 
 the games zoom function can be used to go from up-close to birds-eye in one swift motionwithout 
 any loading whatsoever. This is particularly interesting when players want to watch a scene that 
 is being shot, without having to lose the ability to manage the studio properly. The movies made 
 by players as they progress through time vary from grainy 1920s black and white productions to 
 beautiful full-color epics.
  
  The music in The Movies also evolves depending on which chronological era the player is in; the 
 disc jockey on the accompanying radio station playing over general gameplay also duly changes, 
 which is a solid addition. The music varies from big band to funk, and this seems to keep the music 
 from becoming monotonous. After sound is added to movies, the acting dialog plays in character 
 gibberish, comparable to The Sims language. Sound effects are true to the Hollywood style, and 
 directors will yell Action! and Cut! Thats a wrap! during shooting to notify the player of 
 the progress made.
  
  The Movies is a truly amazing game and Lionhead Studios deserve a lot of praise for it. There is 
 no other game like it on the market, which proves that Peter Molyneux never ceases in his ceaseless 
 search for innovation. Running your own studio can certainly consume a lot of time, but everything 
 remains fun and rewarding throughout, especially when your movie becomes a box-office hit.

Review:  ... if you want to keep your life outside the PC!
  
  This game is simply fantastic. Lionhead have once again taken a difficult concept and tranformed 
 it into a simple, easy and entertaining idea. The Advanced Movie Making tool gives you hundreds 
 of scenes to choose from to mould your movies. A variety of sets and challenges means that almost 
 anything is possible. Truely this is a dream factory and you'll wonder where the day has gone!
 
  
  The graphics aren't bad but they aren't perfect. You wont complain and you might think they're 
 actually quite good but compare them to some next-gen graphics and they come short. Also the sound 
 is rather simple. For films there are a selection of sounds, music and effects to choose from but 
 speech and the like is down to the user. Fair enough. But this game isn't about sound or graphics. 
 They're good anyway. It's the gameplay that will addict you and surely that is the most important 
 factor.
  
  You can work as a studio manager ensuring your stars are happy, your lot is prestine and your writers 
 are writing or you can create the movie of your dreams! Choose from 5 genres: Action, Comedy, Horror, 
 Sci-Fi and Romance and start selecting your cast! Often you'll find your mixing it up. You'll have 
 to manage your lot and staff but movie making is optional. Either way you'll love to play this!
 
  
  People looking for more open-ended gameplay should buy this. You do challenge for awards although 
 these goals certainly wont push you into game over. Theres a sandbox mode where you can simply 
 make the movie (s) of your dreams or play with no rules but the thrill of beating your competitors 
 is paramount!

Review:  I just fell in love with it! I'm surprised to see how many sites are there (user created) of the 
 Movies! How many mods are there, I'm not a modder (but if someone can email a tutorial on how to be 
 a modder (how to make props, sets, costumes, moving overlays and custom music for Stunts and effects) , I 
 would aprecciate it, my email is rulichster@gmail. com or rulich@mweb. co. za.
  
  The graphics of this game is cool, the number of props is amazing, the sets are fantastic, the game 
 comes also with a starmaker, where you can make youre own star. In the game is there also a timeline 
 wich will show world events, eg: If you are in 2001 they will talk about Saddam who denies that his 
 counttry has weapons (the events have been changed into funny events, for the humor) The goal is to 
 create movies, there are five genre's to choose  and comedy, but 
 those are just the main genre's, there are also sub-genre's (like drama) , no matter what genre you 
 choose, you can always choose scenes. For instance: You can make a Dramatic War Drama or an Hilarious 
 Romantic Comedy, your choice. If you have an internet connection and registered to the site (the adress 
 will be included in the manual I think, after you install the movies, they will ask you if you want 
 to register, so it's very easy. To upload a movie, you must first make it, study it, shoot it, then go 
 to the post production (if you are in the right year ) and from there you can edit youre movie, there 
 will be an option where you can upload youre movie.
  
  I recommend: !!!!!! BUY !!! IT !!!!!!

Review:  This game is just fine, you won't be disappointed, you'll be able to make your own movies step to 
 step with already pre-made scenes using your fully customizable actors and actresses. You can even 
 add extra and choose the director of your movie.
  
  Gameplay:
  
  Just right, you'll have many things to do in it, many things to set up... it's a great game if you 
 like games of the sims style. You'll be able to choose the people that take care of your studio, your 
 crew, actors and actresses, directors and most of the things. You can even make some implants, nip 
 tucks and create beautiful trailers with yards for your great stars to live in.
  
  Graphics:
  
  Well done graphics, we should be able to add some blood effects on the movies but 
 if there were something like that, the game would be rated for even older persons. You can see everyone's 
 emotions, cool cars and many scenarios to choose from such as a battlefield.
  
  Sounds:
  
  Yeah good sounds, there's a radio for the game which is pretty good and you can even add your 
 own musics and voice acting to your masterpieces which is a great feature!
  
  Value:
  
  Good value, but after sometime it gets really boring and you'll probally uninstall it from the PC 
 wanting to buy something new.
  
  Concluding:
  
  It's a innovative game in it's own way, really unique and worth the time. It won't be disappointing 
 as long as you keep playing, but after sometime trust me, it really gets boring. But it's a great 
 game indeed.

Review:  The Movies is a PC simulation game created by Lionhead Studios for Microsoft Windows and subsequently 
 ported to Apple Mac OS X by Feral Interactive. It was released on November 8, 2005 in the United 
 States of America, and November 11, 2005 in Europe after reaching gold status on October 8, 2005. 
 In The Movies, players take the role of a Hollywood film mogul, running a studio and creating films. 
 Much has been made about the film-making aspect of the game, as it allows players to easily create 
 viewable works or machinima. The game is similar to the early 1990s film production game Stunt 
 Island; the game is also similar to the 1988 game Charlie Chaplin, the 1996 game Steven Spielberg's 
 Director's Chair and, to a lesser extent, the 1996 game 3D Movie Maker.
  In October 2006, the Macintosh version by Feral Interactive won a Bafta for the best simulation 
 game of 2006 at the Bafta games awards. The Macintosh version added a number of additional features 
 which aren't available in the original PC release. The game was also nominated in the soundtrack 
 category although it did not win.
  In The Movies, players get the chance to run their own movie studio. The game can be divided into 
 three main areas  designing the movie studio, forging the careers of movie stars, and making movies. 
 It is possible to focus on any of those areas that appeal most, and spend less time on the others.
 
  The game plays through from the birth of cinema to the present day and into the near future, with 
 all the technology and historical advances that occur along that timeline. After the movies have 
 been made, they can be played back for the viewer to watch. It is possible once the movie is made 
 to add voice, text and music in post-production. The movies can then be exported and shared or 
 uploaded to a website (The Movies Online) for anyone who wishes to watch them.
  The two most important types of staff in the game are actors and directors, referred to as stars 
 in the game. In order to keep stars in a positive mood the player will need to give them a salary 
 the stars deem satisfactory (relative to their success) , an image the stars deem decent, a trailer 
 of good quality, and a large entourage. Stars can also get stressed or bored, depending on how 
 many movies the player puts them in. Each star has different thresholds regarding when they will 
 get stressed or bored. If stars get stressed, they will resort to alcoholism or over-eating.
  Other staff include extra (which can be promoted to Star status if they are good enough) , janitors, 
 scientists, scriptwriters, and crew members.
  The studio lot is where sets and buildings are built. In order to increase the 'prestige' of the 
 studio lot, the studio must be neat, free of litter, well laid out and with areas of grass, trees 
 and decoration. Buildings must also be linked together by paths. Buildings and sets also decay, 
 thus decreasing the quality of movies that they appear in. They will eventually become unusable 
 if they do not receive maintenance or repair by your staff.
  The first four rival studios your studio will compete against are the following: * Maxipack Worldwide 
 * Lionear Productions (a spoof of Lionhead Studios) * Creamboat Creations * Old Rope Cinema (a 
 spoof of the Time Warner-owned New Line Cinema)
  
  Later in the game these five studios open: * Rigormortis Movies * Gusset Entertainment * Cletus' 
 Shotgun Cinema * Boney Studios (a spoof of Sony Pictures Entertainment) * Booboo &amp; Dingo Films
 
  There is no limit on movie length. The average movie length is between 30 seconds and 3 minutes, 
 but user created films can be as long as budget will allow (although a 10 minute film might require 
 over 20 game years of filming) .
  Once the actors, extras, director and crew are assigned to a film, production begins, with the 
 entire staff of the film travelling between sets to film the movie.
  The sandbox mode allows films to be created without undergoing the lengthy production process, 
 and with budgets of over $100 million.
  Players are able to pick a script provided by the studio's writers or write their own. Provided 
 scripts take longer to write in game time, while user-written scripts take longer to write in real 
 time.
  
  For prewritten scripts, the player hires a writer at the Scriptwriting Office to make one. The 
 player initially begins with the Basic Scriptwriting Office, in which six script writers can work 
 together on a single script. This office is limited to creating one star scripts. The first upgrade, 
 the Intermediate Scriptwriting Office, comes in a basic pack, after the first awards ceremony. 
 This building has a maximum of a two star script. The second upgrade, the Proficient Scriptwriting 
 Office, is won by meeting the criteria for an award. It can employ six scriptwriters like before, 
 but each writer can now work on his/her own script (effectively allowing for 6 scripts be written 
 simultaneously) . This building creates complex scripts usually nine scenes long, and is limited 
 to a maximum of a three star script and the fourth upgrade a First class scriptwriting office and 
 the maximum of four star rating and can have his/her own script like a proficient Scriptwriting 
 Office.
  The ability to write one's own script is enabled after unlocking the Custom Scriptwriting Office, 
 also unlocked from winning an award. It is limited to what highest scripting office can produce 
 (if the player has the Proficient Scriptwriting office, he/she is limited to a three star movie) . 
 Writing a custom script follows a storyboard-like suite. For each scene, the player chooses a set 
 for the scene and then the action that will occur during the scene (for example: 'Living Room 1: 
 Enter Scared') . The actors and their costumes can be chosen, extras assigned roles and mood, lighting 
 and weather settings altered.
  Once production has finished, the film undergoes post production (provided a Post Production Building 
 has been erected) , where music, sound effects, subtitles, speech and titles can be added to the 
 movie. Cuts and changes can also be made to the length and order of the scenes, making editing 
 the film easier.
  The game allows for lip-synching, matching the speech to the actors. However, this only works for 
 short sound files, and only shows basic lip movements.
  Sets are the constructions in the studio lot where the cast and crew assemble to shoot movies. 
 The sets are divided into categories such as urban, western and rural. Different scenes have different 
 actions available (a bar might feature many drinking related actions, while a street would feature 
 various car actions) .
  Sets can be used to practice movies and increase genre experience. For example, an actor practicing 
 on the set of a spaceship will increase his/her science fiction proficiency, leading to better 
 sci-fi movies he/she is cast in.
  The Movies: Stunts &amp; Effects is the first expansion pack for The Movies, it adds stunts, stunt 
 men, new sets and costumes to the game. It also now includes a 'free-cam'; giving total control 
 over the camera position and movement (previously the camera was fixed in the scene presets) . The 
 game was released in June 2006.
  
  New Features Include * 58 New Costumes * 15 New sets * Countless new props and backdrops * New 
 features in advanced movie maker, for example a free-roaming camera * Perhaps the biggest new feature 
 to the game is being able to hire your own stuntmen. With new stunts that your stars are unable 
 to attempt, you will need to hire a stuntman in order safely complete that action.

Review:  The concept behind this game -- make your own movies -- is brilliant. And fortunately, there is enough 
 material that comes with the game to make a wide variety of productions. The tools available in 
 the sandbox mode of the game are fairly simple to use and allow for a lot of creative expression. 
 The story mode of the game, while interesting for a few hours, is actually the weak link. But I 
 assume that the average person will buy this game for the movie-making ability, so the story mode's 
 limitations are fairly easy to look over. Gameplay: There are two gameplay modes: story mode and 
 sandbox. The story mode starts you off in the 1920s as an up-and-coming studio manager. You are 
 responsible for building up your studio lot with various buildings, sets, decorations, pathways, 
 and so forth. Also, you have to staff the studio with builders, janitors, crew members, researchers, 
 directors, and, of course, actors. This has to be done on a budget, so you'll have to manage your 
 money wisely. The overall goal is to produce films that gain experience for your actors and directors, 
 get good ratings, and receive awards (which are given out every 5 years) . As you manage your studio 
 over time, new costumes, sets, and props become available allowing for a greater diversity of artistic 
 creations. Overall, the story mode serves as a very long tutorial for the sandbox mode. Some people 
 will be put off by the tedious nature of the story-mode gameplay. Much of your time will be spend 
 on micromanaging actors' attitudes, repairing buildings, hunting for new recruits, and the like. 
 After about 3 hours, it really can get mentally numbing. However, the developers of the game made 
 playing the story mode necessary, since you can only have access to certain props, sets, and costumes 
 in the sandbox by playing through the story mode. Thus, expect to play through 20 hours of the 
 story mode before unlocking all of the sets and other things. The sandbox is really where the game 
 shines. This is where you can make your own movies. Rather surprisingly, the process is quite straightforward. 
 The tutorials and in-game instructions are very good, and there are tons of scenes, props, costumes, 
 and other times. A very nice element of the game is the star-maker program, which allows you to 
 model the face and appearance your actors. Movies can be as simple (and rough) as you want or as 
 sophisticated (and time-consuming) as you desire. In essence, you create a movie by stringing together 
 pre-set scenes which you can change in a number of ways, including length, intensity, lighting, 
 weather, subtitles, actor positions and expressions, and so forth. You can even add voices and 
 music if you'd like. There are some limitations. For example, you don't have full control over 
 camera angles, and you can't determine precisely where an actor will be in a scene (you have a 
 few pre-set options) . Still, there is an incredible amount of potential in the tools and material 
 that you do have available. To get a sense of the possibilities, take a look at some of the 4- 
 and 5-star movies at www. themoviesgame. com. Grapics: The visuals are good overall. The actors do 
 have a somewhat cartoonish quality about them and can seem awkward on occasion. Still, there's 
 nothing quite like seeing an actor, whom you just spent a half hour creating in the star-maker 
 program, walk into a scene. It's really a magical gaming moment. The sets look pretty good, as 
 well as the props. Also, the scenes and technologies seem appropriate to each era of film-making. 
 I wish that the game had a mini-map for your studio lot, so that you could instantly jump to a 
 particular building (instead of having to scroll there) . Also, the lot should have been expandable, 
 since you'll have it covered with buildings in no time. Still, the graphics are good enough to 
 allow for some fairly immersive gameplay. Sound: All of the music is good and appropriate, from 
 the music played during game installation to the in-game tunes. There is some voice acting in the 
 game, but not among the actors themselves. There are a number of sound effects that can be added 
 to movies. Also, you can add your own voices, music, and effects. Replayability/Technical elements: 
 The game has huge replayability. No two people will experience it the same way, at least not in 
 the sandbox mode. You are largely limited by only your imagination. The instruction manual is pretty 
 good, and the in-game tutorials and instructions are great. If you want to jump into the game, 
 you could figure it out fairly quickly. The game seems well polished, even slick in its presentation. 
 It did crash on me once, but only after a 8+ hour session (you can save all of your film work, 
 sets, actors, etc.) . There is a patch available, which I recommend. Overall, I thought that this 
 was a worthwhile purchase. The story mode could have been better, but the sandbox mode easily makes 
 up for it. If you are interested in a game that allows you to direct, cast, and produce a movie, 
 this is it. It's not perfect, but it does generally fulfill its promise. I hope that there is an 
 expansion forthcoming which add more props, costumes, sets, and the like, along with better control 
 of the camera.

Review:  I love playing this game because it allows me to do what i always have dreamed of doing, making 
 movies. Well, yea sure, the movies may not be all that great because you are picking scenes from 
 a list but at least you can find a way to make it work. The game allows you to add in your voice 
 to the movies so you can create you own dialogue for your own movies. It is fun progressing throw 
 the ages back from the silent movie era all the way to the 2000s. If you are a movie buff, this 
 is a definite buy!

Review:  The Movies is a very unique game. It is a great game. It is only meant for certain gamers though.
 
  
  The Good: Being able to create your very own movie and sharing it with the world online. Being 
 graded and releasing it into the Cinemas. Making charecters do what you want them to do.
  
  The Bad: Blood! This game needs blood! Almost every movie you see has to have BLOOD! There is just 
 not enough costumes. Needs to have kid actors not just adult actors for certain parts. Needs more 
 choices to toggle with in certain scenes. This game could have been way better if there were more 
 sets to use for your movies.
  Even if this game has alot of bad stuff to it, it is still a great game. Thus i give The Movies 
 a 9.5 out of 10

Review:  This is a very difficult game to get the hang of, when you're looking after one thing in your movie 
 studio, another thing goes wrong! Keeping stars happy, making quality movies, looking after the 
 studio.. Its very difficult! But it is very detailed and original. It even has its very own radio! 
 The coolest thing about it is that you are in charge of everything. You can make your studios, 
 hire staff, make and edit movies, you can even go to an award ceremony to win awards for most prestigious 
 studio lot etc. Once youve made a movie, you can even put it on the internet for people to watch. 
 Overall I think this is an original, high quality game. By SoloPanda

Review:  Some people may like it, but there is no complete customization of the movie you make. you need 
 to choose from set of actions from the characters, and sometimes it make the scene to do not match. 
 for example, i wanted the guy to leave the house with an axe, but i could find a scene next for 
 a guy leaving the house with the axe. same thing for a corpse or weapon... lot of bug from sounds 
 you try to record and put in movie, and lip sing is bad. The movies are too repetitive because 
 of the low number of scenes. Also its too hard to try to get the actors out of stress and get good 
 reviews. the game get too boring to fast and player will loose interest really quick

Review:  Wow, The Movies was an awesome, AWESOME game.
  Me and my friends just loved making hilarious movies.
  I can't get enough of The Movies, and 
 you should buy it.
  This was a great idea, now if only we could do this with TV shows...
  Hmmmmmm...
  *IDEA*!!!
  Nevermind...
  Well The Movies, it owns!
  It is not perfect though, 
 after awhile it MAY, POSSIBLY bore you like it did to me.
  But than of course 2 hours later you'll be like, Holy crap I WANNA PLAY THE MOVIES GOD DAMMIT! 
 .
  Than you'll be like WTF why'd I buy this crappy game again??? 
  You'll ponder and watch TV, hatch an idea, remember why you bought it and scream ZOMG THE MOVIES 
 HOLY CRAP!!! .
  
  SUM IT UP SENTENCE: The Movies is a game where you make movies, if you like Tycoon games and making 
 movies, YOU ARE SET! ;)

Review:  The Movies is a Lionhead Studios game, or would you call it one, adds some new things many gamers 
 haven't seen in management games. The only reason The Movies is popular is because its under the 
 license of one of the most famous game studios around, Activision. I have to say for myself they've 
 done a very good job with the graphics sonce Tony Hawk's American Wasteland. You basically start 
 off with a ton of cash but all that money has to be given towards your movies and studio lot. Creating 
 your own studio is awesome, and there is a wide and funny variety of people and buildings, rehab 
 included. The Movies is, by far, the best management game ever created.

Review:  At first when i heard they had a game like this, i thought what a stupid idea, i can't believe 
 they even thought of making a game like this. When my friend bought it i thought he was wasting 
 his money, but when I tried it i couldn't believe how good it was. I have never played a game with 
 such good gameplay as The Movies before. You get to do so many things with the actors, script writers, 
 scientists, extras, and much more. I really like how the people that want to work at the studio 
 actually line up to apply, and you get to reject the people you dont want. The sound was pretty 
 good. When you did reject someone, your computer would make a gun shout sound, pretty funny. The 
 radio commentators are good, especially in the beginning, i actually laughed. The graphics were 
 normal. The value perfect, when i bought it it was for 20 dollars, the perfect price.

Review:  I want to make this review snappy cause I don't have much time. Like I said above this is great. 
 You can produce most of what you want with the expansion pack and choose your stars look and everything. 
 I was amazed by it. However, the only thing I dislike about the game is the ability to create a 
 serious movie. Most of this disability is caused by the fact that the game has a very cartoony 
 feel to it, and does not let you tone down color in your final product. Also, the motion capture 
 is very amateur (if any motion capture was used. It looks like someone created the motions through 
 just point-dragging techniques, which you will learn about if you ever take a game or 3d modeling 
 class) . However, the flaw does not bother me that much, as I am not a serious person and like to 
 make comedy movies.
  
  On top of the editing, another huge part of the game is running your own studio. I found it really 
 fun to be able to build and maintain a studio, hire people, make it look pretty, build trailers 
 for stars, put up sets, manage salaries, make people rehearse, watch them film movies, etc. I do 
 not like star misbehavior though, as it makes it extremely difficult to produce custom scripts. 
 I have two save games, one is a sandbox with misbehavior enabled but I only produce those cheap 
 movies that scriptwriters will write for you. The other save game is the one I have misbehavior 
 turned off and I make custom scripts with.
  
  So Its a good game. Buy it.

Review:  The Movies:
  
  What a great games, kinda looks like The Sims.
  But its a little more amusing since you can control the studio.
  So now you are the boss! Control 
 Actors, What movies you make!
  Go backrupt! haha, do what you will to your movies.
  You decided it all!
  
  I recommend It Alot, the learning curve is a little long, but its normal 
 for this type of game. Once you get the hang of it, you dont want to let it go! Kigs, parents, 
 even grandparents would have fun playing this game. enjoy yourself! Youre Now a BOSS! Thats what 
 makes the game fun. You control it all. so get out there, and be famous, and make movies!

Review:  When I saw the game "The Movies", I thought that would be a great movies studio construction simulator, 
 with interesting interaction, management of costs, actors and actresses contracts negotiation . 
 But... You will see that the game is good in no of those articles. You begin the game with a small 
 studio and you need have specialized buildings that will permit you do films. You will be necessary 
 hire actors, actresses, extras, technical personnels, directors, etc. They appear in the door of 
 your studio asking job. You should observe the world events, that are shown in the top in a line 
 of the time, that determine what the persons are going to see in films. A film with the adequate 
 subject for the epoch has more chance of be successful and produce more money.
  You take care of the persons of your studio - some actors has problems with alcohol, or eat too 
 much and can grow fat. You put-them in handling, case the addiction becomes very strong, and you 
 should please the actors with trailers, adequate salaries, periodic vacation, restaurants, etc. 
 The actors are going to practice for improve his performance in specific kinds - action, drama, 
 terror, fiction. The technical personnels (builders, custodians, writers) also have similar needs 
 and you should lend attention in them also. If you take care well of the persons in your studio, 
 that will do with the studio stayed famous, you earn more money, and more actors and directors 
 are going to work for you.
  Specialized Buildings give you better film through better scripts, technology (movies spoken, films 
 in colors, some special effects, etc.) . Multiple sets are guarantee of versatility of your studio, 
 permitting that you do several films at the same time, but you will need have more actors, directors, 
 technical personnels to conduct everything without delaies. If actors are famous, more chances 
 the film should invoice and stayed in the first positions and be appropriate to the prizes of the 
 Academy of Movies.
  You can say: whow, with all those characteristics, the game nevertheless is not so good? Well, 
 the fact is that you do not have big challenges for play "the Movies". There is a tutorial that 
 teaches you to playing and if you be follow the instructions described, you are going to obtain 
 to do a good studio. There is not another way to play and the game stayed linear in that sense. 
 The graphics are reasonable, the soundtrack sometimes irritates, and certainly you will be bored 
 after play for some hours.
  One thing is cool: the film that you will do in the game can be seen afterwards in the Windows 
 Media Player. But it expect not so many ranks of liberty upon doing a film. There are some pre-definite 
 actions, that will be able to tidy in sequence at the set that you indicate and the dialogues are 
 made in language invented. But it is possible do some reasonable film.
  That game is interesting by the proposal that it has, insert the player in the context of a studio 
 of movies, but is weak in what concerns the quality. It is a game for be asked lent for someone 
 that have for see as it is, by curiosity, and afterwards return him. Or download demo and play. 
 It not be worth hardly buy.

Review:  To start this game is great, you really get the feeling of being a Hollywood Bigshot when you see 
 money rolling in from your latest blockbuster. This game has all perspectives of Hollywood life, 
 the making of movies, and even the shooting of said movies. You do EVERYTHING you hire crew, actors, 
 directors, janitors, mechanics, and hire scriptwriters (but most likely you want to write and direct 
 your own script.) There is NO writing in this game so those who hate writing come on come all. 
 Instead of writing you make, edit, and choose the scenes you want 1 by 1. Be ready for a lot of 
 grinding and waiting if you're in for the Single Player mission. The good news is that there is 
 a Sandbox mode which let's you do everything from building to writing and it's all basically free! 
 An even better feature in this game is that you can put your movies online, but... make sure they're 
 good or some annoying 5 year old will come in and rate your movie a 1 star like it deserves.
  
  Omit If You Don't Want Your Hollywood Dreams To Die
  Also DO NOT expect for your movies to 
 be number 1 at least... not your first movie. The only way you're gonna get the Number 1 spot is 
 if you: Make Custom props, backdrops, and clothes and also have a Mic. handy so you can have Lip 
 Sync.
  
  Did I mention that you can customize the game. You can create your own backdrops, sets, props, 
 stars, and clothes, but this obviously will cost you real money if you want something like Photoshop... 
 also you need to be master already or find a tutorial online. There are some guys out there who 
 are probably actual game programmers, and graphic designers and, of course, for them this is as 
 easy as 1, 2, 3. One of the greatest things in this game is the ability to Lip Sync which obviously 
 involves a Mic. which you need to get if you expect good movies. That's right you can take your 
 own voice, record it, and put it into the mouth of your star which looks all right none the less 
 of how you talk. They will basically pick up anything. The fact that they made this game user friendly 
 is great too and what I mean by that is... Post Production is easy you can cut, move, and even 
 delete scenes with an editor that even a monkey could use. You'd have to be pretty bad at computers, 
 but if you are there are tutorials for all the tricks of the trade so don't worry guys who have 
 a life. The even better news is that you can customize your lot say you want sand instead of grass 
 can do! You want a few plants, trees, or entertainment some where can do! Sets, actors, anything 
 is customizable this brings the replay value very high.
  
  Now The Bad And You Knew This Was Coming:
  First of all you cannot put in new scenes when you're 
 in Post Production so if you screwed up a scene, forgot to put one in, or just need another one 
 to tie in the story you better hope you saved it before you started Post Production. Although there 
 is a way to exit out of P. P. to add scenes all of it is gone, and you have to wait another chunk 
 of time waiting for them to finish the movie, instead of being smart and just filming the scenes 
 you do need.
  
  Your stars are constantly needing something whether it be a new trailer, clothes, or just a few 
 thousand dollars in their salary. They can get on your nerves because some times they don't finish 
 a movie like you want them to finish a movie that needs to be done for money, but... they may or 
 may not go depending on their attitude they might get drunk, but you can force them to finish, 
 but that'll make them rant even more. Even with these flaws this game is overall solid and because 
 of it Lionhead Studios should be proud.

Review:  The movies is a solid strategy game. When you first play The Movies, the game is great and there 
 are so many things that you can do. In the beginning of playing this game, this could be a very 
 good strategy game BUT that is just the beginning. Once you start going through the decades a lot 
 of new technology is available. The first time through playing The Movies, it is a great game, 
 but it has very little replay value, unless ur a diehard fan of this game. You run out of many 
 ideas and movies to make and they all start to become very similar looking. Overall, The Movies 
 is a good, one time around game, but that is about it.

Review:  Well, I bought this game thinking... hmmm, you know what, I don't remember what I was thinking or 
 why I even thought I should get this game. I guess I thought that I could actually create my own 
 scenes, not choose from a list of maybe 100 or more scenes. I got really bored so I wasted $40 
 on something I hated the next day. Folks, if you love making movies, but hate wasting your time 
 on actors and extras and directors that tend to have alcohol problems every year, this isn't the 
 game for you. I also hated that the staff shortages were way too frequent, making my movies get 
 delayed until the next year or two. There just weren't enough people for me by the time I hit the 
 '70s. The flaws seemed to be endless, not enough actors or too many janitors, the actors get REAL 
 picky about wanting trailers, food, drinks, relationships, their image, etc. I just stopped playing 
 after that, because I thought it wasn't going to be that hard, I just hated it. The good parts 
 of this game I thought were pretty interesting were: the radio announcers and commentators (sometimes 
 they can make you laugh) , and... well, I think that's it... 
  If you love sim games, go ahead and buy it, but if you're into making movies that actually look 
 real and aren't rip-offs, stay away from this piece of junk.

Review:  The movies is great there's no doubt about it but there are a couple of problems in it like when 
 your making a scene, I think that there's not enough options and your in an area that you can't 
 extend, so if you have so many sets and buildings and it fills the whole place up when the expansion 
 gets released you din't have room to put in new setsand sometimes it can get alot like the sims 
 with all the actors moaning.
  
  One of the great things about the movies is "Sandbox mode" in sandbox mode you can choose thre 
 year you want to start at, you can make this option that actors etc don't moan and you can make 
 all the buildings apear instantly not to mention you can start with 100 million big ones if you 
 want.
  
  Another one of the great things about the movies is post production where you add music and do 
 voiceovers ans subtitles.
  
  Yet another great about the movies is, you'll never guess this one... you get to make movies (duhhhhhhhhhhhhh) . 
 But overall its a great game and I'll give it 8.3 outa 10

Review:  The Movies is one of those rare games that is hard to classify as actually being a game. If not 
 for its studio-control simulation part of the game this would seem as a weird simulation software 
 program. 
  
  The Movies itself borrows its platform and gameplay, from games such as the Tycoon series or other 
 business simulation programs. Building and running operations follows the same line as the previous 
 games but The Movies does deviate from the other tycoon based games by the fact that it is a movie-making 
 game. You take the omnipresent and limited omnipotent hands of the studio owner who controls a 
 beginning fledgeling studio. Pretty much the game's goal is in line with most of the tycoon games: 
 there is no definitive end until you are personally satisfied that you have completed the game. 
 
  
  Your role as studio owner falls into a few categories: such as taking care of stars, hyping movies, 
 and making sure you win awards for different aspects of the game. Each category can become more 
 specific but overall these are the main parts of the game.
  
  Another part of the game that can be overlooked entirely is probably the advancing movie making. 
 This feature allows the player to create movies to some limited specifications. Movie-making, though, 
 in the Movies is a tall order since it's features may be too limiting to some. The Movies does 
 offer the widest range of possibilities for movies that one can think of, but the opinion of movie-making 
 can only fall to the player's ability to conceptualize and put through their movie and their own 
 preferences.
  
  Gameplay is mostly an operation of streamlining and running your studio. Keeping stars in line 
 and making sure they finish their movies on time. However, the gameplay of the Movies can be described 
 as superficial which can most easily describe Tycoon games. There is no substance to the game itself 
 except for the proliferation of money in a simulated money making scheme. This is the problem with 
 most Tycoon games but it's no time to discuss it here. Thankfully for those who find the studio 
 running part of the game superficial, one can use the movie-making part of the game to give their 
 own movies some substance. Don't be fooled, if you don't like one feature of the game it's not 
 a given that you'll like the other. The movie-making feature is hard to work with at times and 
 can soon turn into work if you feel the need to create a decent movie.
  
  And when movie-making it is probably a good idea to get into Movies Online to discover different 
 sets and costumes you can purchase through the game. 
  
  Overall, the gameplay is what makes or breaks this game. The individual player, in this case is 
 the only one that can give a value to the game. The reason being is that the Movies is so varied 
 that its possibilities are endless. 
  
  The graphics of the movies are not head turners and are mostly good attempts at building a believable 
 virtual person. That aspect of the game is accomplished and shown through the game. But it's hard 
 to judge the graphics of a game that wishes to imitate life but at any glance is readily shown 
 as fake. But more or less, the game does provide satisfactory graphics.
  
  The sound is a great part of the game depending on whether you like to listen to music. The orchestrated 
 tracks and synthesized music testify to the time put into creating the movies. They convey moods 
 appropriately and the game offers a decent list for someone to find some thing to use in their 
 movies or to listen to when running the studio. The sound effects are the only negative aspect 
 game. Some sound blips may bother you after quite a while.
  
  Like stated before the value of the game can only given, in this case, by the player. Your dedication 
 and preference for different parts of the game will determine how much you hate it or like it. 
 Your own skill at the game my determine your likeablity of the game also. This is why the game 
 is so difficult to judge against other games or a standard. 
  
  My own personal view of the game is a little beyond mediocre since the game is a little superficial. 
 I have personally spent most of my time making movies since the small manipulation of stars and 
 movies seems a little shallow. But with different preferences of players will speak to the value 
 of this game.

Review:  Wow! That really describes this game. This game has it all. The gameplay is top-notch. Starting 
 in the 20's you have to create a succesful movie studio and take it to the top of the charts. The 
 graphics are great, but lack some detail. The sound is great! The 20's has weird classical sounding 
 stuff, but the 60's has rock guitar solos. It's cool how it changes.
  
  Believe me, you'll sit down one day, start playing this, and your life will necver change again! 
 THAT"s how addicting it is! It takes you quite a while (at least 30 hours) to get to the 90's-2000, 
 plus you'll want to play it again. There is also a sandbox mode where you can concentrate on creating 
 your own movies.
  
  Now if you excuse me... I'm off to play the movies!

Review:  Well Hello To you.
  In this review i will write about the game: The Movies (TM)
  
  First of all this game is a tycoon so hwo does'nt like tycoon's get outta here!
  but if you wanna 
 start like tycoon games try first the game: The Sims 2 or Rollercoaster Tycoon 3
  
  Now to the business:
  
  the game presents the start of the movie creation from 1920 till the 
 2000 years.
  every year you got the latest equipment to start your movie.
  Remember! it's the latest equipment to this year ok?
  now cut the Bla Bla Bla so let's get to 
 the business
  your first movie will be a comedy movie that has been written by the scriptwriters.
  it has no 
 voice/color/storyline.
  it's just a man hwo do something in about 30 seconds.
  then you need to release the movie.
  no problem right? ok
  the next step is to start making 
 movies.
  in 10 years or 5 years i don't remember only scriptwriters can write the script of the movie but 
 after that you got your own scriptwriting office that you can use to edit your script.
  it's kinda fun but it's a little bit annoying and a little bit complicated and the tycoon lovers 
 will know how to use it.
  you have hundred of places to show your movie.
  you have also "Oscar" in the game that say's if you have any price for your studio (movie stars, movies, studio 
 management)
  alot of upgrades for your studio.
  now the negative side is:
  it's too complicated for starters too much to do and manage
  and this is all
  well
  My score 
 is...

Review:  The Movies is a great complex game to keep you buys for a while. This is really the first game of 
 its type. Well with the goal of Making a successful movie studio. Like all games like this you 
 cant see yourself. You are the great creator. You Have the Power to do watever you want, but ofcourse 
 you have your limits. You have budgets, Actors and Staff have emotions and feelings, and your hole 
 Groove can crash just because one Actor brought some crack. lol
  Many of you like i did, by watching videos and everything, you probably think the Movie creating 
 system is Pretty Free. But its not... Its actually very limited.. Limited meaning you cant do what 
 YOU want. The Game has created groups of skits and scenes that you choose from and use them to 
 form a movie. You can still Make wat you like, but its still dissapointing. This game gets more 
 realistic than you think. Drug Addictions, Sickness, Back Stabbing, Love, All that and more goes 
 on with your staff. 
  You do have rival companies, which can get very annoying cuz at the start no matter HOW GOOD you 
 do, they alwayz do better. After a while its easy to exceed them. The Costumes are very impressive. 
 Horror monsters from Dracula to A guy in a chicken costume. There are mostly War and Space outfits. 
 Not surprised by that. You can add special effects such as Smoke, Funny noises, and Random Crap. 
 Some may believe this is a poor attempt at Sims... But Its not. Sims itself is a Cheap copy of 
 older games (sad thing is Sims still rocks =D) If your looking for a game to last you a long time, 
 and if your wondering wat its like to be a big time Movie Producer get thisg game.

Review:  The movies is an astounding game. There are alot of great ideas in this game really shows how great 
 it can be but the game really isn't that fun. 
  
  Gameplay: The game really suffers from not helping you out. There is a short tutorial that only 
 shows you the real basics of the game so you don't get stuck trying to put a building down and 
 showing you how to recruit people. That stuff should definatly be in a tutorial but they should 
 put more tutorials so that you can get to know how to do the really hard stuff like the movie part. 
 You do get help for making movies but only very simple rules. If you want a high selling movie 
 you have to teach yourself how to make a long and interesting movie. After you make a movie you 
 get some commentary that the reviewers of the movie show you. Some of them keep showing up so there 
 really aren't alot of commentary for your movie. The actors and actresses have a atitude level 
 so if you make them mad or if some one else has something better then him or her he or she might 
 just quit. You find out that later on in the game you get cooler stuff to do if you have the lab. 
 The year goes up to 2020 so they show some futureistic stuff that looks pretty cool and fun to 
 use.
  
  Graphics: The graphics are very similer to the sims 2 so they are pretty good. You can go up really 
 high with the camera or down low to see the faces of the actors and actresses which is awsome.
 
  
  Sound: The sound is pretty good. They have new soundtracks and new radio host every time the years 
 change. Some of them stay on for a while and radio host sometimes get annoying.
  
  Value: This game is going to take you about 30-35 hours to beat which is a good amount of time. 
 There is also a sandbox mode for you to just play around and you are able to chose how much money 
 you start off with and they year you start off with.
  
  Overall: This game is only for people that like strategy games and like a challenge. There are 
 some part in this game that are hard but overall this game is a great and should have an expansion 
 that help's out more with the movie making.

Review:  The movies is A game that lets you well make movies your the head of a studio company and hire 
 directors actors set crews and just make movies which is fun especially when you open up the ability 
 to make your own custom films and if your like me Yule probably make all the classic films in your 
 own sim kind of way. the problems with this game is the management if you make your own film and 
 its a long one Yule find that the stars and directors will get bored or stressed and wonder off 
 leaving your film unfinished and if you dont have other movies on the works while you make yours 
 your money will start to drop big time. The other main problem is the films that the computer makes 
 are almost always the same with no difference whatsoever so making default movies gets boring by 
 the minute. 
  
  the game is worth buying now and with the expansion pack i think people would enjoy playing this 
 game

Review:  The Movies put you in charge of your own movie developing company. From making your name to a limit 
 amount of logos, you will have fun making your own developing company. Of course everyone needs 
 a critict, and The Movies gives you a critict for each catagory: Actors, Technology, Script, etc.
 
  Lot maintance is a must, and so is pampering your snotty actors. Long good scripts is the key, 
 stick to the scenario if you're making a horror make sure the surroudings are scary. Watch how 
 the years fly by, fashion will change and you will need to change your actors wardrobe or they'll 
 be depressed and probably fall into a state of eating, drinking, and depression (oh my!) hehe, always 
 wanted to do that.
  Don't worry either, because you got a slightly funny radio personality that will keep you company 
 through out your whole game play! Of course over time they change since you know, you can't be 
 on radio for 40 years...
  On to serious issues, this game does get boring and people like me don't have the patience to make 
 a movie after movie. They all just mix into one but with different actors. And your actors are 
 asking for trailers that are just too expensive to afford, they are never happy either. Got a drinking 
 problem? throw them in rehab. Now their depressed after all that! gotta make 'em happy. Eventually 
 you'll lose track of them and they'll fall into another addiction. Too much for me. But forget 
 that now I wanna talk about Sandbox mode.
  Ah, yes - Sandbox mode. Don't feel like playing through a series of unfortunate events ? Well 
 just get on with it and make some movies with the best technology the 21st century has to offer! 
 Make any kind of movie you want in Sandbox mode and save it for later for laughs. In Sandbox mode 
 you choose how much money you want to start with and you choose what date it is. All building are 
 unlocked and so are all the stages.
  One thing I like about the Movies is if you have a mic that will hook up to your PC than you add 
 lip syncs and it will actually move the lips for you so it looks like they're talking! I found 
 this great fun and made a couple good movies like that. 
  I recomend that if you're gonna get it wait until prices drop or you might be a little disappointed.

Review:  Lionhead definitely hit the high points of making movies with this one. And.. Some of the low points.
 
  
  In Tycoon mode, the game is your typical "city builder" type game. Take 1 open space, place various 
 objects used by your studio to make movies and keep your population happy while increasing your 
 available resources to keep buying new stuff to fill in open spaces. And it's a pretty fun game 
 in that regards. Population (stars) happiness takes a little micromanagement at times, but for 
 the most part If you like city builders, you'll like The Movies.
  
  You will, however, only have seen about half of the game. Deep with in the recesses of The Movies 
 is a little Machinima movie maker. Write a script, select your cast, film it, and then edit it 
 in post production.
  
  Script writing is basically the process of picking a location (set) and selecting from a menu of 
 actor actions. Backgrounds, props, costumes are all customizable as are some scene elements like 
 length, and type of actions done by the actors. Tie several of these scenes together to form a 
 movie.
  
  Casting involves selecting which of your virtual actors you want for each role in your movie. While 
 this can be done during custom script writing, you may end up having to make adjustments at casting 
 call time. Once all of your roles are filled, you can set your stars to researching the movie and 
 then send them off to film in on your lot.
  
  Once filming is complete, you can move your new opus into post production were you can add custom 
 music, cut and arrange your scenes as needed, and then add in sounds and vocal dialog (which your 
 actors will even lip sync!) .
  
  Finally, a finished movie can be uploaded to The Movies Online where it can be viewed, and reviewed, 
 by other virtual movie makers. Through "releasing" your movie via The Movies Online, your studio 
 will earn Virtual Credits (VCs) which can be used to "purchase" new sets, costumes, and props for 
 your next major motion picture. In addition, movies placed online might qualify for online contests 
 and give the virtual director the chance to win some rather nice prizes.

Review:  I really enjoy Peter Molyneux games, since Populous and Dungeon Keeper, to Fable and now The Movies. 
 This game looked to be so different from any other, but really it's just another Sim/Tycoon game, 
 set in the movie making industry from the 1920's on.
  
  That doesn't make it ordinary, however, as you have a lot of freedom to create your own custom 
 scripts and films, with a powerful Advanced Movie Maker, and you can even create your own actors 
 and actresses with Star Maker.
  
  There is a good bit of micro-management, but I like to be very busy, and there is always alot to 
 do in The Movies, and it all contributes to your success as a Movie Mogul. I've learned a lot of 
 tricks by replaying, the game is very deep, and a good simulation of a movie studio. 
  
  The award shows every year are a nice feature, but I would have liked them to be more elaborate, 
 maybe allow us winners to prepare a speech, get up on stage, and get cut off by the music is we 
 take too long . . .
  
  Overall, I think The Movies is a quality game, for harcore and casual gamers alike.

Review:  Creating and managing your very own movie studio is one of those aspects I haven't seen in any 
 other game. Lionhead has certainly released a very original game! And you have to be brave to make 
 something like that in a now very competitive gaming industry so first off I have to give them 
 some credits for this. I downloaded the demo from Gamespot and right after that I bought the full 
 game! It's extremely addictive! The problem with most tycoon games is that once you start to make 
 money you keep climbing in the charts and before you know you have so much money you don't know 
 what to do with it and the game loses my interest because you have something like "I'm gonna win 
 anyway" feeling.
  The Movies game is different. It's a hard game to play in a positive way. It's challenging and 
 fun to play. 
  For example the single player which begins in the year 1920 and I'm in the year 1984 now, it's 
 still very hard to keep up with the competition, make more money then them, keep up with the technology, 
 hire good actors and try to win an award during the awards ceremony. This gives you a feel of realism 
 in the game because once you reach the number 1 spot on the list, it won't be for long unless you 
 release another blockbuster! You have to keep up with the lot prestige, watch your stars (they're 
 getting older or more demanding, so you might consider either to fire them, sell them to other 
 movie studio's, give the what they want, or just wait until they retire) .
  Build up you movie studio's with different stages and sets. Add landscaping, facilities etc, and 
 make sure you maintain them all!
  There are some things to comment on, besides all the good stuff. The only things I think would've 
 been better is for example the weather and time of day. It's constant play in the sunny afternoon. 
 Weather conditions never change. And also, once you hire alot of people, from actors to janitors, 
 you loose a little overview to see what people are doing and what their demands are. Sometimes 
 you think everything is ok and all of a sudden in the corner of your studio lot you notice an actor 
 is about to retire in a year while you were too busy putting one of you actors to rehab because 
 of his alcohol addiction.
  Minor things, but maybe good for The Movies 2? or an extra expansion?
  Overall a great game! 
 See for yourself and download the demo, or save yourself some time and buy the full version right 
 away!

Review:  I have been wanting to play this game for over a year now and i have finaly got to. I really like 
 tycoon games allot and this one i thought would just be sweet,
  
  - First impressions: YEEEHHHAAAWWWW... what an awesome game. The tutorials were short and really 
 easy to follow. I started out creating myself and my wife and actors to import into the game. Everything 
 from a firt perspective was awesome.
  
  - Gameplay: The game play is easy. Its similar to most tycoon games, but many steps above. The 
 movies you make are awesome. you can edit anything you want. It can get a little hectic after you 
 get going. with keeping you directors happy, and actors. Keeping teh scripts rolling, research, 
 building........ Its awesome.
  
  - Sound: The sound is good. there is music and news that goes along with the year you are in. I 
 was sitting there playing and the kinda annoying thesbian voice said its now 5 after the our if 
 you were going to do anything on the hour.... your late,... hahahaha . I was like, Whoa it cant 
 be. So i looked and it was exactley 5 after the hour. Lots of fun
  
  - Graphics: the graphics are really good. the movies for the era are awesome. as the age progresses 
 the movies abviuosly get better. very well done game.
  
  - Overall: One of the best if not the best tycoon games out there. I recomend Roller coaster tycoon 
 3 as well. The Movies is a must have for any tycoon person. Wonderful and great game.

Review:  The Movies is basically a never-ending game in which you compete against other studios to get the 
 highest ranking, all the awards and have the best stars. But you start in the 1920's, so don't 
 expect masterpieces right off the bat (unless you cheat.)
  
  Game play in this game has similar aspects to The Sims or (to a much lesser extent) , the Black 
 And White series (though it's missing the miracles and gigantic creatures.) You basically just 
 drop people into casting and hiring squares in your made buildings and watch them build, act, write 
 scripts etc. When you unlock the Advanced Script Maker, you can make your own movies with the materials 
 given to you.
  
  Graphics in this game are excellent, in my opinion. You don't really see the outside of your buildings 
 much, and the inside is similar to a blueprint, but the outsides look fantastic, as do the sets 
 you're given.
  
  Sound in this game could be better. It's mainly Swing music and radio announcers until you get 
 a few decades in, which may annoy some people, but there is some good music too (like some of the 
 stuff you can use in your movies.)
  
  In conclusion, this is definitely a great game to buy if you have enough money. It probably isn't 
 for everyone, but it's enjoyable if you're into this kind of game (possibly if you're not.)

Review:  This is an amazing game which can be played by lovers of many different genres.
  
  It can be played as a sims game, where you can control the life and actions of the people within 
 your studio and where you can also choose to make, or to break the dreams of your actors and anyone 
 who wishes to be a part of your studio.
  
  If you like city building games, this one is for you too! Although it is not exactly a city, you 
 have quite alot of options and a very simple and easy to use bulding method (brought to you by 
 those gaming game developers at Lionhead, who understand the concept of simple and yet very effective) . 
 Manage your studio lot, keep it clean and well secured, attract stars to it, treat your stars to 
 trailers, restaurants, bars, luxury toilets, detox, plastic surgery and much more.
  
  This game is also for those of you who have always had an idea for a feature motion picture or 
 always keep saying to youself, "Wow, now that would look nice in a movie!". But then you realise 
 that you cant. Well now you can finally give your ideas the breath of life with, The Movies. Choose 
 your actors, directors and extras. Choose the sets, the actions, the camera angles, the degree 
 of emotions, the way the actions are carried out... then, once you have your big, epic film, get 
 out there and shoot it! Once al that is done hype up the public with some pre production advertising. 
 If you want you can even choose the soundtrack that plays in the backgroun, wide array of sound 
 effect or record your own dialogue and even add subtitles to it. Finally unleash your masterpiece 
 out into the world and begin making another movie while you rake in the benifits of the one you 
 just released.
  
  Work your way up to the number one studio and it doesnt end there. Reveal your creations to everyone 
 you know through the internet. Also downloadable content is added regularly, although not all of 
 it is very usefull.
  
  Go and enjoy this tycoon of all types!

Review:  Before anything, I would like to plainly say that this game is NOT for everyone. Anyone who finds 
 the process of making movies boring, or uninteresting should steer clear. Why? Although this game 
 is marketed to be a strategy tycoon game, it isn't. There is definatley some tycoonish gameplay, 
 but the major aspect of the game is making movies for yourself, and if you enjoy the idea of making 
 your own movies, then you will heartely enjoy this game.
  
  The game is pretty much split into two sections. The running and management of your studio lot 
 and actors, and the making of movies. Because of this, the developers seem to have put a lot more 
 emphasis on the making of movies, so the tycoon aspect of the game seems a little underdeveloped. 
 That being said, it is still fun making your actors breakdown due to too much stress...
  
  As with all Lionhead games, there is also a healthy dose of good natured humour, which also helps 
 keep the masses amused. Pick up the game if you like the novelty of being able to create your very 
 own movies, but if your looking for a tycoon game to test your skill, you may be better of looking 
 somewhere else.

Review:  The movies was always an ambitious project, and was never going to live up to the hype that surrounded 
 it. Like many people, I looked forwards to getting the creative juices flowing, and giving the 
 trigger finger a small break. The game sounded like a breath of fresh air, amongst an otherwise 
 stagnant collection of sequels and clones.
  
  The game arrived.
  
  Initially I was rather impressed, I enjoyed the tycoon element a little more than I thought, however 
 it all began to go wrong once I gained access to the movie creator. Clearly my expectations had 
 been too high, as I was never able to make the movies I wanted.
  
  Typically I would select a starting scene, then spend an age looking for another scene that would 
 logically follow it, and then another to logically follow that. This would continue until the conclusion 
 of my movie. It never felt like I was constructing the movie, instead I was an editor completing 
 someone else's work.
  
  There was still some fun to be had from this formula, but once I got fight scenes with giant chickens 
 out of my system, the novelty quickly wore off.
  
  Overall this is an interesting title, but in keeping the software simple to use, they have neglected 
 the sort of control that I suspect most users want from their projects. Worth a look, but ultimately 
 a short-lived distraction.

Review:  I bought it about 2 months ago and played it non-stop for 3 days, its that addictive. But then 
 I haven't touched it since. The management aspect is pretty fun, though the movie making was too 
 time consuming for my tastes. I've seen some of the user made movies on the web and there are a 
 few good ones, but you really really have to like making movies (e. g. film student or writer) to 
 make the effort to attempt a decent movie. Otherwise the management aspect should keep you entertained. 
 I might get back into it after uni exams... or probably just sell it on ebay.
  
  I think Gamespot's score is pretty much spot on; it's a promising game with the depth if you want 
 it, but for a semi-casual gamer like me, it lacks a little something to make me keep coming back 
 to it. Not a bad purchase though.

Review:  Dont get me wrong, this is a good game. But it really only appeals to the people who like making 
 their own movies, hence the name of the game. 
  When i first bought it, i thought it was going to be great. I was a little disappointed when i 
 first played it.
  The probelms with the game is the fact that there is not enough people to hire in the main game 
 to fit all of the roles, including having assisants for your stars. Its also basically the sims, 
 but with the ability to make movies. 
  Other than these though, its a very good, enjoyable game, if you focus purely on making movies. 
 
  After a while your movies tend to be the same thing with the same scenes, but thats why they have 
 developed an expansion pack, which is gonna make this game a lot more fun to play.
  Cant wait for it!!!!!!!!!

Review:  I love The Movies. It's fun to play both the tycoon aspect of it, and to actually make your own. 
 I have a few issues with the game, but all and all it's a lot of fun. There are not a lot of variation 
 with props and sets and lighting and actual actor "looks". The game needs more options and variations, 
 and definately more acting styles. Scenes are not diverse enough. A LOT of the acting is really 
 corny and fake looking. Facial expressions could be better. It'd be great if the console versions 
 actually went through, because the graphics could be amazing and animations would be a lot better. 
 More polygons on the models would be better. Special effects are needed as well.

Review:  The Movies started out great... I played for a week straight and couldn't get enough. Then I got 
 tired of the micromanagement and realized how nearly impossible it is to make your own movie. Okay, 
 I said that wrong - it's very easy to make your own movie, but when you have specific scenes in 
 mind, it's hard to duplicate them. Furthermore, the process was complicated by technical issues 
 like when I'd put a costume on an actor/actress for a scene, it would overwrite his/her costume 
 for the entire movie. I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to fix that - but don't think 
 I'm basing my entire review on just that one problem.
  
  I know that games are limited in their content, but the movie titles were very repetitive. It also 
 seemed to take too long for scriptwriters to write... I had to have 3-4 on a script to get it done 
 in a decent amount of time. Some minor tweaks to this would have been nice.
  
  The game's official website was disappointing in that, to get the free content they put out (such 
 as new props or costumes) , you had to not only upload your movies, but get a certain number of 
 views. It had started out that you got points simply for uploading them, but then changed to require 
 views. This made it seem like only the popular users would ever get the new content, or you'd have 
 to spam your friends and beg them to watch your movies.
  
  Again, I think the first few days are great, but once you get past about 3 stars, it's too hard, 
 and the micromanagement is very tedious. I'll definitely be skipping the expansion pack on this 
 one - I don't want to put more money into a game I'll only play for a week.

Review:  the game does what it says it would do in a very good game.
  at the begging, it's best to go to the story mode and do their tutirals and survive without losing 
 all your and money until 2000. that's because then in the sandbox which is the best and play it 
 in all years, from 1920 to 2000. the games advanced scriptwriting is really amazing and also the 
 post-production is great. the movies is a good mixutre of Sims and Tycoon games. the only kind 
 of people i think won't injoy it are people who hate Tycoon games or just don't play PC games.
 
  the game is made to anyone who want to make films and aren't film direters.

Review:  This game has become my favorite PC game! I want to be a director when I grow up, and this game 
 allows me to make my movies and share them on The Movies Online! It's a great game for a film-maker 
 or just the guy next door! It's a game that will never be forgotten! With the innovative Advanced 
 Movie Maker and the numerous Post Production options, the people at Lionhead hit the nail in the 
 coffin on this one! The way it allows it's users to make a film completely from scratch gives the 
 feeling that you really are a filmmaker in a studio! I can't wait to see the future for this fantastic 
 game!

Review:  In The Movies you are the director, you run the studios, and you make the movies...
  
  GAMEPLAY: Well, right off the bat The Movies is a little hard to get into. You start in the 1920's 
 with VERY limited technology. So this idea doesn't necesarily work too well, because you can't 
 really do much so I start getting the picture that this game isn't that open. That's not true, 
 if you give it time, it just might grow on you and I eventually found out just how open the movie 
 making possibilities can be, but some still may not be pleased with the resources at your disposal.
 
  
  Making your own custom film is pretty simple once you get the hang of it. First, you choose your 
 stars and director, then choose the genre. (Choosing the genre really doesn't effect the movie 
 much seeing as to how you still choose any kind of scene) . 
  Second, you pick the sets and the "scenes". This is where some people became dissapointed. You 
 don't actually 'make' your own scripts. You actually choose from a couple hundred or so 'pre-made' 
 scenes meaning you just stick your actors into different slots. However you can adjust the lighting, 
 the camera angle, the costumes the actors are wearing at that time, or even the amount of violence 
 and intensity of a fight scene, and also even adjust the type of scream you want from a frightened 
 charactor. When you really explore the scene options there are certainly thousands of possibilities 
 for your films.
  Finally, after you finish selecting and placing your actors in your chosen scenes, the movie is 
 automatically shot, meaning you'll watch your actors shoot their scenes if you wish. After this 
 you have the ability to make post-production enhancements. These include selecting music (which 
 is automatically selected otherwise; you can also upload your own music) , add voice acting (very 
 cool) , and add more sound effects (which you can also upload your own) . (Also, hopefully more scene 
 options will be available in the expansion. A lot more!)
  To really get an idea you just have to watch some of the good user uploading movies at The Movies's 
 official website.
  One problem to me is that it's hard to make a serious film you can take seriously. It's as if your 
 virtual actors don't take themselves seriously. So I haven't made a serious film yet. All mine 
 are just spoofs or short and fun little movies.
  
  The Movies's main mode in which you run a studio is only REALLY fun for a while. It gets a little 
 stale and it's actually not the best sim out there. Most will spend time with just the movie making.
 
  
  For the most part the movie making takes a fairly creative mind and a load of patience. A good 
 idea is to simply have an idea of what you want to make. I also find it fun to export your movies 
 to other people at The Movies's official website.
  
  GRAPHICS: Simply, the graphics do their justice. The game's map at your studio scales nicely, and 
 everything looks very crisp from the buildings to the actors (I was running on highest settings) .
 
  
  SOUND: I noticed some sound glitches here and there, for example, in one of my movies almost all 
 of the sound was a little delayed: like when a man was shot and the actual shot was heard after 
 his was hit. Also the music is usually appropriate and has a FANTASTIC variety to support the different 
 moods created in the movies.
  
  VALUE: It's easy to talk about the value. This game will last as long as you can come up with ideas.
 
  
  ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE: 
  - Scene options aren't quite as quantative as we'd like
  - Some sound glitches
  - Actual studio mode isn't that great of a sim
  
  BOTTOM LINE: Well, 
 I liked The Movies. I'm excited for the expansion. I enjoy making movies cause it's just so simple. 
 I've always had a desire to learn to make Flash movies, but that was too complicated. The Movies 
 makes it much easier. Overall: If you've got some creativity and have the patience to really get 
 into it, The Movies can be a fantastic experiance. I just hope more people buy it!

Review:  When this game came out, I said to myself , "I just have to have this, no matter what". Christmas 
 came, I got it as a present. I ran upstairs, popped the game in my computer (after popping 3 discs, 
 in and out of the hard drive) , played it and was amazed. I never thought I could finally let out 
 all those creative ideas I had for movies. But, the bad qualities started popping out. I was making 
 a movie one day, when I noticed I needed a very certain scene. I looked through and through again, 
 but not finding anything like it or close to it. Then, after successful movies, and the hiring 
 and rehiring of new actors, I got to the year 2000. I said to myself, "Finally, modern movies.". 
 So I get past 2002, when I realized, "Wow, this isn't as much of a change I thought it would be 
 from 1920 to now (2002) " This game didn't disappoint me too much, but there could have been improvements.

Review:  Imagine having your own movie studio, bringing out your own creations to the world on the internet, 
 starting from the 1920s and going up to the 21st century!
  
  This game has the best combination of gameplay I've ever seen. It has money managing, "The Sims" 
 style gameplay, a little of Sim City (you have to build buildings and walkways for employees at 
 your movie studio) , making your own original movies with a very user-friendly interface, and has 
 great competitive online experience. This is a definite change for gamers who want something different, 
 and to have their time occupied with a more productive game.
  
  Everybody can get something from this game. Its strategy with managing money and you have to compete 
 with others' movie studios and movies online and even their actors/actresses/directors.
  
  The coolest thing about making movies I've seen in this is that the actors/actresses in your movies 
 will lip-sync to players' voices very well.
  
  you can make just about any type of movie you want to make and with the new expansion coming June 
 of 2006, you can do so much more, including having people fall from tall buildings and hang them 
 from helicopters in an action movie.
  
  You can convert the movies you make into a readable video format for everyone to check out.
  
 
  If you have at least an ATI x300 card, you'll be set with this game.
  
  To check out examples of what you can do with this game or to see what the created movies look 
 like, check out the online movie charts at:

Review:  This game will feel very familiar to tycoon fans. The main game is you being the owner of a studio 
 and managing it to success. And then again, it also has the option of making your own movies. This 
 makes it feel different at the same time. But overall, Lionhead pulls it off well.
  
  You start out with a handful of sets in the 1920's. Once you get started, it can be pretty addicting. 
 It can also have a decent challenge to it. While it may only be moderately hard to have your stars, 
 studio, and movies rising up the ranks, that won't be the only thing you're doing. On that note, 
 it can be a lot to manage. But it's also a lot of fun.
  
  The game looks pretty good. If you turn up the graphics it can actually look quite beautiful. The 
 movies can look great once you unlock all the modern technology, such as color movies and then 
 better film quality and sound. You have to assign researchers to study these things and Lionhead 
 made it fair and doesn't let you discover it all at once. For instance, you can't discover color 
 movies and then right after that start researching HD-type stuff (I don't believe you can film 
 movies in HD. I'm just using that as an example) . It makes you wait.
  
  In the game you'll go through several mildly entertaining radio host and some some music that fits 
 the time. This isn't why I gave sound a nine. It's because of all the stuff you can do with you're 
 movies. You can add music. You can add sound effects. And best of all, You can add your voiceovers 
 if you have a mic plugged into your computer. This can be a lot of fun when you're making your 
 movies.
  
  Making movies is probably the most fun part of this game. If you've heard that it's a lot of work, 
 it is. But it's also a lot of fun. You pull up a set and then you choose one of probably hundreds 
 of different actions. You can customize these most of the time by giving people different emotions 
 or having them in different places. Minor stuff, but stuff that will make your movie more believable.
 
  
  Overall, this game is a lot of fun. You can play it kind of like RCT or you can just keep rolling 
 off movies and posting them on the movies website. Either way, you're gonna have a blast!

Review:  OVERVIEW: addictive, gameplay OK except feels too much like The Sims sometimes, movie making is 
 amazing, replay value very high, graphics above average, unique game
  
  The movies is an extremely addictive simulation game based off the movie industry. You'll begin 
 the game starting in 1925 and going through the years to 2005 all the while making your studio 
 lot the best in the nation and making the most box office shattering movies ever. There's alot 
 of content in this game that makes The Movies all the more enjoyable.
  THE GAMEPLAY IS PRETTY GOOD. The only problem is taking care of each individual stars needs and 
 wants which turns this game into a little bit of the Sims which can get in the way when you're 
 trying to focus on movie-making. Fortunately, there's a sandbox mode and an option that allows 
 you to turn off the Sims aspect of the game which is very good, though, you'll need to play through 
 the career mode with all the Sims aspect intact. This can get a little tedious but doesn't hinder 
 the gameplay too bad. Everything else is almost perfect. I'd like to see more unemployees lining 
 up outside your buildings though. And finding each one of your individual stars can be a little 
 confusing. The movie making part of the game is amazing. Though, you don't get TOTAL control over 
 your movies, there are hundreds of actions you can choose from and tons of sets to display your 
 movie. It would be nice to have complete control over your camera in future releases.
  GRAPHICS ARE A LITTLE ABOVE AVERAGE. You can tell you're playing a video game on your PC because 
 the graphics aren't that great. Especially when you film your movies, the graphics can get in the 
 way a little. I'm no graphics whore though, and I personally didn't think the graphics hindered 
 the game at all. There are some slowdown issues as well as you proceed further into the game and 
 your lot expands. 
  THE SOUND IS OK. The DJ and music playing in the background add to the atmosphere in a good way. 
 Though sometimes you wish there were some more sound effects when watching your stars interact 
 with eachother or the environment. Filming a movie can get really annoying in this area since your 
 stars speak jibberish the whole time and you have to hear it over and over again. The sound effects 
 you can add to your movie though is superb and there can only be more added in the future installments.
 
  THE VALUE IS HIGH. You'll play this game well over 30 hours to finish the career mode and the 
 sandbox mode adds all the more to the replay value. You can build a building in the game called 
 the Custom Script Writing Office where you make your own movies, whatever you want. This adds great 
 replay value since you can let your imagination run free here. Each action that you choose your 
 actors to do also comes with a slider option that shows the different moods or emotions you can 
 choose from for your actor to display while they are doing their specific action. You can also 
 put your own movies online and earn virtual credit to buy new props and sets and costumes which 
 adds to the replay value. 
  IN THE END, this game is worth getting for any simulation fan and a must have for any aspiring 
 film director. Every persons studio lot will be unique to his/her preference because of the sets 
 and props they use. This shows that game fits any persons style of playing which is an amazing 
 concept for a game to follow, and this game does it very well.

Review:  Now you've got a friend in the movie business -- you! The Movies lets you choose whether you want 
 to be a studio boss, a filmmaker, or both. Movies may be an art, but a little R&D science can help 
 give you the edge you need. A slick graphics engine lets you go from fly-on-the-wall view to bird-in-the-sky 
 view without batting an eye. This game gets a perfect 10 out of 10.
  
  +: Addictive Tycoon-style gameplay; moviemaking tools are easy to use and are deceptively deep; 
 visuals scale beautifully; easy to share your weird movies with all your weird friends. 
  
  -: Disconnect between the business management and the filmmaking; system hog.

Review:  I thoroughly enjoyed the Movies and would recomend this game to anyone.
  
  To begin with it starts off as your basic management sim, build your lot hire your staff make your 
 staff better etc.. But after half an hour or so playing you will unlock the custom script office 
 and this is where the true brilliance of the movies comes to life. With tons of sets and scenes 
 to experiment with, you will never make an identical movie.
  
  Also the graphics on this game are pretty simple but theyre pretty and smooth and look great. The 
 sound is also good as there is music which isn't annoying playing and there is a movies radio which 
 can be hillarious at times.
  
  After you have mastered the game the fun doesn't stop there as you can put your creations online. 
 The online mode is brilliant, you earn virtual credits by other players reveiwing or just watching 
 ur movies and you can use these virtual credits to spend on extra content for the game.
  
  Buy this game!

Review:  There is a lot of good things to say about this game. This is is pretty much for everyone and is 
 also a great Tycoon game. Those who love movies and want to be part of the film industry, this 
 is an excellent start. You can start playing and the next thing you know it can be 4:00 in the 
 morning. A better thing about this game is that you can upload your custom movies that you make 
 on to the community website and have others rate and review you and your movies. There is a lot 
 of strategy involved and plenty of replay value. Everyone should get this game!!!!!!!!!!!

Review:  The Movies is a simulation game with good gameplay, graphics, and good sound. You play as the owner 
 of a movie studio in the 1920s. You have to manage everything from hiring staff, actors, movie 
 producers, building movie sets, writing scripts and making sure your making a profit, and win awards.
 
  
  The game is kind of like the Sims in a way. Because if listen to how the people talk it sounds 
 like the Sim language, and the characters look like Sim characters a little too. 
  
  Their is two ways you can play this game. You could just manage the studio and make sure that the 
 you hire the right people, have the best sets, make sure u have good scripts, take care of your 
 actors and let the computer make the movies. Or you can write the scripts and direct the movies 
 yourself. But making the movies yourself takes a lot of time and if your not into that kind of 
 thing then you'll probably do it once and thats it.
  
  The sound is great. Music and radio commentary changes as the years past to reflect the changing 
 of eras. 
  
  Well thats all I have to because I recently got and haven't finished it yet.

Review:  The Movies is a strategy game with great gameplay and sound. You play as the owner of a new movie 
 studio and as you are in this job, you must control everything which happens in the studio, from 
 building buildings and sets to hiring staff, crew and actors. Basically, you control the entire 
 studio and its inhabitants.
  
  There are two main sections in which you will play in The Movies. One is as a manager-style player, 
 taking care of the money, the lot and the hiring of workers. The other is as a movie-maker, where 
 you write the scripts, choose the sets, decide on the crew and actors and determine the wellbeing 
 and relationships of the stars.
  
  If there is one little letdown in The Movies, it would have to be the graphics. The graphics are 
 ok, but are nothing compared to some of the games out now. The people sometimes look 2D when you 
 zoom in close, and the shadows are not the best either.
  
  Another little letdown is the auto-scriptwriting. There could be two movies with the exact same 
 cast, set and lines, but have two different genres and both do differently in the market. That 
 is weird and annoying as you spend a lot of money for a waste of a movie.
  
  But if these are a bit of a letdown, then the sound makes up for it. The radio announcers reflect 
 the eras greatly and some of what they say is really funny. The music also reflects the times and 
 is catchy and enjoyable.
  
  The replay ability of this game is great. There is so much customisation with both the stars and 
 scripts. There are endless possibilities and it is great to see a movie you made with absolutely 
 no storyline whatsoever succeed.
  
  Overall, an under-appreciated game which deserves more credit than what it has received.

Review:  The Movies is a tycoon game that is from Lionhead Studios, straight from the heart Peter Molyneux 
 himself. You may have played his games, Populous, Theme Park, Powermonger, Theme Hospital, etc. 
 If you look at all the games he's done since he left Bullfrog a long time ago, you would realize 
 that he hasn't really done any Tycoon games that he's well known for since then. Well, here you 
 go. A fresh new Tycoon that was released last year but was overlooked by many.
  
  The Movies starts you off in the 1920's, you have $150,000, and a big studio lot full of empty 
 ground. Before you know it, you'll be pumping out more movies then Ahnold pumps iron. The Movie 
 making system works pretty much like this, either you can hire scriptwriters and they will write 
 movies for you. Or later in the game, once you unlock the Custom Script Writing Office you can 
 make your own movies.
  
  The movie making system pretty much lets you pick pretty much everything, the roles, the movie 
 name, the set, the lighting, weather, what extra's play where. It's pretty simple and easy to get 
 into no matter how complex it sounds. And then you pick a pre-selected scene, which there are hundreds 
 of. It has a search system so you wont be scrolling through the scenes forever. So you can search 
 for a scene just by typing keywords such as Gun, Fight, or Talk. Or you can search by how many 
 roles are in the scene. Also by what prop you want to use.
  
  You'll have actors and directors, both you will have to take care of. As in you will make sure 
 you don't over stress them, make sure they have nice trailers, they need assistants, keep their 
 salary up to date, make sure their up to date fashion wise, keep them in physical shape, make sure 
 they dont get bored, keep them slim. And to add the cherry on top, keep them practicing on sets. 
 Your stars have experience bars, which pretty much start empty at the beginning of the game.
  
  You can click and drag your stars and place them on a set, and they will start practicing. 
 Which usually takes a few minutes and it will stress them a little bit. However their experience 
 will go up and its a good cure for boredom. It will go up tiny bit depending on which genre the 
 set was based on. Which results in them performing better when directing or acting. Your crew, 
 builders, janitors and scriptwriters have experience to. However they dont practice on sets. They 
 just naturally get better after doing their jobs.
  
  To point it out, doing all of this can be tiresome after awhile, however fun nonetheless. Taking 
 care of your stars is big work, especially if you have a ton of stars. And on top of that, you 
 need to keep decorating your lot with trees, plants and ornaments. Also while pumping out scripts. 
 So this game does keep you busy. There is not one point in the game where I was just sitting around 
 waiting for something to happen.
  
  However, there is a flaw to all of this. You would think if a star was bored, or stressed then 
 they would play on the Basketball set or go to the Bar automatically. Which they dont, youll 
 think to yourself after awhile.  Stupid Tom Cruise, go chat with Katie Holmes. . Even though 
 they do play with your basketball hoop, or they will socialize with the other stars. Its more 
 in a random sense, instead of doing in when they actually need to.
  
  Whats really a great aspect to this game is its Timeline. You start off in the 1920s. And the 
 movies isnt a really big thing in the world yet, its still all about theatrical acting. And then 
 certain events will happen on the Timeline. Such as it will be 1939 and the war is just about to 
 begin. Therefor there will be a bonus to Action movies. There are many scenarios like this that 
 will give positive or negative effects to current and upcoming movies depending on their genre.
 
  
  Also, to make your movie industry a success. There are the movie awards shows every five years. 
 In which you can win awards for many different things, such as best looking lot. Or best movie 
 released. Theres many awards, I think around eight. Each award you win rewards you, as in if you 
 with the best looking lot award it gives you a bonus to your research. And you will research faster. 
 The competition isnt easy to beat either. Its a really great addition and makes your work a success.
 
  
  Not to mention that The Movies has online play. You can take your movies that youve made and submit 
 them to The Movies website. And then other people can watch your movie, comment on it and rate 
 it. There are some really good pieces of work out there. Ive seen some over fifteen minutes long. 
 And they all have voice acting and everything. Its a really great thing to check out.
  
  To sum it all up, The Movies is just a great game and its really good to see Peter Molyneux still 
 has his flare in making tycoons. Its a great addition to the tycoon genre, and I cant wait until 
 the expansion pack comes out. Which will introduce stunts and other things. The Movies is a great 
 game, and you should pick it up if you have any sense in tycoon gaming.
  
  The Pro's
  +Great gameplay
  +The timeline is great
  +Has that Bullfrog feel
  +Originality
  +Move making 
 depth
  +Online is cool
  +Fast pace feel
  
  The Con's
  -Stars should take care of themselves at times
  -Cannot configure controls in game options
 
  
  -----------------
  Gameplay | It's what makes this game
  Graphics | Up to date
  Sound | Music is well done, if you can get past the actors mumbling
  Value | A true addition 
 to your gaming collection, and decent replay.

Review:  The Movies made me play it everyday . It's drug , Good Drug . I am loving it more and more everyday 
 . It is easy to understand and gave you space to prove your talent in making movies . 
  
  The movies is the longest game I ever game and without getting bored . The only thing that I don't 
 like about this is the stars but retire and 70 years old I think they should retire a little older 
 as because they can act better as they grow older . 
  
  Once you start the game , there will can no stopping .

Review:  When it comes to simulation games, you can go down ot your local video games shop and pick up a 
 sim game based on virtually anything you desire from controlling an airport to running a provocative 
 men's magazine. You may say that is genre has been overdone, yes I won't lie in telling you that 
 infact when a new "sim" game arrives at the shop i brings the feeling of beating a dead horse with 
 it.
  
  Then I played The Movies.
  
  The thought of being the director of a film studio isn't one that crosses everyone's mind but The 
 Movies captures this feel to a tee, T, tea.
  
  Upon booting the game up you realise that this isn't your everyday "sim" game, the copy that I 
 had acquired had a promo slip for an online film festival

Review:  Whats Great about lion head is that its original!!! other than that the game is realy fun in the 
 biggining and then it gets kinda hard and boring and when your stars retire well it just suck you 
 have to start all over again, i never got the last diploma!!! other than that the game is kinda 
 tony and has a black and white touch to it since you can pick up the actors and place them were 
 you want, thers no real point to the game then just runing the studio, later once your kinda bored 
 youl want to do your own movie and it will probaly suck the controls are realy bad and THE AI, 
 saying when the computer writes the scripts TOTALY sucks, the CP does the worst movies EVER and 
 when u do it youl take up all your money and time... some thing need to improved in the game... 
 its a fun game to play once then u dont realy feel like touching it see for yourself!

Review:  this is a fun game before i got it i thoughtit would be like where you hire ceelberys like tom 
 cruise to star in a movie and then you create the movie with those celebertys it was more like 
 a sims game where you start out small and keep adding to your proffit the first hour i started 
 playing it i hated it but after about a hour i started to understand what im suposed to do more 
 and with in about 2 hours it was getting pretty fun it seems like one of those games where it starts 
 out boring gets fun then it quiets down on you i would say the best part of this was the custom 
 movie making because then its not some crappy film that a bunch of idiots made if you are a fan 
 of tycoon games you should try this game

Review:  The movies is a tycoon game from Lion Head Studios. The basic Idea of the game is to run a movie 
 studio and become the most successful movie maker around. I reckon any tycoon fan would enjoy this 
 game. After you finish reading this review I recommend you go buy this game and play it immediately 
 as it is just too good to be ignored. 
  
  Now lets move on to the gameplay. This game is very fun to play, but I guess it depends on the 
 persons tastes. If youre into games like The Sims or Rollercoaster Tycoon then youll love 
 the movies. The game is actually pretty hard and takes a while to learn the basic things you need 
 to know to play the game. Dont let this put you off though. The tutorial mode will guide you through 
 everything thats needed. The control is similar to RCT or The Sims with a basic left and right 
 mouse button technique and a use of the arrow keys to control the camera. If you play RCT or The 
 Sims a lot, youre fingers will feel right at home while playing The Movies. 
  
  Let me take you through the story and basic object of the game. The year is 1920 (or something 
 like that) and only a few (5) movie studios are around. People still arent convinced that these 
 so called Movies will last and the industry isnt exactly thriving. Your goal is to become the 
 most popular studio around by creating movies and hiring stars.
  
  The procedure of making movies goes as follows. First you make you hired script writers write a 
 script (this will take some time) , or alternatively make your own script using the Advanced Movie 
 Maker tool. The script is then sent to the casting office where you assign the lead and supporting 
 roles, director, movie crew and extras before shooting the movie with the sets you have bought 
 and releasing it to the public.
  
  The graphics in the game are average at best. They look blocky when editing up close, but when 
 looking at them from afar they seem quite sharp character models. The scenery is also average.
 
  
  The sound in this game is ok. There is a radio guy speaking and making announcements during the 
 game. His hatred of movies will really tick you off. Luckily he can be disabled. The tutorial voice 
 is droopy and boring, but it only lasts for the first few minutes. Apart from that all other dialog 
 is gibberish. You can add dialog to the movies you make easily using a USB microphone and your 
 mouth. The music in this game is cheerful yet repetitive and after a few hours of playing youll 
 want to turn it off. 
  
  This game doesnt get boring at all it is playable for as long as you wish and since it is just 
 plain fun, the replayability is unlimited.
  
  Id recommend this game to any tycoon fan and even if youre not a fan, The Movies is still a game 
 to check out.

Review:  This game is suck and stupid suck suck suck 
  That's what people always says suck suck................
  
  Actually, this game shows how studio 
 manager lives. Happy.........
  Nah, 
  
  it's quite okay yet fascinating. I was about to get bugged to this game coz' it's addicting and 
 fun. I really love this game. It's not that boring....
  Anyway, it's the best simulation game of the year. What can we say it was produced by Lionhead 
 Studios. And it's Peter Molynaux's. It's quite long and who doesn't like this game maybe it's not 
 suitable for them. My bro, Nezriq Eddy are not suitable for this game coz' he gets so bored of 
 this type of game easily. But me, 
  
  IT"S DAMN FUN AND

Review:  First off, the game 'The Movies' is a good game. Even though it didn't sell too well, the game 
 is still very awesome. The ability to make a movie in a game and tell the character what to do 
 on a set is fun as hell.
  
  The gameplay is cool, although maybe sometimes it can get boring; you still never lose interest. 
 The ability to create your orwn studio and manage it is awesome, as in creating salaries for your 
 stars and making movies in the advanced movie maker.
  
  The editor in the game is very easy and simple to use. Even if you are twelve years old, you can 
 use the movies editor. The best thing about this game is that when you create your own movie, you 
 can share it online at the 'Movies Online' website where you can review other peoples movies and 
 watch hundreds and thousands of movies created by other members.
  
  The only downside to this game is that it can be hard to create new movies or new 'original' movies. 
 You can select the set you want to use, such as the stage set, and then you choose what you want 
 the actor to do, example; talk on the phone. Trying to put together a great top of the line movie 
 and try to fit everything together is very difficult, but after awhile you will get the hang of 
 it. Also, the game may get a little bit repetitive.
  
  The graphics are good for the game and it can be a system hog as mentioned by Gamespot, but I don't 
 really feel like it is. Everything is nice and clean and I really liked the atmosphere the game 
 has created by the cool graphics and characters.
  
  The sound is good to, from the cars in your movie or to the guns a blazin'. When you create your 
 movie you can use your microphone and enter voice into your movie. And you can even make the characters 
 lips move by your voice, this is called 'lip synching' and is easy and fun to use.
  
  Personally, I believe this is a good game and when the expansion comes out, you can even do more 
 than just create World War II movies and Western movies, if you don't have this game. I recommend 
 that you get it for you can . . . if you are in school, use this game to create a project and the 
 teacher will be very impressed by what you did, it can be your secret on how you did it.
  
  So, go get this game. And get the expansion when it comes out.

Review:  No really
  
  b&w, Fable and now the movies!
  the movies is a game about making movies (Obvious! -_- )
  but it has also made it 20x easier to 
 make machinima videos due to the fact that it has its own machinima making tools a mic plug in 
 and several other features.
  though the game is good it is not challenging. it is very easy to be the best studio. nonetheless 
 this game is a quality game that deserves recognition and your money!
  
  features include
  
  -Make your own movies!
  -create stars in your own image or whatever image 
 you like in starmaker
  -submit your movies on-line and earn points to purchase new sets and objects

Review:  I dont think i have every played a game like this before! In this package you get three games ( 
 well kinda) . i will now tell you about the different sections of the game.
  
  1. a basic sims like game. you must control and care for your actors. You can change their cloths ( 
 can be very funny) , Make them talk to other actors, get their pictures taken, make them phone someone, 
 make them eat, make them drink ,ect. If you don't look after your actors they make get fat, drunk 
 or they may even quit there job with your studio! 
  This bit of the game is very fun, but does sometimes feel like there is something missing. i would 
 rate this section, 8/10. good but not great.
  
  2. building game ( like theme park world) . You can build your own studio, and add may different 
 things, e. g flags, cars, building, toilets, restaurant, bars and even grave stones. This can be 
 fun, but some times it seems a bit pointless as it isn't really necessary. 
  I would rate this bit 8/10 as well.
  
  3. Movie making!!! yay! finally! This is were you can 
 make your in movies! this is very fun and can have very funny results, however it isnt very detailed. 
 You must select a scene from a list and then customise it however you want. So at times it is a 
 bit limited ( not much gore/nudity/swearing/adult content) . It is however still very fun.
  I would rate this  9/10!

Review:  The movies is a diamond in rough. It brings a breeze of freshnes in to the Tycoon like games. Since 
 the topic fresh - up till now there was no other manager game that involves film making - if you 
 overseen Lula - the sexy empire, which is not a "real" manager game.
  Starting at the dawn of movie making, with small part of its elements, The movies introduces you 
 slowly - by time - in to the rolle of studio manager. Rate of these improvements is constant and 
 in a good tempo giving you inuff time to consolidate everything.
  Toward the ending of the game it seems as though gameplay becomes confusing - with everything apsolutely 
 screaming for your attention. At this level some sort of automation should have been enabled so 
 that the game takes care of smaller tasks trough scripts.
  The level of interactive making script for a movie is almost a complete new game with its complex 
 and bulging interface. Most gamers will be beter off with avoiding this alltogether so not to interupt 
 the nice flow to the game.
  It really is a game that bring great joy with success of your movies and stars, with some minor 
 polish mistakes.

Review:  Every time you begin thinking that the game will stop being interesting a new feature pops up... 
 The learning-curve never stops. You actually learn something from this game.. ;)
  
  For me this game is a new step forward in the sim gaming world. The game depth is beyond anything 
 I've played before.
  There's also a greater chance of getting confused than bored. But that's meant in a good way. You 
 learn so many new things in this game and it never stops. You just want to be better at it,,, all 
 the time...
  
  A big 9 from me!!
  
  Play it!! :-)

Review:  Being an aspiring film-maker myself I could not wait to get this game on my computer. I have had 
 it for 4 months and I am still loving it! I will try to do a god bad thing.
  
  THE GOOD: A highly addictive game with decent graphics, good sound and extremely fun gameplay. 
 With mods out now you can do so much to make a great movie. Custom backgrounds, sets, costumes 
 and even stuff to make cigarette holes and your new generation film Black and white. So if oyu 
 add what it lets you do which is a lot and all the mod stuff out and soon to be out you can make 
 an instant masterpiece. The main mode is fun with all the awards and the real life aspect to it 
 but sandbox mode is my favorite for sure. It is really fun to make movies and you can add your 
 own voice in it, with lip synching to make it look even better. The expansion pack will be out 
 this summer which brings stunt-men, action packed scenes and sets and so much more. Basically there 
 is a lot to hope for with the modding and the expansion pack. It has a great community with great 
 movie makers and nice people.
  
  Now the bad stuff even though hardly any.
  
  THE BAD: Like GameSpot says it can be some what of a system hog and even though in the good I put 
 graphics do not expect F. E. A. R or new generation graphics cuz that would not work with the design 
 of the game, or would it work for your computer. Uhm it takes a little bit to get use to and figure 
 out everything that you can do but the benefits of learning are really good. If you do not have 
 in interest in making movies, or if you don't really like movies there is not a lot for you.

Review:  Lionhead has a nac for making innovative games. Black and White, Fable, and so on. The Movies is 
 no different.... An innovative Tycoon game that re-invents the way the genre can be played.
  
  Pros: A change of pace after I played out Empire at War. The Movies is a solid Tycoon game.... 
 with a twist. Actor and Actresses that work for you have needs you are required to attend too. 
 Researching, writing and making movies, helping your stars practice their craft, building sets, 
 and helping your stars over addictions and stress... to name a few of the things you'll be doing. 
 It sounds boring, but it really isn't. You can make your own movies if you figure out how, or you 
 can have your directors produce pre-made films if your more interested in the building end of things. 
 The Movies is a fun and easy Tycoon game that almost anyone can play, but few can play to it's 
 fun potential.
  
  Cons: Hearing "A building needs your urgent attention" from the anouncer lady is really annoying. 
 There needs to be a way to jump around the map.

Review:  Gamers that often shop in the PC game section of their favorite department stores are likely to 
 site that out of all the games on the shelf, there is one type of game that outnumbers the rest. 
 This type of game is known simply as the tycoon game.
  
  These tycoon games give players complete control of businesses such as zoos, amusement parks, railroad 
 stations, casinos, and even schools while letting them run it in the way they feel is necessary. 
 Despite the abundance of these type games on store shelves, its not necessarily a great thing 
 as many of these games lack the right balance of depth and fun to even consider worthy of playing.
 
  
  However theres a new game in town that is not only one of the most in-depth tycoon games on the 
 market, but also one of the most genuinely fun. Activisions new game The Movies takes this tycoon 
 formula to the extreme as it gives gamers the ability to create and run every little facet of their 
 very own movie studio.
  
  The game starts out in the early 1920s at the beginning of the movie industry. Gamers start with 
 a rather sizeable chunk of money and are given an abundant amount of land that they are allowed 
 to call home. With these two things in tow, building a topnotch movie studio should be no sweat 
 at all, right? If only it were that easy.
  
  To start with, gamers need to hire a plethora of workers to complete the many different types of 
 jobs that help make a successful studio. As people run into the movie lot looking for jobs, finding 
 out what the person is good at is a necessity in the process of hiring them. People that have no 
 acting ability should be considered for a janitorial or building position, while people with not 
 only the ability to act, but the good looks as well, should be who players want in or directing 
 their movies. 
  
  Along with these type of workers, there are also many other important positions to fill. Some of 
 these include: extras, scriptwriters, film crew, scientists, and entourage. Even the lowliest of 
 lowly workers are required in this game as they keep the studio in perfect working harmony.
  
  While workers and actors are great and all, they very well cant get much work done without 
 some buildings and sets respectively.
  
  The buildings are where the backbone of a movie is created. Hiring actors and directors, writing 
 a script, rehearsing a script, releasing the movie, and getting PR for the movie all takes place 
 within the confines of these said facilities. 
  
  Once gamers go through the pre-production process of making a movie, they are then allowed to film 
 the actual movie on any of the various sets. Of course gamers should take into consideration that 
 what type of set they shoot their movies should match the genre of movie. Having a horror film 
 set in the middle of a circus tent isnt exactly the ideal spot for scary.
  
  When the dust has settled and all the right buildings and sets are built, this is when the true 
 fun begins for gamers. The name of the game now is balancing funds, keeping employees happy, and 
 competing with rival movie studios. It may sound like a lot of work, but this game is so easy to 
 pick up and play that the whole family will be fighting over the computer for their turn.
  
  One of the neatest things about The Movies is watching the continuous evolution of the movie 
 industry as the years chug by. Over the years new items will become available for players to make 
 better films with. Items such as new cameras, better CGI effects, better props, and more up-to-date 
 costumes will keep any movie studio fresh and popular.
  
  As previously mentioned, The Movies is a genuine blast to play. While it stands as one of the 
 deeper tycoon games around, the games in-depth tutorial will have friends and family alike brought 
 up to speed in no time. All this, plus the ability to upload created movie creations online to 
 share with others, makes this game one well-rounded PC game.

Review:  The Movies. If you like the Sims series, please keep reading.
  
  At first I was not to tempt by this game, especially with some of the review from other players, 
 but GP give an 8.2, so I said why not! I both the game and tried it.
  
  You begin with a small studio, looking like the ones in the 20s. Your main goal is to become THE 
 most prestigious movies maker. To get there you need basically need tree things: 
  1) You need to ire actors, directors, movie crews. You will need to train your actor in different 
 genre (comedy, horror, action and so on) . Better your actor is, better the movie, the same apply 
 to the director; he or she needs to train to get it better at it to achieve success. Your movie 
 crew will, with time, get better with the equipment and will have a better evaluation from the 
 critics (I will explain the role of the critics later) . 
  2) Mean wile you are training your actors and staffs, you will need to build a fabulous studio 
 not only for the good look, but to help your actor to feel better. Actors are very demanding, they 
 need attention, make over, entourage, and many other little thing that will make them feel better, 
 when they feel better, or in a good mood, they will perform better and the end result will be a 
 great film release. But be careful when planning, not only these special needs coming from your 
 actors, will ask you to build different buildings like restaurant, bar make over studio, plastic 
 surgery, but you will need to make space for your stages (decor) . So be careful when planning. (think 
 ahead!)
  3) Scripting, you will need to hire some people for creating your movie script, your scripter will 
 get better at what they do by doing it. More clearly, if you take one of your scripter and ask 
 him to do Action scripts, he will become better at doing them. Eventually you will be able to create 
 script and sale them, but be careful, you might just sale something great to one of your competitor.
 
  
  THE RELEASE: Releasing a movie is always fun, first you see the movie just like at the theatre, 
 but comes the Critics, who will evaluate your movie, and comment on it, this appears in a fun 
 format, their critic will appears in a headline format (newspaper, magazine) , like best film 
 ever so and so was terrific in this movie, and on and on. This will affect not only your studios 
 rating, but as well the one of your Actors and Directors, so be on the look out, they might need 
 some TLC after some releases. Not only critics have a impact on your staff, but as well on how 
 long your movie will stay on the market, longer it stays better profit.
  
  In conclusion, I like building the studios, placing Palm trees around some of the buildings, and 
 make it look just like the movies!!
  
  For the ones who want to micromanage your studio, there is two building you will be interested 
 in; the Custom Scripting Office and the Post production. The first on is use to modify the script 
 your scripter did, by adding scenes more content and more. The post production is use for adding 
 sounds and specials effects after, shooting the movie, which allows you the have a better movie 
 release.
  
  If you know how to manage a Sim, you will be at ease with the process, it a funny game, the interface 
 allows you to do different thinks with your actors, directors and its propose in a funny way, 
 like if you want a actor to go on a specific stage, you just have to click on him, lift him in 
 the air (youll hear his surprise) and drop it where you want it. Its easy to understand, you 
 can get around it in about 30 to 45 min. The tutorial is ok, it gives you the headlines, and from 
 there you will be fine. Dont be surprise to scrap your first or second game. You will probably 
 do some mistakes at the beginning, and as you know, they will affect the future.
  
  Its a nice game, fun to play, I still wonder how long I will keep playing at it, but I sure have 
 some entertainment with it now.
  
  Thanks for reading.

Review:  The only thing that makes this game real fun is that you can send your movies online to be reviewed. 
 If it weren't for that this game would suck. The game itself is really hard and annoying especially 
 when your trying to make a movie and your stars won't stop complaining. The Sandbox mode is my 
 relief though, because you can turn off all the stress and pull of the real game. You can start 
 off with millions of dollars and no stress for the stars. This is what you use if you really want 
 to make a movie. The movie making elements of the game are alright. I wish there were more choices, 
 but there is an expansion pack coming out so we'll have to see. Other then that this game is a 
 keeper, a definetly worth the money if you a very creative person. Get this game!!!

Review:  I will not gloss over the Tycoon aspect of the The Movies. Simply picture the Sims, replace "Sims" 
 with Stars, add reviews and award shows, and a local radio show and you have the Tycoon aspect 
 of the game. Perhaps I am not being fair, but if you have played any of the Sims at all you will 
 get the point rather quickly. 
  
  That brings us to the second portion of The Movies, and what some might say is an entirely new 
 game unto itself. Simply put, never before have developers put tools like these (Perhaps excluding 
 the mod craze of Half-Life and Half-Life 2) into the hands of ordinary folks like us. And the results 
 are stupendous. Take nearly every prop, costume and set you could possible imagine, add more scenes 
 than a Peter Jackson flick, and you have the Movies, not the Movies Tycoon. If you want, you could 
 make a cheesy Kung-Fu flick, or a gritty World War II film, or a horror movie taking place on a 
 space ship involving giant chickens. In short, the possibilties are endless. The game packs with 
 it five major genres: Romance, Action, Sci-Fi, Horror, and Comedy. Certainly you could create a 
 gore fest but the true (And best) directors mold all of those genres into one Movie, and those 
 Movies are the ones that rise to the top. How could I forget the amazing editing tools? Those will 
 make and break a good movie. 
  
  I could go on and on about the movies I have done myself personally, but I would just encourage 
 you to go themoviegame. com and check the player created ones out for yourself. If that doesnt convince 
 you that the Movies is a great game, and a revolution in its own part, nothing will. 
  
  I will never look at sims the same way again.

Review:  The Movies Review
  
  Have you ever wanted to be a movie star, a movie director, or a janitor that cleans up at the movie 
 sets? In the game The Movies, brought to us by Lionhead Studios (makers of Black and White series 
 and Fable) allows you to do all of these things, to some extent. The Movies is a game that lets 
 you make your own movies, release them to the public, and see how they fair in the box office. 
 This may sound simple and it is, but this is one of the most addicting games I have ever experienced 
 in my life. 
  
  Story
  While this game doesnt have a major, on the edge of your seat, thrilling story its not all bad. 
 The Movies actually doesnt really have a detailed plot. This game is very similar to The Sims. 
 You pretty much make the games story however you want it to be. If you want to have an extravagant 
 studio that puts out five start movies, you can. If you want to have a low budget, dirty, grimy 
 studio that no one hears about, go ahead. Either way you start out with an empty lot and a case 
 full of cash. You are the head of a movie studio that wants to be the biggest and badest movie 
 studio out there. (If thats what you want to do) You can use the money to buy things and make 
 your studio great. After that, you are on your own. See, I told you there wasnt much story.
  
  Gameplay
  The gameplay is where this game shines. Its so simple yet so deep. Its so addicting 
 yet sometimes frustrating. As I said before you start out with an empty lot and a small amount 
 of money. (This is the story mode, while the sandbox mode will allow you to start out with a fully 
 built studio) You can take a short and very informative tutorial that I suggest you should take. 
 After that it is off to make your studio great. There is a choice of buildings to build, sets to 
 build, and ornaments to build. Buildings that you can build are a wide variety of buildings that 
 any major movie corporation has. There is a restaurant, a bar, a postproduction office, a script 
 office, a rehearsal building, and a laboratory to make new advancements. Some buildings, like trailers, 
 are the same buildings they just get better as they are unlocked. But before you can start building 
 buildings you need to hire your workers.
  There are many types of workers that you can hire. There are the builders that build for you, there 
 are the janitors that will keep your area free of trash, the movie stars who will act in your movies 
 or throw a tantrums and get on your nerves, there are the directors that help make the movies and 
 shoot them, the extras for when you need someone to stand in the background of a movie, the movie 
 crew who have the cameras and shoot your movie, the scriptwriters who well, write your script, 
 and finally there are the scientist who develop new technology and things to make your studio better. 
 While this may seem like you need a lot of people to make your studio go right, you dont. You 
 only really need two of everything except for the movie starts and the scientist. The limited amount 
 of people you need helps the game easier to play. But remember this, the bigger your studio, the 
 more janitors and builders you will need. 
  In The Movies story mode, and in the sandbox mode you will have a studio rating and what position 
 you are in the charts. In story mode you feel more attached to your rating because it actually 
 can help you. The studio rating is out of five stars and each star has 4 spaces to fill. If you 
 release a new movie and its popular, you usually get another part of a star. If you use ornaments 
 (foliage and things like that) to make the studio more stunning, then you get a part of a star. 
 If your janitors and repairmen keep the studio lot upkeep at a high level, you get a part of a 
 star. If you win a reward, you get part of a star. There are a lot of ways to win a star, but its 
 hard to get them.
  The movie making process is a pretty easy one, unless you make your own script. If you dont make 
 your own script and go off the scriptwriters script then its simple. You just have to get a few 
 script writers to make a script, once its done, take the script and put it in the production office 
 so that your stars can start practicing it, once they are done, take it and start filming. While 
 they are filming it, you just have to wait until they are done. Depending on the stars moods, it 
 will get done fast or slow. While I wait I like to decorate my studio to make it more appealing. 
 Once they are done filming, if you have one, you can take the movie to the postproduction office 
 and add voices, captions, music, and sound effects. After you are done with that, release the film 
 and see how it does. If you make your own script then you make whats going to happen in the movie, 
 and you can add lighting and weather effects. After you are done, do the same thing that the scriptwriters 
 script did. 
  Every 5 years in story mode there is an awards show. This is one of my favorite parts to the game. 
 There are two awards presenters that give out the award. The starting year there are only about 
 4 awards that are given out. The basic awards are best movie, best star, best director, and best 
 studio. Every awards ceremony there is a new award that is given out. If you win an award then 
 you get a special ability. Some examples are your scientist work faster, and your stars never get 
 in a bad mood. There are usually about 5 or 6 studios that are competing against each other. The 
 awards are a nice touch to the game.
  
  Graphics 
  The Movies is a great looking game. The game is a system hogger, no doubt but my computer is pretty 
 crappy and it still had luscious foliage, and very detailed buildings. The character models are 
 all different from each other. While their faces might be different, the scientist, janitors, builders, 
 and crewmen all wear pre-picked out clothing. But even better that the character models are the 
 character animations. In the movies, there are so many options that have so many different animations 
 used, and they are all perfectly executed by the actors and actresses. When some one has nothing 
 to do in the game, they usually wonder around the lot looking for something or talking to other 
 people. One of my favorites is when some one is bored they look in the windows of the buildings. 
 While everything looks great, if you have a weak rig, then there will be terrible lag and even 
 stops sometimes, but everything goes back to normal after it loads. 
  
  Sound
  The sound in The Movies is great. There is a radio that is constantly playing all the time. The 
 radio is on the same station all the time but every 10 years or so, a new radio personality comes 
 on. The amassing part about it is that every single one of them is great, and different in their 
 own ways. Its fun to listen to them talk about things that have been happing in that decade. When 
 the announcers arent talking there is music playing. The music is very fitting for the time period 
 that you are in, in the game. Every 10 years or so, the music on the radio changes slightly to 
 fit the time era. 
  The characters in the game dont talk unless they are directors and all they say are action, 
 cut, and thats a rap. All of the other people only speak in mumble. Like Simlish but no words 
 are actually said. Overall, the music sets the tone, while you are waiting around, and the music 
 in the movies make the movies more interesting. 
  
  Controls 
  The controls of the game are very simple and very similar to the Sims. You use the arrow keys to 
 move around, or hold the mouse at the edge of the screen to move around. To pick some one up, click 
 on them and drag them to where you want to put them. There arent many controls in The Movies, 
 but there are hotkeys to bring up different things. Overall, the controls are very simple and easy 
 to use. 
  
  Replay Value
  This game has some of the best replay value in a game that I have ever played. You can make every 
 movie different from the last or make the same movie over and over. Thats the biggest thing that 
 makes you want to come back to this game is that you can make it how you want it. I played the 
 sand box mode for about 20 hours and the story mode for about 20 hours. Thats 40 hours of gameplay 
 and I still aint done playing it. If thats not replay value, I dont know what is. 
  
  Conclusion
  Overall, this is one of the most fun games I have played in years. The shear amount 
 of movies that you can make is staggering. The Movies is simple yet oh so fun and its a game that 
 will keep you coming back and making movies until your eyes bleed

Review:  Once you get to the end the first time you have played The Movies and you have a couple other games 
 you want to get to, there is no real motivation to play this game again. You've done it, there 
 is nothing more and you have seen what there is to see in this game. It is a lot of un, and I spent 
 a lot of hours giving it a go, I even got to the final year and played a little bit beyond. Will 
 I play it again? I might, when I have nothing else to do and I look back at all the games I may 
 replay, this one will stay on the list, and that is saying a lot because I am pretty choosy about 
 that list.
  
  This is certainly one of my more vague reviews because it is very personally approached, but all 
 the other reviews give you an idea of what to expect, I am giving you an idea of what the game 
 is worth to a RTS lifer. If you haven't played it and you enjoyed games like the Sims or Space 
 Colony, this is a different twist on what is becoming a classic platform for strategy gaming. By 
 now, the Movies is dropping in price, so if you have been putting it off, now is the time to try 
 it out if you have no other games on the go.

Review:  Making your own movies was a thing i always wanted to make. Sure you can make movies but the scenes 
 don't all add up to what you're trying to make. You will sit there and think. I want to creat this 
 but it won't lead up to what i am aiming for. The only thing that can improve this game is expansion 
 packs. From what you have in this game is awesome but it seems like a demo to what lionhead can 
 add to this game. Overall it is a good game, easy to play, sound sort of annoys me after a while, 
 graphics are nice smooth in some cases but in others ahh not so great. Well Overall it's a good 
 game but nothing too insane.

Review:  The Movies is a fun game that really shows the movie world well. You play as a studio owner that 
 begins with a studio lot in the early 1920's. IT's your time to make the hits and some of the flops 
 of Hollywood. The game may not be exactly what you want or expect, but it still remains as probably 
 the best tycoon game ever and allows you to make some great movies of your own if you can be creative 
 with what Lionhead has given you.
  
  As everyone knows, a game isn't good unless it plays well. As for The Movies, it plays real well, 
 at least after you learn the basics. This takes from 30 minutes to about an hour. ONce you get 
 the basics down, you can build your studio lot with basic and needed buildings, movie sets, and 
 additional add-ons to help give your lot some prestige. Your studio is rated on five things: Stars, 
 Movie Quality, Lot Prestige, Awards Won, and Your Profit made. The most important thing to have 
 out of these is profit. It is the thing that counts for most of your ratings. You're also graded 
 on the quality of movies that you've released. Movies are rated on the acting, direction and the 
 profit that the movie makes in the box office. Movies will get better and better as time goes buy. 
 They'll also be required to be longer to get better reviews. Stars are probably the hardest thing 
 to keep up. Stars are rated on their movie success, their relationships with other stars, their 
 press likeliness, their wages, their trailor prestige, their entourage, and their looks. Stars 
 are kind of like Sims. They have needs and wants that you have to fulfill so they feel better and 
 will perform better. Their performances are key to having a good movie. If they don't feel good 
 or don't have enough experience in the genre, you're movies will get bad reviews from the press. 
 Stars can get bored if they aren't in a movie and will get stressed if they're in too many movies. 
 It's key that you don't put them in too many or too little movies, or else their ratings will drop 
 and so will the movie ratings. Stars will eventually need trailors and the type of trailor and 
 it's decoration can boost their feelings and their ratings. This is pretty easy to keep fulfilled, 
 however, it may be a pain in the butt if you have more than 8 stars. Your lot prestige counts as 
 a pretty major part of your studio rating. This is probably the easiest thing to get a good rating 
 in because all you have to do is make sure that most of you lot's covered with grass, has little 
 litter, and that the buildings are well taken care of. I found little problems with keeping a perfect 
 rating in this. Awards really don't effect your studio rating much, but it does help your stars 
 and rating to at least have a couple. Every five game years, there's an award show for the best 
 in the categories for your actors, movies, and studio stuff. As time goes by, there's more categories, 
 so this shouldn't be too much of a worry to accomplish. Some other stufr that you can do in the 
 game is make your own movies. I found this to be pretty fun. I didn't feel too limited, but felt 
 a little restrained to what types of scenes I could put in my movies. I think that this will probably 
 be resolved in the future expansion, so no worries. I had to deduct a point cause I found that 
 the game was more based on the studio than really the whole movie making process and what happens 
 when you make movies. Gameplay: 9/10
  
  Graphics aren't the most important thing in a game to me, but it can really help you be immersed 
 into a game. I found that this game had pretty good graphics for a tycoon game. The effects and 
 stuff were great. I did find some polygon effects that weren't quite right and I also found some 
 character movement that wasn't right at all. Other than that, the game looks great. I thought that 
 the game's high quality and low quality are total opposites so this differs for everyone. Graphics: 
 8/10
  
  The sound really brings a game alive. The Movies really relied on some great sound effects when 
 playing in the studio. The game has a radio that explains what's happening during the era and what 
 is going on with the movie studios. I really enjoyed this aspect of the game cause it took off 
 a lot of stress you may feel at some times. The music sounded pretty good, but it wasn't as good 
 as Halo, or some of the Nintendo themes, but it fit the game pretty well. I found that some of 
 the gun effects and explosions for action scenes weren't as good as they could've been. Also, some 
 of the mumbling was over-used. But I don't care about that much. Sound: 9/10
  
  Well, was this game worth forty bucks? Yep, it really was. I'm glad that I got this game. I'm a 
 film buff and it really gave me something to do that helped me get some hold on what happens behind 
 the scenes. The gameplay was good, the graphics were fine, the sound was great, so yeah, you should 
 definetely think of buying this game. You won't be sorry if you do.
  Value: 9/10
  
  Overall I thought that this was a great game that did tons of stuff right while being focused on 
 something a bit different than most will want or expect. I was really hoping that there would be 
 some more options for some scenes and there really wasn't any camera controls or decision for where 
 the camera will be, but that's really the only donwfalls of the game. Other than that, the game 
 is really fun. I'm sure that someone who barely watches much movies will still have fun with this 
 game cause it has great appeal. There is a lot of depth and there's a lot of customization which 
 really fulfills a lot of the stuff that many people will want from the game. Also, once you make 
 a movie, you can send it to your friends, or you can put it on the game's website and see what 
 other people think of your creation. I really have enjoyed this game and I m sure I'll be consumed 
 with it for a while.
  Tilt:9/10
  
  The movies is a great step and look at the movie industry. I think that if you have any interest 
 in it, you should get it.

Review:  While I don't usually like strategy games, I can make an exception for the good people over at 
 Lionhead studios. I love The Movies with all my PC-gaming heart. I was supposed to get this game 
 for Christmas, but I accidentally bought it before then. I have been playing this game for a long 
 time. I have spent at least 20 hours on each of my accounts. It does a lot of things right. For 
 instance, the online feature is great, even including a whole website dedicated to the movies people 
 made for their online accounts. It's just too bas that my online feature doesn't work.

Review:  the movies is a very good games, its divide in three things. first the tycoon , this the hardest 
 part of the game because you have to create the studio and place the things well.
  
  the second part that the game divides in is the stars this is like a copy of the sims because you 
 have to take care of the stars so, that they will do a good performance in you movie. this gets 
 really annoying after a while
  
  the third part is the movie making , this games lets you be in the shoes of the director, creating 
 your own movies, in a ny set you want with any star that you have.
  
  a really good thing about this game is the star making , this is a place where you make your own 
 star, manage how he looks , his name and everything.
  
  so i would say that this game is a good mix of other games, creating the game-play very addictive. 
 so i give this game 1 and a half thumbs up, just because after a while you get bored of it

Review:  I've always wanted to make a movie featuring a Horse eating Lizard who is killed by the Milatary, 
 and i have, and you can watch it online! Some people say that this is just a copy of the sims, 
 but its not. All you have to do is choose a director and as many actors as you want You can choose 
 out of the movie types: Action, Comedy, Horror, Sci Fi and Romance. 
  The graphics in the game are good and so is the gameplay. I would highly recomend this game instead 
 of getting Rollor Coster Tycoon which my crazy friend did, look where he is now! There is only 
 one catch to this game, it's no fun unless you post your good movies online. Once you've done that 
 you will earn points which you can use to download new items and sets!

Review:  The Movies is one of the few games that I've played the seems like it will never get old. The game 
 itself feels like two games in one. The first part of the game is a strategy game which puts you 
 in the spot of a movie studio manager. You have to manage everything from hiring actors to repairing 
 studio restrooms. You begin around the 1920s and work your way up to present day and beyond making 
 movies, winning awards, and making your studio the number one studio in the movie industry. As 
 you play, your objective is to win awards for the Movie Award show that happens every ten years. 
 This means you have to have your cocky actors and directors be stress-free and loving their job, 
 which can be a hassle as their popularity goes up. Winning awards will give you new buildings or 
 make your job easier such as: researchers will work faster, stars will not get an eating addiction, 
 etc. 
  
  The second part of the game is where you get to make your very own movies. Once you unlocked the 
 advanced script writing building, you will be able to write and produce your own script. By making 
 your own movies you must pick the lead actors, pick a good background for your idea for that scene, 
 then pick an action out of a large selection of actions. Once all of this is done you can add your 
 own voice over and add background music and sound effects. Once your masterpiece is done comes 
 the fun part. By signing up to The Movies homepage you can upload your movie for other users to 
 see and rate. This will effect your ranking on your account at the website making you work for 
 a good ranking and keep on dishing out good movies. 
  
  Really The Movies is a great game. A few minor flaws in it, but hardly any of them are all that 
 noticeable. Once the expansion set comes out this game will offer more things to make your movies 
 even more unique. There really is no end to the game, as long as your creative juices keep flowing 
 out of your noggin.

Review:  This is one of the best games I have ever played. It has great tycoon style gameplay, and has an 
 amazing movie making tool. The movie making tool allows you to create some great movies, which 
 can be as long as you want and you can also add your own voice and have actors lip-sync to the 
 speech. The graphics are great, with lots of detail on every set. The sound is very good, with 
 an in-game radio playing in the background (the news flashes are hilarious!) . I highly recommend 
 this game to everyone, and it is well worth the money!

Review:  The game is alot like a tycoon game at first, because you have to build your movie studio (unless 
 you go to sandbox made) . This part is ok but the real fun is in making movies. You can select two 
 main modes: sandbox where you get making films right away, or the story (or main mode whatever you 
 wanna call it!) mode. It's starts in the 1920's then every five year's you studio goes to an award 
 cerimony! In the early parts of the game they all rate bad! You can even post your movies on www. themoviesgame. com 
 or just watch other peoples.
  
  Good: Making movies is rrrrrrrrrrrreally
  fun!
  
  Bad: You can only make black and white films in the start!

Review:  On November 8th of 2005, Peter Molyneux brought something new to the table. Being one of the more 
 creative, innovative developers, Molyneux wanted to give players the chance to make their own movies 
 where they could write their own storyline, use their own props, and create their own actors. 
 
  
  Fans have to wonder if all the promises that Molyneux gave to them would actually come true though, 
 because in the past, Peter has been known to promise different ideas that he couldnt necessarily 
 deliver upon, for example, Fable. It was a great game, but what he initially described and what 
 it was when it was finally released were two different games. Not major changes that would disrupt 
 the flow of gameplay, but those who were hyped waiting for the innovations would always be disappointed. 
 And thats not to say other developers havent done it in the past, but Molyneux is pretty much 
 known for it and in his newest game, The Movies, he does it yet again, but instead of chip away 
 at the previously promised ideas that never sprouted, Ill talk about the game itself.
  
  There are two modes to play for The Movies with one being a campaign and the other being where 
 youre given the chance to create movies from the get go. The campaign starts you off in the 1920s 
 where you must first hire actors and build your production agency. From there on, youre given 
 limited resources to start creating your movies. Of course, because its during the 1920s, your 
 movies will only be in black and white and without sound. As you progress throughout the years 
 to the present, youll gain new buildings and options as you strive to win awards for the different 
 movies you create. The campaign mode is presented as a simulation game where you must hire and 
 fire all employees including the actors in your movies, the maintenance crew that builds your different 
 buildings and cleans up your area, researchers for new technologies, writers for scripts, and many 
 other positions. Even who is part of each actors entourage. And this game thinks of every aspect 
 of the filming business where your actors need a place to eat, relax, workout, and socialize with 
 others to relieve their stress. They must be happy with their wage and their different roles in 
 the films they star in. There is quite a bit of micromanagement throughout the singular campaign 
 and as time progresses and you try to win more and more awards, youll be given more and more sets 
 and costumes for your actors to deal with when making different movies. Stars will grow old throughout 
 their time with your production agency and youll have to decide either to retire them early, give 
 them plastic surgery, or keep them on the payroll to satisfy their needs and up the popularity 
 of your agency. Youre given many choices throughout the different campaign, and each choice plays 
 a role in the finality of the end game. If youre able to win the awards you need by the end year 
 of the game, youll be able to keep playing as you try to become a five star production agency.
 
  
  The other style of play is where youre able to start making movies from the beginning, but unless 
 youve played the campaign, not everything will be unlocked for you including costumes and sets. 
 Youll only be given the options of materials a few decades ahead of the 1920s if you havent 
 already gone through it, so many will try to rush through the campaign to unlock everything. During 
 the campaign, you may not get the time you need to fully create one of your own movies, so Lionhead 
 gives you option to have the computer actually create the movie for you while you manage the rest 
 of the agency. While this may seem like a drawback at first, youll appreciate the extra time youre 
 given to concentrate on creating a superb production company. Once you start actually making the 
 movies yourself, you have quite a bit of control, but understand that you dont have total control 
 as was once promised by Molyneux. Youre able to write your own scripts, record your own voice 
 for the actors, pick and choose sets and costumes, decide which actors will be in the film and 
 also what actions will take place during the progression of the film. Youll be able to pick 
 which actions take place in what order from a multitude of actions and animations created by Lionhead 
 Studios, but you wont be able to say actor Bob, punch actor Jim on the left cheek with your right 
 hand. Although some fans wont be pleased with not having total utter control, Lionhead Studios 
 strives to bring the player as close as they can.
  
  The graphics within The Movies are well done and are presented mostly like what you see in The 
 Sims 2. There are different and unique set designs that you can pick and choose for each movie 
 and a bunch of different costumes with different colors to go over for your different actors and 
 actresses that youll unlock throughout the campaign and youre able to zoom in and out and fully 
 rotate the camera as you scan your production company from afar. Even while zoomed in, the game 
 looks great and while a film is being made, you can see the actors going through their actions 
 up close while its happening which is entertaining. The colors within the game are clear and crisp 
 and you, as a player, are given multitudes of choices to spruce up your company lot area to make 
 it more presentable to the different actors as they walk around while not filming pictures.
  
  The sound within the game is done quite well and will keep you entertained throughout the lengthy 
 campaign. The background music will change upon the time era that youre in giving a sense of nostalgia 
 to the player as time passes on. There is also an announcer who talks about the different events 
 coming up and gives little tidbits about the different happenings that are taking place around 
 the world. When you watch a film after it has been created, unless you yourself provide the dialogue, 
 the conversation within the movie is given a gibberish language with subtitles for you to understand 
 the storyline.
  
  The game ships with a separate side program where you can name and create your own actors and actresses 
 to import into either your campaign or your different movies during the sandbox mode style of gameplay. 
 This can add a lot to the game where you can recreate yourself and your friends and substitute 
 them into the game and put them into the different movies you want and watch them grow old as you 
 tend to their different needs and wants. Decide upon the different wages of each of your actors/friends 
 and give them different size trailers to live in while they work for your production company. A 
 small program out of the whole installation, but definitely something that adds quite a bit.
  
  There isnt really a multiplayer component to the game, but you are able to put your movies 
 online for others to watch and judge on a range from one to five stars and give either criticism 
 or praise for your hard work. With the limited animations and sets though, you may find yourself 
 watching similar movies. The thing that differentiate movies from one another are going to be the 
 storylines within the movies and also the different voice acting. So far, in the short time that 
 the games been released, there have been quite a few of great quality films that have been quite 
 long in length. We can only look forward to whats in store for the future.
  
  Even though the game didnt come through with all the innovations that Peter Molyneux once told 
 us about and the fact that youre not given total control over everything in the aspect of making 
 the movie of your choice, The Movies does come through on giving the player a great experience 
 with running their own film production company and making some pretty decent movies with whats 
 available. Those who enjoy simulation games should really check out The Movies because of how many 
 different aspects of the film making industry your given the opportunity of dealing with.

Review:  Nobody can even pretend to say that this game is not a big push down the innovation road!! I love 
 the game and it really is a beautifully done "Sim movies" game my only complain is that a couple 
 of years after starting your 1st studio with the many sets and building you researsh and get access 
 to things start to get out a little out of hands!! i mean it's kinda overwhelming managing 3 or 
 4 movie start with a couple of directors while keeping your writers coming up with new exciting 
 scrips plus maneging the lots and the maintanance... the shooting... the producing... the editing 
 and keeping everybody happy ouf... it's kinda of too much work after a while. But still I insist 
 that this is a great game!

Review:  I was a fan of the themehospital/themepark games, but never got into the tycoon series. These types 
 of simulation/management games were never really my cup of tea (I enjoy them, but prefer FPS & 
 RPGs) but when I heard about the movies & the prospect of making my very own films I picked up 
 a copy.
  
  One of the great things about the movies is it has something for both the tycoon fans as well as 
 people who just want to make their own films. You can play through the long "campaign/story" mode. 
 Going from early film era to modern prick-movie star times. Unlocking goodies left & right. Or 
 you can try "sandbox" mode & just start crackin on making your own films without worrying about 
 financing aspect or star moods. I should add they did an excellent job showing the different time 
 periods.
  
  The GOOD: The game is just plain fun. Almost a perfect mix of the sims + a tycoon game. But then 
 you've got the film maker/editor which, mixed with the other 2 game types, makes for lots of replay. 
 Great graphics. Can add your own backdrops & voice-overs. An online community is up & running so 
 you can share your movies with others or just grab a Dr. Pepper & watch the thousands of movies 
 others have made (Or grab a sprite if that's what you're into) .
  
  The BAD: While there are a lot of outfits & sets somehow it feels they're aren't enough. You'll 
 find yourself using the same sets over & over & getting bored with them. The good news is they 
 are releasing an expansion pack sometime Q2 2006. The in-game radio station can get annoying at 
 times (luckily it can be turned off) . The actual movie maker/editor can be a bit confusing at first, 
 but there are helpful tutorials.
  
  If you like watching movies (who doesn't) you'll get a genuine kick out of this game. The details 
 & total package in general is just plain fun. My fiance & I have spent hours working on our own 
 cinematic masterpieces. Sometimes the gameplay gets dull but you options are there & the game does 
 offer a lot. I'd recommend it to almost anybody & with the expansion on the horizon you'll most 
 likely find yourself coming back to the Movies.

Review:  For theose past I don't know 3 years, Lionhead Studios has been updating news about their upcoming 
 project The Movies. Although, when this game was first announced, not alot of fans already wanting 
 it. Mainly because it looked like it won't be a good game. In 2005 however, things changed and 
 so many people realized "Hey, I want to be popular and be a filmmaker so why not do that in 'The 
 Movies'". Now the game is out and already the community (movies. lionhead. com) is already filled 
 with filmmakers trying to be the best, to have fun, or really want to be famous. Yes, I know doing 
 that is hard but thats just the online part.
  
  In the story mode (which actually doesn't have story) you have just made a new film studio during 
 the times when the film industry was new to the public. Obviously, right away you gotta have some 
 strageties to make sure you don't go bankrupt and all of that. Once you've gone to a really great 
 road, now its time to make a movie. For some reason, in the early times (20s, 30s) you don't make 
 your own script, the AI makes your own script which just goes to show the game thinks your a NOOB. 
 During the story mode, you will be in Awards show, getting Broadcasts, and etc. The story mode 
 is kind of pleasing though annoying sometimes which I RECCOMEND going to Sandbox.
  
  If you have a movie that you think is done, you take it Post Production. This part of editing is 
 so slow. Every time you drag a cursor, it will take 5 or 10 seconds just to take it to a scene. 
 This recommends you need Windows Medio Player 9 and the system that is also needed for Battlefield 
 2. Although, if you annoy the lag in editing, you'll be fine. Then afterdone editing, there's a 
 upload for sound which takes up depending how long the movie is, and then a upload for exporting 
 it to your computer which takes 15-45 minutes. The editing to me is quite disapointing.
  
  The online is really the bad part if you want to publish them. For example, if you work on movie 
 that is 19 minutes long, has voice overs or subtitles, and was well recieved in the game, and you 
 publish Online. Well what if nobody rated it, or what is everybody only gives it 1-3 stars. Also, 
 there is some glitches with Online, Online accounts, and Online Publishing. I suggest stay away 
 Online (if you want to) and just watch the movies instead.
  
  Overall, the gameplay is new and fresh, but all of the stuff that is really bad sadly pushes it 
 to 8 instead of 10 or 8.9. The graphics is so great however the muddy textues of the video you 
 made is bad making it 8. The sound is great especially during the game as well as the soundtrack 
 of songs you can pick for your movie. The tilt is so easy because it doesn't have any hard controls 
 for doing movies, making your studio, etc. 
  
  The value is right away a must-buy. Gotta pick it up.
  
  8 out of 10

Review:  This game is a fair type of game its not good its just plain fair. Im not very good its good for 
 a good 2 hours right when you buy then after that its not any fun. Im very disapointed on how its 
 kinda like a copy off of the Sims kinda because the dialouge is bad. I wouldnt recommend this game 
 maybe just rent it on Gamefly then just return it and be over with it. Overall I thought it was 
 just a average game not the best game but its fair. Dont buy it. Just rent it then get over with 
 it

Review:  I'm not one to normally buy a new release title. It's rare that I do, for possibility of being 
 disappointed. Why should I bother, I ask myself, when I can pick up several cheaper alternatives 
 and lessen the chance of not feeling disappointed? But then there are games I simply must get when 
 they come out. The Movies was one of these, and thankfully, it provides a thrilling experience 
 which is unlike any other.
  
  However, if you must compare, I would say it most echo's Peter Molyneux's own "Theme Park" series, 
 with a smattering of "The Sims" with a healthy injection of "Windows Movie Maker" or some other 
 movie making application. There are two very distinct ways of playing The Movies, with a tycoon 
 game that tasks you with creating a profitable Movie Studio from the dawn of film (and into the 
 near future) , as well as a powerful Movie Maker, allowing you to create your own masterpiece.
 
  
  After installing and watching the cute opening movie, I chose to begin a new game, with 2 choices 
 on offer, "New Game" and "Sandbox". These are self explanatory, but it is worth noting that more 
 is unlocked in Sandbox via play in the feature game. There is also a very impressive Tutorial (which 
 is backed up by helpful tips on the web and an excellent manual) which will ease you into play 
 gradually. This is a good thing, as the simplistic and light hearted feel belies a game brimming 
 with ideas, possibilities and difficulty.
  
  The very start of a film usually begins with a Script, so you need to hire scriptwriters and a 
 facility in which to house them to create a script for you. Choose one of the five core genres 
 (Horror, Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi and Action) and get them scribbling away. Writing a script in 
 this hands-off manner is simple, and can produce better than average films, but for those who want 
 a higher degree of control, you can also write your own.
  
  After the completion of a Script, it will sit at the Casting Office, where you must hire a Director, 
 Star, Extras and Crew. This is easily accomplished, with movie hopefuls lining up at the appropriate 
 buildings dreaming to be the next big hit. After rehearsals, its off to the Sets. Creating sets 
 is simple enough, though it requires Builders to create (again, easily hireable) as well as maintain. 
 Your Studio Lot also requires maintenance and beautifying, which can be done by hiring Janitors.
 
  
  Given the choice of both hands off and hands on film making is highly intuitive. Films given your 
 own personal touch generally do better upon release, and can be saved and shared online. You may 
 even download and inspect others works of art, and given the short time since The Movies has been 
 made available, its surprising to see just how good some Movies already are.
  
  Producing and Post Production complete, you may release the film to the expectant public. You receive 
 reviews and helpful criticisms upon release, helping you understand where you may go better. On 
 occasion, you're stars may not have good on screen chemistry, and so may need more time together. 
 This might make you place them in a Bar, but be careful, as some Stars may get a little carried 
 away on the Alcohol. Not only must you tend to a well weathered Studio, but your Stars have their 
 own needs, and if left stressed or frustrated, will bring your movies down. New age medicine, Liposuction 
 and even a trip into the local Rehab can help straighten your Stars out, and more prospective Employees 
 (even from rival Studios, if your Movie Studio does well) will continue to show up.
  
  It's a lot to deal with, so it's good to note that the interface and game alerts are simple, and 
 the game itself usually forgiving. Given a 3D overlap of your studio, you can zoom in and out and 
 around with ease, however, most of your time playing as a Tycoon will be spent Zoomed out, zipping 
 around your various Sets and facilities. It is worth noting that Film releases tie in with world 
 events, with the race to the moon being a boon for Sci-Fi Film making, and the Seventies making 
 easy money off Comedies and Musicals.
  
  Like the Tycoon play in The Movies, making films is easy and intuitive, with a excellent tutorial 
 and scaled difficulty. You can have just the amount of control you think you'll need. You can choose 
 to go the entire way, adding voiceovers and sound effects of your own design if you wish, and creating 
 a 5 star film is truly satisfying (and hard, but practice helps) . While making your own machinima 
 is a great deal of fun, the reviewing of your own content is rather standard, and so it's thankful 
 that The Movies easily allows you to export the films through a variety of common video formats, 
 and share online. Competitions are beginning to show up as well, and it's always fun to see what 
 others are creating.
  
  The Movies is not without flaws though, and there are few that can spoil the gameplay. The steep 
 learning curve will all but alienate the casual player, and the very hands-on approach needed to 
 coax your films into blockbusters is more tiring than fun. The Awards Ceremonies are a good chance 
 to give the player a goal to strive for - but you can win awards using all the same tactics in 
 play. Realistically, you can recreate your film over and over again, with one different camera 
 change and win an award.
  
  If you are to take a hands-off approach, you would be suprised as too just how many films can be 
 made, the large writing staff will constantly churn out titles for you. But unfortunately, they 
 are scripted to only the sets you have built, and in many cases, there is a feeling of sameness 
 after some time. There is no on location shooting either, you are held at your Studio, so many 
 times your films have a feeling of being stuffy and unrealistic. I didn't have the patience to 
 create films with all the tools available, and while this hands off approach makes for some fun 
 films, the stunted nature and contrived atmosphere was off-putting. Similarily, I was bored by 
 many of the films I created.
  
  Graphically, The Movies is pretty impressive - with well animated Stars and Directors. These 2 
 groups also have distinct personalities, and seeing that these are what you will be spending the 
 majority of your time with, makes you appreciate the amount of depth involved. The other groups, 
 Builders, Scriptwriters and so on look a little similar, and are more automatic in nature - as 
 such, you wont care for them like you treasure your talent (just like in the real Hollywood, regardless 
 of how professional these people are) . Facilities and Sets are pretty basic, but are easily acceptable. 
 Moving people around the Lot and placing them in individual sections of your Buildings is simple, 
 you will have no problem getting used to the game's mechanics, and really begin to enjoy yourself.
 
  
  Sound wise, it's the effects that shine. One of my personal favorites was the stretching/pulling 
 sound accompanied whenever you were required to put a person somewhere else (a common event) . This 
 is brought down a little by the music, which reflects the different periods of time in which the 
 game plays out. Several different Radio Jocks throughout the ages also chime in with Events outside 
 your studios, helpfully giving you hints into what the Public is interested in seeing. The Jocks 
 range from being standard to very low standard, they never excel and their lines are very wooden, 
 spoken without conviction and meaning. In game jokes are very poor, however, it can be important 
 to hear what they say.
  
  Overall, The Movies is an incredible achievement. Two very distinct play styles are on offer here, 
 feeding one another and your own creativity. For those interested in creating your own movies, 
 or believe they can do better than Hollywood, here is your chance. In the meantime, you will also 
 get a dense, complex and just plain fun tycoon game that sets itself up for some great laughs and 
 never takes itself too seriously.

Review:  The Movies ias a fun game! There, I said it. It basically reminds me of Theme Park and other management 
 games. Only here, instead of satifying a growing crowd of puking kids, you have to satisfy moviestars, 
 and their egos. You basically have to build a studio, and produce films that in turn will give 
 you some sort of income, with which you expand your studio, hire new stars, research new film-making 
 technologies and so forth. You don't actually shoot the movies yourself (however, you can create 
 your own screenplay) , for this you hire a director with the fitting credentials. This is all fun, 
 the bit that is not quite as fun, is the fact that your stars live their whole lives in your studio. 
 No mansions, no private jets, nothing! This means that you have to babysit them all the time, and 
 by this, I mean ALL the time!
  Your stars behave badly (throwing tantrums, getting drunk while on set) if you don't cater to their 
 specific personal needs. Now, if it were so that you only had two or three stars, it wouldn't be 
 that big of a deal, but in trying to keep your studio afloat financially, you typically recruit 
 about seven or eight stars with different acting skills. This means that later in the game, your 
 main concern is to try to keep the stars happy, lean and sober, which can be quite a task. Mostly 
 due to the fact that they become jealous of each other really quickly, which means that if one 
 star is happy, another one is bound to be unhappy/drunk.
  
  The first hours of the game, are really fun, because you don't have that many stars to take care 
 of, but later in the game it can get quite frustrating trying to make films while keeping an eye 
 out for stars tumbling about in a permanent binge.

 Besides the movie nakeing process starts getting boring after a little time , besides you won't 
 create anything fantastic.
  So don't whaist your time and go hail Sims yey.
  Damn have to write 100 words, but i think the review says all that i could say there is nothing 
 more and i am not going to waste my time for writing more about a game

Review:  When I first heard of The Movies, I was a bit of a sceptic. "Movies? In a game? This must be a 
 joke..."
  
  Well, against my own sceptical thinking, I downloaded the demo version.
  
  - Not long after I started a short-lived studio, I was hooked. Only 15 minutes in the demo and 
 I was stuck. Like tar and feathers, all over.
  
  I got so obsessed that I was "forced" to buy my own The Movies game, since the demo ended so abruptly.
 
  
  Now, my studio, the Mastermind Movies, have produced several twin versions of real life box office 
 hits. And I wont stop, until I drop... lol
  (I haven't shared my movies online though..)
  
  All I can say is that this game offers days, weeks, probably several months worth of gaming, 
 if you happen to like the creation process of movie making.
  
  If I told you all the aspects this game has, it would take forever to get through this review.
 
  
  So, as a shortcut, I'll give you this:
  
  * Graphics: Similar to Sims 2, though much better. Plenty of details to keep your eyes on.
  * 
 Gameplay: It can be a bit tough to get in the game at first, but I promise, when you do get in 
 the game, you'll have trouble getting out of the game once you've got the hang of things, get it?...
 
  * Value: So many things to do, in so little time..
  *Sound: It's what you can expect from a movie making game. The sounds and music pull your imagination 
 back to the early 20's, 30's, 40's and 50's.
  
  Pros: When you get the "custom script facility" - all is allowed! Make your own movies as you always 
 wanted to make them.
  
  Cons: This game does however pull a lot of juice out of your graphics-accelerator, so remember 
 to close all other applications before starting The Movies. Firewalls and antivirus programs makes 
 it unacceptably annoying to get this game going. 
  - You'll get to a point in the movie creation process, where you wished that Lionhead Studios had 
 given us gamers more freedom..
  
  In total, even though some aspects might be a bit irritating, this is a pretty perfect game to 
 spend a few weeks/months on. As long as your imagination doesn't run out, this game wont bore you.

Review:  A very decent game. I bought this game with very high hopes and expectations, unfortunately the 
 game didn't meet these. however, the game did very well anyway. The mix of movie making and tycoon-style 
 play worked very well. However i thought the actual movie making left something to be desired. 
 In particular the different scene choices and the "actors" let it down. Other than that the game 
 didn't have any real technical issues. It performed well and is probably best played for it's tycoon-style 
 element as opposed to the movie-making element. I would recommend this game to fans of tycoon games, 
 but not aspiring movie makers

Review:  I really loved this game except for the lack of good scenes. Everything else is genius and overall 
 it's a great sim. 1 thing I also dont like is when people dont come to your offices to get hired. 
 It only happens when you are doing good and other companies' actors come to you, but no one else 
 (janitors ect.) come to be hired. The script writers you get in the beginning are very bad and 
 it is hard to start out, but when you start cranking out movies your writers become more experienced. 
 Also write you own scripts, it helps a lot. Give your stars what they want (only the good stars) .

Review:  First There is the tycoon part which is amazingly fun, like having the ability to turn movie stars 
 into janitors and trying to get to the top. The Tycoon part is fun but the very best part of the 
 game it TMO (TheMoviesOnline) . There you post you're movies and other people review them!!! My 
 TMO account (BENDICK44) was in 2nd out of everyone. I was in second for about 3 weeks and then 
 I slowly droped due to lack of ratings and movies relesed (I took a bit of a break) I droped to 
 26th. 26th is still really good since there are thousends of accounts.

Review:  The Movies in my opinion is one of the most fresh and original games I've played in a long while. 
 The game offers at least 20 hours of game play and thats if you play it purely as a tycoon game 
 like the video review said there are virtually infinite possibilities with a different way to approach 
 every situation and issue. This game allows yo to run the studio any way you want and gives you 
 enormous freedom, unlike most tycoon games such as roller coaster tycoon where when you reach your 
 assigned goal you start a new level when you see fit all of your goals must be met out of a single 
 studio. This game requires much forethought for this reason as in the first five hours of play 
 your studio may be set up and mapped out perfectly, but my hour thirteen your entire studio has 
 fallen into disarray. Overall I would strongly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the 
 tycoon industry.

Review:  Gameplay: 8/10
  
  The main part of The Movies is a tycoon game. Most people will look at this thinking, "Look! its 
 just another tycoon game!" It is much more than that. It seems quite complicated at first. Once 
 you've gone by the learning curve and know how to play, you will get most enjoyment by completing 
 the main game where you can unlock buildings, sets for your movies and more. When playing to win, 
 it is easier to have scriptwriters writing scripts for you, but playing in sandbox mode gives you 
 freedom to make movies in your AMM (Advanced Move Maker) . It says advanced, but to make a simple 
 movie is pretty simple. Post-production can provide a finishing touch to your movie and it can 
 feel really satisfying when you finally finish your movie.
  
  Graphics: 9/10
  The graphics are quite fantastic on The Movies. I have a great video card which makes it look better 
 on my computer. There are loads of detail in the sets and in the building. If you like your graphics, 
 The Movies will be up that list!
  
  Sound: 8/10
  Nothing much I can say about the sound, it's got nice music which goes in with the time era you 
 are in and isn't too overpowering in the game.
  
  Value/Replayability: 10/10
  
  The Movies is a game you can come back to againand again and again and again... If you start to 
 get bored of the tycoon game you can start having immense fun making your own movies in the AAM. 
 The Movies is a game which you can come back all the time and it will keep you entertained for 
 hours

Review:  the movies is a tycoon game were you control your own prodution studio and guide your stars through 
 the years of the movie bussiness
  
  Cons- 
  -the tycoon game is not connected to the movie making part at all
  -when making the movie all 
 the actions you tell your stars to do are pre made so all your movies look alike. 
  -i also have a echo problem with my sound and i don't know how to fix it, i went on the forums 
 and many people are having this problem. 
  -it has a simmish look to it not that thats bad but it looks a little up beat. 
  -and the bubbles! 
 there is no menus just millions of bubbles poping up everywere.
  
  Pros- 
  -The tycoon part of the game is entertaining and tycoon aficionados will have a good 6-7 hours 
 on that part of the game. 
  -i bought it souly for making movies because i like to make movies and the movie maker is fantastic, 
 besides the fact you have to choose already made actions it is a great movie maker, and there are 
 thousands of different actions you can use in your movie. 
  -the lip sync tool is great, you can talk in the mic and it looks like the person is really talking.
 
  
  Well thats about it, i here there coming out eith a expantion pack for the game so that will be 
 cool. hope this was helpful

Review:  In a world where originality is lacking, sequals are popping up everywhere, and many different 
 game variations adorn the shelves (such as all the Tycoon game) , The Movies is a bright light for 
 gaming. The Movies is an excellent strategy game, with some fantastic features. The game isnt perfect, 
 but there is alot of enjoyment and pleasure, along with several addicting qualities to the game.
 
  
  You start as a new studio owner. Depending on the year you start, you are offered a variety of 
 buildings to help expand your studio, ranging from high quality sets to much needed bathrooms and 
 food service buildings. In addition to, you are also in charge of hiring the staff needed to run 
 the studio (from maintenance workers, to your money-making stars) . With a wide range of buildings 
 to choose from, and many different star attributes, you have plenty to keep you busy.
  
  The movies themselves are written, staffed, and filmed all in your studio. As the studio manager, 
 it is your job to make sure everything goes smoothly. Your stars are very fickle, and their moods 
 change with the more/less work they do. Eventually they become obsessed mega-stars, and you need 
 to fulfill many of their needs (or they just might quit and go to another studio) . As their needs 
 sometimes conflict with the studios needs, this can become a micro-managing nightmare (perhaps 
 the star is addicted to alcohol, you need to decide whether to drop the star in rehab and delay 
 production, or force the star to work and lower the quality of the film ... and forcing the star 
 to work can be difficult as they tend to "sneak" away from the set) .
  
  All of these features are new elements that add some flavor to this strategy game. However, micomanagement 
 can be tedious. And, you are under a time limit ... when stars reach a certain age, they must retire. 
 AND, certain films work better with actors/actresses of certain ages.
  
  In addition to the strategy game, users have the ability to write and shoot their own film. This 
 is a GREAT novelty feature that is a fantastic addition to the game. Although the movie maker is 
 limited to the game sets (which there are plenty of) , movie props, and your own stars, there are 
 plenty of ways to go. Also limited is lack of speech, and the ability to write your own scene (you 
 choose from an large amount of selected scenes .... which there are plenty of, but still limited) . Tired 
 of the weak scripts your writers are automatically writing, then create your own! Interested in 
 the film business, but cant afford a camera, then try the movie maker!!!!!!
  
  Overall, the game is certainly entertaining and will attract a large following. However, the micromanagement 
 can get tedious. The movie maker was a GREAT addition, but it does have certain limitations. In 
 addition, I'm someone who would have LOVED to turn off the retirement/age feature, as you are forced 
 to constantly find and build-up new stars every 30 years (it would make the game easier, but when 
 I build something up, I hate for it to just disappear) . A great game, and definately worth getting 
 if you are a strategy fan, enjoy movies or want to make your own!!!

Review:  The movies is a game in which you control your own movie studio empire. This is one of the most 
 in-depth, most detailed game, most strategic game ever. That's why it's hard. But once you get 
 used to it, you will love this game. Anybody who likes movies, or is a movie fan, or a hollywood 
 buff, will adore this game. You could make any kind of movie genre you want. You could build your 
 own studio from scratch, but that is ONLY for the experts. if you want to play this game and get 
 through it, you have to devote hours to this game. People, this isn't roller coaster tycoon (awesome 
 game, by the way) this is total control tycoon. You have to pick up that 48 pg. booklet, and get 
 to it stupid. You have to read it and understand it. But all in all, this is a fantastic game in 
 every way and recommend it to anybody who is looking for a great game that they can donate a lot 
 of time for.

Review:  I wanted this game for a long time. And when i got it, it wasn't disapointing. the game is very 
 fun and addictive. The idea of making any movie you want is fun but there are some things I don't 
 like about it. The star moods are really hard to handle. Without that it would be more fun. I recomend 
 this game to people12 and up. The gameplay is highly adictive and really fun. The graphics are 
 great. Each character has good facial effects. The body models are really good. Te sound is Ok. 
 overall the game is slightly a copy off of the Sims 2, but not enough to take off of the rating.

Review:  This game kicks ass. It is highly addictive though those lucky bastards with social lives and "girlfriends" 
 give up all hope on ever seeing the world outside of your gaming plateau known as a computer. The 
 game has the perfect blend of micromanagement and strategy. The graphics are pretty good for a 
 tycoon type game and the sound is really good. This orgininal from Lionhead should be spinning 
 in your computer for months possibly even years to come. Do your self a favor and go buy yourself 
 this game if you don't have any problems with having your life sucked into the social outcast pit 
 that is The Movies.

Review:  This game is not at all what I expected after reading all the reveiws and listening to all the 
 hype. People will still buy and feel the same way I do because of all the other reveiws they will 
 be led astray. There is only so much you can do with the game and it begins to get frustrating. 
 I'm not saying that it sucks, but, I wish I would have spent my money on something else. In fact, 
 I have felt that way since the first day I started playing it and only wish that I could take it 
 back and get something else. Buyer beware.

Review:  The Movies is defently not I was looking for. WAY to advanced, with so little option at times, 
 and a somewhat avarage disconnection. But it IS fun, and when you cross fun with dissapointing, 
 there is always a hope of serious gameplay waiting to be played. There is hardly any story - all 
 you need to do is to be the most successful movie creator in the world. But you do get the best 
 movie you have ever sawn and some reviews with the world 'abysmal'. Sure, it is intersting, but 
 that means Terrible.
  
  The graphics are almost realistic, and the game also is like a 'sim generator' like The Sims, because 
 there is some extreme pro things like you have to cast it, make it, script it, shoot it, and this 
 makes a very good... er... film-'em-up. But I needed more for The Movies, and this is defently 
 not I was expecting for. Dissapointing but rock solid.

Review:  Becoming a virtual "Industry Legend" as the box for the game describes sounds great, but truly 
 the game doesn't live up to what it says. The game is far too easy, which may be good for an occasional 
 break from the shooting and fighting style of gaming. The cursor tells you exactly what to do next, 
 which may sound handy, but really gives you no options or control that makes the experience feel 
 "yours". With no widescreen support, the game does not live up to a true gamers wants. The best, 
 most pleasing aspect, was the game's backround music and funny radio stations. Announcers chime 
 in from time to time blaming the communists for a car crash, or explaining how they hate men with 
 long hair (depending on the decade you are playing of course) . Definitly the highpoint of the "The 
 Movies" experience. Who would I suggest this game to? Sim game fans, but don't get yourselves too 
 excited... It's at least worth buying it used.

Review:  Creative gamers will love Lionhead's The Movies. Why? Because the game allows you to control pretty 
 much every aspect of a movie studio. Sure, it's fairly simplistic as far as controls, but the massive 
 amount of commands you can issue and the amount of control you have over your movies is quite impressive. 
 The graphics are some of the best I've seen in an RTS/Tycoon game and the amount of detail is amazing. 
 During your journey through the movies, you get to go through historic movie-making periods, win 
 awards and build new sets and use new effects to make your movie as impressive as can be. If you 
 want to check out what looks like a superb tycoon game, download the demo. That's a wrap!
  
  Update: The full version of the game is WAY better than the demo. The ability to write your 
 own scripts and add your own voice overs and music add an amazing amount of depth to the game. 
 Creative types will love the amount of depth this game offers and keeps giving more. The star maker 
 adds more depth to this great game. Buy the full versions and wreap the benefits.

Review:  The movies is a mind bending theatrical game that gives out the aroma or thrill of a guaranteed 
 hit. The game gives the person the control to finally make a movie that is good other than the 
 waste they have to deal with. This game takes gaming cinematics to a whole new impressive level, 
 it displays graphics as an average game but the concept is illustrious an fun. The making process 
 of the movie might be a little hard but when you get the hang of it its a great and thoughtful 
 game to play, so i thank activision and lionhead studios for making a great and just thi plain 
 fun game.
  Thank you

Review:  The first thought about this game is: "How it is possible to create the game about movie production?". 
 But our well known friend Peter Mulinie had unswered very easy - he had just created the Movies!
 
  The game is all about becoming the producer and meneger of the real Movie production studio. But 
 you can also become a script writer or even a director of the film (or maybe an assistant) , because 
 the film is creating by you stars, that you've employed, while you are just controling the process 
 itself.
  Now about the gameplay. the game starts at 1920's you are the man who is starting his own Studio, 
 but it is not that easy! First you must build the main buildings like main office, casting office, 
 stuff office and ... after that wait for people that will come to work on you as actors, biulders, 
 garbage man or scriptwriter. Then it is time to create your first film. The scriptwriter will write 
 the script for it. Then you will begin a casting for the movie, you must place one of your actors 
 on the place of Director, the other on the place of Actor and so on. After that they will head 
 to the shooting stage that you will have to built. And there they will shoot the film. After that 
 you will release it and money will start filling your pockets! 
  Such a process will become more and more complicated. But with some training it will be easy to 
 do.
  The shooting process is all about placing already created scenes in the order you like. Don't think 
 that it will be boring, the amount of scenes is over 3000 plus different variations with stuff, 
 actors and wardrobe (yes yes you will be able to dress you actors as you like for each scene, from 
 an alien to the soldier of WW2) .
  Each five years the award ceremony is helding out! you will be nominated (maybe) and if you will 
 win, you will get some bonus! 
  It is also very important to keep your stars in sgood shape and mood. If they will be in bad mood 
 the performance of the whole movie will be as good as the apple pie on the second month of keeping 
 it in closet! so you must give them time to rest or create a perfect living place in their trailer.
 
  So as you understood - being the owner of the Movie production studio isn't easy!
  Try this game, it will be interesting for everyone! Don't forget about the official award ceremonies 
 on the Lionghead studio's website, where people are choosin the best film that was created by YOU!

Review:  The movies is a tycoon game meets the sims. You have the ability to build your own movie studio, 
 Run the studio from every aspect, direct your actors, control your actors stress levels by sending 
 them to different venues, and even post edit your movies. The game does everything seamlessly, 
 allowing you to go from building to directing instantly and flawlessy. The Movies is great especially 
 for movie buffs and tycoon addicts. The down fall is at times you can find your self overwhelmed 
 by the sear emensity of the game, the game gives you so much total control that you can at times 
 hover over one section of the studio and find easily a dozen things all happening at once that 
 you need to take care of. But besides that The Movies is a well finished addiction that at times 
 can have you playing for hours unknowingly. If you like movies or enjoy tycoon games this is a 
 very good choice to make.

Review:  Okay, there's such a ridiculous amount of content to this game that I don't feel like spending 
 hours to cover it all. Instead, I'll cover the best part of the game.
  
  I wasn't sure whether I wanted to buy The Movies, but it's down to $40 now, and Peter Molyneux 
 of Lionhead Studios designed it. I've really liked their games, especially Fable, even though they 
 never seem to live up to the hype. However, The Movies not only met the hype, but surpassed it 
 in flying colors.
  
  The game starts out really sluggish. Your options are limited, and there's not much to do other 
 than make really crappy movies and hope for the best. This first impression might turn some people 
 off, but trust me, once you get to the 1950's, all that pain and suffering will be worth it, because 
 you'll have a lot more money, better sets, and more actions for your actors to perform. The more 
 you unlock, the better the game gets. I'm in the 1980's now, and my studio has grown bigger than 
 I ever thought it could, especially since I was in debt for a short while.
  
  As many have told me, this is more of a game than a toy. I'd have to agree with that, but the game 
 itself is a hell of a lot of fun. You hire actors, staff, directors, and all that jazz, and then 
 you can either write a script yourself, or have the game write one for you. All of your staff gain 
 experience with everything they do, so your production team gets more efficient, and your movies 
 start getting better. Then the technology starts to improve, and so does the quality of the film 
 used to make your movies. As each decade passes, you'll see a lot of new stuff, like new costumes 
 and the radio station played throughout the game changes with the era.
  
  But what really makes this game shine are the actors. Each has his or her own personality, and 
 depending on how you treat them, they'll work hard for you. Some are easy to please while others 
 are eternally bitter, but all of them have the potential to do excellent work. As they gain fame, 
 you'll have to hire staff for them, give them a nicer trailer, or give them cosmetic surgery.
 
  
  Parallel to all of this is the actual moviemaking aspect. It sucks at first, but as I said, it 
 gets better once you get lots of things unlocked. It's really as simple as pointing and clicking. 
 You can place in specific actors over mannequins, and there's a huge variety of actions for them 
 to perform, but sometimes it does get restricting, depending on what you're trying to do. But if 
 you practice with it, you'll realize that there's a lot more to it than meets the eye.
  
  When you've finished making your script, you let the crew and actors take care of it, and you can 
 keep an eye on them to make sure everything's going well. Once they're done, you can take it to 
 the editing studio, and add subtitles, your own voices, music, etc. It works pretty much the same 
 way as the Movie Maker that comes with Microsoft Windows. Then when you're done, you can release 
 the film and get your hard-earned cash.
  
  Letting a scriptwriter write it for you works in pretty much the same way, except they're terrible, 
 but they get good reviews depending on how good your writer is. I've fired all but one because 
 he writes them very quickly now. Using them is a good way to earn some money quickly, as their 
 films tend to require few actors and are only a few scenes long.
  
  The best part of the game is seeing the movies you made do well at the box office. Every five years, 
 there's an awards show, and depending on what you win, you can get nice bonuses, like better prestige 
 and a more efficient crew.
  
  The Movies is essentially like The Sims crossed with Movie Maker, but you have much less control 
 over the actors than in The Sims. You can bypass most of the Sims-style stuff by using the sandbox 
 mode, but it's actually a lot of fun working with them.
  
  I really wish I had purchased this game earlier. It's so much better than I was expecting, and 
 it's a shame to see that it didn't sell as well as it should have. I don't think the people who 
 hate this game went much further than the first few decades, because what I've found has been amazing.

Review:  The movies is a very good game with above average graphics. Managing your studio lot is only the 
 beginning. Making the movies is the best part and it is pretty addictive once you know what to 
 do. You can change about every aspect of your movies like changing peoples clothes for certain 
 scenes, changing there names ect. But to top it off, once you finished making your movie, you can 
 then post it on the website and let other people review your films. You then get 'virtual money' 
 for posting movies up and getting reviews, which you can download extra content using your 'virtual 
 money' for your films like more costumes and more sets. That making the movies a very good game 
 for people who like movies and tycoon games.

Review:  I think this is the best game like this since the original Sims and Roller Coaster Tycoon days. 
 It's like they took both and put them together and added an incredible sandbox mode. I figured 
 playing through the decades would be hard to do but so far it's been real fun and pretty easy. 
 There are so many options and scenes for making your own movies and the post production feature 
 is so fun. Being able to cut scenes so you can make pretty much anything and adding music and sound 
 effects is really fun too. The StarMaker is also a really cool feature, like many others where 
 you can change mostly every feature on your actor/actress' face. I think this is a big step for 
 simulation type games. Maybe not as much as what some people would have hoped, but still the possibilities 
 are endless.

Review:  this game is very addicting. i was hooked instantly. the realism of owning a movie studio was incredible 
 and there is a long gameplay value being as you start in the 1920's and go to present time. the 
 gameplay lasts a long time and has good replay value. the only bad thing about the game is the 
 movie stars and how they are never happy... but there movie stars what are u gonna do u gotta give 
 in to them to keep them happy. The best feature is being able to upload your movies to the internet 
 and letting other people see your movies that you've made. 
  
  Overall this game is definitely worth getting and will keep you entertained for a while.

Review:  Pros: The Movies is one of the best tycoons if ever seen. You build your very own movie studio, 
 you control if actors become number one or if they become ordinairy builders. The movies let you 
 choose if you make the movies or that the AI makes them for you, but don't expect supermovies from 
 the AI! The advanced moviemaker let's you create your very own movies, and that's very entertaining! 
 You just have to give this a try to really know if you like it. 
  
  Cons: When you are creating your studio, you also build the sets. But it's most dissapointing that 
 after using them in max. 4 movies the critics will find them boring, and there aren't just that 
 many sets to get you through almost 100 years of moviemaking. Learning your stars a perticulairy 
 genre can get very frustrating because it just takes too long! The advanced moviemaker is a briljant 
 way to finally make your own movies, but it's just too limited. All the scenes are prescripted 
 and that's why only some scenes fit after eachother, if you don't wan't your characters talk on 
 the sidewalk and the other scene they're suddenly talking in the midst of the road! By some loading 
 scenes they show a Neo-like character (Matrix) but the special effects from bullettime and large 
 gunfights are just missing, you can do a funny kung-fu scene but it's too pathetic too be called 
 a "Matrix"-fight. By the Sci-Fi genre don't expect big space fights, you have to do it with scenes 
 inside the space ship (Like most of the Star Trek stories) . But Lionhead is a studio that always 
 learns from it's mistakes (Like Black & White) , so if they make a 'The Movies 2', what won't surprise 
 me because B&W and Fable also get/got an sequel, they will deffinatly fix these things.

Review:  This game is huge. When I first played it, that was what I believed. Then I started career. The 
 Baggage Boy and Love Lasso killed my enthusiasm. I hated it. Then, I found Custom Scriptwriting 
 Office, and it's become one of my favourite games.
  
  If you start playing the game with the dumb scriptwriters doing your films or spend all the time 
 in stroy mode, you won't get all the enjoyment you can. In story, you can only do certain length 
 films (8 scenes? Just enough to allocate all available stars) , or your stars get stressed, moody, 
 and extremely drunk. That's where Sandbox comes in. You need to do stroy, for unlocks, awards, 
 and other things, but the extreme fun in starting Sandbox with maximum money, all the boxes ticked, 
 and using Custom Scriptwriter once I have some stars. In this thing, you have absolute control. 
 You can't make them excessively long or you get bored, but you can do many many scenes. What you 
 do is choose the genre, film name, stars, their character's name, and what type of script you will 
 have. Then, you click ok.
  
  You have loads of choices. You can use any set you have available (though you need to buy them 
 or you can't make the film) . Then, you choose what scene to do. The thing is, the scenes are very 
 plentiful, and then once you've made your choice, you then change the type of action (happy, sad, 
 angry, romantic, scared etc.) , and props, lighting, weather, and so on. You can make absolutely 
 tons of movies, and unless you have a very unimaginavtive mind, you can make them all completely 
 different.
  
  This game is lots of fun, and you can even add subtitles, music, SFX and voiceovers. Then upload 
 them online. A beautiful game.

Review:  The movies is a really fun game; specially if you are a Tycoon/Sims fan. Im not really a huge 
 fan of this genre but I still had fun playing it. There are just so many things you can do; Write 
 your own scripts, cast and train your crew, build your studio, be the director of your own movie, 
 publish your movies etc. 
  
  This kind of versatility has a downside as well. After playing like 20 hours I was just totally 
 lost in the chaos of this game. One part of my crew was screaming for trailers, relaxation and 
 more money the other half of the staff was making movies. There is a point in this game where its 
 just too much too handle. I play games for entertainment, to relax after a hard days work. And 
 this game was just stressing me out.
  
  And I guess the game play wasnt good enough for me to complete this game. After a while you get 
 so annoyed by the staff that, I wasnt making movies anymore but I was only trying to please the 
 staff. What fun is that? 
  
  The developers of this game tried to make the best of the moviemaking part of the game. But you 
 cant avoid it being limited to pre-recorded scenes and sound samples. And it isnt really fun 
 enough to keep doing it (at least: not for me) .
  
  If you are in to this genre: buy this game. If you are not: then dont.

Review:  The Movies is definately the best movie-making game on the market. Its innovative gameplay allows 
 players to make their own movies from a huge selection of sets, actors and scenes. It doesn't stop 
 their either, the player is treated to either add their own Sound Effects, Subtitles and even voice-overs. 
 
  
  Review Starts Here.
  
  Hey all! Welcome to my review, thanks for reading, and be sure to make a recommendation!!
  
 
  Overview
  The Movies is a simulation game created by Lionhead Studios for Windows. It was released on November 
 8, 2005 in the US, and November 11, 2005 in Europe after reaching gold status on October 8, 2005. 
 The game was originally going to be ported to PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox, but development 
 of the console ports was halted and the game officially cancelled on February 7, 2006. Poor sales 
 was the reason cited for the cancellation. On February 8, 2006, Lionhead Studios announced that 
 the console version may still be released, it just wouldn't be published by Activision. In The 
 Movies, players take the role of a Hollywood film mogul, running a studio and creating films. Much 
 has been made about the film-making aspect of the game, as it allows players to easily create viewable 
 works or machinima. 
  
  Gameplay
  In The Movies, players get the chance to run their own movie studio. The game can be divided into 
 three main areas  designing the movie studio, forging the careers of movie stars, and making movies. 
 It is possible to focus on any of those areas that appeal most, and spend less time on the others. 
 The game plays through from the birth of cinema to the present day and into the near future, with 
 all the technology and historical advances that occur along that timeline. After the movies have 
 been made, they can be played back for the viewer to watch. It is possible once the movie is made 
 to add voice, text and music in post-production. The movies can then be uploaded to a website for 
 anyone who wishes to watch them. 
  There is no limit on movie length. The average movie length is between 30 seconds and 3 minutes, 
 but user created films can be as long as budget will allow (although a 10 minute film might require 
 over 20 game years of filming) . Once the actors, extras, director and crew are assigned to a film, 
 production begins, with the entire staff of the film travelling between sets to film the movie. 
 The sandbox mode allows films to be created without undergoing the lengthy production process, 
 and with budgets of over $100 million. Players are able to pick a script provided by the game or 
 write their own. Provided scripts take longer to write in game time, while user-written scripts 
 take longer to write in real time. To write a movie, for every scene the player first chooses a 
 set where the scene will take place, and then the action that will occur during the scene (for 
 example: 'Living Room 1: Enter Scared') . The actors can be chosen, extras assigned roles and mood, 
 lighting and weather settings altered. This is repeated for every scene.
  Once production has finished, the film undergoes post production, where music, sound effects, subtitles, 
 speech and titles to the movie. Cuts and changes can also be made to the length and order of the 
 scenes, making editing the film easier. The game allows for lip-synching, matching the speech to 
 the actors. However, this only works for short sound files, and only shows basic lip movements. 
 The film can be one of five genres: action, comedy, horror, romance or science fiction. The main 
 effect genre choice has is that real world events affect popularity of different genres (The Vietnam 
 War increases popularity of action, the Space Race increases the popularity of science fiction, 
 and World War 2 increases the popularity of horror) . Sets are the constructions in the studio lot 
 where the cast and crew assemble to shoot movies. The sets are divided into categories such as 
 urban, western and rural. Different scenes have different actions available (a bar might feature 
 many drinking related actions, while a street would feature various car actions) . Sets can be used 
 to practice movies and increase genre experience; reading through the script on the set of a spaceship 
 increases science fiction experence.
  The gameplay is astonishing, and also revolutionary, never before has movie-making been this damned 
 good!
  Verdict - 9
  
  Graphics
  They are awesome, a tycoon game has never looked so good. Each actor looks really good, and the 
 fluent movements and actions they makes are great. The park where you build looks perfected, and 
 all the buildings look great even when your fully zoomed in on it. Everything looks clear and crisp, 
 and quite literally "eye-candy". Every part of the visuals look great, especially when you make 
 yourself in StarMaker and seeing yourself shoot someone or acting out a comedy has never been so 
 much fun and looked so good at the same time!!
  Verdict - 10
  
  Sounds
  Everything is done well, the Sound Effects in the game, and in your movies, the voice capability 
 in your own movie, the music in the background and everything else is music to your ears. You will 
 not be disappointed by the sound, perhaps some of the best on the PC, although the regular radio 
 bulletins do get frustrating and annoying, they don't come too often, thankfully!
  Verdict - 10
  
  Value
  While still at full price, you can get easily 75 hours of gameplay 
 out of the main game, and endless movie possibilities in sandbox mode, you can easily get a decent 
 amount of play time. Full price is a bit of a let-down, although I'm sure it should be coming down 
 in the near future.
  Verdict - 8
  
  Overall, this game is quite a superb first attempt at this particular genre by Lionhead, and I 
 can safely say that this is a game that will last a while, and a game you should'nt be disappointed 
 with. A must-have for tycoon-lovers and first-time-players alike.
  
  Overall - 9.1 Superb

Review:  This is really the best game of 2005 in my mind. Why? Simple; it's some of the most damn fun I've 
 ever had! Making your own movies and running your own studio is the most brilliant tycoon premise 
 ever, and you have to wonder why people didn't think of it before. The online community is also 
 a big plus. Once you start playing it, you'll find it very hard to stop. Best to disappear for 
 a while, lest you want this to get you in trouble with your girl. Better yet, have her play it 
 WITH you so the creative process can flow! And I love how you can do some voice acting (it comes 
 in at good quality, too. I reccomend a microphone made by Logitech, that's what I use, and sound 
 is great) for your movies, and if you pay enough attention to the community, you can find ways 
 to add your own music and opening titles, too. GET THIS GAME!

Review:  I recieved this for christmas and man am I glad I got it. It is really a lot of fun. This game 
 is so creative, creating gameplay no other game has. Making movies is really a lot of fun, it may 
 be a little limited on scenes, but you can still make good movies. The sets you get are pretty 
 good, there arent very many and I wish they were a lottle more creative but they are still good. 
 A really good thing in movie making is the amount of costumes. So many costumes, they range from 
 vietnam war costumes to 20s outfits There are two modes, Sandbox and Normal mode. Sandbox mode 
 is probably the most fun since you have the most options but normal mode is still fun since it 
 gives you a challenge. Sandbox mode gives you the options of starting in a select time, how much 
 money you want, how the stars act, a lot of things. When you start sandbox you have all the buildings 
 and all the correct objects that go with your time. Normal mode is essentialy just sandbox without 
 the options, you start in 1920, have 100,000 dollars, and the stars are always annoyed about something. 
 In these two modes, it gives you the option of just running the studio or making movies. You dont 
 have to make movies during either mode but it is fun to. There is a lot to do in each mode, stuff 
 like adding buildings and ornaments, trying to make stars happy, other things too. Seriously of 
 you are a fan of Roller Coaster Tycoon, Sim City or anything like that, get this game.

Review:  grade
  B+ (8.8)
  
  Good
  You can make your own movies! What can i say!
  Gameplay makes you feel like your really making a movie
  people interact with each other...
 
  Do anything you want! Have King Kong with a gun shooting a bunny!
  Better than Sims!!
  
  Bad
  Occasional glitches
  Things can go terribly wrong before you know it
  Things can get 
 repetitive if you've already created your dream movie
  
  Closing Comments: Its a really cool game... not too many flaws.. Story mode is not the best because 
 you can write your own script but other than that this game is remarkable! All thought you are limited.... I 
 mean you cant make a porno movie.... LOL

Review:  I was worried about this game because I thought it was too ambitious. I am happy to report that 
 it was not. Despite a few glitches (some sound problems, and a few problems with custom movies) , 
 the gameplay was perfect. I don't usually like sim games but this one held my interest for a long 
 time. With cute little sims-style characters you will even enjoy watching the resulting movies. 
 Don't wait for this one. Go out and buy it now!!! Don't delay or you will regret it! I won't say 
 it again! Whether you like Sim games or not, you will enjoy this game.

Review:  The Movies starts you as the chief of a small upstart movie studio, putting the challenge before 
 you to slowly cultivate it into a top-grossing, award-winning cinematic machine staffed with the 
 best and the brightest talent -- both onscreen and off -- the industry has to offer. Well, as less 
 of a challenge and more of a suggestion, the free-form (or so-called "sandbox") nature of The Movies 
 means you can go about your business however you see fit, without a "wrong" or a "right" way. This 
 is a game of high quality, and it shows in virtually every aspect of its execution. But all told, 
 The Movies comes just shy of its lofty ambitions. Being a movie studio boss is completely absorbing, 
 and there is really no other game, or, really, any piece of software that makes it as easy to build 
 your own little movies. But the connection between these concepts is tenuous at best. Thankfully, 
 its best qualities shine through more than enough to make The Movies a game well worth playing.

Review:  One of the best games ever made.
  This one have a powerful gameplay, that allows to make movies what you want.
  The first studio 
 lot managing and movie-maker game. At the beginning it would be difficult, but with the time, you 
 will love this game, and love the movie-maker type.
  From 30 seconds to 2 hours, can be the duration of the movie, with the scenes you want, in the 
 order you want.
  The studio management has medium ralativity with the movie making, but in-game have much importamce.
 
  Easy to play, instant classic and underappreciated.
  Gameplay innovative.
  For most people, Lionhead best game!

Review:  This the game of the century you can do so much stuff in this game. You can give your staff trailers 
 and you can give them press releases. At first you start in 1920 and it is a bit boring but when 
 you get your studio up and running it is fun. You can start making 5 star films but it takes a 
 lot of scenes. Its quite simple to make the five star films but you want them to be good when you 
 watch them yourselves. The only thing that does my head in is the drinking addicts. They can never 
 get away from the bar its so annoying. Besides that this is an awesime game.

Review:  The Movies by LionHead Studios is a pretty good game, and you should try it. This game starts in 
 the 1920's and ends sometime in the 20th century. The point of the game is to make your own movies, 
 but there is a catch.... Now you cant do whatever you want in your movies, and there are certain 
 sets in the game. You cant create your own sets so far, and you cant tell your actors to do EXACTLY 
 what you want them to do. 
  
  When you choose a set, you will get a bunch of choices to choose from. For example, a choice you 
 can pick on the "Bombed Street" set is a fight scene. And depending on the type of fight scene, 
 it can be two, three, or even four people in a fight. But, there are a ton of sets and scenes to 
 choose from, so you can still make a good movie even with all the limits in the game.
  
  Whats really cool is the editing part of your movies. After your actors are done filming, you can 
 take it to "Post Production" and add subtitles, voice overs, music, and even change the scenes 
 around if you wish. If you do a voice over, you can get your actor to lip-sync to it, so it looks 
 real. The sound in the game is pretty good, and it actually changes when time goes by when your 
 doing Career Mode. Like in the 1920's, there will be 1920's music, and when it reaches lets say 
 1950, there will be music from 1950, so it usually changes every 10 years.
  
  The graphics in the game are "ok". They could be improved. The sets is what LionHead put their 
 work into and thats what looks the best. The people and your studio look bad... 
  
  So if you like to make your own movies, then you should try this game. Even if you dont, you still 
 might find this game pretty fun. You can keep on making movies forever and not be bored (and they 
 are currently making an expansion which will give you more variety!)

Review:  i downloaded "the movies" demo game and i have to say that i am very impressed. the game starts 
 out telling you what to do and how to do it, and in a very simple and fun way too. in no time at 
 all you should be able to play the game properly. you get to choose your own staff, actors, and 
 directers. you can also give your actors makeovers, but make sure your actor likes what he or she 
 is wearing! you can do almost everything that you would be able to do in real life. i recomend 
 downloading this game demo, its hours of entertainment and fun! highly recomended for fans of the 
 sims or tycoon games. its well worth the money if you was to buy it.

Review:  Peter Molyneux has once again attempted to create another of his romantic creations - this time 
 striking a decent hit. If you've recently played Black & White 2, then you'll most likely notice 
 similarities between the latter and The Movies. Many mechanics have been recycled from the Black 
 & White 2 engine, although this time they've been executed with far more prowess. Unlike Black 
 and White 2, The Movies' mainstay is content. You'll find yourself considering many different angles 
 of approach on how to produce your movies. Unfortunately, as with many other Peter Molyneux games, 
 this means you'll be micromanaging quite a bit. This also means that the game has a surprisingly 
 high learning curve, although there is adequate assistance to help you. The game compensates by 
 offering a solid pace, one that may seem fast at times but that generally works well. You're also 
 presented alot of freedom, with gameplay modes such as "sandbox", which allows you to manage and 
 produce movies without time and money restrictions. The movie maker is also an engrossing tool, 
 as you may find yourself spending as much time managing as directing. All things considered, this 
 is a game that's well worth consideration and is alone in its own category of movie production 
 company simulations.

 you can also make movies as well... The graphics were very good and the gameplay is good as well... 
 Lionhead just keeps making better and better games. I recommend them all. Otimo jogo, e muito inovador. 
 I adorei o fato de que vc pode jogar o jogo como tycoon ou pode fazer seus proprios filmes. Esse 
 jogo 'e um dos que eu recomendo a todos. Mas eu nao sei oq mais escrever, pq q eu tenho que escrever

Review:  This game is my favorite of all time. playing through the story mode is defiantly worth unlocking 
 everything for sandbox. Although movies uploaded to the site are underappreciated unless you were 
 one of the lucky few who got a movie to the top 25 at the beginning and were suddenly the only 
 studio worth watching. It's still a great game that is good for everyone. The expansion pack that 
 should be coming along soon to make this game even better too. Making your stars and bringing them 
 to stardom is so much fun. although the scenes are pre-made, anyone with editing skills at all 
 would be able to make something out of it

Review:  WHen I bought this game the other day I was not sure if I would like it or not. I have to say I 
 really had to put some thought into it, but I am certainly glad that I did. I truly enjoy the tycoon 
 mode of playing this game. If you like playing the Sims then you will like this game. It is not 
 quite the same as playing the Sims but it is Sim-like. The better mood the actor is in then the 
 better his performance. 
  
  As long as you pay attention to what's going on you will do fine. The game pretty much tells you 
 what is needed. Just make sure you make the lot easily accessible and you have it won. You get 
 to win awards for you movies, lot and actors as well. Hope that you will enjoy this game as much 
 as I have. The graphics are well done and the sound is good as well. I have no complaints on either 
 of those categories. I have not gone into the making films part of it yet... not sure I would be 
 interested in that or not but only time will tell. Anyways.... I do wish you well and enjoy the 
 rest of your week. 
  
  Happy Gaming!!!

Review:  The Movies is one of the new types of simulation games that you can make your own movies and then 
 showcase them on the internet. There are two different types of packages of it to buy, which are 
 the Standard Edition and the Premier Edition. Although its more expensive, the Premier Edition 
 contains the Star Maker program (which allows you to create your own actors) and a mini walkthrough 
 on how to make your own movies step-by-step. It may look complicated but it is quite simple to 
 learn the controls and how to build your studio but it can be hard when youre plotting where everything 
 should go.
  
  Overall this game is quite good but also a bit hard.

Review:  The Movies is a long-awaited game made by Lionhead Studios (the same company that brought us the 
 Black and White series and the disappointing, but still great game Fable) . The game's story mode 
 starts in the 1920's (the beginning of movies) , as you make movies, from simple, quiet, black-and-white; 
 to detailed, varied, colorful, and talking movies. Here's my review:
  
  Gameplay: It really isn't bad at all. Actually, I'm addicted to it. One of the good points of this 
 game is making your own studio. Its really loads of fun to become the producer (or boss) of your 
 own studio. You can become a very successful movie studio, having a lot of happy stars with critic-raving 
 movies. But that can be a hard thing to do. It can be quite easy to be in debt, and ,if your not 
 careful, quite heavily. so you will have to work on movies 24/7 until you have enough to take a 
 little break. Another good point is the fact that you can make your own scripts. You can have enough 
 to make your own 5-minute storyline. Don't be startled, however. It's reall easy to use and isn't 
 too complicated at all. The main problems I had with this game (depite it being a little minor) 
 was the fact that it is not too realistic as I would have hoped. (why would they give out rewards 
 for most prestigious studio lot? Why do critics care for some sometimes minor things?) . Another 
 thing is the fact that you can get into debt a bit too easy (watch out) , and can get hard to please 
 your stars, making it even harder to make movies with them. Other than that, it is loads of fun, 
 quite addictive, and is the best Tycoon game I've played in a while.
  
  Graphics: The graphics can be pretty astounding at times (high detail) , but I also noticed that 
 the main problem with it was the fact that the character could get a little screwed up at times 
 (or it could be that my computer isn't powerful enough, but still...) . Other than that, there's 
 really nothing much to complain about.
  
  Sound: You can use a microphone to voice act your movie's actors (which is used for online puposes) , 
 but other than that it is just some seriously annoying mumbling that tries to act like The Sims, 
 which makes it (the mumbling) hilarious. On the other hand, the DJs of each era is quite humorous.
 
  
  Value: This game is really addictive. You'll be playing for what seems to be minutes, but hours 
 and hours of a ton of movie-making and building more and more of your movie studio. The game is 
 just too hard to put down once your starting making movies, just building your movie studio, or 
 just see what everyone is doing. And online mode is like a free movie theater; you can see the 
 "movies" people created and even post your own "movie" online for everyone to see. 
  
  Tilt: Are you a fan of Tycoon-like games? This is for you, and probably the best of its kind yet. 
 Have you been waiting for this game for a long time? You shouldn't be disappointed. Everyone else? 
 This could change your mind (especially if your a movie-goer or want to be in the movie industry 
 when you grow up) , but it probably won't if you are a serious Tycoon or Sims hater.

Review:  The movies is a simulation game where you take control of a movie business which your aim is to 
 make it the most successfull out of all your competitors. The game mode allows you to start from 
 way back into 1925 where you have to build your studio that has the potential to bring great success. 
 As technology improves, you are introduced to new buildings each decade or say which you can always 
 use to your advantage if you 
  have a labatory with scientists can research new things. 
  
  In the simulation mode the key goal here is to keep your stars moods at a right position. This 
 affects their whole movie performance and ranking. And also keeping your movie studio tidy will 
 affect your oeverall ranking too with ornaments and janitors.
  
  The one feature that really makes this game worthy to play are the rewards you can win in each 
 ceremony which are used as incentives that actually gives you a unique bonus in each reward that 
 you can use to advance in the next 5 years till the next ceremony commences. If you presist in 
 these catergorys you can win them consecutively. And the certificates you can obtain to unlock 
 various features can be a real challenge too.
  
  After a script is done from the script office you can alter the scenes and actions to your preference. 
 This allows you to take control over the story and may boost the qaulity of your script which is 
 vital to the overall performance. This is most enjoyable because you can have fun altering each 
 movie to your liking and raising the quality of the movie so you can benefit from your cast and 
 studio. You can also edit your films through the post production office which allows you to expand 
 your story to perfection.
  
  Making your own movies is fun too! Yo can use your imagination and make the movies you always wanted. 
 However, this aspect is not fully flexible so you can't make your scene do whatever you want. After 
 completing your own movies you can upload them online which is really great to show your skills 
 in movie making within the game.
  
  As a conclusion, the simulation part of the game is a real challenge trying to keep all your stars 
 happy, as well as keeping your studio clean, and amount of movies produced. But after you get used 
 to things you really become on top! Organisation and strategy is the key to this games' success...

 i got it, with my expectations reserved. And before i knew it, i was hooked..!
  
  i must admit, its taken me to restart the game 3 times already (although i've "finished" it once 
 before) , just to get all the sets to fit in the lot primarily. Honest. hahaha.. And the lot does 
 get filled up with mostly sets, and those darn trailers for the "stars". =P
  
  Although i wasn't hooked as much to the Sims series, this one sure got me going. Cheers to the 
 makers. And may anyone who's willing to play this game really suck you into playing it all night..!

Review:  This game got a lot of hype in the run-up to release, and I'm going to get straight to the point 
 as I absent-mindedly drink this can of Pepsi; it doesn't quite to live up to the hype it got. It 
 takes a lot of work to make a full movie business simulator, and this is undoubtedly the best one 
 yet, but there is still room for improvement that will hopefully come along in the Movies expansion 
 pack [which will probably happen] 
  
  The Movies, in case anybody has been living in a heavily secluded clearing in the middle of the 
 Brazilian rainforest for the last few months, is a deep, detailed management sim where you are 
 the owner of a movie studio. It's an ambitious project, and Lionhead haven't quite pulled it off 
 the way they should have; everything is clear and correct, but this game just isn't as fantastic 
 as other sims like Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. It's hard to explain, but The Movies is missing a sort 
 of X factor, the thing that will bring you back again and again. 
  
  Everything is here like you'd expect in a management sim; actors, actresses, staff, movie makers, 
 scriptwriting, cleaning, post-production, a makeover engine, cosmetic surgery, and all those microscopic 
 details that make the basis of a management sim; you know, happiness, ratings, prestige, and god 
 knows what else. 
  
  So yeah, use all these tools to make blockbuster movies and a dominant film studio. Sounds simple, 
 but The Movies is very time-consuming and you need a lot of patience to actually achieve your goal. 
 It isn't as addictive as it sounds either; the learning curve is very off-putting at the beginning, 
 and although it comes complete with a decent instruction manual and a buttload of tutorials, it's 
 still complex enough to put off casual gamers who just want to laugh at movies that make no sense. 
 The movie maker is nowhere near as deep as it should be, it consists of just placing your actors 
 in the provided mannequins and putting one scene after a-bloody-nother.
  
  Sure, maybe I'm being a bit harsh on The Movies, but to me, this was a bit of a disappointment. 
 There's no doubt it has glitzy presentation; it has great, but somewhat familiar music, and the 
 visuals are an excellent example of CGI, but underneath it all it's all a bit bland. There's not 
 enough here to keep people going for ages, it's nowhere near as addictive as it should be. No doubt 
 it's an achievement, and one of the best management sims for months, but it is nowhere near the 
 killer it should have been, because the gameplay gets tedious quickly. For me, The Movies is a 
 bit of a disappointment. And that disappointment is something I can't describe.

Review:  The Movies is a simulation game where you are responsible for managing a studio lot. You hire actors, 
 directors, extras, maintenance men, janitors, writers, and scientists all with the intent of producing 
 the best movies that can generate the highest return on your investment. There are very few simulation 
 games that I have enjoyed over the years, but The Movies turned out to be a fun game, albeit 
 short lived. It only took me two times to play it through from beginning to end before I mastered 
 the game. So, its not overly complex, but it does have the fun aspect. Theres nothing like actually 
 watching the movies you are creating, especially when you see how much they change over the years. 
 From silent movies, to high budget special effect features, you get it all and everything in between. 
 If you enjoy micromanagement on a light hearted scale, then you will enjoy The Movies.

Review:  The Movies is a great game. It gives you the opportunity to actually make your own movies. Your creativity 
 can be unleashed in this game.
  There are n Number of possibilities to make a movie how you want it to be.
  The game makes you 
 feel a part of the movie making industry.
  You start of in 1920's and gradually progress through the 20th century.
  In order to make a movie 
 you need to do everything which happens in real life.
  From giving jobs to people as an actor or directors you also have to create u r own scripts. This 
 is where u r creativity will be tested.
  Although the story of the movie doesnt impact the audience (due to the limited A. I of the PC) the 
 genre, interest , actors mood does determine whether u r movie is a hit or flop.
  To add to this you also have to manage u r own studio and mak sure u r better than u r competitors.
 
  And if that wasnt enough you also have Award ceremonies every 5 Years in different categories. this 
 also effect u r studios rating.
  The graphics r pretty much like the SIMS.
  Gameplay wise the movies is very immersive and can get addictive.
  Editing can also be done in 
 a very effective manner (u can add subtitles and u r own voice to it) . But you cant add your own 
 music and images.
  You can even post u r movies Online on the officil website and let the world see u r creativity.
 
  All in all THE MOVIES is a great game and is highly addictive. it can get a bit complicated and 
 difficult but overall it offers high replaybility and is fun.

Review:  Lionhead Studios is a love/hate relationship. They are notoriously known for their highly original 
 and fun creations which never live up to the promises that Lionhead makes during the development. 
 The Movies is no different.
  
  The game breathes new life into the tycoon genre that was pummelled into oblivion by budget developers 
 ever since Roller Coaster Tycoon shook up the industry. The Movies puts you in the position of 
 a Film Studio owner who has to run and manage his own studio. You need all the necessary buildings, 
 such as Casting Offices, Writer's Buildings and sets. You are responsible for keeping your stars 
 happy, hiring new and better stars while improving old favorites. You have to keep your place neat, 
 tidy and still pump out profitable and critically successful films. Which can, as you'd imagine, 
 be quite a handful. The game begins in the early century when film first became a big hit. You 
 begin with silent, black and white films that are a mere minute long and as you progress so does 
 technology and profitable genres.
  
  The game gives you an option to make your own "script" which is basically shooting your own movie, 
 once complete, you let the actors act it out and your creation gets sent out to the games critics. 
 You can even post your creation online, a neat feature. The problem with this is the lack of creative 
 control the game gives you. From the previews, I was always lead to believe that you could do basically 
 anything you wanted to, light the sets as you saw fit, etc. Turns out, you have to pick shots from 
 a list, a big list but sometimes it can be frustrating to find the one you want. There are some 
 big restrictions with items the characters have as well as inconsistency in different shots in 
 the same scene because you can't just place characters where you want, they have preset locations.
 
  
  Some shots only allow you to shoot from one angle, others give you an option of usually three angles. 
 The lighting sometimes gives you a choice of only three different intensities. There is typical 
 bright light, dim light and foggy. That's all I have seen thus far.
  
  The game does introduce an interesting timeline which gives news clips that influence the public's 
 genre interest and gives you a nice glimpse of the future and what movies to make at what times. 
 The timeline also shows you when scientific breakthroughs will occur and when the Movie Awards 
 take place which can earn your studio reputation and bonuses.
  
  The game pumps out some nice "The Sims" like graphics that are pretty cartoony but work for the 
 light, fun atmosphere of the game. The game does'nt require a very powerful machine, thankfully, 
 but with lots going on in the game, it would be a good idea not to run many applications in the 
 background.
  
  The sounds in the game are busy as you'd expect in a tycoon like game. The characters in the movies 
 speak like Sims which speak a whole lot of non-sense. The other sounds in the movies are sometimes 
 non-existent when there should be something there or are sometimes dull or boring. The in-movie 
 sounds rarely wow you, though in the studio, there is enough to please the ear. From silly "whoa" 
 or sucking sound effects when picking people and objects up to the lovely sound of cash when your 
 movie is making big bucks. The soundtrack is pretty generic though.
  
  While being an extremely good tycoon game, The Movies, like most Lionhead games, fails to deliver 
 all of its promises. The Studio aspect of the game is fun, though sometimes difficult, but the 
 Custom movie-making is lacking. I often got frustrated, bored and irritating when making my own 
 movie. Which disappointed me because that was the biggest reason I bought the game. Never the less, 
 the game has a fast paced tycoon spirit that is tough but quite a bit easier than expected from 
 Lionhead. Tycoon freaks rejoice, your game is here. Everyone else, check it out just for the sake 
 of it, it's decently fun.

Review:  This game starts off to be very interesting but after about 1 hr, its repetitive and becomes a 
 landscaping game, where you just end up sprucing up the movie lot with plants, ornaments, etc.
 
  
  Soundtrack is not bad but gameplay is pretty awful. The only unique feature of this game is that 
 you get to watch the movie you made, although it is extremely simple movie where even a 5 yr old 
 can easily make. 
  
  This could have been a great game, but the game gets too preoccupied with the non-movies making 
 aspects of the game. Ie. Welfare of actors, directors, etc.

Review:  A great game. It takes a little time to fully grasp the game. It is a tough game to learn at first, 
 but once you go through all the tutorials, and what not, it gets to be pretty fun. It does get 
 a little old when the computer AI spits out scripts, they tend to be the same. Once you unlock 
 the custom script ability it gets better. If you don't have a mic, to do voice overs, it gets a 
 little dull, but you can use a pair of head phones, plug it into the mic jack, and it works. I 
 use it all the time. Overall, it is a good game, and I hope a Movies 2 is in the works.

Review:  The Movies, made my Lionhead Studio's, also responsible for Black and White 2, is an amazing tycoon 
 game in the Sims mould.
  
  You play as a guy who opens a movie studio in the early 1920's, you strive to make a succesful 
 business and make money at the same time. You write and direct your own movies and also Hire and 
 Fire actors and other staff.
  
  The game itself is extremely addictive and, before you know it, a 15 minute session turns out to 
 be a 5 hour session. The graphics are great, and the game just has a joyful look and sound.
  
  Any fan of tycoon games or any of the Sims games would love this, and if you do buy it, free 
 up your schedule.

Review:  When i had read a preview in a site before two weeks from the release i was so excited! The game 
 looked very interesting!
  When i bought it i have played for over 6 hours without a break! The game has a lot of things to 
 offer and keep the players busy for a while!
  The next 3 days i was some kind of boring and i was avoiding to play because i was thinking.... you 
 know, i had better things to do and more fun than playing the game.
  The movie creator will definately keep you busy and has many things to offer to make the movie 
 of your dreams! I can't say the same for the single player though! After a few hour of playing you'll 
 discover that!
  To sum up i think that the game is interesting and a lot of fun and will make you feel like a real 
 producer some times! It's worth a try! So don't miss it!

Review:  I wasnt expecting this! 
  
  If your trying to find out what type of game this is, the best way i could describe it would be 
 a mix of Roller coaster Tycoon, The Sims & a totally new game.
  
  1st theres the park building side to the game where its pretty straight forward, you place buildings, 
 paths, trees, toilets etc.
  
  2nd theres there the hiring of staff, stars, extras, directors etc and heres where the sims part 
 play into it. You can improve their experience in Action, comedy, romance etc movies which will 
 make them better actors/directors & earn more money for you per film.
  
  3rd there the making of the movies part & this can be done in 2 ways, quick & long. Quick does 
 it all for you. Bu the long way is where the game really shines. you can practically make your 
 own movies with easy & little confusion. 
  
  The game starts at 1920 & goes on from there with changes to the graphics & fashion as time goes 
 by. You can nurture a actor into an international super doper star! You can creat special teams 
 just to do horror movies, or you can make jack or all trade actors & directors to star in all 
 genres. There is so much depth here with out being overwhelming it makes you realize just how good 
 the developers are to make this game.
  
  Im yet to make my own full movie yet because im having so much fun with the other aspects of the 
 game, but i know ill be spending countless hours making moves & hoping they do well at the box 
 office.
  
  In conclusion, if you like Tycoon games or The Sims genre, you will LOVE this game! Get it!

Review:  -Lionhead Studios really did a great job with this one. This game offers you the opportunity to 
 move in the Movie business. I really liked this game, and you hardly ever or it would be better 
 to say "never" find games of this genre. When you play this game you really, really feel like you're 
 in the game, and that's what's most important for a game, to feel the game to feel like you're 
 inside or to feel like it's happening for real. It's great, how you start a company in the early 
 20's, and you're the first of the 5 or 6 Company's to contribue in the Movie Busniess or let's 
 say to develop the Movie Technology. I mean making all those black and white movies, classic movies 
 is really great... and then how you develop your technology in the 30's, 40's and so on, you start 
 making let's say half colorful movies and then the technology improves so much and you start making 
 movies like today... and ahh what I forgot, what i liked, what i liked the most in this game was 
 you know the race or the competition between the Movie producing Company's, all the time fighting 
 to take the first place, making movie stars, and creating a city yeah, something like hollywood 
 where you gotta buy houses for your stars of course if you want they're mood to be good. Graphics, 
 well graphics are good, they're in a good shape. Sounds, well i'd give them a score of 8. Gameplay, 
 gameplay is great, of course it deppends on your liking but for myself I play this game 3 or 4 
 hours a day. This is not the greatest game ever, but trust me this game offers a lot of fun, it's 
 not boring, no action in it, just the game you wanna play...

Review:  I love resource management games, always have and always will. This one interested me right from 
 the start as it had a totally new angle on a well established genre.
  
  The Movies, as it's name suggests, allows you to write, shoot and produce a movie that you can 
 share with others or keep for yourself. You get to be as granular as you want with the creation 
 process but ultimately the aim of the game is to produce good movies that will rake in the cash. 
 The more cash you have, the bigger and better your studio becomes and the better quality actors 
 want to work with you.
  
  You have the choice of doing everything, from writing the scripts to building the sets to hiring 
 the staff and actors. Once you have actually 'shot' the movie, you then send it of to post production 
 and eventually you can release it to the world, sit back and wait for reviews to come rolling in.
 
  
  Good or bad you will get paid for it all and this money can then be ploughed back into your studio 
 to make it bigger and better at producing new and state of the art movies.
  
  It starts out back in the early 1900's and as you progress through the game time rolls on and you 
 will eventually find yourself shooting movies in a more recognisable era.
  
  One of the best features of this game is where you can actually save your movies to the hard drive 
 and then upload them onto the internet to be watched by real people. It is a bit like a virtual 
 oscars but a brilliant idea and one that has created a phenominal online community.
  
  This game is definitely worth a try and I think you will enjoy it. I know that I did, a lot.

Review:  There's a question that all men wonder about and that question is, "When is it all right to review 
 a game that never ends?" I guess right now is the time. The game in question is The Movies for 
 PC.
  
  Now my PC far surpasses any of the requirements listed on the box but the game seems to suffer 
 from a memory leak. The longer I play the game, the more is chugs its way to an unplayable point 
 of slowdown. Ive since had to drop the quality of the game to near Sims 1 level and the game looks 
 ugly. When its in its full graphical glory, the game is a beauty for a tycoon game. Everything 
 is modeled well and detailed nicely.
  
  One of the big questions about the game is hows the Movie creation process?. Well Lionhead was 
 smart and made it so that you have to make progress in the main tycoon mode to unlock variable 
 objects in the sandbox mode. A trip through the games timeline all the way to the year 2000 will 
 unlock hundreds of sets, wardrobes, props, and technical gadgets to fool around with while making 
 your theatrical masterpiece. The Movie making process is a bit more limited from what you would 
 expect in a game about making movies, but it is easy to get right into it and start churning out 
 movies after watching the brief tutorials. 
  
  The interface the game uses is the typical Lionhead fanfare; the pick up and drop. Sure, its not 
 the most realistic interface. I think people being whisked away by a giant hand and thrown into 
 whatever position they want should be kept more into the God games, but it works here. Another 
 strange part of the gameplay is that the actually movie making seems to take a backseat to the 
 tycoon part. Movies are created in the same cookie cutter fashion over and over while most of the 
 emphasis is put on maintaining the lot and the stars happiness level. This gives the game more 
 of a Sims chore feel to it. I felt I was constantly taking care of people and making the lot looking 
 better than actually getting my hands into the movie making. This isnt to say that you can get 
 into the directors seat, its just that there really isnt any benefit to it. While playing the 
 main game, if youre wanting and willing to put effort into making a movie of your own design, 
 the game lets you. However, the budget on your movie will be much larger than a normal movie due 
 to time and theres a large chance the movie wont be accepted by the public. Another gripe I have 
 with the game is when its time to turn over the studios legacy as actors and directors retire, 
 the lack of employment is astounding. When the top movie maker in the country is having a hard 
 time finding anyone that would work for them, it pretty much ruins any idea of reality in the game.
 
  
  The sound in the game is done well. Radio announcers change throughout the years, actors voices 
 are pretty good even the various sound effects are handled well. Theres really not much to say 
 about the sound as this really isnt a sound intensive game.
  
  Overall the game is a nice distraction to the other games that are offered these days and I look 
 forward to seeing how well some short stories I have written turn out on the small screen.

Review:  This is one game that takes a lot of time to get to know and even just to understand. There is 
 just so much that goes on that you literally have to keep up with who is doing what. Because there 
 is so much going on, it's really hard to keep up with everything.
  
  GRAPHICS
  =========
  Very well done. The way they set up the props, stages, areas, buildings, locations, 
 even stage backgrounds are fantastic. Whether you are doing a full featured game or just messing 
 with the auto movie maker, you can make a movie, make the movie a hit and even make some stars 
 a star. Plus, the outfits you put your stars in are very well done. Dresses really look like dresses, 
 jeans really look like jeans, even leather outfits look like leather. Plus the expressions on teh 
 Stars faces is great, they really put a lot of detail into making this game a very well detailed 
 and graphical game.
  
  CONTROL
  =========
  One of the many fantastic games that all is required is a mouse, nothing more. Either you are just 
 moving things around, fixing up your Star, or if you use the Quick Movie Maker. Everything was 
 very well planned out and very well make use of the mouse quite easily. If something comes up, 
 click it. If a star is out of place, use your mouse to get that Star there. If you have things 
 to build, use your mouse. To me, the best part is the Instant Movie Maker, once you have movie 
 writers and some other people working for you. You can literally make a movie is less than 30 minutes. 
 In fact I have found that using the Instant Movie Maker makes better movies than what the script 
 writers make or even what the directors make. Course, it also helps to have a good eye for detail. 
 The more well detailed a movie, the metter the movie itself.
  
  OVERALL
  ========
  Fun, constructive, plenty of things to do, and lots of interactions to get to use and play with. 
 This is one game that does require some learning and/or getting used to. But once you know how, 
 it's easy from then on and you will never want to leave your game. For me, this game can be very 
 addictive as well as time consuming, but overall it's just fun. See if you can become the net MGM 
 movie owner??? :-)

Review:  I've been waiting for The Movies to come out since I saw a 3 sentence mention in a Gamepro of like 
 2001. I finally got it... then waited a month for the patch... then played for 3 days. The tycoon 
 part of The Movies is very addictive, combining Sims with micro-management, and by itself could 
 be the whole game. The movie making process, however, left everyone frustrated. If you were like 
 me, you were expecting total freedom of ragdolls and giving them total plot, but instead were given 
 slightly adjustable animation scenes to piece together. With a lot of effort and time you could 
 make a decent 5 minute movie, but it lacked the range and freedom most were counting the days for. 
 
  
  It is a great game, and was fun playing, but I hope they somehow come out with a The Movies 2 with 
 more in depth directing options?
  
  With a 4 year buildup and an unhealthy obsessive anticipation... nothing could've lived up to my 
 expectations though.

Review:  Kicking things off in 1920, The Movies starts you as the chief of a small upstart movie studio, 
 putting the challenge before you to slowly cultivate it into a top-grossing, award-winning cinematic 
 machine staffed with the best and the brightest talent -- both onscreen and off -- the industry has 
 to offer. Well, as less of a challenge and more of a suggestion, the free-form (or so-called "sandbox") 
 nature of The Movies means you can go about your business however you see fit, without a "wrong" 
 or a "right" way. The game starts out extremely slowly by carefully guiding you through the process 
 of hiring studio staff (like janitors and builders) , helping you decide which cinematic hopefuls 
 will be actors and directors (and which ones will be extras or film crew) , building your first 
 set, and releasing your first movie. This handholding remains pretty intensive for your first few 
 decades as a movie mogul -- and that's a good thing, because there's a lot to digest. 
  
  The core moviemaking process itself can be pretty dense. First, you'll need a screenplay, which 
 means you can choose to write your own (more on that later) , or you can hire a staff of screenwriters 
 to do the heavy lifting for you. Even with the latter hands-off approach, you'll still have to 
 determine the genre of your film, with the given choices of action, comedy, romance, sci-fi, and 
 horror. Different genres have greater general interest in different eras, so even if the film itself 
 is good, the wrong genre at the wrong time could spell box-office disaster. Once you have your 
 screenplay in hand, it's time for casting. The size of your cast and crew will grow over time as 
 you produce bigger, more-sophisticated movies. But in the end, you're always going to need a director, 
 some actors, a movie crew, and, usually, a handful of extras. Who you choose to fill these roles 
 will ultimately affect your end product. How experienced is your crew? What sort of mood is your 
 talent in? Do the director and the lead actor get along well? Though it can make the process of 
 casting your movies quite maddening, it's actually rather impressive to realize the minute details 
 that can have an impact.

Review:  The Movies? Could this be a game about movies or films? Why yes, it is indeed. The Movies is what 
 every kid (and I've asked them all, so it's undisputed fact) dreamed of when they was young - that 
 is setting up a cool car chase scene, a bar fight or even or a heart-felt goodbye. 
  
  Dream no more kiddies, because the future is here, in the present, but it's not just for kids, 
 it's for older beings too! Upon first playing The Movies, I thought it related to The Sims in some 
 aspects, but is obviously totally different and redefined in others. The reason I say this is because 
 fans of The Sims would probably enjoy the gameplay found here. 
  
  And I rekcon Activision and Lionhead studios have produced a great hit with their latest title: 
 The Movies is really something new, it's different, it's cool, it's funny and it's (most of all) 
 really entertaining!
  
  Let me just say, I really didn't think that it was possible to make your own movie, in your own 
 home, in a game, with no videocamera - but you can and it's great! I was hooked on the game so 
 badly that I didn't realise that the whole house was asleep at one stage. Lucky for the slumbering 
 soulds that I was wearing headphones.
  
  The game appears to be similar to The Sims at first, but there's a lot more 'behind the scenes' 
 stuff here. If you choose to start from scratch you must build a big studio where all of your movies 
 will be shot for the next 40 or so years, and you can begin the game from the year 1940 with 100 
 Million dollars if you want. 
  
  Of course, I needed some training, so I went through all the basic steps and started from scratch 
 in a new game. You have to employ the builders, the janitors, the crew, the actors, the cast and 
 a whole lot more, to start making your movie. I needed some help, so I turned on the much-impressive 
 interactive guide, which led me through some of the early stages of construction, helping sort 
 you out, and getting you 'off your feet' for the first few years in the game.
  
  Once my studio had been set up with nice buildings, stages, food stands and plants, trees and the 
 like I started to produce my first movie. The first few productions are made for you, but you can 
 soon employ script writers to do it for you. You can tune in to a radio station to listen to up-coming 
 events via an annoyingly-amusing Englishman talking on wireless. Later on, as time passes and technology 
 increases, you can build better studios, buildings etc.
  
  Then as you near the mid 1930s you can start to edit your own movies, and make them for yourself. 
 This is the main part of the game and you can create and edit your own scenes, using the advanced 
 movie maker. You can exert a lot of control over your actors, ensuring the characters in your blockbuster 
 movie about a blind Priest with magical powers do exactly whatever you want them to. 
  
  You can even do voice overs, giving it your own personal touch, and there is scope to create animated 
 features. And the best thing about making your own movie is that you can post it online for the 
 entire world of film lovers to see. 
  
  There are online competitions too. The winner scooping cash and/or prizes, and getting the credit 
 for making it. Naturally you can also watch other people's movies. But you don't even have to have 
 the game to watch your mate's movie, as you can convert it into another media file (mpg4) and play 
 it using Windows Media Player.
  
  Another important aspect of the game are the relationships that your movie stars and the other 
 crew (like the directors) have with each. If they're not gelling on the set, your movie is unlikely 
 to reach its full potential. 
  
  Okay, so I've raved and ranted about some of the game's features, but there are just too many to 
 mention - it's a big game - and I don't want to make it look boring, because it's not. It's quite 
 full-on having to run a studio, keep stars happy, please reporters and win prizes, and that's just 
 the single player game!
  
  The graphics of the game (on high detail) are surprisingly good. You can't compare them to any 
 other game really, because the models look half 2D, half 3D [2.5D? - Ed] , but they really are good, 
 considering that you can zoom up so close you can see the chef preparing a meal in a van, and still 
 have great quality. The visual effects are really great in the finished films as well, and I was 
 impressed with the level of detail which they've captured.
  
  The sound effects in the game are well-suited to the game, providing all the neccesary audio cues, 
 but they do tend to get annoying before too long. The only real let down would be the sound, even 
 though it suits all the surroundings quite well.
  
  At first, I was a little sceptical about just how much freedom a movie-making game would allow 
 and whether it could be accessible to all types of gamers, but now that I've seen the standard 
 set by this game, I'm quite amazed.

Review:  This game is awsome. There is so much...
  
  There a LOT of scenes for your films, and the AMM is is incredibly simple, but still FAIRLY powerful.
 
  
  The Story mode is fun too, having to deal with your stars actions, though it can sometimes be annoying. 
 I suggest checking out its official message board for a lot more info though, its a good resource.
 
  
  You MUST give it a bit of time for it to be fun.
  
  The music/sound is BRILLIANT!
  
  If you love the art of film, the film industry, or have dreams of making it in hollywood as 
 a filmmaker, this is an EXCELLENT start to begin making your own movies and getting them veiwable 
 by the world (online, at TMO)

Review:  An awesome sim-type one player game that puts a spin on normal simulators. Personally, I like the 
 fact that you progress throughout all of the genres: from 20's silent films, to 50's sci-fi and 
 romance, up to the modern mega-blockbusters.
  
  Consider yourself the executive at a fledgling movie making corporation. You have to develop a 
 cohesive and productive staff ranging from actors to groundskeepers to researchers.
  
  Maybe the name isn't as revealing as one might think. You don't just make the movies. Movie making 
 is just one part of the plot. Every 5 years there's an award show (kind of like the oscars) that 
 rates the top studios in various catagories. When you win awards, you are, in turn, rewarded with 
 new facilities and stages and props and various decorations for your studio grounds.
  
  Graphics are good. Sound is ok, but I turned it off because it got annoying after the first 15 
 minutes. Make sure you have enough time to devote before sitting down. This game is a real time 
 consumer. Just ask my girlfriend.

Review:  This game is really cool. I haven't even played it for that long but for the time I have it has 
 been good. I hope they make expansions with more actions to do in your movies. One of the only 
 cons is that you have to start out in the early 1900's when I wanted to make a good movie a little 
 faster. The makers did a nice job with it though. The graphics were more than good and the sound 
 was clear as glass. The only problem with difficulty is that it takes a brain to learn quickly 
 because of the advanced movie making processes. Using a microphone to add your own voice to the 
 movies is also kind of tough and you need a good one to hear it clearly. The overall game play, 
 however, was very good quality in all ways. This is recommended to most people with good imagination.

 is such an amazing game I just can't wait for expansion packs wow!!! I can't think of a better 
 way to make a game about The Movie bussness the only thing tat I didn't like was not having more 
 scenes this was a great Simulation game now they need to make a game about making music then games 
 so on so forth I love this game. They should also make it avalible to make sports movies such as 
 a Miracal like movie. There is so many ways you could go with this game they are so creative they 
 should make one-hundred games this type laugh out loud. O-man review.

Review:  ... making movies and tycoon mode, hampered the experience a bit.
  
  Gameplay- The Movies has plenty to offer in the gameplay department, including a tycoon mode 
 where you build and run your own movie studio, and a sandbox mode which is more designed for people 
 who just want to make their own movies. But with that said, there is certainly a frightening disconnect 
 between making your own movies and playing through tycoon mode. I ran into disaster when I decided 
 to film a movie I had made in tycoon mode. There were a number of complications: first, my movie 
 required a large number of extras which became a huge problem, second, getting everyone on set 
 for a large production was a nightmare, and a few times filming just stopped, and I would have 
 to start over again. This was extremely frustrating and it pretty much killed my studio, but the 
 whole reason I filmed a movie in tycoon mode was so that my achievements would show up on-line. 
 I recommend that you stick to shooting the movies that your scriptwriters write; they will probably 
 be shorter and it will most likely save you some unneeded pain. Also note, that tycoon mode can 
 be quite challenging and can cause you to become a bit stressed, due to the almost constant micromanaging 
 that you have to do to keep your studio rolling. But with that said, there are still many things 
 that The Movies does well. Although challenging, tycoon mode is still very enjoyable, and unlocking 
 things along the way adds even more fun to the mix. But for a lot of people, the highlight of the 
 game will be in sandbox mode where you can let loose and make your own movies. The Movies allows 
 you a great deal of open ended creativity when you are making movie, but yet it beautifully keeps 
 the game simple, without losing too much in the movie making process. But, occasionally you may 
 find yourself a bit disappointed with the lack of scenes (although there are a whole bunch) , or 
 that a certain scene isnt available with a specific set. The ability to alter many parts of the 
 pre-made scenes is nice and giving your actors that perfect costume can add some flair to your 
 movies. You can even put your own voice into the game if you have PC microphone, or just do subtitles 
 if that is to your liking. Once you are entirely done with your movie, you can go ahead and export 
 it, and then upload it to the movies website. The Movies Online allows you to view and rate other 
 peoples movies, buy things in the propshop using virtual credits (which you get by uploading movies 
 and having people view and rate your movies) , and chat on The Movies forums. At this point The 
 Movies Online is decent, and it should only be getting better.
  
  Graphics- Im giving the graphics a ten because 1) the graphics do indeed scale beautifully, and 
 the movie studio lots look great 2) the graphics work great within the game without demanding the 
 latest graphics card. The actors are definitely similar to a Sims character, but the rest of the 
 game seems to have its own artistic style that I really liked. Most of the scenes used for making 
 your own movies, also look nice, especially considering that a game like this had yet to be created.
 
  
  Sound- The Movies offers plenty in the sound department, including: a radio DJ who talks in the 
 background during sandbox mode and tycoon mode (the DJ is funny but he can sometimes be a bit crude, 
 but you can turn it off) , background music for your studio and for your movies, and the ability 
 to put your own voice into the game. In the end, you dont feel cheated in the sound department.
 
  
  Value- The Movies easily gets a ten in value because of countless hours you can spend making your 
 own movies, and the 10-15 (possibly more) hours that tycoon mode will give you. You can spend quite 
 a lot of time on one movie, if you decide to make a longer film or if you just want to tweak it 
 to perfection. For those who just want to make their own movies, there are options that you can 
 choose that will make life easier and less tedious. It is also worth noting that you can find this 
 game for around $30-$40 with relative ease.
  
  Tilt- Ultimately The Movies is loaded full of hours of fun, and sharing your movies online with 
 friends or strangers is definitely cool (although there are some stupid people online who get very 
 upset if you rate their movies poorly or other peoples movies poorly and feel that it is their 
 job to extract revenge on you) . But this almost perfect game is weighed down by some unfortunate 
 problems, which is shame. None the less, the developers should be proud of this game because they 
 made a very innovative and ambitious product, and it turned out to be a superb game.

Review:  Movies started around the 1910s to 1940s as a way of news and advertising. The first movie based 
 game is this game in 2005, my 4 words to this game is..... Best stratagy game ever. It's not just 
 a game where you make movies thats it, NO. You manage your studio, actors/actresses, directors, 
 crew, janitors, scriptwriters, extras, builders AND make movies. You can win awards, get stars 
 from rival studios, and upload your movie to the movies community website. I think if there is 
 a company that makes a better movie based game than this one by Lionhead studios, they have a long 
 way to go because this game is lights, camra, attraction!!

Review:  The game had really good ideas such as the advanced movie making. HOwever, there was not enough 
 freedom to really make a movie, everything is premade so it is all the same. The parks are really 
 small, too small, for a studio especially when you can't buy more land. There were a lot of extras 
 such as moods, skills, and beers. However, the incomplete game made those seem like petty gimmicks 
 that tried to help the game from total disaster. The developers seemed to focused too much on other 
 not important things that they forgot the most important stuff: THE MOVIES. It's especially frustrating 
 to finally be able to research a really important stage, but ran out of place to put it. In the 
 end, the game could have been good, but the lack of gameplay and the poor movie making technology, 
 along with the frustrating gimmicks make the game not enjoyable.

Review:  I already was hooked on the game when I first read about it in Computer Gaming World about 3 years 
 ago. The whole idea of running a studio, managing stars, and making movies made me think "Wow, 
 this is an amazing idea". I got it on the day it came out, and though I admitidly may not play 
 it quite as many hours as I used to, it still hold majority of my computer gaming time.
  
  The basic idea is what was already said. Make movies, manage stars, and run a studio. The game 
 is in a way both a game and a creative tool. The game aspect is your basic Tycoon game with all 
 the fundamentals, depth and addicting elements that you would want in such a game. You start off 
 int he 1920s with an empty dirt lot and from there, you build your studio empire through the course 
 of the movies history. Initially you don't have much control over the movies, however, as you progress 
 and when you early on unlock the advanced movie making tool, or rather the custom script writing 
 office, you will find there are a lot of creative tools to use. You choose a set, the actors and 
 a scene to use. These scene come in a huge variety and include conversation scene, fight scenes, 
 and many others and several set specific scenes. Many of these scenes have sliders that can tweak 
 several things such as actors moods, locations, and other things depending on the scene chosen. 
 It is important to remember IT IS NOT A FULL ON MOVIE MAKING TOOL, it is at heart STILL A GAME. 
 However, if you can work around the limitations and get creative in the post production tool, and 
 even get into modding, you will find you can make some pretty amazing stuff.
  
  You can also upload your movies to The Movies online community website for people to see.... if 
 they notice your film that is, because at this point if you really want a film to be noticed by 
 a lot, you best do some PRing at the lionhead forums. The rating and chart system is flawed at 
 the moment, however its still pretty cool and fun to be a part of.
  
  The tycoon aspect as said before is what it should be. There are two basic layers to this gameplay. 
 You have to manage your lot and the finances, release the best films, and get it to a high profile. 
 Then the other layer is managing your stars. As they get in more movies, they can develope egos 
 and you will have to keep them out of trouble. They also have moods on stress and boredom, and 
 if either of them gets past a threashold, they can do things like resort to drinking. They also 
 have skills in genres which determines greatly how well your movie does at the box office. Then 
 theres relationships they can get with other actors which also have an effect on how well the movie 
 does. Your movies will get reviewed by the game itself and this is where it kinda shows the disconnection 
 between the tycoon and movie making aspects. The rating system for the game is very, very mechanical 
 and merely judges on stats and scene choices. Its efficent and works as it should, but if you hope 
 you might get some bonus rating for making an artistic film with something unique, don't expect 
 as much.
  
  The production values are very well done. The music and audio are top notch and the songs you can 
 use in the movies sound like actual music from many different types of blockbuster films. Visually 
 the game looks solid. The actors look funny sometimes, and occasionally you might notice a few 
 graphical glitches but otherwise the visuals are very solid.
  
  To put simply, if there is one game that you can say Peter Molynuex actually pulled through on, 
 its The Movies. Yeah sure there is understandably few things that people hoped to be in there that 
 isn't, but keep these two terms in mind.
  
  Propshop
  Expansion Packs.
  
  Thats all that needs to be said. As long as your willing to look past the limitations and very 
 few flaws, you will find this to be a game truely unlike anything else you have ever played.

Review:  Ahhh, stardom. What could be better than having your own studio, making movies, and making scads 
 of money? This is what The Movies tries to do for you, with some success.
  
  For the record, while I very much am enjoying the game, I do not utilize the movie making functionality 
 of the software. I stick to the tycoon game. So, just how great is the tycoon game? Well, that's 
 what I'm here to tell you!
  
  The gameplay is pretty straightforward. Most everything is easy to figure out, although I do have 
 some issues with some of the game issues and there's one EXTREMELY annoying interface issue. Deleting 
 a building is more complicated than it needs to be. You have to pick up a builder at which point 
 a bomb icon will attach to the building. You then have to drop your worker onto the icon. A bulldozer 
 icon (or even a bomb, if they prefer) in the building selector tab would have been more welcome. 
 Another problem is the fact that it takes so long to build relationships between stars and you 
 have to baby sit them while they are improving their friendship. The same goes for trying to improve 
 your stars' physique. I never noticed a difference after repeatedly forcing them to lift weights, 
 so I ended up just giving them liposuctions. Also, grass on your lot is constantly dying, no matter 
 how well-kept your grounds are. This means that you are always replanting. To add insult to injury, 
 the game will charge you money on grass even if the grass unerneath it is healthy. This means you 
 have to be fairly precise if you don't want to waste cash - no clicking and dragging massive amounts 
 of acreage. A little less micromanagement would have worked nicely.
  
  The graphics are serviceable. They aren't anything spectacular, but they get the job done. The 
 sets are nice, and movies turn out well. 
  
  The sound is good, for the most part. Music and sound affects are well done, but I have an issue 
 with the "simlish" they have. It's monotonous and almost dead feeling. In the Sims franchise, who 
 first started using "simlish", there are different phrases that you can, after playing a while, 
 recognize and figure out what the "translation" is. Not so with The Movies. They all say the exact 
 phrase over and over again. And that phrase has no distinguishable "words" - it sounds like the 
 voice actors have a mouthful of marbles! "Mumble mumble, mumble mumble mumble." 
  
  I picked my copy up for $29.99 and have enjoyed it a lot, so the value is very good. I think the 
 game could have been a lot better, but it still is a pleasant way to spend an evening. I'm sure 
 if you enjoy movie making it will be an even more attractive addition to your collection.

Review:  The Movies
  
  A great game. Requires a lot to operate, but worth it. It can get overwhelmingly complicated. The 
 tutorial helps but still leaves you clueless. But true gamers dont read manuals anyway. Trial 
 and error. There are many things that you can do. You can even create your own movie. If nothing 
 else it teaches you how the movie industries work. The game also comes with a create an actor/actress 
 that by itself is entertaining. You can make your actor have plastic surgery, make overs, and even 
 get them drunk. The stars will complain and do all what the real life stars would do. So yes, I 
 would recommend this game.

Review:  OMG!!! I can't tell you how addicting this game is. It is a fun game to have. Especially if you're 
 into making movies, but don't have the equipment or actors. This game is great for making shorts 
 and it is freaking fun!
  
  Gameplay: It's a very well put together game. There are some drawbacks. All the drawbacks I could 
 find were with trying to maintain the lot. Movie-making technology on this game is outstanding 
 though. It's perfect for people who are interested in learning what making a movie is like. 8/10
 
  
  Graphics: The graphics are Sims-esque. They aren't horrible but they aren't amazing either. Sometimes 
 in the movies the actor's hands would og through his head if he scratched his head for example. 
 8/10
  
  Sound: In a word: Awesome. I love the music. Some of it sounds like Indiana Jones others sound 
 like they got the music from some cheesy horror flick. The radio broadcasters are funny and they 
 change with the era. And the news announcements offer a funny historical perspective on past and 
 a couple of current events. 10/10
  
  Value: It's totally worth the money to go out and buy. Especially if you love movies and are interested 
 in making movies. 10/10
  
  Reviewer's Tilt: I am addicted to this game. It's so much fun to make movies. 10/10

Review:  I have beem playing the mvies since it was out and i feek this is one good game for the pc that 
 anyone in the simulation is into. the game lets you be the boss and make your own movies and tell 
 the people what to do. it as some fetures of the sims and the sims 2 in it. it lets you control 
 relationships ,stress, boredom, looks, salary, image and more. the game is really easy if you can 
 follow the onscreen tutorial that is in the game to hep you whenever you need it. the game does 
 add the element of challange also. in the game their are rival sudios that lets you be ranked up 
 against them so you know how you are doing. the game's main point is to make a movie. it is on 
 a 5 star scale. you can eventually have a prerelease to hype up the people about the game. certain 
 things you do unlocks extra thing for you to use so your movies get even better. the good thing 
 is tht you can also reaserch the things to get them too. everything is important from the star 
 level of the actors and directors to the way the studio lot looks. when you make the lot you have 
 to make sure to have trailers an enterage and good things for the stars but not let them get addicted 
 to them. so be oon yur best way and not let your stars get lazy or stressed. so this one one game 
 that you should take a look into.

Review:  Im not really a fan of this kind of "tycoon" games, but the movies introduce the whole magic of 
 the industry. Its a great game that lets you enjoy the marvelous evolutio of the cinematigraphical 
 industry from its beggining to the actual days.
  
  You can appreciate in a really excellent worked way the evolution of technology, quality and complexity 
 of your own movies, yo have to administer your studio and make it a potence, you have to make your 
 star shine like true star nad you have to produce marvelous movies that keep recorded in the minds 
 of the audience to own the big prizes.
  
  With excellent and detailed graphics, marvelous sound and a excellent developed gameplay, the movies 
 its one of the most addictive and best games ive played recently.

Review:  ok dont get me wrong this is a fun game... its just in the previews it looked amazing like u could 
 make your own sets ceate your own actors, make your own movies! Like you have lots of controll
 
  
  But as fun as it seems it dosent give you as much control as you would like...
  
  - You can't build your own sets you "research" them
  -You need to plant and place cars everyware 
 to make ur studio look pretty, but in the it thos just get in the way of finding that perfect spot 
 for the set you need
  - The actions the Characters can do are already programed in... You cant really edit them in n 
 e way exept like, be happy, or be sad.
  - The moods of the actors, directors, and reviewers are all way too exadurated. The Actors can 
 get really stressed from shooting one seen for like... 1 min. same gose for the directors. The 
 reviewers... well i understand thier just AI and not real people... but come on i got a review 
 that was bad because my set was undermaintnenced... !?! wahhh???
  
  +Its a fun sim game if you dont try to get into serious movies
  +It's a cool consept
  +Building 
 your studio can be fun (w/o planting the plants)
  
  Meh its ok... not great
  
  OH YAH FORGOT the actors use the dumbest sim voises EVER... they have like one line for talking 
 which is like... Mahama Rawichhica... then if they are both guys you get a conversation going... 
 Mahama Rawichhica Mahama Rawichhica Mahama Rawichhica Mahama Rawichhica Mahama Rawichhica... ahh 
 it drives you insane... well if thier mad or sad its different... BUT STILL come on if u use the 
 bad voises @ least have a variety of them!

Review:  This game is amazing! It keeps me coming back to play. The game has flaws like not being able to 
 move people around in the movies and having to stay with the same thing you have. and taking care 
 of your  anything. But thats only for story mode. If you want 
 to avoid all the hard work, then you can go to sand-box mode. This game is addictive and you can 
 post your movies on the website for other people to say"this movie is so stupid". Just joking, the 
 movie is a game that you can't miss. If you don't have the requirements for the game, then you can 
 just wait for the game to come out for ps2, xbox, and gamecube.

Review:  Don't take this the wrong way. I like this game. But it just like everything has it's flaws. You 
 play as the head of a movie studio starting in the 1920 all the way though 2005. During this time 
 you will watch the times change, and the technology change all in this tycoon type gameplay. 
 
  
  The Good:
  Sandbox movie making gameplay, the ability to create your own movies, great tycoon type gameplay, 
 ok graphics, somewhat funny radio D. Js, overall fun if your into this type of thing, ability to 
 keep playing after the game actually ends, everything has a comical aura to it, can make your movies 
 into WMV movies to post on the internet, can add your own voice to movies.
  
  The Bad:
  Not much gameplay if your not into this type of game, not enough people to hire (you sometimes 
 need to adjust workers to fill in different jobs) , actors can be a pain to please (just like in 
 real life) , that stupid aging actor mechanic (actors age and need to retire) , movie making is too 
 restrictive to what scenes can go into the movie. Replay value drops to nothing if you are not 
 into the movie making side of it.
  
  This game is nice. And the DVD verson comes with some extras (nothing special) . The game can be 
 fun if you are willing to let it take you in. If not then by all means avoid it like the plague!!!!!!!!!

Review:  This games was fun, don't get me wrong, but I probably wouldn't buy it if I knew just how short 
 this game was. A lot of people seem to think this game was a work of art, but for me, after one 
 campain and a few hours of making movies I was done with it. Unless, you or your kid is obsessed 
 with a dream of on day making movies, I might suggest passing this one up.
  
  Gameplay: The actual gameplay was fair enough. The goal was to ruin a studio much like you would 
 on rollercoaster tycoon. You hire builders, janitors, extras, scriptwriters, scientists, camera 
 crew, extra to run the studio for you while you select your directors and stars to make your movies 
 glow. The stars are what you might begin to look at as customers, they whine and cry if you don't 
 cater to there needs and will totally mess with your movies success if you ignore them. It's much 
 like babysitting. As far as your movies go, you have the option of creating your own storyboards 
 out of a set of semiflexable scenes or having the script writers do it for you. Ether way, your 
 goal is to make money and with big at the award cerimonys. The cerimonys are why I labeled the 
 gameplay as HARD, simply because I found it annoyingly difficult to please the AI. Sure, I beat 
 the game, as a successful studio easy but becoming the top studio seems impossible because no matter 
 how good your stars were or how you perfected your script, you could never seem to get above one 
 star more than your top scriptwriter could do when it came to movies. In the end after seeing the 
 same scenerios minorly altered over and over, it got old really quick after a little more than 
 a week I was done with it.
  
  Graphics: They where fair good for having to provide flexibility when it came to constant customizing, 
 but they weren't enough to make me excited enough to contiue to play.
  
  Story: Well, it is a simulation, so there is no real story, but you can listen to the radio broadcasts 
 to follow the events that happened to occur over the timeline in which you were making movies.
 
  
  Controls: Basic and easy to follow.

Review:  Kicking things off in 1920, The Movies starts you as the chief of a small upstart movie studio, 
 putting the challenge before you to slowly cultivate it into a top-grossing, award-winning cinematic 
 machine staffed with the best and the brightest talent -- both onscreen and off -- the industry has 
 to offer. Well, as less of a challenge and more of a suggestion, the free-form (or so-called "sandbox") 
 nature of The Movies means you can go about your business however you see fit, without a "wrong" 
 or a "right" way. The game starts out extremely slowly by carefully guiding you through the process 
 of hiring studio staff (like janitors and builders) , helping you decide which cinematic hopefuls 
 will be actors and directors (and which ones will be extras or film crew) , building your first 
 set, and releasing your first movie. This handholding remains pretty intensive for your first few 
 decades as a movie mogul -- and that's a good thing, because there's a lot to digest. 
  
  The core moviemaking process itself can be pretty dense. First, you'll need a screenplay, which 
 means you can choose to write your own (more on that later) , or you can hire a staff of screenwriters 
 to do the heavy lifting for you. Even with the latter hands-off approach, you'll still have to 
 determine the genre of your film, with the given choices of action, comedy, romance, sci-fi, and 
 horror. Different genres have greater general interest in different eras, so even if the film itself 
 is good, the wrong genre at the wrong time could spell box-office disaster. Once you have your 
 screenplay in hand, it's time for casting. The size of your cast and crew will grow over time as 
 you produce bigger, more-sophisticated movies. But in the end, you're always going to need a director, 
 some actors, a movie crew, and, usually, a handful of extras. Who you choose to fill these roles 
 will ultimately affect your end product. How experienced is your crew? What sort of mood is your 
 talent in? Do the director and the lead actor get along well? Though it can make the process of 
 casting your movies quite maddening, it's actually rather impressive to realize the minute details 
 that can have an impact. 
  
  You don't have much control once shooting commences, though that doesn't mean you shouldn't keep 
 a watchful eye over the production. Though most of your employees are basically just automatons 
 doing the job assigned to them, actors and directors are much more complicated, emotional creatures, 
 requiring significant quantities of your attention. Their true characters will often be revealed 
 under the duress of filming, informed by a dozen or so different stats unique to each person. Most 
 of your problems basically come down to stress -- and how your talent deals with it. A stressed-out 
 actor or director won't turn in a very good performance, and he or she will often turn to food 
 and drink for comfort. This is tolerable in moderation, but some people have a greater proclivity 
 toward vice than others, which, if left unchecked, can bring a production to a screeching halt. 
 In turn, this can send the cost of your production through the roof as you send the person to your 
 own private in-studio rehab center.

Review:  I just got this game recently for christmas and I have spent so much time playing it lately that 
 it is ridiculous. Playing both modes of gameplay are extremely fun. The best part is that you can 
 create your own scripts and make entire movies by yourself using The Movies software! The game 
 does have limitations but if you get creative then there is no limit as to what you can accomplish 
 with this game. The only downside I see to this game is that it is highly addictive and can take 
 away a lot of time. I can not wait for some expansions to start rolling out!!

Review:  The Movies is actually not as excatly as it was shown on the commericals, but I'm not saying that 
 as a bad thing, in fact, this is a good thing, GO GET THIS GAME NOW!!!!!! This game is the ultimate 
 simulation game made by Lionhead Games, since.... well.... have they ever made a game before? But 
 why look on the negative, this game has a Star Maker feature that allows you to make your own movie 
 Superstar, and plus, you control what the stars do, the movies you make, and your own studio lot. 
 You can also let millions around the world look at your movie on the website (gotta put mines on 
 there pronto, work work work... heh) . The tutorial on the game is also great. Just don't let the 
 Tutorial get in the way of any of your works.

Review:  An ambitious and interesting idea. This game only barely gets buy on its merits.
  
  Superficially deep. In reality the quality of your movies (to the game) has nothing to do with 
 the quality of movies as movies. Your staffs numerical rating, etc, decide how it does at the box 
 office.
  The movies that your script writers produce are only nonsensical and you won't want/need to watch 
 them after the first few and the novelty wears off.
  Intersting but often impractical UI means you can see information on any object in game, but there 
 is no way to quickly compare and select different information. A shiv in the side of any strategy 
 game.
  There is no way to control the camera movement and you must select from an unwieldly large selection 
 of predefined scenes.
  
  Generaly: The game tries to combine a buisness sim and a video creation tool and succeeds on some 
 level, but both elements are inferior and awkward on their own. The online component is interesting, 
 but ultimately this software doesn't have the flexability to give the online element legs. Dead 
 in a year.

Review:  This game got a lot of hype in the run-up to release, and I'm going to get straight to the point 
 as I absent-mindedly drink this can of Pepsi; it doesn't quite to live up to the hype it got. It 
 takes a lot of work to make a full movie business simulator, and this is undoubtedly the best one 
 yet, but there is still room for improvement that will hopefully come along in the Movies expansion 
 pack [which will probably happen] 
  
  The Movies, in case anybody has been living in a heavily secluded clearing in the middle of the 
 Brazilian rainforest for the last few months, is a deep, detailed management sim where you are 
 the owner of a movie studio. It's an ambitious project, and Lionhead haven't quite pulled it off 
 the way they should have; everything is clear and correct, but this game just isn't as fantastic 
 as other sims like Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. It's hard to explain, but The Movies is missing a sort 
 of X factor, the thing that will bring you back again and again. 
  
  Everything is here like you'd expect in a management sim; actors, actresses, staff, movie makers, 
 scriptwriting, cleaning, post-production, a makeover engine, cosmetic surgery, and all those microscopic 
 details that make the basis of a management sim; you know, happiness, ratings, prestige, and god 
 knows what else. 
  
  So yeah, use all these tools to make blockbuster movies and a dominant film studio. Sounds simple, 
 but The Movies is very time-consuming and you need a lot of patience to actually achieve your goal. 
 It isn't as addictive as it sounds either; the learning curve is very off-putting at the beginning, 
 and although it comes complete with a decent instruction manual and a buttload of tutorials, it's 
 still complex enough to put off casual gamers who just want to laugh at movies that make no sense. 
 The movie maker is nowhere near as deep as it should be, it consists of just placing your actors 
 in the provided mannequins and putting one scene after a-bloody-nother.
  
  Sure, maybe I'm being a bit harsh on The Movies, but to me, this was a bit of a disappointment. 
 There's no doubt it has glitzy presentation; it has great, but somewhat familiar music, and the 
 visuals are an excellent example of CGI, but underneath it all it's all a bit bland. There's not 
 enough here to keep people going for ages, it's nowhere near as addictive as it should be. No doubt 
 it's an achievement, and one of the best management sims for months, but it is nowhere near the 
 killer it should have been, because the gameplay gets tedious quickly. For me, The Movies is a 
 bit of a disappointment. And that disappointment is something I can't describe.

Review:  A new idea and it worked beyond my expectations. I never would have thought to have made a game 
 based on you, being the head of a studio, hiring actors, directors, extras, builders, researchers 
 and even Janitors. I never thought I would enjoy playing the game let alone spend hours and hours 
 on it.
  
  So, I bought this game for 18, with a discount of course, brand new. I set off wondering how on 
 earth we play this game. The manual was a good start, it also explained what I would expect to 
 come across in the game. Now it was time to get to the actual game.
  
  Even with a 128 MB nVidia Graphics card Geforce 5200MX and 2.4 Ghz also packed with 1GB RAM, I 
 never thought the game would run well. Once I was in, I was shocked and amazed. Although the engine 
 created did not require a powerful processor, I was very pleased that I was off past the first 
 hurdle and this was with the Graphics at the highest level.
  
  It then began telling me, with a woman's voice, on how I was going to start the Studio, hire actors, 
 builders etc and also develop my Studio. The great thing as well with the help guide is that its 
 within the game itself so whenever something new comes up or you unlock, it explains briefly what 
 it does and what you can do with it. Its superb to see games that tell you this and that whilst 
 in game mode rather than going through a tutorial which you may end up forgetting once in a while.
 
  
  This "playing game help guide" kept me playing the game because I was always looking to do something 
 else and something new. It was non-stop and at one point it became chaotic. Thats not to say that 
 this is a bad point, in fact, it was real, you have actors and directors looking for things to 
 do, television needs us, as the leader to give the audience entertainment. I was pretty much very 
 occupied preparing to shoot new films and found that I had too few actors and too few directors. 
 Because it is limited at the start and the Studio is small, you have get the balance right, balance 
 is everything.
  
  I could go and on, so, I want everyone to know that getting this game will be a challenge because 
 there are so many things you can do. From creating actors, even getting to do your own scripts, 
 remaster shootings of films, and even sharing movies on the web, the game has endless opportunities 
 and it fails in the area of boredom. In fact, the actors get bored so you have to be active all 
 the way. I would to sum it up with the awards ceremony, even though I am still in the 1930's, I 
 have failed to be nominated for films and also best Studio, I am going to everything in my power 
 to achieve this, you write good films and have the chemistry at its peak amongst actors, directors 
 and the crew, you achieve recognition and that is what I like to do in a game like this.
  
  The graphics, again, look strong even with a decent spec. The sound goes well, of course, the actors 
 don't have real voices, although you can add voice overs and sound efforts. If I keep on rambling 
 on, then you will get bored, instead, you can go and get the game and enjoy many hours of entertainment, 
 just like on television, thats what we enjoy best.

Review:  First off this game offers something new and unique. If you dreamed about making movies or running 
 a movie studio this is your game. For all others it's still an interesting game.
  
  The game offers a campaign and open-play style, the campaign takes you back in the 40's since the 
 birth of the movie era. As you begin to play you have like a little tutorial the first 15-20 minutes, 
 and after you complete that you are on your own, but still with some helpful tips. You build up 
 graduosly and make your movie studio better and better.
  You can do everything Warner Bros studio can do and evn more. You can sign up movie stars, movie 
 crew, script writers, janitors and builders- which are required to build stuff. You have 3 main 
 menus where from which you can build everything.
  
  Gameplay is rather good, but still it lacks some details and varieties. Beacose everything happens 
 at a rather slow pace the game get boring after 10 hours, and mauby the most interest part is when 
 you have build everything and you just make your own movies, but still that gets boring also beacose 
 of the stupid way you make your own movies.
  
  Graphicly the game looks good, details are good but season times are missing as you would play 
 for years (game time) and you wont see winter or spring, also rain or some storms would have been 
 good. The camera is rather stupid as at max zoom-out it's still close to the ground and you see 
 only a small area of view.
  
  Sound or should i say the music is extremly good in the game and it livens up the atmosphere in 
 the game. There arent much of voices in the game, expect of the mumbling of your movie stars which 
 cant be call voice.
  
  Overall the game is fun at the begining but after 10 hours as i sed it gets boring, but still you 
 have 10 hours of quality gameplay!!!

Review:  It has been a long time since I have played a tycoon game that made me lose track of time. My first 
 night playing easily kept me up well past sunrise, but the replay value on The Movies is just so 
 high and there are so many ways to look at the game. Do you want to play the game as a 'Tycoon' 
 and work through the career mode, or do you want to take to the sandbox an dbecome a movie director?
 
  
  The Movies gives you the option to post created movies online on Lionhead Studios central directory 
 and have fellow players vote on them. Movies with high ratings get awards and virtual points which 
 can be used in an online shop to buy new sets, costumes and backgrounds to be used in future movies, 
 which can them be placed online, voted on, etc...
  
  Through the decades, the music changes via a radio station with a DJ that suits the era you are 
 playing in. And there are several background songs that can be played in your movies to give it 
 that extra 'edge'.
  
  You can also plug in a microphone and record voice-overs in your movies giving it that personal 
 feel. Not only is that a neat idea, but really adds to a movie if done right.

 sims imitating game as playboy - the mansion . but hell no ! this game is so addictive .i'm not 
 sims fan , i don't even like sims , because it's to boring , but in movies there are so much action 
 , there is no time to get bored . but why is it that hard ? i'm always falling behind other studios 
 , it's to da*n hard to make a real good movie or to raise your actor to superstars . but i'm trying

Review:  The Movies has a very interesting concept that may appeal to many, but does it actually deliver? 
 Does it make it possible for us to make movies or is it just a gimmick of sorts? I guess it all 
 depends on what kind of movies you would like to make. I installed the game with great anticipation 
 but when I finally began working on a movie, I have to admit I was pretty disappointed.
  
  Before you can actually make movies, you must first build your own studio and run it from 1920 
 to the modern age. Yes, you can also just jump in the sandbox mode, but if you want to unlock anything, 
 you have to play through the main mode at least once. For me, that was a bit of a problem. As in 
 some tycoon simulation games this part of the game was rather boring and a real chore. It's pretty 
 standard stuff: build facilities, sets... but the real pain were the "stars"... constantly nagging, 
 getting addicted to food and alcohol, demanding trailers and entourage. Combine that with the maintenance 
 required for all of your buildings to remain in use and the number of message alerts popping up 
 all over the studio can get quite overwhelming. This sort of micromanagement can get pretty hectic 
 and frustrating as your studio becomes bigger without really adding depth to the game - assuming 
 that's what they were going for. Also worth mentioning that the game is fairly hard and even though 
 I enjoy a challenge, I was expecting a lighthearted game and not having to sit and watch through 
 the annual awards hardly ever winning something.
  
  I played the main mode for about a week, but when I got to 1978. I just couldn't go on and decided 
 to start making movies. That's when things began to get very disappointing. The game lets you believe 
 it is much deeper and more complex than it actually is. In reality, it all boils down to placing 
 one scene after another onto the film strip. The biggest flaw in the entire game (and an unforgivable 
 one) is that you are unable to direct your movies. You cannot take control of the camera. It's 
 a fully 3D game - was it such a problem to let the player take control of the camera and you know, 
 direct the movie? There are some rare scenes that let you change angles and positions of the shot, 
 but that just isn't enough.
  
  I've had a few ideas but they were mostly relying on the visual aspect, not so much on the story. 
 I guess I'm just kind of an artsy-fartsy guy and it seems Lionhead didn't have people like me on 
 their minds when creating this game.
  
  The post production is probably the most interesting part of the game; it allows you to cut scenes, 
 add music, sound effects, subtitles and even your own voicework. You can make something really 
 interesting if you put a lot of work and creativity into it, but not being able to direct is just 
 unforgivable.
  
  The graphics are good, but you won't find anything special here. The studio lot looks nice and 
 colorful, but the character models could've used more detail - they all look pretty much the same 
 and there's something about their expressions and movement... whether it's crying or running, all 
 of it looks funny - great if you want to make comedy films, not so great if you'd like to make 
 a serious film. The music is also very good, both in the sim mode and when making movies. As you're 
 progressing through the game, the music changes to fit the age and the DJ's inform you of the "latest" 
 news like the ending of World War II and such. It's a nice addition that helps to immerse you in 
 the game a bit.
  
  Like GameSpot's review suggests, this is really two games rolled into one - the tycoon simulation 
 game and the movie maker, but the true problem is that they're both lacking. It's a great concept 
 and I hope they build on it, but I'd scrap the sim part of the game altogether and focus on the 
 movie maker. Maybe that way they would succeed on delivering what they initially promised - a deep, 
 immersive game about creating films.

Review:  NB: The version of The Movies I'm reviewing is v1.1 and is no longer such a system hog as it was 
 before. Get the patch you idiots!
  
  ---
  
  The Movies is one of the better management games that I've seen in a long time, and certainly deserves 
 the time I've been spending on it. According to my Xfire profile, I've been playing it for 13 hours 
 over the past seven days. 
  
  But how does it play?
  
  As the name suggests, you are in charge of a new movie studio in the heart of Hollywood (so we're 
 told) and the lack of a stats-filled interface is refreshing, although it takes getting used to. 
 Information is mainly received by right clicking any character or building on in your studio and 
 finding the required information, however eventually it does get cluttered with bubbles after a 
 frantic right-clicking frenzy to find someone.
  
  Other controls is handled by a simnple drag and drop system, for example, to to rlease a movie, 
 you have to drag it from the sidebar and drop it into Release in the Production Office. Although 
 it's very hadny in the beginning, once your studio becomes huge, you will get slightly riled that 
 you can't find the damn building. Although you do get little sparlky streams suggesting where to 
 go, if you have a weak system, dragging will make you go way too far off the mark. 
  
  The main gimmick with this game however, is to shoot your own movies. Usuing the same drag and 
 drop system you can quickly make a short movie about anything really, and if you want, you can 
 release them to the public viw the community website - http://www. themoviesgame. com/community - 
 where if it's good enough, you can download extra gubbins for your studio.
  
  The sounds in this game are fairly annoying after a while. Your actors, like in The SIms, speak 
 no recognisable speech, so your movies will benefit from the lip-synching and recording technologies 
 bundled with the game. The main gripe with the sounds are the radio presenters. A lot of the voices 
 you'll want to walk to their studio and strangle them for being so damned annoying. The humour 
 of this game is also sadly lacking. This may not matter to you, but the British always expect British 
 developers to inject a little humour into it, and sadly, it is evident that the game is targeted 
 for American audiences. Ah well, that's where the money is nowadays
  
  Don't let this little niggle stop you from buying the game. If you turn off the DJs in the sound 
 options, you have a fantastic game to start your dreams of becoming the next Speilberg
  
  Possibly

Review:  Muststopplayingmustgetair. Ah, thats better. No! I must become the greatest B-movie maker 
 of all time! And I will damn it! Youll see, you will all see!!!!!
  
  Thanks to Lionhead Studios excellent game The Movies I think it is safe to say that The Sims 
 2, The Sims and all those expansion packs have been put to shame as now, finally we have a sim 
 experience with a difference that now we actually have something to do! With proper missions and 
 proper goals! Sure, there are things to do in the dominating Franchise but nothing is as emotionally 
 fulfilling and involving as watching your own movie studio flourish from a simple stage school 
 to a full, blown up movie city where you control everything from janitors to actors, to script 
 writing to post production where you tweak the movie and ad voice-overs. How can that not be cool? 
 
  
  Well it is very cool indeed and what makes the game even more spectacular is how Lionhead have 
 managed to get it to work so perfectly. So many Tycoon games have given us the ability to run theme 
 parks, airports and cities, but nothing has been so engrossing as The Movies. Its such a thrill 
 to work through all the decodes, right from the 20s of silent films to the year 2000, whilst trying 
 to keep your studio from becoming bankrupt by demanding actors failing movies. 
  
  The amount you can do in this game is mind blowing. A shortlist includes: creating actors and directors, 
 builders and janitors for the studio lots, scientists to discover new filmmaking trends and techniques, 
 screenwriters to create the screenplays if you dont want to try your hand at it yourself, and 
 so much more. Theres building sets, having an on-site bar and restaurant, as well as a rehab centre 
 in case any of your stars get addicted to too much food or drink, a makeover department, a plastic 
 surgeon, trailers for the stars to relax in, entourages to follow the stars around, paparazzi to 
 snap pictures, awards ceremonies, radio DJs, and all this is even before you make your own movies.
 
  
  Creating your own screenplays is a blast in itself. You get to choose a genre and whos going to 
 star in your feature, and then put scenes together from a huge selection, and I mean huge (imagine 
 a scene from your favourite movie. You got one? Well in The Movies I promise you can recreate that 
 scene easily!) . You can even go in and tweak the selections by adjusting camera angles, close ups, 
 you name it. And if all this sounds like it would be incredibly hard, I guarantee you this games 
 easier than any of the Sims games right out of the box. You wont even have to crack the instruction 
 manual, unless you want to. Just be careful not to spend too long creating your screenplays as 
 you might find yourself thinking havent I done this all before? Yes you have, remember when 
 you made Baggage Boy 2
  
  There have been plenty of groovy games released recently but theres only one must-own-title for 
 all gamers out their and that is The Movies. The music, graphics, and animations are all really 
 superb, but its that game play  the most important thing of all in any game  that shines brightest 
 here, and will keep players glued to their seats for days and weeks on end. This is undoubtedly 
 the best PC game of 2005 and if its not in your collection then shame on you! 
  
  Now if youll excuse me, I have a few drunken actors to fire and new blockbuster to create. Goodbye 
 Darlings!

Review:  Firstly I would like to say that the game is excellent, the idea is superb.
  I`m playing it 2 months already, and each time I reach year 1980 or 70 or 90 I turn the game OFF 
 and say to myself that I wont play it again, because there are to much tasks that you must do at 
 the same time, make your extras practise, shoot new movies, lay new grass, search for old ornaments 
 to delete them and buy new ones. There are too many tasks for one person. You need to concentrate 
 on all of them but you can`t because always you have problems with your stars or movies or money. 
 I think that the game is perfect but not superb. I would rate it 7,5/10.

Review:  Gameplay: Very addicting and fun, easy to play for hours. The movie making is pretty in depth if 
 you want to take the time to do it. Only people that didn't want to take the time to figure it 
 out wouldn't like it.
  
  Graphics; The graphic are pretty nice, I mean you can actually watch the people eat their food 
 and it overall looks nice.
  
  Sound: The sound is what you would expect from Lionhead. The music is decent and you can hear your 
 director yelling "Action!" and "Cut!" in a loud voice. i like the sound when you go and hold left 
 click and take people out from the star thing on the left side of the screen.
  
  Value: The replay value is pretty good. I mean you can always go back and build up your studios 
 different. Hire different stars and put in different ornaments. Of course, make better movies with 
 your experience.
  
  Tilt: Overall I give this game a 9. This game is good. Like all of the other good games, there 
 is always something you want to change about it.

Review:  Hot off the heels of Fable: The Lost Chapters, and Black and White 2, Lionhead Studios has released 
 a truely genuine and one of a kind tycoon game. When you think of tycoon games, you instantly think 
 of Rollercoaster Tycoon, or Sim City, but what The Movies does best is take all of the great features 
 of tycoon games, and adds a whole new dimension to it. In The Movies, you are an aspiring studio 
 owner. In order to beat the competition and reach the top of the studio charts, you must hire actors, 
 build sets, write scripts, and much more. Most of the game (if you so chose) will be played like 
 a tycoon game, putting you in charge of running the studio, making it look better, and interacting 
 with your stars and actors. For those of you into movie making, there is a completely different 
 way to go. In addition to the tycoon type gameplay, there is the advanced/custom movie making feature. 
 Though it takes a while to unlock, you will eventually be able to select from literally thousands 
 of animations and piece a masterpiece of your own together. I highly recommend that you go ahead 
 and let the scriptwriters write your scripts for you for a while so you can get a feel of how long 
 each movie should be, and what animations are better than others. Without knowing what to do when 
 creating a movie, it will take you hours upon hours just to get a two minute movie set up. Overall 
 though, making movies is very fun, along with controlling how the movie studio operates. Back to 
 making your movie studio work, you have a ton of stuff to do in order to reach the top. First, 
 your stars have to be high ranked on the star charts. You'll have to improve their image, give 
 them eventual raises, provide them with a trailer and provide them with an entourage. You also 
 need your stars to interact with each other, both for high chemistry in movies and to get their 
 star rating up. And finally, you have to make sure that they're always occupied with something 
 to do, but not too stressed out by work. If so, then your movie quality will suffer. You also have 
 to make sure that your stars remain "sober" to the two types of addictions -- food and drink. If 
 that happens, you have to put them in rehab in order to "kick the habit." In addition to having 
 high ranking stars, in order for your studio to be a high ranking one, you must have high charting 
 movies. First, you need good scriptwriting. At the beginning, your scriptwriting will be bad, but 
 as your scriptwriters write more movies, they'll get better. Of course, your actors must be good, 
 like I explained earlier. You also have to make sure though that you don't use actors to often, 
 or people will get bored of the same people in movies. Another thing that cannot be used too often 
 is the sets, if they do then the movie will suffer as well. If you manage to avoid all of these 
 obstacles however, you will make a very good movie. Looking back on all I had to write explaining 
 how to make a good movie, and studio, I realized that there's way to much stuff to do in this game 
 just to make a movie. It does show you how hard the movie-making process is, but I really don't 
 want to have to worry about sending stars to rehab, and making sure that they get press attention. 
 So in short, the gameplay in The Movies is very good, but very detailed, so at some point, you 
 will be tired of having to move around all the time instead of being able to sit and watch. However, 
 it's still a great idea, and if you are at all interested in making movies, this is a great tool. 
 The graphics in The Movies are also really good. Most strategy/tycoon games do look good at a distance, 
 but if you zoom in, it looks really bad. The Movies, however, retains very good graphics both up 
 close and far away. There's nothing else really to say about the graphics other than that they're 
 really good in pretty much every way you think of it. The sound in The Movies is also fantastic. 
 While you are playing, it's got sort of a movie-themed radio station to tell you about the happenings 
 in the studio world, the real world, play music, and entertain you with lots of funny jokes. For 
 example, a voice will come up and say that you have more people in line to become actors, so that 
 you can immediately go and pick which ones you like. They will also announce when award ceremonies 
 are coming up too. The radio personality (which is very accurate as you move from time period to 
 time period) , will tell you about what is happening in the real world at that time. Wars may be 
 going on, or teenagers may be rebelling, but believe it or not, you will need to know this stuff 
 and how it effects the movies you make and what genres to select. In addition to notifying you 
 about things going on, the radio personalities are all very good for comic relief. Every time you 
 see them come on, they'll crack a time-appropriate joke, some of which will have you rolling on 
 the floor with laughter. Some, however, are a little risque. In the Cold War era, you'll hear a 
 bunch of crude comments about communism and communists. Some of the stuff they'll say will have 
 you saying "Oh my goodness, I can't believe he said that," but nonetheless, it's time-appropriate, 
 and very accurate. Overall, there may be a ton of stuff to do in The Movies, but when it comes 
 down to fun, The Movies captures the heart and soul of the movie making business, and gives the 
 power to you at your fingertips, and it's an absolute joy. If you are at all interested in Movies, 
 then you should definately go out and buy this game.

Review:  Never has a game that I can remember, allowed a player to direct, star in, voice over, and produce 
 a product that was then played on MTV, CNN and reported in news papers across the world. Yes a 
 video game did this, it was a movie about the riots in France, but it just goes to show you as 
 it did me if you build it they will come.
  
  Between the tycoon game play, which admittedly when I come in an amusement park atmosphere I could 
 care less, but something like producing your own movies, well thats just my bag. The Sims II graphics 
 and voices, with none of the instability problems that come with, you just can get much better 
 on a first try on a completely new concept. When I can zoom from a birds eye to a Hey! Pop that 
 pimple in once simple movement, and not suffer, well Im the happiest Writer, Director, Actor, 
 Key Grip, Producer there ever was. 
  
  And I cant wait for the next installment from the geniuses over the pond, at the Lionhead Studios.

Review:  The Movies is a great game to make your own movies, watch them and upload them to the internet. 
 You can be hours and hours everyday and not get bored of it.
  
  GAMEPLAY:
  The gameplay is intuitive, and easy to get used to. You can start with the very, very useful tutorials, 
 and end up playing as if you've had the game for years.
  
  GRAPHICS:
  The graphics remind us of the Sims 2 game. Make your own stars and place them in a completely 3D 
 movie studio. The bad thing is, sometimes parts of their bodies disappear inside their shirt, or 
 their hair disappears inside their back. 
  
  SOUND:
  The game has got dozens of sounds you can put on your movies, plus a fake radio you can listen 
 to, plus the music.
  
  VALUE:
  The game is very very good, intuitive, and original. It's definitely a good game.
  
  REVIEWER'S 
 TILT:
  This is a fantastic game which you can play for hours and hours. I've really enjoyed it, and still 
 will do.
  
  Good and bad:
  + You can make your own movies, with nearly no limits.
  + You can import your own voice to the movies.
  + Dozens of sounds to add to the Movies.
  + 
 Be a millionaire, and create your own movie studio.
  + Detailed graphics and animations. 
  
  - Some graphic problems.
  - You can only make your films with the already made scenes.
 
  - Unless you choose not to in the sandbox mode, after making the script in the movie maker, you 
 have to wait for them to record EVERY SINGLE SCENE.
  - If you're not careful, the stars will get addicted to alcohol or food.

Review:  The game it's self i very good and the thought of making a top movie is good but there are some 
 down falls in this game. The graphics are a bit dissapointing and need improvment but you can play 
 it without worring about that. You will need to make shaw that your computer is the 1 of the latest 
 out as it takes it. I had to upgrade my computer to play it and it isnt cheap. When you get on 
 the game and make your first film that is when you become addicted or sad because you will learn 
 if you like the game in the time it takes you to do your first film. I think to have real fun with 
 this game you need to have a microphone to record voices. 
  
  Thank you for reading

Review:  this is a ok game it has the bad and good like every game dose......... the good is that yes you 
 can make movies even your own movies and the bad is that it takes a long time for the actors to 
 make the movie and it's hard to keep the people happy and after the first hour it gets boring. 
 The good is also that you make movies watch them and make more movies it's still a good game also 
 if you like the sims you will like this or if you like this you should try the sims 2 thosse games 
 are fun.

Review:  The Movies is surprisingly an amazing game.
  There are two parts of the game while playing The Movies.
  
  You can play it like a Tycoon 
 Game and let Scriptwriters write your scripts and then choose the actors you want to have in your 
 movie and wWhen the film is done shooting you can actually see it.
  
  Or you can play it like the Director and shoot the movies on your own.
  You can choose from very 
 many scenes and if you have researched after sets you can have lots of sets, as well.
  
  The sounds in the game... are really great. I think they fit so perfect in the game and they're 
 just perfect.
  
  The Movies also have an online community where you can upload the Movies a you made and rate others. 
 If you upload your movies you will 
  win credits that you can use to buy new props.

Review:  If you're looking for a game that allows you to really grasp the movie-making process that seems 
 very similar to real life, then the game, "The Movies," by developper Lionhead Studios, is the 
 game for you.
  
  It is truly a strategy game like no other. It implements all the things that a normal strategy 
 game would, like barely using the keyboard. In all seriousness, when you look at the Movies from 
 a comparison to something like, oh I don't know... Let's just randomly take one from the hat, and 
 say "The Sims 2," it steals some originality, and adds to it.
  
  When you first kick off the game in 1920, you will see the timeline appear. This is amazing. It 
 goes from the stockmarket crashing, to war happening, to world peace, to kids acting up, to telephones, 
 to televisions, to EVERYTHING. It all happens that happened in the real world, and if you watch 
 the background of the cars going by, as time goes by, they will change to more advanced cars. It's 
 really something to see everything progress.
  
  The only problem with time in this game, is there is no night. It's constantly day-time, and months 
 go by strangely faster than a normal strategy game. You'll find yourself in a new month in 4 minutes.
 
  
  The graphics of this game... Here's where that *random comparison* comes in. The characters? Yeah... 
 EXACTLY, EXACTLY, EXACTLY like The Sims 2. I swear, if I didn't know that Lionhead Studios made 
 this game, I would swear it was a Maxis game.
  
  The way the game plays is fantastic, but there really seems to be something missing in the connectivity 
 between the advanced movie-maker and The Movies game itself. The advanced movie-maker seems like 
 a pre-school movie-maker tool that comes with the game.. It doesn't feel like it goes with the 
 game, entirely.
  
  The game also comes with a StarMaker tool. This is almost exactly the same as Maxis' "The Sims 
 2" Bodyshop, where players create their own sim with full customization, and abilities to create 
 textures on clothing, etc.
  
  The Movies falls short on originality, but it beats "The Sims 2" in one thing. Personality. Every 
 star has a different personality, while the characters of "The Sims 2" are all alike. Betcha never 
 noticed THAT...  _ ...
  
  MOVING ON, The Moves is a good spirited game, but it lacks a lot of what it could've been on its 
 own, without leaning on shoulders of originality like "The Sims 2". Maybe the expansions will clear 
 out what it's lacking.
  
  Yes, there will be expansions. There is prove on themoviesgame. com
  
  All in all, the Movies 
 is really original, and everyone who's tired of same-old same-old strategy games should check it 
 out!

Review:  
  I won't repeat too much of what others have said, so I'll get straight to my point about what's 
 right and wrong about this game.
  
  Too much of The Movies is devoted to Sims/ Sim City style studio building. This isn't horrible 
 in itself, but it's been done before -- and better. The novelty of designing your own studio lot 
 wears thing quickly. Also, in this mode you really end up spending much of your time soothing your 
 fragile stars. This is NOT fun for me, personally; it feels as silly and time wasting, and often 
 frustrating, as dragging my sims to the bathroom. It's a strangely cynical view of Hollywood that 
 actors and actresses are so prone to addition and tantrums; it should happen only to the very top 
 few actors on your lot, maybe, not them ALL. 
  
  The Movies then has its second game, of sorts, the movie making itself. This is much better than 
 I anticipated. You are obviously limited in how many sets, actors, and props you can include, and 
 the formulaic scenes to choose from leave some key concepts out (example: there is at least one 
 "Regain Consciousness" scene, but not one "Lose Consciousness" one. D'oh!)
  
  Having said that, you can really work some creativity into what you're given. Also, there HUNDREDS 
 of props; the ability to design your own stars; HUNDREDS of costumes (some really great, like the 
 ghosts and the robots) ; plus all types of directing "sliders" to make one scene neutral or angry 
 or happy, etc. Add some weather effects, total backdrop control; further add the ability to record 
 AND synch dialogue, plus import original music . . . wow, this can be a fun, robust movie making 
 game. In fact, it's almost not a game in that respect at all; it's a creative piece of software 
 that could give young (or old) amateur film-makers some serious toys to play around with.
  
  I wish they had just made a movie making game than this two-in-one offering. The studio managing 
 is a bore, if not a chore. But the movie making is not done in any other game I can think of, making 
 it both wholly original and a small joy.
  
  So if I were god or Peter Molywhatever, I would make a Movies sequel with all film-making and add 
 some more directing options, like more angle control, lens filtering, transitions, and directing, 
 on top of more of the basics like sets, props, and costumes.
  
  For any creative type out there, this is pretty fun; I'd recommend it. If you're not particularly 
 creative but like micromanaging games like Sim-x, I'd pass, though. And if you are neither of these 
 things, DEFINITELY pass.

Review:  The Movies is a stratigy game based in Hollywood starting in 1920. The thing that is so amazing 
 about the game is the depth. The game gives options for everything, from makeovers, to cosmetic 
 surgery. When the game starts, the movies are black and white and the scripts suck, makeing your 
 movies suck, but as the game progresses, the radeo personalitys and the technoligies change. But 
 eventually i found a patern to help with the strain on stars stress to makeing good movies. I actually 
 found it easier to make a bunch of small crapy movies and release a bunch fast then to make big 
 movies and release them slowly.
  To be completly truthful, the main reason i got the movies was for the movie makeing tools, which 
 as good as they are, they are hard to figure out. Ive only actually just now figured out how they 
 work. It gives many script forms, but basiclly, select what set you want, what action you want 
 and put it into production. But to make a truly good film, it takes time and effort and eventually 
 i just moved on to do something else.
  This game is great, but is in no way a perfect game and thair are plenty of strategy games that 
 you can get that are more fun, but this one is adictive and quite fun, but most people who play 
 it will probably like it at first but eventually get pissed off at it and it will easly be overlooked, 
 all because of how anoying the stars are to keep happy.

Review:  amazing idea by Activison with big help of lionhead, and ATi
  
  the gameplay is amazing! the best simulation tycoon since the sims!
  you make your own movies 
 choosing from a variety of sets and scenes, hire your starts/directors, movie crew, janitors, and 
 builders, scriptwritors or make your own scirpt which gives you a deep amount of control, chose 
 Genres like action, comedy, horror, romance or sci-fi. each actor has his/her different movie expieriences, 
 some may be good with action or others may be good with Science fiction. also run competitons with 
 other studios and climb the studio charts, (along with actor. acteress charts, movie charts) get 
 balcked down by paparazzi and tabloids. the movie making is great you can add subtitles and voice 
 overs.
  
  the graphics arent so spectacular, it depnds on what graphics card you have, the game works great 
 with ATi radeon cards, on my laptop it runs very well and with an ATi Radeon x550. on the average 
 PC (around the status of an ATi Radeon 7200) it runs, o. k
  
  the sound is pretty good, it had alot of pre-loaded music tracks thats can be added to your movies 
 but you can add your own music by converting your file to a .ogg file. the voiceovers i think are 
 the most realistic part of the movie making, some people arent too good with voice-overs but it 
 adds alot of drama and 'spunk' to the film
  
  the value is.... defenitely worth it for $49.99 but my dad payed $68.52 (for premier editon of the 
 game, taxes 6%, and wrapping) i got it for free though because it was my christmas present.
  
  overall the game is wonderful and everyone should go and by it

Review:  The Movies is a very fun simulation game, but it is just that  a simulation game. While you can 
 make movies, and the movie making controls are fairly deep, there are limitations on the movies 
 you make.
  
  As a simulation game The Movies is very addicting. It is a lot of fun building the lot, influencing 
 the movies being made, and working toward building up your stars.
  
  Take note  if you are looking to buy this game strictly for the make my own movies aspect, make 
 sure you read up on the game first. You cannot do anything you want when making a movie. You can 
 influence and direct the actors, but that is all. You can become somewhat frustrated when looking 
 for an actor to do a simple action, but unable to have them do it.
  
  Overall The Movies is fun and addicting, I recommend anyone looking to play the game, and not looking 
 to only make movies, pick it up.

Review:  The game The movies by lionhead studios is the second worst game of the year, the reason behind 
 is simple if you want to throw your dad's money then you should buy this game or if you are kind 
 hearted then you should give this money to needy people , now I come to the point that why the 
 game is so awful the reason is it is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo difficult and very short I played 
 the whole game with out any success in couple of days .In its tycoon mode i am not able to complete 
 my movie in 2 years and after its release ( (inspite of all the hardwork) ) my movie gets only 2 
 or 3 stars and after 5 years when the awards ceremony held I got nothing. Its movie making part 
 is not so bad but again it is very hard there is only one way to played this game i_e by converting 
 its DVD in to frees-bee Goodluck

Review:  With the multitude of movies Hollywood is releasing left and right, do you want to get in the action 
 and make a movie of your own? Then The Movies is for you! 
  You start the game with a empty lot. Using the money you have, you can purchase buildings and sets 
 and place them where you please. You can also purchase  
 fountains and all sorts of stuff to decorate your own studio the way you want it. After you progress 
 through the game, you can unlock other buildings and movie sets.
  You start the game in 1920, the era of silent, black-and-white films. So, the films you make will 
 be short and black-and-white with no voices. As the years go by, your films look more modern and 
 clear and you can even add your own voices. At the start, you will make movies by a script that 
 your writers make. They do all the work, all you do is give them orders and pay them their salary. 
 However, if you have the skill and patience, you can purchase the building that allows you to make 
 a script from scratch on your own. This takes alot of work and time, so if you just want to play 
 the game as a tycoon, let your workers write the script. After they write the script, you select 
 one or two of your actors and a director that you hired and you're ready to shoot the film with 
 one of the sets you currenty have in your studio. The game is very realistic in this effect as 
 you can watch every second of filming, from them setting up the set to actually filming it. After 
 filming is done, you release your movie and watch the money roll in. You can even watch the movie 
 itself and send it to your hard drive to share with anyone, even on the internet.
  Graphically, The Movies looks sharp and clear and you can view your studio in 3-D if you want. You 
 may notice the game pause for a second or two (depending on your PC setup) but its nothing serious. 
 If you have a fast CPU and a top notch video card, you'll probably get no slow down or pausing. 
 The building look great and they all operate realistically, like watching a guy prepare burgers 
 in a snack van to watching a builder build a building you just purchased.
  So, if you ever wanted to make your own movies or just wanted to have a tycoon game about making 
 movies, then this game is recommended. But the movie making process itself may be a bit too complicated 
 for some to operate.

Review:  I've been watching and waiting for The Movies for over a year. As a gamer, Im' a bit of an odd 
 duck. I tend toward simulation and RTS games that don't involve a lot of combat. I'd rather spend 
 my time bulding things and mnaging relationships than fighting dragons, driving cars, or flying 
 planes. Unfortnately, that means there are relatively few games out there that I'm goign to be 
 al that interested in playing. So, when I first heard of the movies, I knew I'd want to try it. 
 
  
  The game itself is pretty straightforward. If you the tutorial, you'll be ready to start in no 
 time. The only problem is that you don't initially get much control over your movies. You'll turn 
 out a lot of mediocre silent mvoies while you focus on keeping your stars happy and managing their 
 relationships. If you play long enough in the regular game mode, you'll be able to go further in 
 the sandbox mode, where you'll be able to have more control over your scripts and movies, and experiment 
 with various techniques. (Here's a hint, play through the scirpt and post-production tutorials 
 too.)
  
  The only complaint I have is that the movie-making is rather detail oriented, and you'll probably 
 have to try a few times before you get your story told just right. And the kinds of movies you 
 can make are somewhat limited by the genres and sets available. The online propshop may allieviate 
 some of that, along with the inevitable expansion packs. 
  
  The best thing about the movies is that it puts the tools of media storytelling (machinima) in 
 the hands of lots more people than had them before. And the added ability to export and upload 
 your movies to share online makes it an even more powerful tool for taking storytelling to a new 
 lever and spreading it further than ever before. 
  
  I'll definitely be looking forward to further expansion packs and updates for The Movies.

Review:  THE MOVIES PC Review
  By: StarFry64
  
  For theose past I don't know 3 years, Lionhead Studios has been updating news about their upcoming 
 project The Movies. Although, when this game was first announced, not alot of fans already wanting 
 it. Mainly because it looked like it won't be a good game. In 2005 however, things changed and 
 so many people realized "Hey, I want to be popular and be a filmmaker so why not do that in 'The 
 Movies'". Now the game is out and already the community (movies. lionhead. com) is already filled 
 with filmmakers trying to be the best, to have fun, or really want to be famous. Yes, I know doing 
 that is hard but thats just the online part.
  
  In the story mode (which actually doesn't have story) you have just made a new film studio during 
 the times when the film industry was new to the public. Obviously, right away you gotta have some 
 strageties to make sure you don't go bankrupt and all of that. Once you've gone to a really great 
 road, now its time to make a movie. For some reason, in the early times (20s, 30s) you don't make 
 your own script, the AI makes your own script which just goes to show the game thinks your a NOOB. 
 During the story mode, you will be in Awards show, getting Broadcasts, and etc. The story mode 
 is kind of pleasing though annoying sometimes which I RECCOMEND going to Sandbox.
  
  If you have a movie that you think is done, you take it Post Production. This part of editing is 
 so slow. Every time you drag a cursor, it will take 5 or 10 seconds just to take it to a scene. 
 This recommends you need Windows Medio Player 9 and the system that is also needed for Battlefield 
 2. Although, if you annoy the lag in editing, you'll be fine. Then afterdone editing, there's a 
 upload for sound which takes up depending how long the movie is, and then a upload for exporting 
 it to your computer which takes 15-45 minutes. The editing to me is quite disapointing.
  
  The online is really the bad part if you want to publish them. For example, if you work on movie 
 that is 19 minutes long, has voice overs or subtitles, and was well recieved in the game, and you 
 publish Online. Well what if nobody rated it, or what is everybody only gives it 1-3 stars. Also, 
 there is some glitches with Online, Online accounts, and Online Publishing. I suggest stay away 
 Online (if you want to) and just watch the movies instead.
  
  Overall, the gameplay is new and fresh, but all of the stuff that is really bad sadly pushes it 
 to 8 instead of 10 or 8.9. The graphics is so great however the muddy textues of the video you 
 made is bad making it 8. The sound is great especially during the game as well as the soundtrack 
 of songs you can pick for your movie. The tilt is so easy because it doesn't have any hard controls 
 for doing movies, making your studio, etc. 
  
  The value is right away a must-buy. Gotta pick it up.
  
  9 out of 10

Review:  
  I knew The Movies was gonna be good, I just didnt realize how good. I have been playing this sucker 
 non-stop for the past few weeks and I still am enjoying the game as much as the first day I got 
 it. Peter Molyneux (Fable, Black and White is a god among video game designers.
  
  What is The Movies? Well, at first I thought it was just a game but as I got the hang of it, it 
 is actually both a game and a movie creating tool. Sure, the main portion of the thing is a game 
 in the vein of Theme Park or Sim City. Youre a fledging director of a new film studio and its 
 your job to make your studio numero uno at the end of the line. Along the way, you gain technologies 
 that improve your pictures, turning the once silent black and white movies into the digitalized 
 versions we see today, complete with digital sound and whatnot. How do you do that? Why by making 
 movies and getting famous stars to star in them of course.
  
  A second easily overlooked part of the game is the ability to create your own movies. You can write 
 the dialogue, decide what props to use (kinda boring but necessary) , who to star, what genre it 
 should be in, where to shoot itthings you could do in normal life if you were to direct a movie. 
 Hell, you can add in your own audio tracks for the game and do the voices yourself if you want! 
 Alternatively, you could get the game to make a movie for you to film and play the game totally 
 without jumping into its movie creation toolyour choice. Being a huge fan of Aliens (the first 
 and second movies only cause the rest suck ass) and Star Wars, I naturally tried my hand at making 
 one. It wasnt going to win any Oscars but I did have tons of fun making it. Hell, I even had zombies 
 in the game running around for good measure. As anybody knows, anything with zombies in it automatically 
 makes the movie good!
  
  I have to warn you though, it takes a ton of time to make an entertaining movie and honestly, I 
 spent the better part of an hour just to make a 5 minute clip as I tweaked the scenes and fine 
 tuned it. So be warned! This is not the game you pick up for 10 minutes and then chuck it one corner.
 
  
  Nonetheless, even if you opt to go all out filmmaking only, you cant. You still need to manage 
 your studio, hiring crews and extras for the movies, writers for the scripts and other positions. 
 You get only a limited number of people at one time so youll probably be juggling them from one 
 job to another to make the game flow smoothly. While it does add to the hectic feel of the game, 
 I dont particularly like this and everytime I had to make the hard decision of switching jobs 
 for a poor schmuck, I kept wishing why the hell cant I just hire more people? Im the head of 
 a freaking movie studio for goodness sake, I have money coming out of my ears and I cant hire 
 ONE more extra janitor to scrub my VIP toilets?
  
  With the amount of personnel working under you, I was unpleasantly surprised that a game as polished 
 as The Movies didnt offer a more intuitive system to spot your various employees at a glance. 
 Looking from the default birds eye view, its tough to spot whos who as your employees run around 
 working. It would have been more fun if there were some way to distinguish the various classes 
 from afar.
  
  With the games Starmaker system, you can create your own stars. Using online photos and a lot 
 of trial and error, I was able to make passable copies of Harrison Ford (cant make Star Wars without 
 Han Solo now, can you?) , Mark Hamill, Sigourney Weaver and Carrie Fisher. You can also assign attributes 
 for the stars, so that they act better in certain movies than others. Its a fun and quite powerful 
 tool to mess around with and I spent more time than I should fine tuning the looks of my stars 
 in it. Creating your own stars is better for the game than using the cookie cutter ones the game 
 send your way. With your recognizable names of talent, you can easily fit the stars into the roles 
 you want them to play.
  
  Like in real life (at least I think so) , stars are a **** to keep in fighting form. You need to 
 dress then well, curb their addictions (build a rehab clinic to cure them of overeating or alcoholism) , 
 give them trailers and even the occasional nip and tuck to make them look good.
  
  Costumes play a big part in the game. Your stars need to stay at the top of the fashion mountain 
 to impress fans and to maintain a good mood. While the game offers a diverse selection of costumes 
 you can use, strangely missing is the ability to mix and match your own selection. 
  
  While the game does have icons for the stars to signify if theyre busy or free, it doesnt have 
 any icons at all to show what genre the star is good at. Remember earlier why I said to make your 
 own stars? One of the reasons I recommended it was that very flaw I mentioned. The ONLY way to 
 tell what your star is best suited for it to hover around his/her icon with a mouse for a few seconds, 
 making the pop-up bars appear. Another thing that sucks with the interface is that if you have 
 a big stable of stars, their photos disappear from the HUD and only a small bar remains. That really 
 sucks since youll need to spend time finding the star youre looking for from the list.
  
  The other things I hate about the game (hang on, Im almost done with the ranting parts) , is that 
 destroying your structures is a pain in the ass. Most games of this nature simple feature a destroy 
 or sell button to eliminate unwanted buildings, not so in The Movies. Here, you need to first find 
 a janitor or a builder, and then pick him up and drop him at a specific spot on the building you 
 want gone. A big hassle and a time waster as you need to disrupt your personnels work just to 
 eliminate a building. Last but not least the game tends to stutter a bit as your studio expands 
 but thats an easily overlooked flaw.
  
  I guess, reading what Ive written, it might seem as if Im dissing the game. In fact, its the 
 other way around. The flaws Ive mentioned are only noticeable because the game is so freaking 
 polished you could see yourself in it! I love the game and even with the flaws I mentioned, I still 
 keeping playing it over and over and overOne day, the world will see how Episodes One, Two and 
 Three should REALLY be madeBY ME! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA! George Lucas better be wetting his pants, there 
 be a new Star Wars director in town!

Review:  Well lets try.... a mater piece. this really is one of those games that you just have to have. 
 mainly because its three games in one.
  1. Theme park style lot building sim
  2. sims style character building and managment sim
  3. AN innovative movie making game
  
 
  This really does hae it all , i mean the movies you can make often turn out better than you thought... 
 however like with any animation, alot of work can turn out with little result, to make anything 
 spectacular you really have to put the hours in. but if you wanna make short lttle skits to impress 
 yer mates, there easy enough.
  
  simpley fantastic every aspect of this game seems to exude quality... ya know like when you put 
 a black and white ps2 manual next to a gamecube manual. (I have nothing against ps2 i love their 
 games, gamecubegames just seem to be made with more care :) )

Review:  This game looked decent when being made but the constant delays made me not want to purchase the 
 game. However after reading the review given by game spot I decided to get it anyway.
  
  This game is in a word "AMAZING". A fantastic game. With its addicting game play this is a very, 
 very good game. Its a surprisingly strategic and a fun game to play. Also being able to swap movies 
 with friends is also a good addition to this game.
  
  A really good game recommended to everyone who likes a good strategy game that isnt to hard and 
 has a slick user interface well this is the game for you.

Review:  From running a movie theatre in Cinema Tycoon to making my own flicks in The Movies... Being a 
 control freak in the entertainment business doesn't get any better than this!
  
  The basics of the game start with lot planning and building. Only a few buildings will be available 
 at first, so arrange them in a way that leaves you room for other things. Planning ahead adds to 
 your lot's popularity, so make sure everything is connected by paths (but don't make large paved 
 areas) , place enough restrooms and snack vans, add some landscaping objects and make sure there 
 are a few things your stars can be entertained with. Hire enough janitors to keep your grass green 
 and your litter in the bins and enough builders to build and repair your facilities.
  
  Once you get the Research Lab, you'll be able to hire some researchers and unlock new sets and 
 buildings. More sets and new technology help keep your movies interesting.
  
  You have full control over your crew. People will line up at the different offices to become stars, 
 crews, researchers or maintenance staff. It's up to you to pick the most suitable for each task. 
 Hiring someone is a click and drag process, with a twist for custom-made stars. If you have created 
 your own with the Star Maker tool, every time someone is at the casting office waiting for a job 
 you can drag them to the "Import Star" room and pick one of those you have created. No more Mr. 
 Ugly in a movie, you can make everyone as gorgeous as you want, with the advantage of giving them 
 acting experience in some categories and other useful. Make sure you explore all the options in 
 the Star Maker, it really is a powerful tool.
  
  Keeping your stars happy is as important as producing movies. As they become more popular, they 
 will want more commodities, such as their own trailer and assistants. To hire an assistant, drag 
 any of the job applicants (except stars) and place them near a star. Keep in mind though that hiring 
 someone to be an assistant will leave you less people to hire for other jobs. The good thing is, 
 when a star is about to retire, you can grab their assistants and promote them to stars or directors, 
 since they will already have experience in the business.
  
  Stars also want to keep up with the latest fashions and worry a lot about their image. The first 
 step after hiring someone is to give them a makeover. Pick something they're happy with and that's 
 fashionable, since only much later you will have access to plastic surgery. Yes, just like in real 
 life, movie stars can get a facelift, implants and liposuction. This will help keep their looks 
 and physique in shape, and sometimes checking one of your stars you will find little messages like 
 "Maria Stuart, age 70, looks 54."
  
  Since apparently movie-making is a stressful ordeal, your stars and directors will eventually get 
 stressed out from working. Some will turn to food as comfort, others will drink themselves stupid. 
 When someone becomes too much to bear, throwing tantrums (they actually do) and spending precious 
 time in the bar while the crew is waiting to shoot a scene, it's time to place them in rehab. Unfortunately, 
 you can only have one person per clinic at any given time, so it's a good idea to build a couple.
 
  
  Drunken celebrities are also good publicity stunts. If you find one of your stars is staggering 
 around your lot, place them at the studio gates and drag the photographers to them. Instant publicity! 
 Although it does annoy the actors a bit, it usually raises their star rating.
  
  Stars and extras that aren't busy can be placed in sets that aren't in use for practicing a certain 
 movie genre. You can also place stars next to each other so they get acquainted. Both of these 
 actions will improve their future performance on set.
  
  The Movies is not only perfect for the micromanagement fanatic like me, but also for all those 
 with a creative side. The custom script creator is just the right tool to spread your wings in 
 the movie business.
  
  You pick your actors and their costumes, choose the sets, customize the scenes including weather 
 and lighting effects, choose the backdrop and add some props to decorate the set. There is a small 
 issue with the props though: if the set has raised terrain, the objects will sink in instead of 
 staying visible on the surface.
  
  While a scene is still being shot you can doubleclick on the respective set to make a few more 
 changes: pick from a selection of camera angles and add more emotion to the scene. It's funny to 
 see how more or less romance in a scene goes from hand kissing to passionate smooching. 
  
  Later on you can customize your movie even more In the Post-Production Office, where you can even 
 add your own music, voice acting fade-ins or fade-outs and subtitles. 
  
  I was overwhelmed with this game right from the beginning and have now played through five decades 
 of "Didi Productions" movie-making. Makes me wonder how far the technology and advancements will 
 go... I'll let you know when I find out.

Review:  The Movies is well executed despite the fact that the tycoon takes away alot of the actual Movie-Making 
 proccess.
  Though some enjoy the Tycoon process others would like more time for their own movies.
  This 
 is a game that is great for anyone who wants a semi-real time expirience and make w/e type of movie 
 they want.
  Really I sugest renting it to check how YOU like i, because "The Movies" is a mixed bag of many 
 things. This may not have been a huge impact like "Final Fantasy 7" (the best game of all) or "Halo/Halo 
 2" but it is a great game, so have fun.
  I give it a 8.8.

Review:  After having tracked this game for quite a few months right here on GameSpot, I was still a bit 
 tentative when I eventually got to the shop and stood in front of the shelves eyeing the cover 
 of The Movies.
  
  Although I had a fairly good idea of what The Movies was all about, based on the tracking information 
 here on GameSpot, I still didn't really know what to expect.
  
  Well, the answer to that question was simple from the very first moment I installed this game - 
 I'm addicted.
  
  I guess nobody can say that Lionhead studios go for mundane re-makes of old stuff by simply adding 
 souped up graphics and new audio tracks to old ideas. Based on two of their latest releases namely 
 Black and White 2 and The Movies, I suspect it's safe to say that the guys over there at Lionhead 
 studios are very innovative and really put a lot of effort into the overall quality of their productions.
 
  
  The Movies is quite revolutionary in most respects and from my perspective it's hard to really 
 describe the perfect genre fit for this game.
  
  It's really a mix between a bit of The Sims 2 as far as characters, interactions, etc. is concerned 
 and a lot of the "Tycoon" style games. What really makes it stand out from an innovative perspective 
 though, is obviously the setting - which I don't think has really been dealt with before - and 
 the amazing way in which the guys at Lionhead approached the movie-making part of the game.
  
  As far as the original GameSpot review is concerned, I have to differ somewhat though, in the 
 sense that I do actually see the "integration" between the movie-making aspect and other aspects 
 of the gameplay. The ability to create custom movie scripts is actually quite well integrated into 
 the eventual outcome and "success" as far as the end product is concerned which in turn will have 
 significant impact on any "award quests", studio rating and star ratings as a result.
  
  In this sense, there is quite a bit of "integration" between the various facets of the game as 
 far as I am concerned. Then again, some guys may just want to make movies for the sheer fun of 
 it, in which case the Sandbox mode will actually do the job.
  
  Overall the graphics are really cool except for the fact that characters have this funny "floating" 
 walking and running style which is rather weird looking from a human kinetics perspective at times.
 
  
  The audio is also cool although the background "DJ chatter" can become a bit annoying when you 
 start a new game for the umteenth time.
  
  The user interface incorporates quite a few concepts that Lionhead seems to have "invented" for 
 Black and White 2. This includes the "information bubble" concept and the ability to pick up characters 
 as they are moving around the place - almost exactly like Black and White 2 in fact. In general 
 I find this approach quite cool and it seems to work for me as far as overall efficiency and just 
 pure "fun value" is concerned.
  
  To summarize:
  
  If you are a serious strategy gamer who enjoys games that take a while to get going and really 
 require some planning and thought to succeed, then you can't go wrong with this one. Making movies 
 in between all the empire building is also great and sometimes it just makes for a good change 
 after some fairly intricate "tycooning".
  
  If you are not a strategy type of gamer, it's probably best to stay away from this one.
  
  
 As far as my own preferences are concerned, I can safely say that this is my new favorite game.

Review:  The movies really create a whole new concept of gaming in nature, not only you can run your own 
 movie studio, but also direct your own movie. if these features are appealing to you, then you 
 have come to the right place.
  
  The game started off in the 1920s era where the motion picture started to take place. The game 
 has a build in tutorial, spoon-feeding players till they get the hang of it. which is good for 
 any new player to have a solid ground to start with. Then is all come to serious business, you 
 have to manage staff, build facilities, producing movies, and then enjoy your fruits of labour 
 in the awards show. Its sort of like playing in tycoon series, only in studio version and more 
 sophisticated.
  
  Making movies are the core aspect to earn money in the game. You can either start from scratch, 
 managing every detail of it, or just hire staff to wirte the scripts for you. Then is off to casting, 
 reharsing, shooting and finally realeasing for the public to see. The process can be really hard 
 to manage, especially you have to take care of your actors and directors' mood. if their mood turns 
 red, then you have a crappy movie for the critics. Really sounds like the job performance in the 
 Sims right? only the movies they show you the process of their work. moreover, there are many factors 
 that can make your movie into a box-office hit or a laughing stock for movie reviewers like actors 
 experience, genre fit, technology, relationships and so on.
  
  However there are some drawbacks in this game. The graphics in this game look a bit odd, especially 
 the people, the rest is still fine. Mircomanagement are bound to happen so keep your fingers busy 
 on your PC so expect no time to sit back and watch your old movies. well, except that you decided 
 to pause the game of course.
  
  Overall the Movies is a fun game to play and hopefully you can even learn a thing or two about 
 this long-running entertainment medium.

Review:  This game to me feels just like the designer has intended it too, Challenging and immersive. this 
 is a great game if you like the RTS style games because it gives the feeling of accomplishment 
 and acheivement . The main concept of the game is basic but suprisingly clever, Make movies, release 
 movies and most of all get damn rich. The gameplay it self is of a good standard and so is the 
 graphics. The main downfall of the game is the price, but it is common that games tend to fetch 
 a higher price upon release, but on a whole it is good value for money. 
  The sound and effects in the game were similar to the sims which i consider to be a downfall, as 
 i felt thatTHE MOVIESwould be the game which would overthrow the sims in the strategy selection 
 of games.
  I play this game for nearly 14 hours in total and felt that i was indeed worth the amount i payed 
 for it. Even though i may be a bit biased as i played this kind of game before and found it a joy, 
 "THE MOVIES" tops them all!!
  
  TO ME THIS GAME TOTALLY RULES!!!!

Review:  The Movies is a good game.
  It runs well even on my modest system.
  Graphically, the game isn't superb, but it's still quite pleasing to the eye.
  The tycoon aspect 
 gets dull and repetitive quite quick.
  Drag writer here, drag actors there - wait and drag film here - boom - thats it.
  The meat of 
 the game is in the Advanced Movie Maker.
  Where you can pick scenes, but them wherever and in any order with whomever you want performing 
 them - filming and then moving it over to post production, where you edit -add subtitles/voice 
 overs and background music.
  It's quite fun to make your own short-films and regardless of the predefined scenes, you can do 
 a hell of alot with whats available, if you're even the slightest bit creative.
  Those looking to recreate Starwars, Lord of The Rings or The Matrix or (Insert favorite/popular 
 film name here) will be disapointed, but those with an ounce of originality in them and the willingess 
 to work with whats provided will have loads of fun making movies and uploading them to Lionheads 
 database whre they'll be reviewed and hit the charts, earning you money to buy new props, sets 
 and.. Stuff!

Review:  I think that Pete M. (not going to try and spell his last name) is a very creative man, but just 
 can't seem to make a good game. I have played Black and White, kept me for a week at best. Fable 
 was fun while I played it at a friend's house and when Lionhead was Bullfrog... god... those were 
 the worst. I hope that he is getting his act together becuase if his games start to improve at 
 the rate they are, Thing might just get better.
  
  Now, to get the good stuff out of the way. You can pick up and play this game sort of quick. The 
 studio building and running is good and all, but the awards ceremonies suck at the beginning when 
 somehow only the computer studios get good actors and scriptwriters, but soon enough you'll win 
 one. Then the sound, it is very good. The music is authentic, and voices are good, and things like 
 the Burger Joint sound like they should. The graphics are great, until the actors have turned black 
 head to toe and you have to crank the graphics down a noch.
  
  Now, the bad stuff. I. E. bubbles and movie making. Movies. Thats what the game is about. What they 
 should have done is put in a better movie maker. They also should have incorperated a good post 
 production screen. They need to make more animations or have and "animation maker" thing. The Bubbles. 
 TOO MANY FREAKING BUBBLES!!!! WHY??!!! I CAN'T SEE!!!! AM I BLIND??!! No, I just have 500 bubbles 
 on the screen. Get a menu! Lionhead doesn't like menus! Not in Black and White, not in the Movies. 
 If you want employees you need a good rating. To get a good rating you need people to do the work. 
 Well, there is one bad thing about The Movies that they probably couldn't help. The Case. Just 
 like Battlefield 2's. Not storage friendly, go back to small cases in big boxes. To fix this game, 
 you just need to kill the bubbles, and give the player better movie making tools.

Review:  If you have ever played Fable or Black&White you will know one thing that Lionhead Studios is one 
 of the most creative developers out there and they prove it yet again by combining tycoon game 
 features with real time movie making in such a way that it remains accessible to any type of gamer 
 and provides a lot of fun.
  This game plays like other tycoon games but is much more simple and easier to play. Anyone can 
 get into the game easily and enjoy it for a long time period. The game has amazing graphics and 
 doesn't need a super PC to get the full out of the game. The game also has a movie maker tool which 
 allows you to create custom movies, the tool is pretty powerful and many movies have already caught 
 media attention.
  This game is a must buy for any type of gamer.

Review:  To make a film is an old dream from my child-hood. And I always wonder why there is no such game 
 about making movies. Until now, thank to the LionHead Studio, I can be a film maker myself.
  First of all, It`s like a mixture of Sim-city with Sims. Constructing the film studio is fun from 
 the beginning. But by the growth of studio. It`s going boring and tiresome a bit. Since the construction 
 doesn`t evolute itself. (It just gets old and needs repair.) And your stars and staff. Trust me, 
 when you busy making film to pay their salaries. You won`t have time to train them or to make-up 
 some scandal. So this is the flow path of the game: Writing a script. Making the movie. Meanwhile, 
 prepare for the next movie or get started to another movie. After the movie complete. Just sit 
 there and watch the box-office.... Then make another movie..... (repeat)
  After I start the game for 40 years. I got bored and expected a ending, When the game suddenly 
 ended itself in 2005. What a relief it was! 
  That means I could look for another game now. And this game, Maybe I will play it again some other 
 time.

Review:  Pre-release, I was little confused and intrigued as to how you would be able to create such different 
 and personal scenes and movies. Essentially, most of the work is done in the "script" phase, where 
 you basically decide where, who, and how things happen - There are preset animations for every 
 scene - e. g. "Two people enter the room, shivering", or "Three people are having an argument" etc. 
 The possible roles are represented by wooden mannequins - to assign an actor to that role, you 
 simply drag them onto the relevant mannequin, and then they will act it out when it comes to shooting.
 
  
  If this sounds restrictive, be assured that there are dozens and dozens of these preset animations 
 - enough to create a truly unique and atmosheric film every time.
  The best way to think of it is not "I must make a film around these animations" but rather "I'll 
 think of a film how I want it, and see how I can use these tools to make it look good".
  
  You really get the chance to be infinitely creative with this game, and soon you will be spending 
 all day at work considering your next big blockbuster!

Review:  I remember waaaayyyy back, a couple years ago when I first heard that Lionhead studios was coming 
 out with a movie making sim game. I was extremely excited and awaited the game with much anticipation. 
 The year is now 2005 and my excitement was renewed when I heard the game was finally out. So after 
 a short trip to EB's I booted the game up and played.
  
  Graphics: 
  
  Not too bad. Nothing special here though. System requirements seem a bit high for the amount of 
 detail, but generally an average looking game.
  
  Sound:
  
  Pretty much the same as the graphics, would have scored higher here if the sounds in the movies 
 were louder and there was actual language spoken.
  
  Gameplay:
  
  Certainly very creative and addicting for a shortwhile. Both as a tycoon game and a Movie Maker. 
 Really it's only downfall is the boundaries the game presents in the latter mode.
  
  Value: 
  
  I found myself getting bored of the game after a while, in the tycoon mode, you 
 will see the same script repeatedly written by the computer script writers and it gets old. It 
 also feels like you have too much to do all at once.
  For example you have to shoot the new movie, give your star a makeover, get your writers working 
 on a new script, beautify your place, build stages. It gets pretty crazy.
  
  All in all the movies is a fun experience for a shortwhile. The movie maker is fun, but it has 
 it's limits.

Review:  The movies is a GREAT game, the saviour of PC games to be precise. It is fun, funny and you can 
 play it for hours on end without feeling that you're doing the same thing over and over again.
 
  
  The movies starts off in the 1920's, when you make black - and - white films with no sound, and 
 moves all the way up to modern day and beyond, with advanced cameras, sets, stars and costumes. 
 Movie making is the backbone of the movies (hence the title) . Without this, the movies would just 
 be "another" strategy game, a little like the Sims, but making you own masterpiece is the hardest 
 part of the game, as there are so many ways to do it. You can build a script office, hire script 
 writers, and leave them to do the work or you can make your own film from scratch, choosing sets, 
 props, backgrounds and costumes down to the smallest details. It is the movie-making system that 
 will really keep you exited about the next stage of the game.
  
  All in all, the Movies definately deserves it's 9.8/10, and I wish it all the success it deserves. 
 MERRY MOVIE-MAKING!

Review:  I have made a bunch of movies with the game. I have made really long movies. I think this game 
 was well worth the $50. Sometimes you are so caught up in making a movie or doing the tycoon portion 
 of the game that it'll be 3 o clock and you won't even know. This game is a lot of fun, and I would 
 recommend it to any one. It is SO addictive that your actors won't be the only one in rehab. It 
 is so much micromanagement, you gotta keep your script writers writing, keep your actors from to 
 the bar (practically after every scene) , make sure all your sets are in good shape, keep your press 
 rating high, send your actors to get cosmetic surgery, keep your actors happy, make your actors 
 talk to your other actors, change your actors clothes. It is simply mind boggling. So if you like 
 micromanagement then this game is for you. I also like the movie making portion. You can make practically 
 any kind of movie you want. A comedy, a corny alien movie, an action movie with a lot of cool explosions 
 and stuff, a WWII movie, or a zombie horror movie. It is a lot of fun.
  
  I think we need more video games like this.

Review:  If you are a tycoon or a sim fanatic or maybe just wanting to try a tycoon like game... well the 
 movies is the right game for you. The movies is everything you expect it to be. Making a beautiful 
 studio, making your own movies, and making stars get drunk. The thing about the movies is that 
 it is extremely addicting and I mean addicting. The really cool thing in the game is the sandbox 
 mode. Putting $99 000 000 (believe me this money will last you forever) , and building and making 
 movies all you like. But the problem with sandbox mode is that some of the sets, buildings aren't 
 in sandbox mode. Some sets and buildings have to be earned when you play the campaign mode and 
 thats where it gets addicting. Also if you have an account (its free) on the movies game you get 
 to show off your movies on the Internet and seeing what the other people say about your great ideas. 
 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME to anyone. You dont really have to be a tycoon fan or sim fan to love 
 this game. I dont like tycoon games or sim games and I just love the movies game:)

Review:  The idea has been in many gamers minds for years past, but no developer has ever tried to pull 
 this idea off, until now.
  
  Lionheads latest game, The Movies has fulfilled its expectation in every way for me. It has 
 a bit of everything mixed into it.
  
  The Story mode of the game begins in 1920, you create your custom studio name and choose from a 
 wide variety of logos or you can be ambitious and create your own logo and save it to the correct 
 directory for use in the game. As the game begins you are guided through the menus and you soon 
 learn the basics of game play.
  
  As the game progresses new sets, props, costumes and studio facilities become available. You can 
 build; make over buildings, script writing facilities and much more.
  
  The 1 thing the game offered that appealed to me was the ability to write your own scripts from 
 scratch, it takes some time but the results can be amazing.
  
  Not forgetting that when your done with your movie and your ready to release it, the movie is reviewed 
 by the in game newspapers and magazines. If you want to go a step further, Lionhead has incorporated 
 an online section to the game. You get 25mb of space to upload your movies to be reviewed by people 
 all over the world from The Movies main website. After uploading and receiving a rating, you 
 get online cash which will be used in the up and coming Prop-Shop which will allow you to buy new 
 things to use in the game with your online cash.
  
  Apart from the story mode you can jump strait into the action by starting a sandbox game. This 
 allows you to start with a pre-made studio and you can start at a different date than 1920. You 
 can still upload movies you make in this mode, and the game goes on forever from what I can see, 
 Im currently in 2060.
  
  After playing the movies I have to say its one of my favourite games of all time, id recommend 
 it to anyone who enjoyed The Sims series as you get the same sort of control plus a whole lot 
 more.
  
  Remember to keep your eye on The Movies main website, for the up and coming Prop-Shop.

Review:  Addicting, yes. Yet also lackluster. The game gets boring fast. The Make-Your-Own Movie concept 
 is appealing until done.
  
  The main reason I bought this game was not for the tycooning, all that much, but for the movie-making. 
 I played it through and finally got my production building and saw a colorful version of Movie 
 Maker before me. If you think you can make the character do whatever it is you want him to do, 
 say, set a path for him to pace back and forth, stumble and fall on a certain prop while someone 
 misses his shot with a rifle, your mistaken.

Review:  Ever watched a movie and thought to yourself "Hey, I can do a better job at writing/directing/acting 
 for this movie!"? Well now you have a chance to prove it with Lionhead's incredible sim game The 
 Movies.
  
  In The Movies, you take control of a studio in the early 1920's and get to run every aspect of 
 it, from the movie stars and directors to the janitors and repairmen. The glorious aspect of The 
 Movies is that you get to control everything in the movies that you do, and when I say everything 
 I mean everything, from camera angles to score to actors. The gameplay is sublime and is easy to 
 understand (the tutorial is very helpful) . The micro-management of your stars can get a bit hectic 
 at times, because you also need to control all the facets of your studio, from the aesthetics to 
 the salaries to the movie making. But everything is done so well that you won't ever complain.
 
  
  The graphics in the game seemed a bit choppy to me and are not the best out there, but let's face 
 it, you won't buy this game for it's graphics. The sounds are pretty good, except for the language 
 spoken in the movies, which seems like a really bad imitation of Simlish.
  
  It is really easy to pick up and play this game, with all the help bubbles that pop up throughout 
 the game, but the tutorial is there to help you and blends into the actual game very well. I haven't 
 played the sandbox mode in The Movies, so I will not comment on it.
  
  All in all, The Movies is a great game for flick fanatics out there and can be enjoyed over and 
 over again. I recommend it strongly.

Review:  After playing my friend's copy for the better of last night (depending on the date of this posted 
 article) this game has become an INCREDIBLE addiction.
  
  I was up till 6am in the morning playing the game and I haven't even scratched the surface of what 
 this game can provide. This game however has it's flaws and bugs in it's original release and the 
 interface isn't all that pleasing to learn.
  
  Other than that this game is just great It's cool to see all the parts of this game work together, 
 unlike most 'Tycoons' where you only work on one aspect. This game you actually have to plan ahead 
 to stay ahead of the curve to be at your rival studios. A+ for this concept.
  
  An outstanding game, and hopefully by this holiday season end, I will own this game my self. Well 
 desered for a 9.4... superb.

Review:  I'll be honest from the word go here - i'm biased. I love the game, and i blame that on having 
 much too much free time as a child. 
  Does anyone remember the old 'Movie maker' with McZee? I do! I spent too long playing that as a 
 child, and loved every minute of it. At the time it was high tech, cool, funny and generally great, 
 but since then nothing like it has been released to satisfy my creative urges. Yes, i said creative. 
 . .
  That is, until now. I followed this game for months before it was released, and snapped it up as 
 it hit the shelves. In days it was complete but still had so much potential. I love it, and it 
 hasn't gotten old quite yet, though i can see it joining McZee in the drawer of orphaned games 
 eventually, but hopefully not too soon.
  
  So lets hear about it you say? You wan't more? I certainly do. The Movies is a game which allows 
 you to build your own studio lot - piece by piece, set by set, even scene by scene as you will, 
 and to produce your very own blockbusters.
  You start the game in the early 1900's, at the birth of the movie industry, and progress through 
 the years to the present day - with new technology, sets, actors and costumes coming with each 
 new year. 
  This way, the game grows around you, much as your studio lot grows from a portacabin or two, to 
 a cinematic empire.
  Now imagine making movies, but then cross breed it with the sims. Wierd eh? Nope, just plain fun. 
 Your actors and staff (to a lesser extent) are their own annoying, pestering, selfish, spoilt, 
 rich ,self obsessed, drunken people. You have to manage their career - every aspect of it, from 
 relationships to salary, and film roles to trailer prestige. You hire staff in the same way, but 
 they don't require any micro management. Leave them to it, they don't need to be pampered like 
 the stars.
  
  My only complaints are that even though the game i the best of its kind on the market, you're still 
 restricted to pre-scripted interactions, and sometimes this prevents you from getting the scene, 
 or even film you want.
  The finance of the game needs tweaking. I mean i can make a few terrible movies and be better off 
 than if i made a blockbuster and a half. Film quality seems to be judged a bit oddly, and time 
 just flies by. I could blink and i'd miss 20 years of my actors lives. . .
  
  I won't go into much more detail, but let me say this - If you like movies, the sims and have a 
 creative side (or two) then this game is for you. It gets my two thumbs up.

Review:  Lionhead Studios Created a game that keeps your mouse moving every second. Starting from 1920s, 
 till 2000, game shows us the improvement in movie technology and how new generation stars can be 
 little spoiled kids !
  
  You only start with a few actors and actress, a director, a plenty number of janitors and builders, 
 crew and only one set to shoot your movies of 10-15 second. There is a non stop action in the company, 
 choosing the director for a new movie, writing another script, shooting one at the sci-fi sets, 
 archiving old movies and trying to keep your staff's morale and boredom up, plan your company's 
 next year profit and know about the latest releases and inventions at movie industry. (Now I understand 
 why most of Movie Company Owners are Alcoholic or Nicotine Addict, so whos gonna keep their boredom 
 and morale up for God's Sake??) . If You want to keep your stars up in mood, increase their wages 
 $2.000 after every movie, not only to those who acted in last movie, increase everyone's wage so 
 they wont get jelaous of eachother.
  
  You Have To Buy trailer for each of your stars and directors or they will get jelaous of eachother. 
 If you want to keep your economy stable, try to buy little trailers for each or you will bankrupt 
 like i did. I will not buy a $75.000 trailer for each of my start next time...
  
  One of the greatest thing about this game is Makeover department where you can dress up your stars 
 in anyway you want.
  Your star is bored or stressed? send them to Bar or Restaurant or make them chat eachother to increase 
 the relationship between them *wink*. Its good that your employees are getting retired when they 
 are 70, my first actor could play as Master Yoda without having any make up on his face, if he 
 had stayed a bit longer in my studio.
  
  Want your actress to look sexier then any other? Send her to Liposuction or to have Implants. Or 
 want your star to look more charming then other guys around him? Prevent Him From Overeating and 
 dress him with latest cloth releases. 
  
  Theres a custom scriptwriting and post production offices where you can add - take out scenes from 
 movies that your directors made, or you can create your own movies in the genres you want, with 
 the actors you want, in the way you want.
  
  Do Your Best and Collect All The Awards In Ceremony...
  
  Camera, Lights and Action !!!

Review:  The Movies is really two things: a Tycoon-style game about running a movie studio, and a movie 
 maker. You can play the game entirely without ever scripting, editing, or looking at the movies 
 your studio makes. And that's actually pretty fun. Stars and directors get bored or stressed and 
 turn to drink or food or throw temper tantrums that put your shooting schedule on hold. You have 
 limited resources to work with (stars, directors, film crew, extras, sets, and various production 
 buildings) , so much of the game is juggling these resources. You can watch your film actually being 
 shot, which in itself is cool to watch. Your ultimate goal is to the most highly rated movie studio. 
 Unless you're playing in Sandbox mode, the game takes place over a timeline, where new technology 
 and sets and costumes become available. So in the beginning you're making simple, black and white 
 short films from the 1920s, and gradually they turn into "long" digital color movies with modern 
 costumes and sets. I personally find this very enjoyable.
  
  The movier maker part of The Movies gets an unfair rap. It seems a lot of people expect a movie 
 maker that's part of a game to have the same set of features as you might find in a professional 
 video editing program. Which is of course nuts. In the game, when you build a custom scriptwriting 
 office, you can write your own scripts from scratch. Each set has a number of scenes you can use, 
 and each scene may have some customizable options, such as how the actors react in the scene, the 
 angle used, the length of the scene, which roles to use, and what costumes to wear. It can take 
 a lot of work to get something resembling what you envisioned to appear in the script. Instead 
 of writing the script yourself, you can open a scriptwriting office and hire some scriptwriters 
 to churn out a script in a particular genre. Once done writing, you send the script to the casting 
 office, where you assign film crew, extras, a director, and actors to the primary roles. After 
 a short rehearsal, you can put the film into production and everyone begins shooting. After all 
 scenes are filmed (this happens more or less automatically, although you may need to deal with 
 an ill-behaved cast or crew) , you can either release the film immediately, or send it to the post-production 
 office you've built. Inside here, is a video editing and audio engineering application. It's not 
 that hard to use, but not incredibly feature-packed either. You can snip parts of scenes, reorder 
 scenes or snippets, add dialog or subtitles, add music and sound effects. When you're done, you 
 can export the movie to a WMV file and give to your friends or upload to The Movies website. And 
 finally you release the film. Tabloids and industry journals critique the film, and it starts generating 
 money (and hopefully a profit, sometimes not) .
  
  This whole process is time consuming, but entertaining. I play a non-sandbox game and release several 
 films on auto-pilot before getting the itch to write and post-edit my own film, which I do, and 
 then go back to churning out auto films just to fill the studio coffers. Gameplay is very good, 
 but my opinion here is probably skewed by the fact that I've never seen a movie-making game before, 
 so it gets a lot of a points for novelty. Graphics are very good, you can zoom and rotate on the 
 3D landscape and follow your actors around in the sets and around your lot. The sound is ok, but 
 the "mumbly talk" used by the actors is nauseatingly repetitive. It's a unique experience, and 
 if you like tycoon games, there's no reason not to try this one.

Review:  I bought this game since I had to spend 18 hours on a plane, so i wanted to get a game that would 
 suck that time. And it sure did deliver! Now, i cant stop thinking about this game, and here is 
 why:
  
  1) It gives you the ability to play a Sim-city type game with your movie studio.
  2) It gives you the ability to play the Sim's 3) You create some really awsome movies if you put 
 the time in.
  4) The game gently guides you through the basic learning of the game. Which is very helpful because 
 this game is huge.
  5) Technology and sound chages with the times (a nice touch)
  
  most the gripes I had were quite minimum, I would like to be able to import my own logo for my 
 company, and the game tends to bog down when your lot is full and you try to look around.... But 
 nothing major to speak of.
  
  Good Job LionHead, I'm a fan now :-)

Review:  The Movies are a tycoon style came from Lionhead studios. The vast majority of the game takes place 
 in the tycoon portion of the movie studio. You will be the big cheese of your own movie studio 
 and you can shape it and transform it as you wish. As with all movie studios, the goal is to make 
 your studio number 1 in all of the land. Yet, that feat is easier said than done. You will have 
 to carefully manipulate your stars and your studio into what will be the biggest, brightest, and 
 best studio in Hollywood.
  
  You will start off your studio with a blank lot and a lot of cash to start making your empire. 
 The year is 1920 and you will start off with only the most modern film techniques, costume, and 
 sets possible. You must shape your empire by carefully building the proper buildings, hiring good 
 people to help you get to the top, and start managing the careers of some of your brightest actors 
 and directors. The game will start off very slowly, giving you a step by step guide of what you 
 must have in your studio and how each of the different buildings performs a vital function to the 
 success of your studio. After you get through the studio tutorial, you will be off by yourself 
 in a world where you are the master of your own destiny. Although the game can be addictive for 
 some people for others it can get quite repetitive an hour or so after the tutorial is over.
  
  The other majority of the game is taken up by the movie making experience. In the beginning 
 you will be handed several scripts that you can use to make a movie with. After a few movies have 
 been released you will then be instructed to write your own scripts, and this is where the movie 
 making gets very heavily split up. You can either hire a bunch of script writers to punch out scripts 
 like monkeys at a bunch typewriters. Or, you can select to write your own scripts, where you can 
 plan out your movies exactly as you see fit. Although the personal script writing is not available 
 from the beginning it should be mentioned that these are the two main ways that scripts get done, 
 and they are very important because they are the back bone for why your studio is staying a float 
 and not burning in the rubble.
  
  Each of the actors and the directors has a lot of different qualities that make each of them up. 
 Each of the stars will have certain genres that they are already more proficient in than others. 
 The idea is to have each of the stars concentrate in the area in which they are most proficient. 
 Along with genres, each of the stars will have to deal with stress, addictions, and anything that 
 you see current stars complaining about. This can get really annoying and if you dont like hearing 
 about current stars and theyre entourage or their salary, you are really not going to enjoy this 
 game.
  
  The gameplay of the game is something that is an acquired taste. The main part of the game, being 
 a tycoon is something that you either like or you dont, there are no ifs, ands, or buts about 
 it. Tycoon style games require a lot of time and effort put in to them in order to get a lot out 
 of them. In this particular tycoon style games you need to be able to, and like to, micro-manage 
 like no other. In this aspect you have to be able to pretend that each of the directors and actors 
 are like one of the Sims. If you are not a fan of the Sims, or you just like to see how fast you 
 can ruin their life this game is definitely going to get old and frustrate you very quickly. In 
 order to be successful enough to be the top studio in the land you are going to have to be able 
 to micro-manage and multi-task all at the same time. Bottom line is that you if you are Tycoon 
 or Sims person, this game will certainly fit your bill, but if you are not this game will get very 
 old, very very fast.
  
  The graphics in the game are nothing to be laughed at but they are certainly nothing that you would 
 put up for the Graphics of the Year award. You would not expect to see anything spectacular in 
 a game like this. They do adequately enough in this game and are certainly nothing to write home 
 about. If you get up pretty close to the stars in the game you will be able to make out some of 
 the more distinguishable qualities of each of the stars. The only real nice part about the graphics 
 is that you can see the whole studio and change the angle from which you see it without having 
 your computer slowing down to a crawl.
  
  The sound of the game is well unique. The ballad that plays in the background while you are playing 
 for the most part is the unique and goes along well with the type of game that you are playing 
 at the time. The only fun part of the sound is the radio host that makes commentary at certain 
 times in the games. The radio host sometimes has nice quippy remarks that make you laugh.
  
  The value of the game is ok for the 50 dollars that it is at. If you are person who likes Tycoon 
 games and has a lot of patience, then it will be 50 dollars well spent. If you are a person who 
 does not like Tycoon games, this game will only provide 5 hours of game play for the 50 dollars 
 that you will shell out for this game. Bottom line is that this game is very dependant on the type 
 of gaming person that you are.

Review:  Peter Molyneux's brain fluxuates with crazy-insane ideas all the time. He is like the Albert Einstein 
 of gaming and has definately made a huge, HUGE name for himself in the gaming world, known as the 
 Godfather of gaming.
  
  So, Peter woke up one morning and WHAM! It came to him. A videogame focused on Hollywood, and Movie 
 Making. "Why the hell has'nt someone made a game about this before?" he asked himself. Excited, 
 he told his wife about his new great idea, she gave a grunt, but from there, magic happened - where 
 that one story would soon be history being stamped in the growing industry of videogames.
  
  The Movies is pretty much what you would expect from the title. Movies. YOU are the studio 
 manager, YOU must create the stars, YOU must make the best movies, YOU must create and manage the 
 movie studio. And this is one thing Lionhead has been known for, making games all about YOU.
  
  The Movies is pretty darn fun. Let's say you boot up the game, and you would like to do the 
 Campaign-ish game. You start in the 1920's, and work your way up the years doing nothing but stuff 
 movies are all about. It's like a Movies Fanatic dream come true. I won't go in depth, you can 
 check out GameSpot's review for all that - but I can say that the game will keep you busy for hours. 
 The GameSpot reviewer could not have said it better, it's so easy to lose track of time and find 
 yourself sitting at the computer at 5 in the morning while the sun begins to rise - pretty much 
 like what The Sims was like for some.
  
  Now, the sandbox mode is great... but the advanced movie maker leaves you somewhat limited and 
 wishing you could have more flexibility. Lionhead wanted to focus on creating the game for the 
 audience that was largest, and making this tool easy and limited was the only way to achieve that. 
 However, one thing I believe Lionhead overlooked was that most people buying this game- are the 
 talented ones. They want to make movies, they want to have flexibility, no matter how complex something 
 looks, they are willing to figure everything out to create what they truly want.
  
  Despite the very few shortcomings, the most important thing about this game is the future. There 
 is definately room for improvement, and Lionhead is dedicated in doing so, Which seems to be very 
 promising with expansions and extra content... Also, never forget the mod makers out there who 
 will keep this game alive. This game will be around for years and years. Do not give up the chance 
 to be part of something special. If you love Tycoon games, love Movies, or hell, just love videogames 
 in general. When you seethe pretty blue box sitting on the shelves, buy it.

Review:  very good game, fun to keep track of salary caps, rehearsing, etc. One very cool addition to the 
 game is at the top of your screen, you can see main events coming up such as The Depression and 
 The Selling Of The First Television sets, and what kind of movies they promote people to see. Overall, 
 I was very satisfied and deifnatly lived up to what i wanted to.
  I wish you could actually be a person and see yourself accepting awards at the award ceremonies. 
 I played at least 9 hours straight the night i got it, and i odnt usually do that with the games 
 I get.

Review:  The Movies is an awesome game where you can make any type of movie you want. Ranging from western 
 classics to sci-fi newcomers, this game has quite a variety of props, actors, sets, and a whole 
 bunch more to choose from. 
  
  Even if you think this game would be boring because of its lack of the player going into action, 
 you're really just missing a great oppurtunity because all you really need to have to enjoy this 
 game is a love of watching movies. Because after you finish each movie, you'll get to watch them 
 over and over again as well as share them with your friends or posting them on the Internet for 
 everyone to enjoy.
  
  Plus, half the fun of The Movies is hiring and firing actors and workers and, also, partaking in 
 many quests along the way.
  
  The Movies has its ups and downs, but mostly all it has is ups. Anyone who enjoys creating and 
 then watching your own unique stories and films should get this game and if anyone disagrees, all 
 they're doing is wasting their time. This game is awesome.

Review:  This is one of the best games i had played in so long . The games idea is very interesting . It 
 looks a little like sims with te needs of the stars but you don't have to fulfill all of there 
 desires afther all you are there boss , at first the movies that you make look dull but when you 
 have enough stars and extra you will like the movies that you make (if you have a custom script 
 building and after you have the public relations office the game starts to look like the real thing 
 ) . Good luck playing the game , hope you will like it as much as me :) .

Review:  I bought The Movies when it first came out expecting a brilliant masterpiece that would keep me 
 hooked for weeks, however when i brought my copy for 34.99 i discovered that it was nothing more 
 than a Sims game but with more involved. It was also very difficult to set a film out the way you 
 wanted, from the scenes you had avaliable only a small number of films were possible to make for 
 it to make any sense. Despite this it is a very original game and im sure it has many fans. It 
 just wasnt the game for me.

Review:  This is another great tycoon game. The goal is to create the best movies, movie stars, directors 
 and studio. You do this by improving your studio with plants, statues, fountains, bars and restaurants 
 to keep your people happy. A happy actor/director will make a mutch better movie. Once they reach 
 a certain level they want to have more things like a trailer or a personal assistant. It's important 
 to let your actors/directors with the same movie specialty (Sci-fi / Romance) talk to eachother 
 and let them become friends. The better they know eachother, again, the better the movie will be.
 
  
  You can make your own scripts or let your scriptwriters on the lose. I didn't do mutch with the 
 movie maker as it has a pretty steep learning curve. But then again i am a real tycoon player and 
 this one goes together with other great tycoon titles.

Review:  If anything, "The Movies" certainly gets the job done. I have never played a more polished game 
 in my entire life. It's a game with endless lasting appeal, featuring gorgeous visuals, superb detail, 
 and most importantly, sharing the virtual motion picture with anyone around the entire world. I 
 was surprised, and very pleased how this game came out, and you will be too!
  You start out as an indy-film maker. Little money, low quality images, and cheesy sets. But as 
 you advance throughout your career, you will eventually find yourself surrounded by a whole lot 
 of goodness. and I mean A LOT. High paid actors will want to be in your films, your studio will 
 become gigantic with employees and acting agents, but you will also become extremely rich, and 
 the game will takes a good note of spending your money wisely. This is definitely one of the games 
 shining point. 
  You really feel like you are controlling your job as the director with all of these features in 
 the palm of your hands. 
  And Did I mention the graphics and audio? Absolutely amazing. Each
  part of your studio looks 
 well designed and life like. Yet, the true key is the dialogue and voice actors in the game. The 
 creators nail it. You can have actors say things completely serious, but you can also let them 
 be comedic and goofy. In fact, you can do anything you imagine! This game is THAT good.
  It's not easy making a good film either. It takes long periods of time, and the audio recording 
 with your mic/headset can be very tricky and frustrating. But once you get the hang of it, I guarantee 
 you will have a blast. But the best thing about "The Movies" is when you share the movie you've 
 created to your friends. The hard work and determination finally pays off, and it's priceless seeing 
 their reaction. 
  So, what can I say about this video game? Well, it's one of the best games of the year, and you 
 best not miss it. The "Movies" has an infinite value, and you will be playing this for a long time 
 ahead of you. With it's ingenious interface, beautiful production, and fun gameplay, "The Movies"
 
  is simply worth every penny. Two Thumbs up!

Review:  I've been pretty excited about this game. Since I've heard of its conception I've been waiting 
 like many people have about this game that lets you make the movies instead of just being on the 
 viewing end.
  
  All in all, I'd say it lives up to the wait, but it does have its problems that, from my perspective, 
 hold the game back. The graphics and sound all work to the games advantages using good character 
 models and good sound effects that really adjust with the time period you are playing in. The control 
 panels are all pretty simple and easy to use. But, the simplicity also holds it back from a micro-managing 
 aspect of any kind. I wish there was an option or mode where you could really control every aspect 
 of every movie. While, I know that would mean a lot of work and time on my/the players part, I 
 think it would result in a more rewarding experience in the end. I was a little disappointed in 
 the copy and paste style of 'movie making'. I felt that even after several hours of 'writing' that 
 the scenes didn't fit well together and seemed lethargic. And it seems like after hours and hours, 
 it still wasn't the film that I had hoped for, just barebone drawing boards.
  
  On the good side of the game, it does let my creative side out a little instead of linear gaming 
 or dare I say 'open-ended stories that are far from being in my control'. The only thing everyone 
 can agree apone about this game is there is no other game like it. Perhaps I was hoping for a 'sim' 
 quality game, and in many aspects it really is, but in some spots, its just not. 
  
  if you liked the sims and enjoy letting yourself go into the creative world, I would give this 
 game a big reccomendation, but if you're like me and like managing every detail of a game, this 
 is not for you.

Review:  ... The Movies to me was a good game. Was it worth it though? I would have to say no. Although there 
 are many cool features such as casting your stars, making your movies, building your empire and 
 such, I would have to say that after playing through it once there is no point for doing it again. 
 There are no unlockable items, no different gamemodes. It is just one game mode and one time to 
 play. It is deffinitely not worth 50$.
  
  Graphics: The graphics are decent, but deffinitely not as good as what is capable. There are blocky 
 buildings and extremely odd character movements. Some things are good such as the lighting and 
 shadowing, but other than that it doesnt look pretty.
  
  There was good sound, but I think that the "unheard language" like they made in the Sims was a 
 let down. I listened, and after 10 seconds, the voice clip repeated over and over again. This game 
 was just a big hype and I deffinitely don't recommend spending 50 on this.

Review:  The movies has anything and everything you want and need to make your own easy at home movies. 
 It can be long or short. It's how you want to make it. The good things are the divestiry and time 
 periods in which you can make your silent films to star-breaking future films. If you have the 
 opertunity to, get a microphone so you and /or your family, friends, neighbors etc. can have there 
 own stars and voices to put into the movies you make. It's sort of like rollercoaster tycoon, just 
 with movies.
  
  The only bad things about it is how long it takes to make a movie of your own creation, the rating 
 system, which tally's up how long it is, not the content or extra crap you add. In any case, it's 
 a really good game, with swapping of movie online and rating others. A good holiday gift.

Review:  When i first had a look at this game, i thought wow, a movie maker with 3d animated characters, 
 AMAZING! But now that the final product is in my hands, and it took me about one day to beet this 
 game is was not what i expected.
  First of all, i know that its mostly not even about the single player game, its about the online 
 community, and ill get to that later, but the single player portion is fairly fun. You get to create 
 your own studio, actors and buld sets. You start off in the early days of film and work your way 
 up to preasent day, its was fun as it lasted although there were some problems. When i made a movie, 
 a greate movie, the computors review system will sometimes give it a horrible review. Why you ask, 
 because its a computor, and it dosnt know any better, it will rate on actors moods and film quality 
 and set up of the films plot, so if you freeform for most of the game you will most likely not 
 enjoy it.
  The online community is a very nice touch to this game. Its why most people bought the game. But 
 so far its starting to become a newgrounds of the movies. For example, i submit a movie, i get 
 two great reviews, my movies doing preaty well in the standings at 52nd, then someone comes and 
 gives me a one, because there personal opinion was, oh another silent one again, and they gave 
 me a one. Thanks budy, im sure you watched the hole thing, and im guessing he never made a film 
 too, thus being like newgrounds.
  The editor is also something i didint expect, i thopught i could make my pown camera angles, zoom 
 focus in and out, place charc=acters where ever i wanted. The answer is no my friends, none of 
 that s in the game. But there are multiple scenes and actions you can use you to create your movie, 
 in any set. For example there is critical talk, or two enter, or banana humor, thats just to show 
 some scope of whjat they have. I could ask for more but each one holds its own with good cutting 
 and good edting.
  Now when you have made a movie, you can keep editing it by yourself. Mind you thsi is nothing like 
 final cut pro you adobe premiere ok, this tool has nothing on them, but what is does have is the 
 basics, and for this, it seems like this is all you need. Although i wish there were some video 
 filters i could play with or BEING ABLE TO CUT AUDIO!! witch you cant do. But it has your cut tools, 
 your drag tool, fade in and out, subtitles and a very likable voice opver system where the actors 
 will ip sinc what you say.
  In the end the movies does not offer what was expected but what it does offer is a new way to make 
 movies with 3d characters.
  
  Ps: for anyone seriously into film, this is also a good product to create story boards in, its 
 simple and fast.

Review:  The game reminded me of the sims. Same feel of being in controle but not being in controle. The 
 sets and actions were good but once you begam creating more that one or two movies they became 
 very repedative. The audio was good. The best feature of the game is the online screening room 
 where you can wach diffrent peoples movies. well i need s hundred words so a a a a a a a a a a a

Review:  incredibly fluent and addictive... i have been watching the game ever since i first saw its previews 
 in gamespot and was counting the days and ta-da! it was well worth to wait luckily!...
  tutorial detailed yet not boring, gets you directly into the game... using spaces in your studio 
 is a little challenging at first so i opened a second game, now that i am a more experienced entrepeneur... 
 difficult at first, i only played it for about 5-6 hours i guess, the first "learning course" was 
 the longer one so i never saw beyond 1940s... right now i am at work, i should be working on cleaning 
 validation as a validation engineer but inside i am planning what to do as soon as i load the game 
 back up when i get home... 
  my plans is first not getting deep into movies and see where the game goes by itself.. then i will 
 start once again, but not last, and go deep into movies...

Review:  I have to admit that I didn't quite know what to make of The Movies for the first few hours I played 
 it. It's not quite like most other tycoon games where the buildings themselves drive the game. 
 Instead, you're given stars to deal with.
  
  In an odd sort of way, this game seems to be a combination of tycoon game, where making money is 
 the primary object, and the Sims, where you have characters with specific personalities.
  
  The game does have a steeper than average learning curve, so it will take some time to get used 
 to. But after that, the game is refreshingly easy to control.
  
  The ambience of the game is wonderful. The period music, costumes, etc. all contribute to a truly 
 immersive experience. What helps is that so much of the game is controlled by you - and the movie 
 titles, character names and everything make the game feel like your own. Including the ability 
 to make your own movies. While your own movies may or may not really contribute directly to the 
 game's outcome, they are still fun to make, especially if you're a real movie fan.
  
  The graphics are excellent, and though wonderfully detailed, I didn't ever see the game slow down 
 significantly (except for an odd pause when the game was about to announce that a movie was completed, 
 or an awards ceremony was about to happen) . Those few pauses never distracted from the gameplay.
 
  
  The challenge was a little uneven, with the earlier stages of the game slightly more difficult 
 than the later stages. Of course, in the later stages there is so much more to do that despite 
 the change in difficulty, there is still a bit of challenge. The sandbox mode also allows a bit 
 of variation, if you want less challenge and more freedom for creativity.
  
  All-in-all, this is a wonderful game. It's nice to see that game designers are allowing the gamer 
 the freedom to make the game world their own, and to allow some freedom for self-expression. If 
 that's what you're looking for, this game is definitely for you.

Review:  I heard before this game was released that many people believed this was going to be a "masterpiece" 
 much like "the sims" was four years ago, in my opinion that certainly is not the case, while it 
 does have a few decent features.
  
  Lets start with the one thing that intices many people, and me, to this game, is the fact that 
 you can make your own movies.
  
  Yes you can, but not very detailed ones, and certainly not very long ones, "the movies" gives you 
 about 100 cut scenes you can choose from, then its up to you to put them together, to make "your 
 own movie", or an easier way is to let a scriptwriter do it for you, which would make more sense.
 
  
  After your movie is complete, you can edit it (which to be is the best part in the game) , you can 
 do almost everything, fade in fade out, split screnes, vioce overs, subtitles, sound effect, the 
 works, to me this part of the game is the funnest and most underated.
  
  Other than making movies, you can train your actors and directors, build relationships (to make 
 better chemistry in the movies) , and of course build your own studio lot.
  
  This part of the game is nothing special, typical tycoon style.
  
  The first 10 years of game 
 time is rather boring, making terrible movies (which is realistic) , but once 1935 hits, watch out, 
 because you have heaps to do at the same time, often confusing, and too fast.
  
  Another thing I like is the invention of technology in your movies, allowing different effects 
 and increasing quality of camara work, it really does feel like your going through the ages.
  
  The game in all is incredibly easy, after you have made your first movie, it is a stroll in 
 the park, one of the easist games I have ever played.
  
  Not recomended for over twenty year olds, but definetly a sure hit for teens, across the globe!

Review:  Peter Molyneux of Lionhead Studios hjas really hit it big this time with a new simulation game, 
 The Movies.
  
  The Movies puts you in the place of the manager of your own motion picture studio and you have 
 to lead your studo from the early 1920's onwards to success.
  
  Each year there will be award ceremonieswith a new award added each year. If you win an award its 
 special effect will be activated until the next award ceremony, the following year.
  
  Employ all your own actors, directors, crew, extras, janitors, builders and scriptwriter etc.
 
  Build your own studios thats including sets, script office, cosmetics, pubs and much, much more....
 
  
  Keep your stars happy and you will not regret. The happier your stars are when filming on set the 
 better their performance will be. If they're unhappy they will refuse to talk to other staff and 
 co-operate. Make sure they often talk and practice on set. also your satars will be much happier 
 if they have their own trailers to relax in, assistents to err.. assist them and keep an eye at 
 their stress bar.
  But there is much more to keeping your actors happy than just that.
  
  The custom scriptwriting office and post production buildings allow you to create your own movies, 
 add subtitles, sound effects and props.
  
  Overall - Theres not much to say. It's a great simulator and Lionhead Studios have done extremely 
 well in the process of creating it. The game does get boring after a lenght of time but not to 
 worry im sure you'll find a way to keep you happy.

Review:  Have you ever heard of a little guy named Peter Molyneux? Well if you haven't he is the one behind 
 Black And White series. And now he and his team at lionhead has released The Movies. 
  
  The Movies is a Sim that let you start your own movie studio. The game starts of at 1920 and goes 
 al the way up to 2010 if i remember correctly. But if you get bored with the story mode you can 
 always play in sand box mode. In sand box mode you create a studio and just play there are no main 
 objectives and no awards. The game is very simple to play al you need is a mouse and dont have 
 to tuch the keyboard once. And of course the game is about movies and yes you can make your own 
 from scratch and later save and send to your friends or upload to the movies website and let other 
 players review your movie. The movies comes with a tool called "STARMAKER" and with that program 
 you can create your own stars and import them to the game. The game runs very well and stable but 
 could use a patch to correct so smaller isues. I think that covers it.

Review:  This game is so fun I just can't stop playing it. It has it's faults but they are certainly taken 
 over by the addictiveness. Making movies and uploading them is so fun! It's so, so, so entertaining 
 i can't really express it. i think that all the game needs is better sound and graphics, even though 
 they are way above par. I think that this game might get too addicting and can get frustrating 
 at times, don't you other reviewers think so? maybe it should have the ability to make longer films 
 easierly but I'm not too sure because love it the way it is.

Review:  When I first saw this game I thought it was going to be a sims rip-off but its completely different. 
 I have made movies non stop and not yet is it even a liitle boring. You can make comedys, action 
 films, horror and more. There is an open-endedness when making movies that allows you to be creative 
 and there is also stuff to do off the set of making a movie. Its much like a tycoon game but better. 
 This game deffinately has the potential to become a community modding game also. Just about anybody 
 should beable to find something to like about it.

Review:  Definitivamente este juego no va a partir la historia de los videojuegos en dos, al principio la 
 idea de poder crear nuestra propia pelicula me sono muy buena, pero despues de jugar un rato, me 
 doy cuenta que no es mas que otro tycoon, mas entretenido que muchos otros tycoons, pero no es 
 mas.
  
  Graficamente no es nada ambicioso (que mas se le pide a un tycoon) , el sonido esta apenas para 
 las necesidades del juego y la jugabilidad es la de todo un tycoon.
  
  Pa finalizar y no aburrir mas, la idea es muy buena, el juego no es malo, pero hay muchas cosas 
 que se quedan en el aire.

Review:  Well, I'm going to be very basic and straight forward
  
  Gameplay: Is very good, the control setup is fine and nothing really irritating except for the 
 fact that you can't choose your own camera placement during the making of your movies, that all 
 the bad things i could find. 
  
  Grahpics: The graphics are very nice, only a very stupid poop throwing monkey would be able to 
 get the game to lag. I run a 3 gig, 1 gig ram, and an ATI radeon 9600 256mb, and its runs beautifly 
 on the maximum settings with out a jump, even when i put the game into overhual it runs great. 
 And the level of detail will blow you away. When you can zoom in on people's faces and sets you'll 
 be flabbergasted to see that their as good close up as if it were first person veiw.
  
  Sound: is ok, nothing really spectacluar done with it. They give you premade music sounds and things. 
 And the ability to record your own VO
  (Voice-Overs) which sound really good, especially with that lipsyincing thing.
  
  Value: With 
 the amount of content crammed into this game it baffles my mind, all the sets, and shots, and differentls 
 clothes hats, i could go on. I bought the cd version for $50, but it was definelty worth the 60$ 
 dvd version.
  
  Reviewer's Tilt: With the amount of things to do, llike the tycoon part of the game, and the sims 
 part, as well as the yor own movie making, you will get some decent suprises if you dont know what 
 to excpect from this game. Some poeple might get fustrated with the sim mechanic, but the true 
 thing is, a game is meant to be challenging, and the sim part is what does that. It was fine for 
 me thoe. You can excpect some real good fun thorought the game. ecpect for when you may get a little 
 annoyed.

Review:  This game is the best tycoon idea, and game out there to date. One, you can create your own ideas 
 for movies. After the movie is created, you can post it online, which has to be the best part of 
 the intire game. You can add in how your actors emitons play out, you can decide how viloent a 
 scene can get, and you can put in your own background music. YOu can also put your voice into the 
 movie.
  Now you do have to micromange your stars, which can become a hassle, but you totally forget about 
 when you make your movies. Now you can have your own script writers make the movies, but whats 
 the fun in that. Making the movies yourself is the best part! There is so many types of movies 
 you can make, and the radio station you listen to is the best. Its funny with the parts of history 
 it puts into it. You will love this game, and you won't be able to put it down. There is nearly 
 nothing wrong with this game. Go out and buy the game right now! You won't be dissapointed!

Review:  This game surprised me. I was expecting the single player campaign to be a tacky add on and the 
 movie making to be the best part. Turns out that I'm loving the single player "tycoon" part of 
 the game and am REALLY disappointed with the movie making.
  
  The tycoon part is quite rich. Everything seems to influence how your movies turn out, and being 
 able to increase stats and talents of my actors appeals to my RPG loving nature. The interactions 
 and effects of what you are doing are intuative and obvious, but difficult to master. You can't 
 just make a star good at everything, and are forced to make decisions or limit their career to 
 specific genres to get the best out of them.
  
  The movie making part was a real let down. I thought I was going to be able to make masterpieces 
 with this thing, and send them to my friends for a good laugh. Turns out that it's greatest strength 
 (it's ease of use and speed at producing movies) is also the biggest downfall. The game is too 
 limited in it's interactions and you find yourself changing your script too often because the game 
 simply cannot accomodate what you want to do. For example, two guys walk into a bar. I want them 
 to start talking, and then have a fight. But after they walk in, I don't have an option to move 
 them from where they end up in the first scene to the start of where the next scene shoots. You 
 can't have a fight anywhere - it must be wherever Lionhead decided the best place for it to be 
 was. So what you end up with is two guys walking up to the bar, and in the next shot they are fighting 
 in the middle of the room. How did they get there? Who knows!
  
  Anyway, overall it's a bit of a laugh and I have still churned out some funny stuff to amuse my 
 friends. The single player campaign mode is holding my interest the most at the moment though.

Review:  The Movies is yet another ambitious product from Lionhead. It is, unarguably, a great game, and 
 is perfect for a creative person looking for a unique expirience.
  However, at the same time, the game doesn't seem content to cater to this demographic alone. In 
 fact, it desperately tries, and fails, to appeal to everyone who likes Sim or Tycoon games. The 
 good news is that it doesn't do a bad job at that (The game trying to mimic the relationship aspect 
 of The Sims is when it's at its worst.) but the bad news is that, when you get deep into the Tycoon-esque 
 aspect of the game, you'll realize it doesn't do a very good job either. That won't stop you from 
 enjoying it until you get to the point where you can make your own movies, though.
  The ability to make your own movies is probably the best aspect of the game. It could be argued 
 that there are not enough scenes, and that most of the focus went into the details, not into the 
 big picture; but the movie maker is still wonderful. There just ain't anything like watchin a movie 
 that you just finished.
  Back to the Tycoon side of the game, the interface basically relies on you picking up something 
 and putting it into a certain section or in front of a building to do just about anything. This 
 works well in the beginning, but later on it gets very annoying; because chances are you'll have 
 a lot of different buildings, and it will be hard to remember exactly where each one is. You may 
 have heard this before, but there is CONSTANT micromanagement in the game. And it is exhausting, 
 but that doesn't even come close to, what is, in my opinion, the worst flaw in the game: You don't 
 have room for all the movie sets. That's right, the game actually hinders your creativity by something 
 as stupid as what you can fit in your lot. If you insist on using a certain set that you don't 
 have room for, you'll probably have to sell a bunch of smaller sets, or another big one, to make 
 room. Nobody wants to constantly delete and rebuild things just so that they can make the movies 
 they want. Not even Sandbox mode solves this problem, and that's just wrong.
  Thankfully, The Movies is mostly bug free, but there is a single, very serious one: every once 
 in a while, if a movie with a script generated by AI writers is shooting, and another movie is 
 shooting at the same time, the AI may suddenly stop shooting the movie with the generated script 
 for no reason, and no matter what you do they won't ever start shooting it again. This is very 
 rare, but when it happens, it can throw your entire game of course.
  
  Now, with all these flaws, you may think that The Movies is a bad game, but it isn't. It's a great 
 one. And it's especially amazing because of just how good the game is despite its flaws. The Movies 
 is DEFINETELY not a perfect game, but it is a great one, and once again, highly recommended.

Review:  First off, I can barely run the damn game. The lagging and stuttering are unbearable and make the 
 game unplayable or at least unenjoyable.
  
  I have no problems running games like Call of Duty 2 or Far Cry on high settings. But this game 
 is a different story. What a system hog.
  
  The movies themselves are nothing more than 45 second commercials that make sbsolutely no sense 
 whatsoever.
  
  I had high hopes for this game, being a movie buff and all, but this game falls flat on its face. 
 I would at least score it a point or two higher if it would run without all the freeze ups and 
 lag.
  
  I wasted my money on yet another poor excuse for a game.

Review:  This game is OK.
  But if you play longer the game quite get boring you know.
  Doing the same thing all the time. Write a script and begin cast it then release the movie done! 
 Then do it again and again and again........
  There a nice thing with this game is that you can make your own movie =)
  I didn't understand 
 the movie making so much but I think if you can make a Star wars movie or WW2 movie you are the 
 Master!!!
  The movies mutiplayer part seemes not so attractive. Do a movie send it in and let the other garde 
 the movie and you receive viritual money and you spend it on props.
  
  And the game seems buggy jumps out all the time.

 we can't Sandbox mode is awful, the game play is just bad, graphics are awful, sounds are ok, actors 
 and directors are too fussy, and we can barley do much, it was not worth the 70 dollers and the 3 
 year wait so I say don't get it your going to get a big disapointment and it takes way to long

Review:  Peter Molyneux is a highly ambitious game designer that loves to strive for what a player desires 
 in a game more than any other aspect. He tends to create features in his games that revolutionize 
 the interface and gameplay of games in ways that many other designers should start picking up on. 
 However, with each great revolution and with each great creation that evolves in the game industry, 
 comes a slate of flaws that can sometimes bury the title completely. Molyneuxs latest title, The 
 Movies (PC, PS2, XBOX, GC) , is a strategy game that withholds his ideals of revolutionary gameplay 
 and interface. Yet his goal of simplicity and pleasing the player is overshot with loads of responsibilities 
 that many casual players will avoid at all costs. While Molyneux was wise enough to offer an entirely 
 separate mode of the game specifically designed for casual players, the alternate mode may not 
 have sufficient value to even hook casual players.
  
  Molyneux offers players a chance to run their own Hollywood studio from the 1920s to the present 
 and create movies through an ingenious 3D movie-creating tool. Being the owner of a Hollywood studio 
 may sound intriguing and possibly highly entertaining, but it ultimately becomes one of the most 
 horrific professions known to mankind. The Movies is combination of Roller Coaster Tycoon and 
 The Sims, a mixture that may seem like the best of both worlds, but simply translates into far 
 too much management. Players build sets, hire staff (actors, crew, directors, script writers, janitors 
 and researchers) , manage production and filming of movies and furnish the studio lot to please 
 staff members. These are all quite standard duties that would be expected of a studio owner, but 
 unlike most reputable strategy games, Molyneux demands far more. 
  
  Each actor and director has emotions, needs, and wants that can drive an owner to madness when 
 the only goal is to complete the filming of a movie. The general flow of gameplay in the game involves 
 creating a script (either through a dense movie creation tool or a randomly generated version) , 
 casting the crew, actors, and directors, and finally following its progress in the brutal war zone 
 known as the box office. The Movies expects a player to be able to have two to three films being 
 filmed at one time in order to stay on the charts. All the while, players are expected to make 
 sure that each of their actors and directors have not wandered off of their sets to get drunk or 
 fill their faces with food. Each actor and director can become jealous of each other and will demand 
 trailers, entourages, and makeovers or else they will hit the bricks and leave your film without 
 a star. Amidst the chaos of inebriated stars whose moods ruin your movies, The Movies also expects 
 that players manage each and every set and building, including bathrooms, and make sure their maintenance 
 level is always sufficient. Suddenly, the original standard duties that were expected are hidden 
 behind the myriad of duties required to make a single staff member satisfied. 
  
  Failing to keep up with any time consuming duty could mean the demise of one of your movies. Each 
 star must be satisfied before each and every scene otherwise your movie will lose a severe amount 
 of quality points. When you have three directors meandering about in a drunken stage of bliss, 
 actors hiding in their trailers, and a debt equivalent to the inverse of Ross Perots bank account, 
 frustration becomes your best friend and only ally when playing The Movies.
  
  Obviously, the expectations of players in the normal mode of The Movies can be quite challenging 
 to keep up with and will easily scare casual gamers away (not to mention hardcore gamers that lack 
 any patience) . The Movies does, however, offer an alternative mode where actors and directors 
 have no emotions and therefore never bother you, sets can be built instantly, movies can be filmed 
 and produced instantly and an entire studio can be created and furnished the moment you begin the 
 game. This allows players to dive into the most entertaining features of the game and ignore the 
 drudgery of living in Hollywood. With the majority of the strategy stripped away from the game, 
 one must wonder just how much value is left to enjoy when your main goal is to finally only make 
 movies.
  
  The Movies has a movie-creating tool that is not only unique and original, but quite possibly 
 one of the most enjoyable and addicting experiences a gamer can have. You can create ridiculously 
 non sequitur short movies or spend hours on an extensive epic about aliens breaking out of prison. 
 The types of scenes, sets, and animations that are available seem endless at first, but can become 
 a bit restrictive after many hours of play. The tool allows you to add your own voice acting to 
 the characters and can even lip-synch the mouths to any voice. You can edit the film with about 
 as many options as Windows Movie Maker and eventually export it to a format that can be uploaded 
 online to the The Movies website. You can then share your ridiculous movies with other most likely 
 insane directors in an already growing community. Using the movie-creating tool is not a requirement 
 for each movie (you can hire a writer to write randomly generated movies) , but it is certainly 
 the source of entertainment in The Movies. The most valued feature of The Movies is its movie-creating 
 tool and, in my opinion, the tool alone is worth the $50 price tag.
  
  Molyneux wants to please the casual gamer with each release he makes, but he is continually forgetting 
 to act like one. While The Movies is able to create a user-friendly interface and generally enjoyable 
 environment to interact with, Molyneux is completely oblivious to the fact that the strategy implemented 
 is simply too overwhelming and time consuming. The alternate mode of the game is lacking in any 
 real challenge and contains many of the flaws from the normal mode. Each feature, even the most 
 miniscule, is worth noting and praising, but when combined altogether, The Movies becomes a job 
 rather than a gratifying experience. The Movies can supply several hours of indulging Hollywood 
 satisfaction that can be shared with friends, but it is up to the gamer as to whether this alone 
 is enough to throw down the $50 for. 
  
  After many hours spent tossing actors around a studio and creating beautiful masterpieces starring 
 50 Cent, I feel Ive had a worthwhile experience with The Movies that any type of gamer can also 
 appreciate. However, I fear the apparent open-ended gameplay offered in The Movies lacks enough 
 value and variety to make it a long-lasting title in any gamers collection.

Review:  Gameplay:
  Easily the highest point in the game. There is so much variety to be found here because of being 
 able to just focus on the necessary things in the tycoon mode if you want to basically try to make 
 the best movies by trying to micromanage all of the little details like props, costumes, and even 
 scripts. Or you can only focus on the tycoon game and just let your director, actors, exstras, 
 and crew to handle the movie while you focus on improving your lot, researching new technolgies 
 and much much more.
  
  Graphics:
  Another great part of the game while not as good as say Earth 2160 they are very detailed and colorful 
 and can run on mid-range systems without much lag at all.
  
  Sound:
  The only complaint I have is the sound which is mainly because of the gun sounds and the lack of 
 prerecorded speech but otherwise there isnt much else wrong in this catagory.
  
  So basically this game is an extremely fun game and will apeall to a wide variety of gamers.

Review:  I had been waiting for this game for about a year and when I bought and installed it, I wasn't 
 dissappointed even a little bit. Sure lot's of people who reviewd this game say that the movie-making 
 part is a disappointment, but that all depends on how high your expectations were. If thought the 
 movies would be a 60 dollar alternative to having your own movie studio then obviously you wouldn't 
 enjoy this game that much. 
  Still, the movie makin part could be very fun and you'll be able to make good movies with the right 
 type of editing and creativity.
  
  The tycoon part of this game is totally awsome and addicting. And the difficulty level is not too 
 hard or too easy, but taking care of you stars, managing your studio, and making movies at the 
 same time keeps you busy right until the end of the game.
  
  The sound while making movies is totally stupid, however the music, the DJ's, and the sound effects 
 are awsome.
  
  The graphics are just normal, (for which I'm happy, i didn't have to upgrade my video card) but 
 the character actions and movements are all in a comical sort of way.
  
  The cool thing about this game is that you could choose to focus on only a part of the game. Either 
 just making relationships between your stars, or managing your studio, or making movies. However 
 it would be better to do this after totalling working on all of them in the campaign mode to unlock 
 new features for the sandbox mode.
  
  OVERALL:
  AWSOME!!

Review:  Lionhead promised freedom in this game and like many of thier recent titles, they promise big and 
 deliver little. Yes its true u can make your own movies, they didn't lie. But there is confusion 
 as to what the word 'make' means to Lionhead, it is to them to compile and arrange, as you see 
 fit. a bunch of pre rendered scenes, mine is to take charge of the cinematography atleast, but 
 thats asking too much, is it? Moreover the only thing connecting the tycoon part to the movie making 
 part is the revenues the studio can gain and on the other hand the technology and the actors to 
 be used in movie making. Either intentional or not they should start being clear and be detailed 
 about their games or dont talk at all just surprise us! if they said this was a tycoon game instead 
 of a movie-directing one. i would have been much happier and consider the ability to manipulate, 
 though in a little way, your movies an actual plus.
  
  gamplay: the tycoon part is decent but nothing remarkable
  graphics: nothing we haven't seen 
 before, light-hearted and funny
  sound: mediocre
  value: made for the dumb masses, i think it works too. Say 'i am a big idiot' enough times and 
 suddenly you'll think this game divine.

Review:  A very solid game that is very innovative. I havent seen anything like this b4 ever. Basicially 
 this game is a hybrid of the Sims, Monopoly and movie making. Having spent like years making a 
 movie then it gets horrible ratings maks you want to sqeeze one out as the game says. This is not 
 for people who dont like spending a long time in single-player. What is neat is that you can export 
 your creations (or pieces of crap) and post them on the internet for everyone to see. A great game. 
 I like it, you like it, they like it, heck we all like it.

Review:  I first heard of The Movies almost 4 years ago when Peter Molyneux mentioned the concept of the 
 game in an interview. Since then I had been eagerly awaiting the games release. Of which, over 
 the years, has been put off time and again making the desire to play this title grow ever more. 
 
  
  The concept of building your own movie studio, playing through the decades film genres and technical 
 advancements is only a part of the core of the games play. There is the main and what I believe 
 draws almost everyone in, the fact you actually make movies with it.
  
  For those who might think this is the answer to all their computer animation needs, it is far from 
 it. It does lack the ability of allowing you to do much with camera angles as they are all pre-set. 
 But they do give enough pre-sets for you to be able to make unique movies. There is talk that this 
 will be changed with future add-on packs and patches. If not the modding community are already 
 on it. 
  
  The up side of all this is that the developers of the game are being more than supportive of the 
 modding community. This means, and is already proving, that there will be an extensive amount of 
 content to be available to those who use the game. Already there are game hacks available to change 
 certain aspects of the game and allow you to change some of the visual aspects of the game via 
 skinning. For those without the technical know-how of skinning and modding the community for the 
 game has been more than happy to provide.
  
  My recommendation of this game is for those whom are willing and wanting to invest time into it. 
 It has more replay value than most games that have be released in the last few years. Well, thats 
 until The Movies 2 gets released.

Review:  WOW, I'm addicted to this game! It reminds me of the tycoon games though, after playing this one, no 
 tycoon game is good enough.
  Since I've installed it I've been playing continuously and still no boredom.
  For sure one of 
 the games of the year and it was worth the waiting and its worth the money.
  Unlike many games of this genre, this is not a very hard game so lets you more freedom to build 
 stuff and arrange everything without going bankrupt
  Another positive thing I found out was the tutorial. Usually tutorials are boring enough to make 
 you wanna skip it and try the game for yourself but this tutorial is very "light" and short giveing 
 you the idea of the whole basic game play. The in the beginnig of the game the tutorial (optional) 
 continues helping you out with very useful tips though, again not boring
  
  Try it, you'll love it for sure!!!

Review:  The movies is a good fun game to play with making your own movies is the best part just making 
 them and then seeing how much stars you get and even releasing your movies to the public is fun! 
 Theres plenty of sets to choose from 
  in the movies and hell of a lot of costumes to choose from! The sandbox mode is the fun part of 
 the game which lets you just play the fun part of the game with all the tycoon parts already done 
 so your set and all you need to do is hire actors and build sets! Another good thing about the 
 movies is when your making your movies there is tons of animations to choose from which will be 
 good for your genre of movie it goes from action to romance comedy sci and even horror the best 
 of the best! it even allows you too add your own voice clips how snappy is that! :P The tycoon 
 part of the game is just about running your studio and handling staff stars can misbehave and get 
 mad about something like not being happy with there latest movie release.
  
  Even though i find this a good game i still find it stressful at times like it isnt fully free 
 you sometimes cant find animations suited for your movie or the animation is what your kind of 
 looking for but just isnt it! you cant also select where you want your stand to act out the animation 
 on set! though there is some options where you can change location at first you will find the movie 
 making part confusing and hard to get used to but after you get to know which buttons do what youll 
 do fine. a note for movie makers who are uploading there movie online is DO NOT upload your FIRST 
 MOVIE keep making movies so you get more practice whats the point of uploading your first movie? 
 it might not be as good as other movies but if you really have spent alot of time on the first 
 movie well give it a GO WHY NOT? Only other let down of the game i can think of is the Sandbox 
 mode options you cant start with everything unlocked though there should be a modification to change 
 this soon! 
  
  If you really love movies and would like to make a movie well this is one game you should try!

Review:  this game is truely a must buy. there is a story mode where you are the director and you make and 
 break stars. there is a upkeep to the stars, and they can quit at anytime. its fun to dress them 
 and cast them in movies. the movie creating is so deep that i think there are unlimited possibilitys. 
 literally. you make comedy, action, sci-fi, romance, and horror. you can create the most random 
 **** and have a whole shit load of laughs. the action i serious, and has goo action sequences. 
 i made a WW1 movie. it was, i must say, brilliant in its own remark. if you have a mic, you can 
 add your own dialouge. you can also make subtitles, and music. in the scene selection, you can 
 fix the camera and prop, you can dress the set to anything of your likeing. your studio will start 
 at like 1920 i think, and then go from there, my brother is on 2000, he got cgi effects, and a 
 whole shit load of new settings. this game is a creation that only peter and and the gang can pull 
 off. thsi is definently a game to buy. hell, its not even a game. its more of a movie making program. 
 buy this game!

Review:  The game I had been waiting for since 2002...
  I went to the shop and bought it on the release day, I wanted to scream of happiness (but I didn't) 
 when I was finished installing the game. Then I started the tutorial... The tycoon part was pretty 
 good actually, but it was not the part I had been longing for, it was "The Movie making part". 
 I started it up and in about an hour I'd learned how to use it. I was clearly disappointed!
  
  The Movie making part wasn't very special... I had been hoping for more "freedom" when making 
 the movies, but it was more like taking scenes and putting them together. Another thing that I 
 dislike about that part is that it's impossible to do a serious movie! however you do it, it'll 
 just turn into a comedy.. Because of the unrealistic movements the characters does, like in "The 
 Sims 2", but that fitted in completely in that game.
  
  I went back to the tycoon part, because I got tired of "the movie making part" in about an hour. 
 I keept playing the tycoon part for about an hour... and then I shut down the game, disappointed 
 as never before (about a game, that is :p) . Another bad game from Lionhead, I thought (I really 
 never liked the black and white series, but I thought this would be something different) .
  
  Okay, now for a short summary.
  Gameplay: The gameplay in the tycoonpart is actually almost 
 perfect, like most other tycoongames.
  Graphics: Good, but nothing special. The realistic graphic doesn't fit the comedy-stile movements 
 of the characters.
  Sound: very much alike The Sims 2, but these sounds in the movies... urgh, they are just silly.
 
  Value: Well, as I said before, I played it for 2 hours :p no value at all...
  
  Another So-So game in my collection! =)

Review:  The Movies is a fantastic game which lionhead studios have put a lot of time into. along with Activision.
 
  
  The gameplay: Is amazing you will definatly be playing this game for hours on end just like me 
 go from creating black and white movies from the early 1900s up to today the year 2005 and then 
 into the future.
  
  The graphics: In the game are superb and you can fill the entire studio and it wont lag at all 
 at least for me but my comp aint that good.
  
  The sound: Is great i especially like the radio in this game which will make you laugh when you 
 dont have much to do which will not be often because you are a movie mogul and a very busy person 
 indeed.
  
  The Value: The movies game is definatly worth what you have paid for it because you can make your 
 own movies, you can make a simple one of which is 3 minuites long or make a full movie of 2 hours 
 + if you have the time and patience to do it.
  
  Right basicly this is an absolute amazing game which will have you glued to your computer for hours 
 (not literaly) it is one of this years must have games and will be a hit this christmas. so if 
 i was you id go out there and get this game ASAP!!!
  
  Have Fun Gaming:

Review:  Because thats the only kind of movie you can make with this game. In fact, the game is not even 
 good at that. If you can piece together a movie longer than 1 minute that makes sense, you should 
 truly win an Academy Award.
  
  Gameplay: Well, here you have two completely different games; the movie making game and the tycoon 
 part. None of them is more than mediocre. The tycoon part of the game is tedious and has many shortcomings. 
 For example, unlike other games where you have a complex variety of things you can do; In The Movies 
 you only have to pick your actors and directors, drop them at the restaurant or bar to eat or drink 
 when they are stressed, drop them at the make-up place or the cosmetic surgery. Relationships between 
 your cast you say? Well, apart than dropping them together to talk and after ages of that putting 
 them together at the bar or restaurant, there is nothing else to it.
  
  Another huge flaw you will find in the Tycoon part of the game is the fact that you will find yourself 
 moving your employees from one task they do perfectly well, to other tasks because you will always 
 be short of staff.
  
  Shall we get to the movie making part of the game? Ok, I understand you cannot put a GAME with 
 the complexity of making movies ala 3d Studio Max. It would be far too difficult and frustrating 
 for most. Even thought the idea of having pre-made scenes you put together is good, the fact that 
 you have a handful of scenes make it impossible to piece together a movie that makes sense. After 
 a few hours playing this game, the movie making process will get tedious as all movies are basically 
 the same and you will just put random scenes together. As long as your actors have a high rating 
 in the genre of the movie, good relationships between them and the set has not been used recently, 
 you will get a high rating for your movie. Nothing else matters.
  
  Graphics: They are not bad but they are not great either. Nothing you have not seen in games dated 
 back in 2004.
  
  Sound: Mediocre at best. Repetitive while in tycoon mode and a joke when in movie making. Yes you 
 can import your own soundtrack and sound effects to the movies, but then its not the game sound, 
 is it?
  
  Value: There is not much value after a few hours of playing The Movies. Once you start realizing 
 the new technologies and new stuff you unlock make no difference, you will quickly press the uninstall 
 button.
  
  Tilt: I really had big expectations with this game, but the whole game experience is more frustrating 
 than rewarding. How can I like a game called The Movies, when you cannot even make a decent one 
 with it?

Review:  If you have been holding off on buying this game because of a few negative reviews, don't wait 
 any longer!
  
  This game is solid fun from the start, and offers quite a bit more challange and playability than 
 a typical Sims or Tycoon type game. I've read several reviews complaining about the 'easy' level 
 of play, but personally, it took me a couple of starts before I found a formula that wins some 
 of the big awards early on.
  
  The game starts in 1920, at the dawn of the movie studio era. There is a running timeline, with 
 periodic news and humorous commentaries regarding moments in history as your studio grows. I laughed 
 out loud on several occasions. You'll start with four 'big' studios to compete against for the 
 first awards show, and they definately have the advantage over you. You have an empty lot and a 
 suitcase full of cash, but that's about it. These studios mean business!
  
  The game is easy enough for any Sims, RTS, or Tycoon player to pick up quickly, but the fun and 
 challange of making movies that really stand out makes the difference between boredom and entertainment. 
 The learning curve depends on how far you want to set your goals.
  
  This game is entertainment and then some! It's easy to start, but hard to put down!

Review:  Graphics and content are great .You are the owner of a Hollywood Studios lot which you control, build 
 and micro manage actors, movies. Although actually getting an award at the award ceremony is like 
 winning the lottery, slim and none and SLim left town. But seriously folks to make C movies and get 
 all your employees talented enough to start making good movies takes alot of work but starting 
 out in the early 20's and then progressing as the years go on so you see all the advancement is 
 not only a history lesson in itself which leaves the game very interesting and well thought out. After 
 several hours of training your actors as your making terrrible movies just to get their name out 
 there it's well worth it to see the reward, then when their experience is done you need to get their 
 relationships amongst each other to top notch. The SIMS is great and fun for awhile but the novelty 
 wears off, this game seems to wear on you and become more fun rather then tedious due to the excitement 
 of Hollywood. There is nothing in this game that bothered me aside from the camera panning sticking 
 on an AMD XP 2700 overclocked to a 2.6ghz w/1.5gb of Corsair RAM w/RAID 120gb HD's,256mb XFX gf4 
 6600 video, the problems are software related that's for sure. Aside from that, this is worth checking 
 out:)

Review:  The movies is latest game out by Lionhead, also one of the better Lionhead games recently. The 
 main game itself isnt very different from other tycoon games, except for the theme. It does however 
 manage to pull the genre in a new direction with its movie making function. 
  
  You start the game with only one building in your studio witch is used to make builders and janitors. 
 Once youve got you builders and janitors the studio building process begins and in no time youll 
 have ready to use studio. 
  The game starts in the 1920s with black and white no talkers.
  Before long youll be in the 1950s with full colour (if youve invented it yet) making some kind 
 of horror movie. The game occasionally evolves at a rushed rate, but most of the time youll be 
 able to keep up with the competing studios. 
  Nothing revolutionary in this department. 
  
  Now on to the beef of the game, namely the movie making part. There are basically two ways 
 to make movies, either you just drop one of your scriptwriters into a script office and let them 
 do the work. You basically only get to choose the genre if done this way. If you want to get more 
 involved in the production of the movie you can do this by either rewriting a script made by the 
 scriptwriters or making a brand new script. The latter being the funniest. The game lets you choose 
 from different genres like horror or romance. 
  You dont actually write a script; instead you make a movie then release the script. First youll 
 get to choose the lead roles, supporting roles etc. 
  From here on the sky is the limit. You get to choose from an extravagant amount of sets and scenarios. 
 To make sure that each of you movies are unique Lionhead has put in sliders that lets you define 
 for example the mood of the characters, the weather, even how romantic or scary a scene should 
 be.
  On top of that youll be able to record your own voice in the games movie player. If you think 
 youre a future director and want here others opinion, you can upload your movies to The Movies 
 home page.
  All of this might sound a bit complicated, thankfully its not. 
  
  The graphics in the game dont stride too far away from the usual sims look. Though, if you scroll 
 down to pedestrian level some great details are uncovered, you can actually watch the little people 
 making movies. 
  The sound in the game is great. Theres a radio in the game that tells you stuff going on in the 
 world (if you want to make hot movies youd better listen what is being said here) .
  As said before the game does not revolutionize the tycoon genre. 
  The big attraction of this 
 game is its movie making part.
  
  One thing that should be mentioned is that the game can be played through as a regular tycoon game. 
 You never NEED to make your own script as you just as well drop a scriptwriter into a script office, 
 you might just play an other tycoon game.

Review:  Finally a game that is totally new & away from the whole FPS crap,
  this game is what i'd call THE SIMS meets STEPHEN KING/STEVEN SPIELBERG :D
  
  It's a breath 
 of fresh air among the crap we have to swallow these days,
  key words are : INNOVATIVE, AMAZING, CREATIVE, ENTERTAINING.....
  
  Another game that had this 
 effect on me was a game called GHOSTMASTER,
  you lead ghosts to scare people, it was the best game ever for me.
  
  THE MOVIES let you create 
 movies and such, so get creative,
  you won't need a 100000$ budget, all you need is your PC now!!!!
  
  love it.

Review:  Expect big things for this game. 
  I originally started out thinking that I was only interested in the movie-making aspect. How wrong 
 I was. The playability of The Movies is great. The challenges throughout to unlock all the movie-making 
 feaures, sets, props etc leaves you wanting more. It's so easy to become completely immersed whilst 
 playing.
  As for the movie-making aspect, it really is quite amazing. There's so many shots and scenarios 
 you can choose. The only thing that I think it lacks, is more sets and props. But that will come 
 I'm sure! 
  If you've got 50 odd bucks to waste, then you better buy The Movies. It's definately worth it.

Review:  The Movies is surprisingly an amazing game.
  There are two parts of the game while playing The Movies.
  
  You can play it like a Tycoon 
 Game and let Scriptwriters write your scripts and then choose the actors you want to have in your 
 movie and wWhen the film is done shooting you can actually see it.
  
  Or you can play it like the Director and shoot the movies on your own.
  You can choose from very 
 many scenes and if you have researched after sets you can have lots of sets, as well.
  
  The sounds in the game... are really great. I think they fit so perfect in the game and they're 
 just perfect.
  
  The Movies also have an online community where you can upload the Movies a you made and rate others. 
 If you upload your movies you will 
  win credits that you can use to buy new props.

Review:  The Movies is great at executing a type of game that many developers would fail at. In the Movies, 
 you are the runner of your own Movie Studio that you can name, choose the logo, and build. There 
 is the sandbox mode (you can play with however much money you want) or story mode. In story mode, 
 it emerges you into the 20's black and white silent era of films. There are 5 genres you can make 
 your movie off of, Action, Sci-Fi, Romance, Comedy, and Horror. The most addicting is probably Horror 
 because of the great costumes and sets you can have. The most sophisticated and complicated part 
 is making your movie. First of you begin with intros, conflict, big fight, etc, it pretty much matters 
 on what genre you are doing. Making the scenes is the most addictive and most complicated of the 
 game. You can make your stars shoot, fight, kiss, or even do some comedic stuff like slip on a 
 banana peel. Below are the cons and pros of this game.
  
  Pros: Addictive Gameplay; Good Interface; You make your own movies!!; able to upload to official 
 site; 
  
  Cons: Difficult to make what you want; Hard to raise Star's behavior; no tanks?!; Hard to get good 
 ratings on your movies; Babbling gets annoying; Takes awhile to learn.

Review:  While The Movies does deliver most all of what was promised some things just are not right. Case 
 in point the amount of time you have to devote taking care of the actors and the lot takes so much 
 that actually making the movies becomes and after thought. While this is great for the business 
 sim side of the game it detracts noticeably from the movie making experience. In turn if you focus 
 on the movie making experience then you run the risk of upsetting the actors and having a sub par 
 lot. All that to say that neither of the negative aspect are necessarily bad but force together 
 the way they are makes the game feel unwieldy at times.
  
  That said I the game is truly a great if not slightly awkward it's one of those games you can't 
 stop playing. In fact.....

Review:  I've played it for a week or so and at first I was really impressed. At first, I went into time 
 warp, losing all sense of what time it was. I stayed up till 3 a. m. on the firstt couple sessions. 
 But, after 2 or 3 days I found the tricks to a successful studio that seemed to work pretty much 
 every time. Now I'm just doing pretty much the same thing to get ahead . There are no random events 
 that make much difference and I find nothing extraordinarily special about the game. It loses it's 
 luster after 2 or 3 days. I'll certainly play some more but I'm only mildly impressed

Review:  All the hype that Lionhead brought onto this game was well worth listening too, lionhead creates 
 another masterpeaice. 
  
  The Movies is a Game within a game - It has the Tycoon style management of buildings, stars, and 
 staff. Then you have the Movie side, which you can create any type of movie you wan't with literally 
 dozens and dozens of pre-animated scenes to choose from. 
  
  Although these scenes are pre-animated they can be combined in so many differnt ways that the possibilitys 
 are unlimited. The ability to add music, change the title, and add you're very own voice overs 
 just adds even more depth to the game itself. Ontop of that, there is an online community in which 
 you are able to post your movies and show off you're latest masterpeaice for all to see and rate! 
 
  
  Theres not much bad to say about this wounderful game besides the fact that, at times you will 
 find you're self looking for that "one" scene that the game dosn't have. Or that one background 
 the game dosn't include, but with the community of The Movies growing and easy modding capabilites. 
 This leaves the Life line of the movies open for a very long long time.
  
  Deffinately worth the buy.

Review:  I've been waiting for this to come out for quite some time and was really expecting a let down 
 as with most games (AOE III anyone?) Not true in this case. This is one of the most enjoyable experiences 
 in gaming and will probably last quite a long while due to the creative aspect of it. It's like 
 adding a game onto Adobe Premiere in a way.
  
  Most people dog the tycoon part of the game but actually it is really enjoyable and Lionhead should 
 be commended for creating an interface with really very little interface. Most everything works 
 just the way you would think it should. Very little menus in the way.
  
  The attention to detail is incredible and the ability to zoom in all the way to your studio and 
 "walk around" is a great experience. The graphics are superb and fast. All the animation is top 
 notch.
  
  The moviemaking portion is also pretty good but hardcore animators will be very frustrated at the 
 lack of control. Lionhead basically removed much of the choice in order to make it possible for 
 the computer to shoot films. This is fine when you just want to run the studio but creating the 
 movie you want is a bit harder as you are held to the large amount of canned scenes and slider 
 controls. There is alot though so many people may think it overwhelming. I hope for more freedom 
 in a future expansion as do most people I think.
  
  No, it's not perfect but a blast to play and one of the most ambitious titles to ever come out 
 and it nearly succeeds on every level.
  
  Bottom line is that this is a great game, Visit their website to see the movies people have done 
 as already people have come up with alot of winners.

Review:  When my boyfriend brought this game home I had no intention of playing it but as I sat down and 
 watched him play I couldn't wait to get my hands on the keyboard!
  
  It is a perfect game for control freaks like myself! It has tons of playabilty and I love the movie 
 making aspect of it. It allows those of us who have always wanted to make a better movie than what 
 is currently out there to delve right in and take charge with our creative spirits!
  
  It is a diverse enough game that all ages will enjoy playing it for hours. My son (a control freak 
 in the making) loves the fact he has control of a game that he can add his creativeness to it and 
 watch it in action!
  
  I recommend this game for all those Sims/Havest Moon/Tycoon lovers out there to give it a try you 
 won't be disappointed!

Review:  Amazing !! Great Game !!!! New type of simulator never seen before ! New ideas , new concept. I'm 
 still paying it and the game is replayable even after a long gameplay. Every game played is a different 
 one ( New actor , ne movies often ) Best game of this kind played up to date. The gameplay is just 
 right not to hard not to easy. The learning curve is somewhat fast about 1 hours which is normal 
 for any kind of games as i dont want to spend half a day learning how to play the game. The graphics 
 are wonderfull.
  
  Pros:
  - Good Graphics
  - Good replay value
  - Good soundtrack and sounds
  - The game is long enough 1920 - to today which take about 20 hours 
 or more to complete not to short.
  - Lots of choices for advanced movie making ( costumes , actions , props etc..)
  
  Cons:
 
  - Advance movie maker which doesn't keep your actors costumes after each scene. ( you need to 
 recostume every one the way they were ) And often change your second role character for a monster 
 ?!?!
  
  Conclusion: The game is a wonderfull piece of software that you should play and even i still play.

Review:  When I first played "The Movies" I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed; All the tutorials and different 
 buildings made it almost seem like it would be a chore. After about 10 minutes I moved passed the 
 tycoon part and started up the advanced script maker; stupidly I skipped the tutorials and found 
 my self lost. So I quit playing that in about thirty minutes, I was very dissappointed; I thought 
 the game was a distaster. 
  
  So the next morning I thought I'd give it another go, this time it went ALOT better, I played around 
 with the advanced script maker some more and started to get how to use it; and then I decided to 
 watch all the script maker movies and everything became easier and much clearer. That was just 
 the beginning, after making my first movie the tycoon portion of the game started to get fun, it 
 was fun to know that my studio was in competition and the control I had over people and there salaries 
 is great! 
  
  Where the fun ever got more fun for me? Voice Acting! Its amazingly fun, and the outcome you get 
 is great, the characters lips will sync accordingly. 
  
  Gameplay: 
  The camera slides nicely, every button pressed goes accordingly with a response, the only problem 
 Ive had was in the script maker; sometimes when assigning an actor to a role by dragging and dropping, 
 the actor will be assigned to the wrong role or it wont get assigned at all.
  
  Graphics:
  Not next gen by any means, but for the current gen there not bad. Nice and clean, 
 some pretty shadows here and there.
  
  Sound:
  Well, although the sound is not at top notch quality, there are many sounds to choose from to add 
 into your movie, not only sounds but music clips and such; Don't forget you can do voice acting 
 for your movies!
  
  Valure:
  The only way I see this game getting "old" would be either a sequel or the graphics getting just 
 way too ugly. This game has alot of value, making movie after movie. Not to forget "The Movies" 
 online community where you can upload you movies onto there website for the whole world to watch! 
 Even more fun, along with your movies you get "credits" these will be used to buy "props" for your 
 game; and I don't doubt there will be a few expansion packs. 
  
  Conclusion:
  "The Movies" is awesome and very addictive. I hope they make expansions; and a great idea would 
 be to make a "set maker" in which you will be able to make your very own sets.

Review:  Gameplay:
  altho the game is huge and vastly articulated, it is surprizing how easy it is to get into the 
 studio building and movie making. the tutorial does a very good job explaining all the things you 
 need know to get you going. controls for the most part is stable, altho some tasks may feel a bit 
 awkward to initiate.
  
  Audio and Video:
  the music is awsome and the many sound affects makes a good selection for your movies audience. 
 The graphics arn't too good, sprites look real from a distance but very much like characters from 
 "sims 2" when actually shooting them in films.
  
  Things to Consider:
  Making movies in real life is really complicated. for a game that show's some of the ups and downs 
 of film making is already a tremendous effort. furthermore, i'm positive that this game will have 
 new props and backdrops and technologies for downloading, to broaden your possibilities, in the 
 future- so that's something to look forward to. finally, the online sharing and reviewing each 
 other movies website is awsome. 
  
  if you like tycoon games, simulation games, interested in movie production, filming, playing with 
 people's lives, or just looking for something new, then give this a shot.

Review:  In one simple word i say this game is: "Unique"!
  
  As me being a filmmaker, I love playing this game during my free times, I even may get addicted 
 to it soon. The game is full with surprises and it surely is adventurous.
  
  The graphics, sounds, quality is great. I can't compare this game to any other one as it comes 
 in a whole new system. It's all about talents instead of Strategy like in other games of the type 
 it's close to.
  
  At the beginning your head will get all full with the amount of information that you "Must" know 
 in order to play the game. but after a couple of hours you'll get used to it start enjoying your 
 time.
  
  This game is a great tool for filmmaker "wannabe" to have a feel of what film-making business is. 
 In some way or another this game is being developed on a true life like situations.
  
  This game is packed with wondrous stuff. Try it and you'll never regret it! :)

Review:  While the game itself is really genial, this game lacks of very common easy of use commands and, 
 badly, it is full of bugs!
  A simple "turn the camera" by using the two mouse buttons is not present, neither a click and drag 
 approach, nor a simple menu to remove or destroy object. You have to pick up a builder and move 
 it on a building, find the destroy icon, click on it and click again once its ready. Terrible.
 
  You also have a very bad day when you look for your scriptwriters. They are of course around you 
 100x100 miles park and you have to look for them or you won't have scripts. What the hell?
  Then there is something that destroy your pleasure. When you're not winning, you lose and lose, 
 you never get new hires, nor you can advertise or buy hires, you just... die slowly, frustrated 
 by a voice telling you you need new hires! Great, I need them, I know. Give me the way to get them, 
 stupid machine.
  Lastly, the bugs. One terrible is happening when you fire someone and it's not fired since it was 
 simply ... filming or acting. It remains in your list and there is no way to remove it. It locks 
 forever one of your movies, and screw all your statistics. You can even destroy the park, and it 
 will remain. No matter you try to drag it, it cannot be dragged.
  Nice try, the game is genious, but you have to play more the other construction games to understand 
 how it is frustrating your interface.
  
  Hope in some updates to fix all this garbage. Ah, I forgot, it seems that all the buildings are 
 always to be repaired, always, so when you have some buildings, you're stuck in losing all your 
 people in repairing... Illogical and very frustrating.

Review:  This game is great it kind of reminds me of the Sims so if your a sims fan this would definatelly 
 suit you, obviously it is actually different from the sims because instead of living a life you 
 are a movie creator. Lots of cool stuff to do like you can sort of choose what type of movie you 
 would like to make like horror, thriller etc. You also have to hire the people to create the film 
 you can decide whos going to be in your movie you get to choose the stars, you have to set the 
 background, props, you have to choose directors, producers, extras etc. Pretty cool game but i 
 really think its going to be one of them games where its sooo great and fun at first but then after 
 it just gets boring! at the moment im enjoying it im glued to the screen but im pretty sure it 
 wont last. I think this game would be great fun for like 2 weeks max! and then it will sit and 
 gain dust on the shelves, but if you loved the sims 2 and never really got bored of that im sure 
 this game is for you!
  
  I give this game a good score of 9/10 but in a weeks time im sure that will drop to 7/10
  
 
  Have fun! :-)

Review:  I think the descriptions of this game as a hybred of the Sims and a tycoon game is pretty accurate. 
 I've only had it a few days, but I could see a lot of things that could consume my free time. I 
 also see some things that could instantly improve the game. I'd expect that they will be added 
 in expansions or future generations. I believe this game is definitely going to generate a sequel 
 if it doesn't get dropped like so many other great games that just seemed to be 1-hit wonders.
 
  
  The game centers around managing the moods and appearance of studio figures (builders, crew, directors, 
 stars, etc.) and the prestige of the studio itself. It comes with some interesting tools for building 
 your own movies from scratch, if you like. I think that's a great, added value feature that they 
 didn't have to include, but did so anyway. 
  
  What I think is well done: The overall concept is fresh and fun. The music sound-tracks that they've 
 created are really clever. They quickly remind you of movie themes, but depending on your mood, 
 you can hear different types of movie themes in just one tune. It could be an epic western OR a 
 sci-fi tune, for example. I just thought it was really clever. You can use the 'Star builder' utility 
 to customize the people you want to use as stars. Like the movie making tool, it's not required, 
 but a great value added in by the makers at Lionhead. The game also allows a player to use, or 
 not use some automated helper systems. There's PLENTY of information about the mood of characters 
 or the status of films. It's a little clunky, but I can't think up a better display system at this 
 point. So I'll call it functional. The time passage in the game is variable speed, so you can play 
 it on 'fast forward' if the game seems slow. Custom script tools and the ability to perform post 
 production tasks all add to a fairly broad and ambitious type of game.
  
  What I think could be improved: There are too many static elements. For example, you can choose 
 one of several genre films (action, romance, etc.) Stars and directors as well as writers all have 
 different skills in different genres. However, there's not a good way to cross over and have a 
 romantic comedy, or action comedy, etc. There is no ability to make a director a 'writer/director' 
 that the little sim-izens are pleased with. But in the "real world" of hollywood (and believe me, 
 this game is probably more real that most of hollywood) writer/directors are often better film 
 makers. Little things like that, are areas that I'd be very shocked if they didn't improve. Also, 
 the materials for studio beautification are pretty lame. 20 different types of lamp posts don't 
 really make me tingly. Perhaps I haven't yet foud the more involved aspects, but I would find it 
 more interesting if you had the ability to add arcades, swiming pools, expensive studio housing, 
 etc. Also, there's not really a "free agent" star system by which an existing, high-powered star 
 could be signed to a limited number of pictures. It's much more based on the older studio contract 
 system in which you build stars and use them through a long portion of their career if you keep 
 them happy.
  
  All together, I've enjoyed the game since I started playing it only a few days ago. I'll give it 
 many more hours to see if it grows on me more. However, I've also got AoE III which is a rather 
 kick-ass strategy game. Not sure how I'll divide my time between the two.
  
  My overall recommendation is that Sims fans will like it and some minor improvements are likely 
 to appear over time. They already have an on-line method of submitting your movies and earning 
 'points' that can be used to download exclusive game content like new costumes and sets. If you 
 thought the Sims and tycoon style games were just average, then I'd suggest you pick this one up 
 after the holidays when the prices drop a bit from the $45 average. I got mine at a well known 
 retailer and it came with a $5 gift card. So, at $40, and being a person that's not a rabid fan 
 of sim/tycoon games I'd say that's a fair price.

Review:  I and many others have wait 3 years for this game. Finally can i play this! Its really a great 
 game, there are many scenes you can shoot your movie in, and plenty of different costumes and stuff. 
 I learned this can very quickely, becouse its a great tourtorial that guide you trough the game. 
 Its great, and very fun to play. I am missing the part that you control exactly where the people 
 goes and what the do, but that will be to much for the producers of this game, and to hard to do. 
 But its also great that you can use your own voice, haven't find that function yet, but im sure 
 its great. 
  
  Its also great with the starmaker, when you make your own star, that really get the sims 2 feeling 
 which is great. Its very impressing have much they have done to this game. I really recommend it!

Review:  Many people simply want the movie making tools in this game. Others want a solid economic tycoon 
 sim of a Hollywood studio. This game delivers a great taste and lots of possibilities.
  
  I had a tough time due to lack of imagination. I simply jumped in to conquer the movie market. 
 My studio is just one big grass lot with buildings and sidewalks. You never need to use concrete. 
 Actually I believe because i never used concrete, the media (part of the game that judges your 
 performance) rates my studio the best. This results in sped up research of movie technology. Which 
 in term, earned me awards for using Digital Video in my movies in the 1960s. The result? Unlimited 
 money, constant job applicants, more awards.
  
  So I really lucked out and flew through most of the game. I hit a stump when I realized i have 
 to follow EVERY single move of my ten actors/directors. Dragging them to places and forcing them 
 to do things. This means you will spend hours CONSTANTLY clicking and dragging. It will be like 
 work. Otherwise, I am pretty sure you can not achieve 5/5 star celebreties that make your movies, 
 5/5 stars.
  
  This pretty much sums up the game. Easy economics, hard social management ala Sims, and pretty 
 fun movie making features.
  
  The music and graphics are worth the money in this game. Definetly a milestone in sandbox games. 
 Hooraah!

Review:  I've spent roughly one whole day playing this game, in both the Normal Game Mode and the Sandbox 
 Mode. 
  
  The Normal Mode is very addicting, just like any good simulation game. I love these micro-management 
 games, and this one satisfys my craving.
  
  In Sandbox Mode, the game is very powerful in make simple/moderately complex movies. I can't wait 
 till someone starts utilizing other engines in combination with The Movies to make truely amazing 
 Machinima.
  
  Some of the movies upload the The Movies Online community are really great. I think with this game 
 we will see an increase in the number of animated shorts, as this game/tool makes it somewhat simple 
 to "film" a funny or crazy little movie.

Review:  This game is very similar in genre to the Roller Coaster Tycoon series. You have a plot of land 
 and build up your Production Company, as new buildings become available. The graphics are very 
 solid and the sound track is great. The movies you (or your writers) make are short, but very well 
 executed and flow amazingly well.
  You start out in the 1920's and I've only progressed a couple of years in the game (I've already 
 restarted a couple of times with new ideas.) As a result, I've only seen the silent movie era. 
 I'm anxious to see how the "talkies" are done. 
  I have two problems with the game. First, although you can hire people as either directors or actors 
 (among other jobs) , the directors can act and the actors can direct in movies if you choose. This 
 is fine, except there doesn't seem to be any distinction between acting skill and directing skill. 
 Not very realistic, since most directors can't act and vice versa. 
  The other problem is there's no scenarios, campaign, or random game generation. You have to start 
 in 1920 on the same lot with inexperienced actors. This is more of a compliment than a complaint, 
 because I like this game so much I want more of it!

Review:  Of course there's action! This game is one of the most addictive I've ever played. I think only 
 the Red Alert series had me glued to my PC more.
  
  I've yet to spend time with the custom script editor, but it looks fantastic. I can think of a 
 million scripts I'd love to make into my own little movies, and luckily it seems like the editor 
 takes most of the hardwork out of producing them.
  
  Custom movies aside, the gameplay of The Movies is fantastic. I find myself actually getting annoyed 
 with my little thespian chums. They're so demanding! "I want a makeover", "I want a raise", "I 
 want... I want..." - aaarrggh!!
  
  You have to buy this game though. It's top of my game collection for sure right now.

Review:  I am a PC gamer since many years, maybe too many years. I think I have seen everything on a PC, 
 new graphics and music impress me for two seconds, not more.
  The Movies idea intrigued me, I read about it here and somewhere else on the net. It intrigued 
 me so I waited for the release of the version in my language and run to buy it.
  I use to "waste" hours with CIV IV and Football Manager, but I never spent seven hours in a row 
 (from 11 PM to 6 AM) with a game!
  
  The Movies made the miracle (or the disaster, I had to work the morning after) , and did it with 
 a few peculiar aspects
  
  funny idea
  easy gameplay
  fast learning curve
  funny voices and comments
  good graphics
  
  like all the great games, The Movies is easy 
 to learn and hard to dominate. Let a few years pass and you'll find yourself immersed in so many 
 problems, like drunk stars, bad screenplays, decaying buildings and lowering budget.
  
  The game speed is actually breathtaking, there are so many things to do that you cannot follow 
 everything. The first thing to "cut" is for sure the advanced screenplay phase.
  The advanced screenplay allow you to improve already-built screenplays or write your own from scratch. 
 It is a great idea, time freezes when you do that, but your mind is so fulfilled with all the pending 
 tasks that you will not want to do even that. Another thing you will not do anymore after a few 
 years is to follow the shooting phase. Going there you may adjust at you will every sequence of 
 the movie, but you will probably not be in the mood to do it.
  
  The most complicated and funniest aspect to follow is the management of the stars. These bastards, 
 after a couple of movies, start consideringthemselves as gods on earth, and will want more money, 
 a trailer, a new look and even some people to be their entourage. This steal money and time. You 
 must do it (or fire them) or they will go under stress and start acting badly, and being food and/or 
 alcohol addicted. When this happens, you are forced to send them to a rehabilitation center, losing 
 them for about one year.
  The movie rating depend on so many factors: screenplay, fame of the artists, relationships among 
 them, good and new sets, innovation and a number of other aspects. Making a good movie bring fame 
 and money to you. The game is structured in "levels". As soon you reach a milestone, a few more 
 addictions will be unblocked, bringing new actions into the game.
  Every five years a ceremony is set to give prizes to the various studios. Winning prizes allow 
 you to live better until the next ceremony
  
  In conclusion, I could hardly imagine to find a game that is MORE addictive than my beloved Civilization, 
 but that's it. I must be brought to the rehabilitation center ASAP, 'cos I'm The Movies addicted 
 already!

Review:  The game is quite enjoyable, although not all it aspires to be. It's not difficult at all, but 
 at the same time very addicting to play. Making movies is very easy, and the results can be hilarious, 
 if a little confusing. The management aspect is really the main part of the game, but it feels 
 intuitive most of the time. However, it can be frustrating trying to keep your stars on task; they 
 tend to wander off and get drunk in between filming every scene.
  
  One thing I do wish had been included would have been for the game-generated scripts (you find 
 yourself mostly using these) to come with subtitle diaglogue. As it is, they're all just mumbles 
 and so you have no idea what is happening.
  
  My only complaint is that the game does not work with an SLi setup. This may just be my cards - 
 2 7800 gtx - but the game freezes unless SLi is turned off. Other than that, the game runs pretty 
 well.

Review:  "Ok... ACTION!" Words you'll start to live by when you play The Movies. I went into this game expecting 
 something a lot different then what i got which made me a little dissapointed. Though after playing 
 for a while i started to realize that the motto "Time flies when you're having fun." is so true. 
 The Movies has a great turn to it and it plays out beautifully though granted it has its flaws 
 just like any game but you'll soon forget them.
  
  The gameplay is actually just the same as The Sims, hence the title similarities. You still have 
 the little toolbar in the corner that expands with what you select. It's fairly easy to navigate 
 the screen especially when you have the little star helper that, very noticeably, sparkles when 
 you get something new or when it's trying to tell you what to do. There really isn't any bad factors 
 that tie into the gameplay of The Movies so i can't really talk to much about it.
  
  The graphics aren't really awesome but they do look nice at least so they didn't drop the ball 
 like in most games that don't focus on graphics. When you're zoomed out looking at the birds eye 
 view the characters tend to look angular and choppy. Though when it comes time to do a movie and 
 you're all zoomed in it all goes away. Which actually makes you wonder why they couldn't keep it 
 like that.
  
  The sound in this game is pretty good it catches all the ambient sounds that you'd hear in the 
 time era you're in (20's, 30's, 40's, etc.) . Though the downside is that the music also ties into 
 the time era so you'll slowly start to have plans of slitting your wrists after a bit. Though its 
 easy to ignore, hence they made a "Music Volume" slide bar in the option menu.
  
  Now that i've went through all of the categories i'll start telling you a little more about the 
 game. The Movies is basically just like Sim City only you're just concentrated on your own studio, 
 not everybodies studio. Which in your mind might take a load off of your mind though it doesn't. 
 At first you won't have a problem and might find it a bit slow but the farther in the game you 
 get the faster it goes. You start out in the 1920's and once you hit the 1950's you tend to get 
 a little behind and clustered at what needs to be done. Trying to keep your directors and your 
 actors all happy and working well all the while trying to keep your studio up to date, clean and 
 also working well tends to take a toll on your nerves. Now i know everybody is gonna go into this 
 game and be all happy about making their own movies and putting their own little twists and what-not 
 into a movie. Though the grim reality of it is that you don't have complete control over your movies 
 until about the mid 1930's. When you do finally get complete control they throw it all at you in 
 one big cluster that you get really confused and lost and end up making a horrible movie that nobody 
 is gonna like. The good thing is that there's a tutorial for the script making job, the bad thing 
 is that it could take you 3 years to make a script and get the hang of how everything works. Though 
 even with the bad job they did on the script making part of it you can still tell your people to 
 do computer made scripts and tweak the scenes a little bit by moving slide bars that decide the 
 mood of the person/scene, how they get shot and with what, whether its a slap or an all out brawl, 
 etc.. Which makes it a little more fun because the right slide of the bar could make or break the 
 scene and enough broken scenes and the movie is a bust. On the other hand enough good scenes could 
 have it climbing the charts to number one. Even though i was pretty bummed about the horrible job 
 of script making and the freedom they said you'd have i am still drawn to this game but the fun 
 of tweaking each scene and trying to win awards with my movies and putting my own stars in my studios. 
 
  
  So to anyone wondering whether to buy this game or not, go ahead just make sure you're buying it 
 for the right reason. Though it's a little dissapointing it a great game and a lot of fun to play 
 and is quiet challenging at times. The first time you'll get your award you'll cheer for yourself. 
 So have your people call my people and we'll set up a meeting, but until then go make me some money 
 star.

Review:  This is one of my favorite games for the PC of 2005... and one of the top 5 ever. In reality, this 
 game is in fact 2 games: A tycoon type game, and a movie-making game. Both are highly addictive 
 and very fun to use.
  
  First off is the tycoon part of the game. It works the same as Roller Coaster Tycoon and things 
 of that nature. You make a studio, progress through the years, and try to become the number 1 studio 
 of all time. As you progress through time, new technologies and events happen, such as (*gasp*) 
 color film, better sound quality. Events such as World War 2 and the rise of communism play a big 
 part in this game, as each event raises public interest in a certain type of movie. If you make 
 that type of movie, you'll make much more money in the box office. 
  
  In the tycoon mode, you have to manage "wannabes" that want to work at one of your studio's jobs: 
 Star, Director, Extra, Janitor, Builder, Crew, and Script Writer. People will line outside the 
 corresponding building and wait for you to put them to work. Some people have complained about 
 the few number of applicants, but I never had this problem. While there is a limited number, it's 
 only reasonable - if you could hire an unlimited number of workers, the game would lose any challenge 
 it has. Making movies in tycoon mode is as easy as getting a writer to make you a script, assigning 
 actors/director/etc., and waiting for it to be filmed. Through all this, you have to manage star's 
 moods, which can be a little bit of a hassle, but let's face it - Stars in real life are a hassle 
 anyways. Because of how hard it is to manage the stars, you should not make too many but that's 
 not a problem as you will only want at maximum 2 or 3 movies filming at once - it gets way too 
 tedious to have more then that filming. Anyways, the tycoon mode is very fun, easy at times, hard 
 at others, but very rewarding, as you MUST play through story (tycoon) mode in order to unlock 
 better/more props for the regular movie making mode in Sandbox Mode.
  
  Lastly is movie making. This is an extremely powerful tool in itself. There are tons of scenes 
 in The Movies, mixed in with several different sets and different mood sliders to make the movies 
 you can make "limited only by your imagination." I believe this is true, as the first movie I made 
 I was "wow'ed" by the enormous amount of scenes and customizations available. It is very easy to 
 make a movie that you can show to your friends, or even upload on the internet for the view of 
 people worldwide! I find that to be very rewarding, reading comments that people leave for your 
 movies, and the good feeling you'll feel when you get good reviews, and the urge to work harder 
 if you get bad reviews. All in all, the movie making tool is extremely powerful, fun, and very 
 addictive to use.
  
  While I was playing The Movies, time flew by very fast. I got the game around 2 pm, and before 
 I knew it, it was already 1 am... few games have done that before.
  
  I would recommend this game to ANYONE remotely interested in the following: Tycoon games, Sim-like 
 games, and movie making. I think there is a part of this game for everyone, so go out and buy it!

Review:  This game IS many types of games in one. If you like tycoon games, you can play a tycoon game, 
 if you want to make movies, you can make movies!
  
  As a tycoon game, this game has it's problems, like having to babysit the actors and directors, 
 and the frustrating task of trying to film a movie when your director is trying to get drunk.
 
  
  But, the movie making part is where this game shines, and it is a bright shine. Sure it has it's 
 parameters and is a little restricting with it's preset scenes, but if your creative enough, you 
 can manage to still make your movies cool. The game does have a surprising amount of depth, even 
 though it won't appear that way at first.
  
  If you are a creative, and are more-so interested in the movie making section of this game, you 
 can't go wrong with buying it. If you are more interested in it for the tycoon section, there are 
 better tycoon games out there. 
  
  Either way the movies is an extremely fun, original, and entertaining game.
  In my opinion, well 
 worth the fifty bucks.

Review:  U might think that the title, 'the movies' might sound lame and stupid at first... although its 
 exactly the opposite. First off, the gameplay is what makes the game addictive. After half an hour 
 to and hour of playing, u suddenly get the hang of it and quickly start making money. Extremely 
 fun, and many things in the game makes it even more exciting, like the award ceremony. 
  
  Second off is the graphics, they are not that bad, but i've seen better. Next, the music and sound 
 effects are astunding, expecially what you expect from a game called the movies. 
  
  The only improvements that i would recommend are some options for mangement, like a map that shows 
 you where you are, instead of having to press m and take u to the overall map. 
  
  Anyways, you must really have patience for this game because it will take you hours to get from 
 the 1920's, to a lot more years after that... even in fast forwards.
  
  Other than that, it was an extrodinay game, that should be announced as the game of the year in 
 my perspective.

Review:  There is really 3 games in one here. There is Movie Studio Tycoon mixed with a Movie Maker and 
 a dash of The Sims.
  
  In Movie Studio Tycoon. Its just that, laying out the studio is very important. As you progress 
 you win more and more awards. Just trying to get your stars and your movies as high as possible 
 on the charts is a good time.
  
  In "The Sims" version in the game, you take care of the stars mood. Meaning they have wants and 
 needs and their happiness is completely related to the quality of the movie they are in.
  
  And then there is Movie Maker. It is laid out VERY well. It is difficult some times to find exactly 
 what you need, but their still are plenty of options that keep you wanting more. Then in post production, 
 you can edit your film, add voice, add subtitles, and add music. Then Share it with the rest of 
 the world on-line and watch what other have made and have people review your film.
  
  And the best part..... ITS ALL TIED INTO ONE MODE!

Review:  If you like The Sims your going to love this game. The Sims finally has some competition. You get 
 your money worth out of this game. Actionvision has a hit on it's hands here. The two year development 
 of this game was worth the wait. You control everything from salaries to hair styles and sets. 
 I just want to see what the expansion pack is going to look like. It would be worth it to buy the 
 DVD version for the custom costumes and other goodies. I like the idea of making movies and then 
 up loading it to internet to get the worlds opinion. Now anybody can make JIBJAB cartoons. Overall 
 you can't go wrong with this game. I

Review:  Fun for the first few hours but then the novelty wears off and you find yourself playing only here 
 and there.. i played 10 hours made 10 movies, 2 original and the scenes aren't so great but still 
 you have fun. stars seem to get upset without giving you a reason as to why, i'ts like you have 
 to figure it out. eventually you just play when you're bored or want to pass time. i admit when 
 i do play even though I've lost semi interest, you play for an hour or two. The scroll is very 
 annoying, not being able to see a map rather than just looking for the building you want scrolling 
 back and forth up and down..

Review:  To anybody who has ever wanted to shoot their own movies, this game is the perfect solution to 
 the million dollar problem. As it would probably cost you close to a million to shoot and release 
 your own movie to the theatres. Well now you can do all that in the comfort of your own home. 
 
  
  I have been wanting a movies game, ever since the early 90's when spielberg came out with this 
 crummy movies game. I have been urning for one ever since. Peter M. solved my problem and after 
 2 years of waiting here we are. 
  
  I have not been disappointed a bit, well maybe a little bit, but its like a grain of sand on the 
 beaches of the world compared to what I have waited for, well for a very long time. The game can 
 be frustrating when your buildings are falling apart, but that is already mentioned in gamspots 
 review. But other then that you can setup and shoot your own movies, and even add dialogue and 
 music and yes it works perfectly. GREAT JOB LIONHEAD!

Review:  I haven't been playing this game for too long, but there's a LOT to do in here. The graphics and 
 sound are great, though there is a lot to manage in the game itself. Keeping talent happy, keeping 
 your studios cutting-edge, etc., can be a bit of a pain, but I'm still learning the game. Seems 
 like once I master everything, it will be even more fun. The movie making part of the game is immersive, 
 and you could spend hours just tinkering with that mode alone. But I like the standard game, competing 
 against other studios, going to awards ceremonies, etc. Just a great, fun game all around. Not 
 perfect, but a very good game. Strongly recommended.

Review:  The Movies is a new release by Lionhead Studios.
  
  This game is pretty damn awesome, You start in the 1920's and work your way up to modern times. 
 Your actors age over time, as do your sets.
  
  The included Star Maker program is pretty great on its own, as you can make your actor/talent look 
 like whatever you want him/her to look like, you can even choose what age they are, from 18 to 
 65.
  
  It takes an awful long time for you to begin raking in the big bucks. It almost seems like you're 
 playing for hours and hours before you make a decent movie and make it big, but the outcome of 
 playing for long periods of time is rewarding. The Movies makes you feel like you are really running 
 a big time movie company.
  
  Graphically, The Movies looks great. The default settings are great the way they are, but you can 
 set the resolution from 800x600 to 1280x1024, change the color depth and graphical detail. 
  
  I haven't actually been able to hear the game because my sound card is not working, but i have 
 heard from numerous people that the Audio is pretty good. I have been told that the Actors/Talent 
 sound like the Sims. I hope they don't because i don't really like the simmish talk. =P
  
  The tutorials are pretty good also, they teach you the basics of gameplay and how to make movies 
 like a pro.
  
  This game has great value to it, you can keep coming back for more and not get bored. The Sandbox 
 feature is by far the best feature in this game, as you can go at your own pace, have lots of money 
 and it will keep you coming back. In the hours upon hours that i have spent playing this game, 
 i would say that this game should be played by everyone that loves Simulation/Strategy games. 
 
  
  Oh, i almost forgot about you being able to create your own movies, put your own dialogue in them.. 
 even put your own voice. You can also upload them on the Lionhead website for other fans of the 
 game to watch your masterpiece. I haven't really been able to create a great epic blockbuster yet, 
 but i am working it. ;)
  
  Thanks For Reading.

Review:  If you have ever wanted to take control of a movie studio and try to make movies then this game 
 is for you. The presentation of the game is pretty good allowing anyone that can click a mouse 
 play the game. I like how they give you hints on the things you can do with the objects you have 
 selected. The graphics are really good and give off that Sims 2 like vibe which isn't bad unless 
 you hate the Sims. I like the management aspect of the game and I would have probably bought the 
 game with just that. But the big suprise with this game is the fact that you can make movies (with 
 a little patience of course) . They have dozens of pre canned screens and the interface for getting 
 everything just right is really easy to do. With that being said if you want to do everything yourself 
 as far as making movies please save the 50 bucks and get yourself a camera. But if you are patient 
 and talented you can get some really good stuff out of the movie maker. You also can upload movies 
 to the internet to have other see your masterpiece. Great game if you like managing stuff or have 
 a creative side.

Review:  This Game is a tycoon game, no more, no less. If you want a tycoon game it is Ok, graphics look 
 alright, nothing special and gameplay is like every sim/tycoon game before it. If that is what 
 you want this game is for you. 
  
  The reason I am so disappointed is becuase of the ads stating "make your own movie" "control everything". 
 You pick the actors, place the prebuild studio buildings on the lot, pick a director and say go. 
 The computer makes the movie with no input from you. You can go back and "edit" meaning change 
 characters and backgrounds but you cannot control the motions, movements, disalog, etc...
  
  Then you take your "MOVIE" and save it and upload it for others to see, which will be about 
 the same as everyones elses except for background and actor. I was excepting a game that allowed 
 you to control the movements, backgrounds etc.... 
  
  I think it has reviewed so high is that it is a decent tycoon game, and for some reason a lot of 
 people like tycoon games....
  
  I consider this 50 bucks lost.........

Review:  This is the most unique game to come along in a long time. Someone spent time thinking and designing 
 this bad boy. What I like about The Movies is that its a strategy and creative film making outlet 
 all in one, the only thing that limits you is your imagination. Another nice feature is the fact 
 that you can save in WMV format, this can allow you to manipulate the movie in Windows Movie Maker. 
 I am an amateur film maker and for a long time I wanted to make a computer generated film, now 
 thanks to The Movies I can do just that and play an interesting, fun strategy game. I put this 
 one right up there with Classic Strategy games like Age of Empires, Starcraft etc. Well done Lionhead, 
 you have a winner on your hands. Now I can't wait to see what you do with the add-ons, or even 
 better The Movies Sequel (The Movies 2) . Great work! Well done!

Review:  A much anticipated game, The Movies attempts to put you in control of an old movie studio, giving 
 you the opportunity to make movies and try to make it big in Hollywood. The game mode starts you 
 in the 1920's and progresses from there, with new technologies and buildings coming available as 
 the timeline progresses. A pretty standard business sim, like all the others out there... but with 
 a strong twist. In this game, you actually get to make movies.
  
  The sim side of things is a fun game. You have to manage your stars (who can get stressed and bored 
 and do things you don't want them to) , hire help in the form of extras and crew, and actually produce 
 scripts of various sorts to film on sets you make. In the background, you have to respond to the 
 public needs and wants as far as movie genres go and research new filming technology to stay ahead 
 of your competition. You can see how well your movies, stars, and actual studio are doing at any 
 time by checking your ratings. In addition, there is an awards show every 5 years, and winning 
 awards actually gives you real bonuses for game play.
  
  In order to be successful, you have to juggle your stars' needs with a shooting schedule, keep 
 films in the works at all times, keep your sets and buildings maintained... there's a lot to do, 
 but it never gets bogged down. You don't have to micromanage to the point of exhaustion, but you 
 do have to keep up with things. Neglect the lot, and you will lose status.
  
  As fun as that is, the real interesting twist comes in making your own movies. Either as a script 
 you make for filming in the management game, or while playing in sandbox mode, you can construct 
 your own scripts and film them, using actors and scenes, costumes and sets, all to make your masterpieces. 
 This is where the unique aspect of the game shows. The editing tools for this are strong and robust. 
 There is a learning curve here, but it's not too rough on the experienced gamer, and there are 
 excellent tutorials provided to help you with it. Once you have filmed your epic, you can export 
 it to a playable file for posting, and even upload it to Lionhead's community site.
  
  On the bad side, the movie making has a limited number of possible scenes, so filming can get repetitive. 
 There are scenes that would seem to be very logical that are somehow missing, and others that don't 
 look to have much use. The manipulation of props in the scenes is very limited, you can usually 
 only select from a very small list for most scenes. Action scenes in particular are limited, in 
 my opinion.
  
  This is a good game, and can be a lot of fun. the graphics are good, and the sound is excellent. 
 It runs smoothly on a strictly mid level machine. The script writing feature is fun and certainly 
 unique, but has some big weaknesses that could stand to be fixed. As long as you are flexible and 
 willing to make compromises on your movie making ideals, you should have a good time of it.

Review:  I was a late-comer to the pre-release fandom for The Movies and didnt have to wait as long a some, 
 still it was almost unbearable, rather like waiting for Christmas to arrive so I could open my 
 presents. But the wait is over and I am happy with the game.
  
  The amount of on-screen information to absorb is the greatest obstacle to enjoyment in the game. 
 Trying to figure out what my stars want and satisfy their desires is made all the more difficult 
 by the thin instruction manual included in the game. I am certain that some will say, Go buy 
 the Strategy Guide! but I believe that for the price tag, Lionhead could had included at least 
 a .pdf file with a more robust manual. Sid Meiers was able to, why not Lionhead?
  
  The movie making process is enjoyable with enough variants in costumes and sets to avoid feeling 
 too repetitive. The advanced movie-making mode helps to alleviate this but tends to distract from 
 the pure business management focus of the game. Most will enjoy the diversion, it is fun after 
 all, but I find that spending too much time in the writing process means the rest of the studio 
 goes to hell in a hand basket. Hey! Just like real life!
  
  Scripting movies in the advanced movie-making mode is limited by the canned nature of the scenes 
 available but this is a tradeoff that one must accept for playability sake. Some have expressed 
 disappointment but this is a business simulation. The movie-making ability is a nice add-on. Anyone 
 who wants unrestricted ability to direct virtual actors ought to skip this game and go straight 
 to 3D graphic design programs.
  
  I havent tried the editing software yet but if I ever get the desire to publish my movies, I will 
 probably export the movie to a more expensive, professional editing software. This is not a lick 
 on Lionhead. They should be commended to putting so much into the game.
  
  I look forward to many enjoyable hours playing this gameif I ever get past the steep learning 
 curve.

  Battle Studios

Review:  The game is just awsome, you have 2 basic modes of play; The normal way where you strive to build 
 a studio and have to so all the hard stuff or you can fire up Sandbox mode where you can concentrate 
 on making a cool movie that you want to without having to worry about things like unhappy stars 
 or bad reviews.
  Excellent varity of sets and options help highlight this game and its fresh approach to gaming, 
 make horror to sci-fi its all there. A few things mar a perfect scoring game though; There is no 
 dragging and dropping items like trees cars and other things to make your studio look nice while 
 the game is paused.. so if your looking to shift things around to make room you have to grab a builder 
 and put him on the move option while the game is ticking away, can cause valuable time loss when 
 trying to correct some lot design problems to make space for a movie you have to construct a set 
 for. Also this causes some issues when trying to construct upgraded trailers for stars.. would be 
 easier to be able to drag and drop while paused. The star icons on the left side would have been 
 nicer if instead of minimizing it would have allowed you to scroll down or change to a second page.. or 
 organize them into Male stars, female stars, directors and so on to reduce screen clutter. Character 
 graphics should have been a little better but they are still good enough to not impact the game 
 greatly
  Custom movie making shines in this game, you ever wanted to make a movie nows your chance... though 
 it can be limited at times restricting what kind of scenes you can make but overall a good game 
 that stands out above most releases over the last few months

Review:  The long anticipated and hyped game, The Movies, has finally premiered. And this is an instant 
 blockbuster. Movies gives you tons of tools to make all kinds of movies yourself. Or if you just 
 want to focus on running the studio you can leave the writing and acting up to your staff. The 
 game starts in the silent film era and goes all the way to modern movie making. There are dozens 
 of sets, actions, props, etc. to craft whatever you can imagine. You also have the ability to tweak 
 the movie in subtle ways. Not only do you need to crank out box office gold but you must keep you 
 stars happy. You can hire stars from rival studios or take a nobody and mold them into the toast 
 of the town. Stars can be made over to just about any specification, just make sure they approve. 
 Information is easily accessible and help pop-ups are as plentiful as you want. Obviously there 
 are some limitations to movie creation with some props/sets used over and over. Despite these limitations 
 this a great game and good for anyone who wants to try their hands at machinima.

Review:  For those of you who love some strategy in a game, The Movies is an excellent choice. Often, I 
 find tycoon games lacking in depth and find them very repetitive. This game, up to now, has offered 
 a lot of variety in its gameplay. Of course, if you don't like making movies and putting some effort 
 into it, this might not be a game for you, as a big chunck of that depth will not appeal to you. 
 The game has a good way of introducing you to your first studio, with a lady voice explaining you 
 the basics. I like the way how they incorporated the tutorial in the actual building of your lot 
 from scratch, as I personally am not too fond of seperate tutorials. So, essentially, the learning 
 curve is short.
  
  The graphics are good, but especially the soundtrack is top notch and fits the era in which you 
 are playing very well. The gameplay can sometimes slow down a little, but, you can always press 
 the fast forward button.
  
  As for the sandbox mode, I was somewhat disappointed to find that it is not really sandbox, for 
 example, you start out in 1950. If you're hoping to skip the tycoon part of the game and just start 
 making a movie with all the options available, well, that's not possible it seems.
  
  This game, if you like it, will consume a lot of your time, and it will be time in which you will 
 have had a good time. If you only play counterstrike, you might not enjoy this one, but if you 
 are into things like Rome Total War, Civ, ... while totally not like those games, I do think you'll 
 like this one.

Review:  The movies is just one of the best games I've ever played.
  You can make your one movies and adapt anything you want.
  The graphics are good, but not as 
 good as the Sims 2.
  The game is very addictive, once I've started the game, I can't quit.
  Everybody can learn to play The Movies, even my young sister.
  
  I would recommend The Movies, 
 to everyone who liked playing or stills likes to play The Sims (2) or games like Rollercoaster 
 Tycoon.
  
  This is my first written review, I hope anyone likes it :P
  It's a little bit short, but I don't have that much time.

Review:  I remeber a year ago when I saw The Movies being in production. It was awesome, getting to make 
 your own movies? Kick ass, along with making your own actors, directors, scenes, dialouge, they 
 couldn't go wrong! But they did.
  
  The idea of the movies is better on paper then it is in play. I'll get to the "core" part of the 
 game. Making movies, these "hundreads of possiblies" is false. There are around 200 scenes to choose 
 from, which is great and everything but when 100 of them are basically the same thing or just flat 
 out suck, there's no point. FOr instance for every scene there is 8 different ways for a character 
 to enter, there's only 3 different kind of fights (Acutally there's around 12, but the extra scenes 
 are basically a single punch) As for these sliders, they don't do much most of the time, either 
 if you want the scene to drag on, or not drag on. It's helpful for fights and some suspeneful things 
 but you'll find out you don't use it that much. Lionhead studios obviously didn't think ahead, 
 unless if they wanted you to make 100 Sci Fi movies idenically and based on the same thing. If 
 you want an action movie, it can be 20 seconds long in order for it to make sense. There are no 
 action scenes really, comedy? Take any other scene and replace a few costumes, that's a comedy, 
 instead of a gun, it's a wooden stick. Hilarous! Not. 
  
  Romance is ok, there are litterally 80 Horror scenes and 80 Sci Fi scenes. I wonder what Lionhead 
 was going for, hmm. Not to mention there's only 6 action sets, and there's 18 horror/sci/fi. Thanks 
 a lot, jerks. If you want to make a bunch of Sci Fi movies, get this game, if you don't. Then don't. 
 Also Movies isn't even the main concept, it's the Tycoonness. Which sucks, first off you have to 
 keep your actors "happy" and by happy I mean you have to send them to rehab every few minutes, 
 you also have to over-pay all your actors, give them mansion of trailers when they suck at acting, 
 and re-invent them every 10 seconds. Great way of managing things, also movies aren't made while 
 you script them, they have to be "built" and if the actor doesn't like his mood, he'll just leave 
 the set. After playing the first 30 years of the game (Starts 1920) I haven't had any movie touch 
 the 2 and half marker. I had full stats in Comedy for director and actors, I took a long time to 
 make it, and look a 2 stared movies. Somehow everyone else can make 5 stars instantly. 
  
  The awards were a cool feature, although you'll only win one most of the time. If you try not to 
 win thsoe you'll have a better expirance, but not by much. I wanted to make a hot action thriller 
 called Die hard 17 but I can, it ruins your dreams. Most of the game you sit around waiting for 
 other people to do stuff. This game was so disappointing I wish I hadn't have bought it. 
  
  I keep wanting to end this review but I keep rembering things, like the soundtrack. The radio 
 DJs you hear, they say some funny things about the VCR and WW2 however for sound effects in the 
 game. It sounds like a balloon poping for the shotgun and the pistol is like me picking at my teeth. 
 It sucks, I'll try summing this up:
  
  Don't play this game.

Review:  Just enough handholding to get you started. Just about the time you get the hang of it they let 
 you go on your own. The awards ceremonies every five years are a welcome break from the rigors 
 of the studio (and it's an honor just to be nominated) . As time progresses it unlocks more and 
 more content to keep you interested and the ever increasing needs of your personnel and lot keep 
 you plenty busy. The highlight of course is when you receive the postproduction studio. The fun 
 just never ends once you get that! Postproduction is fairly easy and your studio is put on hold 
 while you do it (another plus) . I have yet to script and shoot a custom movie but it looks like 
 a blast!

Review:  First off, I must say I'm not a big sim fan. I played Simcity 4 and the Sims, but overall I'm more 
 of an action and FPS gamer. But this game is amazing. As many have already stated, there are really 
 two different parts to this game. The first is the Tycoon-ish (for lack of a better word) simulation 
 part of the game. This in and of itself is fascinating. The tutorial was well planned and executed, 
 and allowed me to easily jump into the basic details. Once I started the real game, I began creating 
 my own studio from scratch. This was a very fun experience, deciding where to place the buildings, 
 what kinds of sets to build, etc........ It goes much deeper than just placing buildings though. 
 You can create stars or take them away, create crew members, make your director, decide who's going 
 to be janitors or builders, give your stars makeovers, and make them do alot of things like the 
 Sims series. Working out, taking baths, relaxing, eating, and so on are all represented, but not 
 to the point of frustration. I have already created several movies during the "sim" part of the 
 game. I believe the game gives you more control of filming a movie during sim mode than the original 
 review by gamespot indicates. You can adjust the actors emotions during filming. Granted, this 
 is not the full control you have during sandbox mode, but it is worth noting. In fact, I have been 
 so wrapped up with just the sim portion of the game, I haven't even messed with the sandbox mode. 
 Judging by what others have said about sandbox mode I can't wait to get started creating my own 
 masterpieces from scratch. If you are debating about getting this game or not, then don't hesitate 
 any longer. I definitely believe it lives up to all the expectations it had. If you enjoy playing 
 a truly great game, then you'll love The Movies.

Review:  The Movies is a fun simulation game like SimCity or Rollercoaster but with much more depth. There 
 are many different things to do within the game and you can modify your game play to fit youtr 
 individual goals.
  
  The only concrete criticism of the game is that in order to enjoy all of the goodies in sandbox 
 mode you must play the game and unlock them first. However after playing the game for a couple 
 of hours, it quickly grows on you as well as give you a chance to learn the controls.
  
  Overall, the game is a good buy especially for those who enjoy simulation games . Plus the extra 
 movie making feature gives it a creative edge and greatly increases the replay value. 
  
  Definately Worth buying!

Review:  Alright I will make this brief and to the point! The game is awesome. 
  
  Graphics
  
  There decent. Nothing like F. E. A. R, but maybe just shy above The Sims 2!! 
  
  Sound
  
  
 The audio is what you make it. Yeah you can import your voice and own music. A little glitchy, 
 but it works. Probably will need a patch in the future. 
  
  Annoyances
  
  The micro management of the stars, directors and other works is the most annoying part of the game. 
 Especially if your playing the game mode. Almost every movie you do will have someone drunk, eating 
 disorder, alcohol problem or throwing a flat out tantrum. I had to stop production twice.
  
  You have to play the game mode to unlock other buildings and sets to play in sandbox mode. 
 Even the post production lot must be unlock.
  
  Now I know I said alot of negative things just now, but the game is awesome there is a lot to unlock. 
 Even though the annoyances are there it balances out, because it makes the game a challenge. I 
 am currently in the year of 1942, I still haven't won an award. Maybe I suck or something, I don't 
 care really, cuz learning to play the game is fun.
  
  The Great part of the game to me is the emotional the character express. It not real I know, but 
 god's it funny. I think Lionhead and PM did a great job re-creating the movie exprience in The 
 Movies Game.

Review:  When I first heard of 'The Movies' I thought it was going to be another dismal tycoon game... I 
 was wrong...
  
  When I decided to try out the game, I was surprised, literally... I didn't know it could reach 
 my level of expectations, but it did. 'The Movies' offers an in-depth story mode with the freedom 
 to do anything. You can be the director, producer, writer, actor/actress, even a lighting guy... 
 sand box mode is awesome, as you have limitless resources and options. You choose your own actors/actresses, 
 who to direct/produce, and the genre of the film you are making.
  
  To put it short: 'The Movies' = Great game!!.... Get it!

Review:  Possibly the best thing about The Movies is that it contains many types of video games in 1 package. 
 Not only that, but it also lets focus only on 1 if you want. If you would rather play the more 
 Tycoon-ish portion of the game you could do story mode. If you would rather Make movies more-written 
 by your writers or yourself- you could do sand box mode which is like a free mode. You can select 
 your actors and make cool movies without being hounded for time and you would a have a practically 
 limitless budget. 
  In conclusion: You should get this game!
