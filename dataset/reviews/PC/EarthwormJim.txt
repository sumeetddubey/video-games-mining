It's a video game, it's a cartoon, it's a toy, it's a lunch box, and now it's a PC CD-ROM game. 
 

 It's a video game, it's a cartoon, it's a toy, it's a lunch box, and now it's a PC CD-ROM game. 
 In under two years Earthworm Jim has made the evolutionary circle complete by returning to its 
 roots, the computer, where Shiny entertainment first breathed (programming) life into this lovable, 
 sardonic, super-powered nematode for their cartridge game. Now Activision has brought that same 
 fast-paced, side-scrolling action game to the PC with more levels, more weapons, and a chance to 
 trick-out your work area with a Jim desktop theme that plugs into Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95. 
   

 Like The Simpsons, this animated character traverses the terrain between slapstick humor and social 
 commentaryyou could even call it subversive. With the same mastery that ported Pitfall: The 
 Mayan Adventure from a cartridge game to a PC game, Activision has done justice to Jim with a righteous 
 conversion.  

 The keyboard serves as a decent controller for this side-scrolling game, but to skillfully dodge 
 and shoot the biggest bosses you'll want to play this one with a gamepad. The game is Windows 95 
 native, so it integrates smoothly into your desktop and there's no installation. Now all Activision 
 has to do is convert the rest of my favorite SNES and Genesis games to PC, and I'll be completely 
 content.

Review:  Earthworm Jim is a side scrolling shooter that has a little bit of Castlevania with a cartoony 
 twist. The story is that an Earthworm named Jim has heard the princess named What's her name (that's 
 seriusly her name) has been kidnapped. So Jim has to go find her during all these missions such 
 as a garbage dump, a few space races, a hellish planet, and a lot more others. The game features 
 a lot of humor the whole way through, making it a very hilarious experience for comedy fans.
  
  What I liked about this game is that the controls are tight. Beautiful 2D graphics. Hilarious 
 comedy through the whole game. A brilliant comedy game overall.
  
  The only thing I didn't like about this game is that the "what the heck" mission is almost impossible 
 to pass.
  
  Overall, Earthworm Jim is one of the best comedy games ever. Even with great shooter results.

Review:  Earth worm Jim is a game at a very high standard it is highly addictive, great graphics, good story 
 line great game but this is my first earth worm Jim game so I had no standards to put it up with 
 but I made my own and it surpassed it very easily. This is some of the reasons why earth worm Jim 
 was such a successful game and not some thing gotten out of the dumpster.
  
  In earth worm Jim you must jump, attack, deaf ET enemies and what kind of villains do you face 
 in the game a garbage bin. How long would it take the creator to make that boss? Earth worm Jim 
 is really fun because you run around shooting random things. That was just the first level bring 
 on some more.
  
  what a game it is earth worm Jim a guy who has guns and attacks bins what a game. if you like those 
 sort of games buy this game and thank me. thank you for reading

Review:  As I wandered the store aisles, dreary in the absence of my Xbox 360 which is in Texas being "repaired" 
 as I type, I saw Jim the Jem on the bottom shelf on clearance for $1.66. Why not? This coupled 
 with Roller Coaster Tycoon are enough to hold me until the highly anticipated arrival of my fixed 
 Xbox 360 in around a week. So I bought it, hoping for the best.
  
  Soon after purchase, i realized the box said that it was for Windows '95 and '98. Great. I have 
 XP, will it even work? Biting my lip, i headed home and hoped for the best. I popped it in, and 
 to my surprise, it worked! No installation, just plug-n-play! Awesome!
  
  After situating myself with the controls, I began to play. Lots of distinguished worlds to fight 
 through, some funny stuff mixed in, this was my kind of game. It's a shooter/side scroller action 
 adventure, which basically means if you play games you'll like it. However, some of the game's 
 puzzles and dead ends will undoubtedly lead to frustration and you will have to be patient or you'll 
 get fed up quickly.
  
  There are options to change the difficulty, which is nice, the game saves by itself, and the game 
 feels well polished for such an aged title. That's when i noticed it had joystick support. I doubtfully 
 plugged in my Xbox 360 wired controller... ta daa! It worked! Not just worked.. it worked well. 
 The only thing is that you can't assign the triggers to anything but using the face buttons and 
 joysticks felt natural and smooth.
  
  As a well-aged title, Earthworm Jim is a fun game that is likely very cheap if available at all, 
 and is therefore guaranteed to be worth your money. So if you want a distraction from all the technical 
 jibber-jabber of modern games, pick up Earthworm Jim to get a taste of your long-lost classic gaming 
 days. You won't regret it.

Review:  This cam with a PC magazine that I used to get years ago and to be honest it was one of the only 
 two good games I got with it. Now I had played the classic Earthworm Jim 2 before this game and 
 well this was a little disappointing but I had to take the fact that this game came out first into 
 consideration. The crazy story casts you as Jim a once normal earthworm that had a super-suit land 
 on his head and caused him to gain super powers and a big red gun. Jim has heard the galactic crisis 
 that Princess Whats-Her-Name has been kidnapped by her sister Queen Slug-For-A-Butt (and that is 
 the shortened version) to stop her taking control of the galaxy. Along the way you meet some of 
 the most interesting enemies like Bob the Goldfish (seriously he is just a Goldfish) , Professor 
 Monkey-For-A-Head and Pys-Crow. This game does take time to complete due to the controls mainly 
 but they do not really get frustrating. The cartoon graphics are great for this game although they 
 could have been vamped up a bit. The sounds are great and the music is good. The game is not too 
 long if you adapt to the keyboard but can take you sometime if you struggle with PC hardware. Earthworm 
 Jim is a classic in its own right but there isn't enough ti sustain a decent amount of playtime.

Review:  Earthworm Jim has been an old time favorite for snes and sega genesis owners, back in time; this 
 was one of the few action platform games that offer to the gamer hours of entertainment, high quality 
 graphics and game play along with some of the best game music Ive heard in ages.
  
  Lets talk about the graphics. The graphics might not be crystal clear, I think they look better 
 on the Super Nintendo version, but it gets the job done wonderfully, youll still enjoy the cartoon 
 like animation and characters, I think this is some of the finest animation we have seen in 2D 
 action games.
  
  The game play is easy and fun, staying closer to the cart version, each level is different and 
 youll be quite satisfied with this variation, as each level gets wackier and funnier.
  
  If you played the original Super Nintendo version like me, youll find this enhanced revision has 
 2 new levels for us to enjoy.
  
  As you make your way to the end, each level gets enabled on the main menu after you beat it, giving 
 the player the option to start where he/she left.
  
  The music along with the sound effects are some of the best I have heard since, each music track 
 complements perfectly each of the levels, we get from rock, techno, pop and sometimes classical. 
 You can even listen to the tracks in any CD player, thats a plus I enjoy a lot.
  
  Finally, Id say this is the best version of old Earthworm Jim game; I enjoyed each one of the 
 levels, including the new ones, the way the levels flow is awesome, and the CD music is a highlight, 
 Id definitely recommend this game to any 2D Action games lover, is a must.

Review:  It's been awhile since i played this game, but when i did, it's awesome..
  yes it's been awhile, but it's a good game for those people so really have an OLD computer, it's 
 one of the games i grew up playing, and it's good, not to easy either, pretty fun actually. At 
 the time, the graphics were very well done, and the gameplay was funny and fun to play, even for 
 younger kids. It's an enertaining game, with the worm that says some pretty funny things!. However, 
 it may be hard to find in stores these days, but you never know.
