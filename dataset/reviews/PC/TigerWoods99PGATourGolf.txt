:::Review:::
The plain-vanilla power-ball control interface of PGA Tour Pro has been spiced up a little with 
 some extra and welcome functionality. 

 Tiger Woods 99 is the most recent incarnation of EA Sports' long-standing PGA Tour line of golf 
 sims. For a couple years, in between Links 386 and Links LS, PGA Tour was the only serious golf 
 game out there. It had decent ball dynamics, an important license that allowed you to play against 
 real tour pros, and some excellent graphic and camera features. That's why last year's PGA Tour 
 Pro was such a disappointment. You can read my review , but suffice to say it had problems in both 
 control and graphical elements.  

 Some of these problems have been carried forth into Tiger Woods 99, some have been resolved, and 
 new ones have cropped up. There's no question, however, that it's an improvement over PGA Tour 
 Pro in many areas. The big noise here, of course, is the superexpensive Tiger Woods license, which 
 means Tiger is everywhere they can possible squeeze him. They've done everything but put his face 
 on the ball. The other news is the support for hardware acceleration, which is currently unique 
 to Tiger Woods 99.  

 Just what does it mean to be the "first and only game with real-time 3D acceleration," as EA claims? 
 Visually, this appears to be little more than PGA Tour Pro with your hardware card managing the 
 textures, and not doing a terribly good job at it either. No machine can run it at the highest 
 detail and 16-bit color without serious, serious chop. With levels set about medium and at 8-bit, 
 the action is a bit smoother, enabling the game to really show its strength at managing diverse 
 camera angles. The camera can be zoomed just about anywhere over the course, giving us some of 
 the first decent "real-time" movement through a golf course. During shots, TV-like cutting gives 
 the action a dynamic feel. The announcements are even largely appropriate, such as "This putt cuts 
 a little to the right." So far so good.  

 However, some egregious problems have remained from the last PGA Tour game. Objects are appallingly 
 flat and poorly integrated. Trees look like cardboard cutouts. The water has the same improperly 
 matched colors between the still, distant water and the moving, close water. It looks awful. The 
 hardware support smoothes textures but doesn't properly handle blurring on distant textures, resulting 
 in sudden patchwork shifts from clear grass to blurred grass. The video of the pros is generally 
 decent, but like the objects, not always properly integrated into the terrain.   

 Ball dynamics and gameplay remain strong. The plain-vanilla power-ball control interface of PGA 
 Tour Pro has been spiced up a little with some extra and welcome functionality, such as trajectory 
 arrows and an auto-shot setup that creates low- or high-risk shots. The weird club mismanagement 
 and resetting nuisances have also been fixed. The only real issue with the gameplay itself is that 
 the penalty for power-hitting shots seems substantially less. Is this because Tiger fans will expect 
 to clobber the ball every time? There's even a ridiculous graphics effect for when Tiger really 
 nails one: Lighting strikes Tiger and electrifies him, while a booming voice of God shouts "TIIIIIGERRRRRRR 
 SHOOOOOTTTTT!!!" Yoiks!  

 The rest of the standard EA Sports features are in place and effective. Online play is some of the 
 strongest on the market, with player matching and tournaments with an actual cash purse. Three 
 courses (Pebble Beach, Sawgrass, Summerlin) are included, and plenty of others are available as 
 add-ons from previous PGA Tour games. An extra CD contains five older courses that can be manually 
 copied, and some information on the PGA Tour. Seven other pros (Love, Kite, Stadler, Janzen, O'Meara, 
 Faxon, and Jacobsin) are included along with Tiger, and you can play as or with all of them. The 
 music is loud and annoying, and the video a little too in-your-face. Certain shots trigger a "Tiger 
 Tips" button that allows you to get in-game tips from Tiger. The video on this isn't very sharp, 
 and the voice sync is a bit off. More to the point, while Tiger is a fine player with a unique 
 game, as a teacher he's the pits. All the Tiger Tips are rather pointless, each going something 
 like this: "Blah blah blah, and hit it as hard as you can." Uh, right, Tiger.  

 EA Sports knows how to make a good golf game. It's almost back on top with Tiger Woods 99, but those 
 lingering and amateurish graphic flaws keep it down.

Review:  The putting is absolutely horrible - makes the whole game unbearable. There are a few hot spots 
 but others that are poorly done - like the simple act of customizing your character - which fricken 
 button/arrow to you hit when the cursor is where -- how the heck can they botch even this. Doesn't 
 anyone play-test stuff anymore. Production values are worthless - if the game play is poor, throwing 
 a 100 courses at is doesn't help. I can't believe Tiger let his name be put to this and the we-say, 
 they-say values are so high. Rent it for a day before buying - you'll be glad you saved yourself 
 the pain!
