:::Review:::
This is an awesome experience whose completion feels a little like finishing a long novel that actually 
 makes you think. Despite the new bells and whistles (and temporal distortion matrices and cloaking 
 devices) , fans of the original Journeyman Project won't have any trouble getting into this hipper, 
 larger sequel, a three CD-ROM set. In Buried in Time's bizarre opening sequence, the player is 
 visited by a panicked future self (!) handing off a man-portable time-jump suit before he is carted 
 off by his fellow Time Officers, and the story picks up with the player framed for altering history. 
 The only way to clear your good name is to once again muck about in time, both past and future. 
 The biggest new gizmo in the new Journeyman is "Arthur," a neural-net artificial intelligence chip 
 which acts as gameplay advisor, educational commentator (this is one of the few games I've seen 
 in years that's managed to slip in a little historical by-the-way without actively annoying me) 
 and wisecracking sidekick. Arthur's advice runs simultaneously with commands executed in exploration 
 modeand not as a separate functionso this virtual pal truly is useful rather than irritating. 
 Players can elicit comments from Arthur which may or may not be of value, and if the player's clue 
 factor erodes completely, he or she can cave in and ask for "help. If you're a lazy gamer, 
 don't even bother with Adventure modeyou'll just hurt yourself. Instead, play 
 "Walkthrough" and enjoy the cinematic feat here. This is an awesome experience whose completion 
 feels a little like finishing a long novel that actually makes you think.

Review:  I have owned this game since 1997 and I've always loved the game. I actually found out how the 
 game was made. I went to www. larf. org and one of the performers, The Duelists, worked on the Journey 
 man project. I asked him how did he participate in the game exactly. He told me that he was one 
 of the actors who played Richard's men. He also told me how the game was able to be so visually 
 impressive. 
  
  Taken from Guestbook post from Duelists. com website:
  My Post:
  I noticed in one of your Bios that you participated in the PC game Buried in Time, The Journeyman 
 Project II. I just happen to own the game and I was curious as to how you partcipated in the game. 
 I love the game its a great mental challenge.

  Chris, 
  
  In the game, we're all the soldiers, knights and guards in Richard's Army. All shot on Bluescreen, 
 and digitized into the game. If I'm not mistaken, B. I. T. was the first game to do this. 
  
  I found that to be very interesting. I hope this was somewhat informative. As to the game itself, 
 it is very problem solving oriented and I've owned the game since '97 and I have yet to beat the 
 game on Adventure mode. I have beaten it once on Walk through mode. Its a tough game, but fun nonetheless.
