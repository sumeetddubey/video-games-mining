:::Review:::
Warlords III is the kind of game that drives you to play through the night to the break of dawn 
 and leaves you feeling good about it the next day. 

 The third chapter in the acclaimed Warlords fantasy strategy series is a textbook case of superb 
 design and implementation. This is the sort of game you won't just play for mere weeks, but one 
 which contains months, possibly years, of grueling strategy and tactics. It's that good.  

 Aesthetically, Warlords III is nothing out of the ordinary though it is a dramatic improvement over 
 its predecessors. The high-resolution bird's-eye-view world maps look realistic and attractive 
 enough, while each of the dozens of military units are imaginative and readily distinguishable. 
 Dispersed throughout the game are beautifully hand-painted scenes depicting each troop type, castle, 
 character, place, and special event. These contribute immensely to the feel of Warlords III, offering 
 that extra sense of detail and involvement, which is nonexistent in most strategy games. Sound 
 effects are sparse but effective, while the music score (composed by Steven Fawkner who designed 
 the game) adds just the right touch of symphonic grandeur.  

 And Warlords III is grand indeed - you will wage war across massive countrysides, with dozens of 
 keeps and castles marking the territories of up to eight separate armies. A friendly tutorial explains 
 the basics of the game in minutes though only time and practice will reveal its nuances. You and 
 your opponents take turns moving your armies, grouping as many as eight units into a single stack. 
 Claiming castles allows you to rally more units, with stronger ones requiring several more turns 
 to produce and demanding more gold for their services. While your instinct may be to produce as 
 many high-level troops as possible, only the proper balance between lesser and greater units will 
 allow you to effectively assault the enemy while adequately defending your perimeter from possible 
 counterattack. An intricate but easy-to-use diplomacy system lets you join forces against a common 
 foe, or find yourself battling against multiple enemies united to do you in.  

 If Warlords III is to be faulted, one would have to cite the abusive unit vectoring system which 
 allows troops to move between friendly castles in exactly two turns. This transfer is invisible, 
 an inexplicable teleport that transcends mountains, water, everything. Though vectoring speeds 
 up gameplay, it downplays factors like positional advantage.  

 The key players in your wars are the hero units who will offer their assistance from time to time 
 for a steep price. These specialized soldiers are stronger and faster than the rest, and can benefit 
 other units with their adept leadership skills. Heroes also gain experience, allowing you to augment 
 their outstanding abilities even further. Some heroes wield magic, which doesn't play a critical 
 role in the game but can sway a battle at that decisive moment. Combat is completely non-interactive, 
 and resolves itself in seconds through a series of hidden number crunches. While those accustomed 
 to real-time strategy games will yearn for more control over their battles, the emphasis in Warlords 
 III is not so much on the execution of a fight as on the preparation. The combat system may seem 
 alarming in its simplicity, but with so many factors at work that determine the odds of success, 
 it is, in reality, not simple at all: Everything, from individual unit strength to agility and 
 morale, plays a role in the outcome.  

 There are countless ways to engage in Warlords III. An epic story-driven campaign as well as stand-alone 
 and randomly-generated scenarios will challenge the solo player, who will encounter a calculating 
 and vicious computer opponent fully prepared to win at any cost. And if you're looking to clash 
 wits with your friends, you may do so via modem or network or even over e-mail. Best of all, you 
 can wage war against strangers from around the world on Red Orb's specialized Internet server. 
 Warlords III is well geared to multiplayer competition, as you can set turn time limits and even 
 resolve turns simultaneously with the opponent - requiring you to work quickly when in close quarters. 
 The options and variables go on and on, as you can construct a custom army, define specific victory 
 conditions, and much more.  

 Warlords III is an intelligent, exciting game - the kind that drives you to play through the night 
 to the break of dawn and leaves you feeling good about it the next day. Its timeless design is 
 easy to learn though robust and sophisticated enough to offer immense depth, limited only perhaps 
 by your cunning. Even its visuals, though not at once striking, are destined to withstand the years. 
 If you long for an intelligent strategy game that offers endless hours of nail-biting tension and 
 terrific warfare, then you cannot go wrong with Warlords III.

Review:  Finally got this game working under Windows XP (the secret was to add -wincursor to the shortcut) 
 and it brought back a flood of memories. What a great game, even after 10 years. Very addictive 
 gamepley that has just been sucking the hours away again. Highly under-appreciated, this game is 
 a timeless classic and if you can get it from somewhere, and you like strategy games, grab it!!! 
 You wont be disappointed. This game is excluded from the old Warlords fan sites, in favor of the 
 later Dark Lords Rising , which is a pity, since it is easily the equal of that game. I believe 
 this is because of the mistaken belief that it doesn't run under Windows XP, but with just a little 
 tweaking, it can be made to run perfectly well!

Review:  This game is a sucker. No, it doesnt suck. It sucks time away like a vacumn. For a long time. 
 
  
  The single player game is inspired, the multiplay (Hotseat and net) is varied and fun. There are 
 dozens of different factions, each with their own history. The game map is colorful, easy on the 
 eyes, and even eaiser to manipulate. 
  
  The RPG portion is put in brilliantly, with enough items, levels, and characters to keep your attention 
 for a long time. 
  
  Simply: Its a masterpiece, and a game that I wish everyone would go out and enjoy. We owe it that 
 much.
