:::Review:::
Duels is definitely aimed at newbies to Magic and, as a stand-alone product, it's a damn fine translation 
 of the card game. 

 As the television ads for the card-based version of Magic: The Gathering proclaim, "All you need 
 is a brain, a deck, and a friend." Until the release of the multiplayer ManaLink patch in early 
 February, MicroProse had provided plenty of decks but didn't allow players to compete against human 
 opponents. Fans of the series were beginning to think the designers at MicroProse were the ones 
 lacking brains. Duels of the Planeswalkers, the latest installment in MicroProse's Magic series, 
 combines ManaLink, over 480 cards, and the Magic game engine - but the original release of Magic: 
 The Gathering for the PC was over a year ago, and fans may find this add-on to be too little, too 
 late.  

 In giving credit where credit is due, Duels is not solely an expansion pack. All of the elements 
 found in the original Magic package can be found in Duels: 403 cards from the Fourth Edition set, 
 two modes of gameplay (duel and campaign) , a video-enhanced tutorial, faithful card art reproduction, 
 and a plethora of pre-built decks. Duels even includes several interface enhancements and tournament 
 options &amp; agrave; la Spells of the Ancients, as well as 80 new cards from Legends and The Dark 
 sets.   

 All of this makes Duels more of a rerelease than an add-on, but those of you who bought Magic when 
 it hit the streets may be a bit peeved at MicroProse. Duels is the product that should have been 
 released last year: a full-featured Magic engine that allows mano-a-mano duels via the Internet. 
 Even if you own Magic and Spells of the Ancients and you only want the 80 new cards to enhance 
 your decks (ManaLink is available to registered users for free via the Internet) , you have to shell 
 out another $30 for Duels ($45 street price with a $15 rebate) . This means that dedicated players 
 who have been with the series since the beginning will have to pay approximately $120 to play multiplayer 
 Magic via the Internet with all of the available cards, giving way to the real magic behind both 
 the card and computer-based version of Magic: its ability to mysteriously suck money from your 
 pocket.  

 Duels is definitely aimed at newbies to Magic and, as a stand-alone product, it's a damn fine translation 
 of the card game. However, for players who have been behind MicroProse's Magic from the beginning, 
 Duels is almost useless and really just serves to piss you off. If you're new to Magic and are 
 interested in the possibility of playing against your friends over the Internet or via a LAN, modem, 
 or direct connection, you may want to check out Duels. But for you old-school Magic players out 
 there, Duels of the Planeswalkers is simply not worth the price.

Review:  This CCG converted game features 1-to-1 death-matches with self-built deck of 4th edition cards 
 (old-school!) with Alpha rares such as Black Lotus, the Moxes, Time Walk, etc... versus a computer 
 AI using over a dozen pre-built decks. There are also 80 over new cards in this expansion, including 
 Legends (Storm Seeker!) and The Dark sets!
  
  The other main attraction would be the single-player campaign of Shandalar, where you are in a 
 little RPG world with your character (you can dress him/her up with some crazy clothings and wigs!) 
 running around with Magic cards and defeating evil monsters with their pouches of Magic cards too! 
 Haha! That's quite silly but it's addictive fun.
  
  Curiously, there are a few cards unique to the pc game with a new ability, the 'random' effect, 
 in which the card (enchantment/creature) with this ability can cast random effects generated by 
 the computer on your chosen targets. Weird, but a cool supplement. I spent the most time on Shandalar 
 with replays of different color sets. It's something like the opposite of the World of Warcraft 
 pc game turning into a collectible card game. Definitely a must for Magic fans, even if you don't 
 really play pc games.
