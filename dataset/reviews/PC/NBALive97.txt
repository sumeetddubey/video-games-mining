:::Review:::
NBA Live 97 is still a blast to play and features almost all of your pro players and teams. 

 
 You should be happy to hear that NBA Live 97 is an improvement over the last version. - and you 
 should not be surprised when you hear that there are no major improvements in gameplay. Better 
 graphics and audio are always welcome, but my repeated gripe when I review sports games - and I 
 won't stop until I'm finally satisfied - is always in AI and gameplay.  

 The graphics and player animations - like in EA's hockey counterpart, NHL 97 - are stunning, and 
 they achieve a level of visual realism that should make any sports game fan eagerly reach for a 
 gamepad. Although the game's feel is similar to the very first one in the series, NBA Live 95, 
 the players have a greater variety of moves and appearances. In fact, the texture mapping of their 
 faces and heads closely resembles the look of the actual players. Other noticeable, and well-done, 
 physical characteristics are height, but not so much girth, and skin tone and hair color and style. 
 (Although they all appear to have the correct visage, I look forward to the day when their expressions 
 change, too.)  

 The audio is topnotch, particularly the sound effects, as has been the case in EA Sports games for 
 some years. My favorite effect is the sound of the ball making contact with the basket. Whether 
 swishing through the hoop with nothing but net or bouncing high off the rim after an errant shot 
 or thunderously pounding from a gorilla dunk, the sound is close to the real thing and adds an 
 element of satisfaction or disappointment to every shot. EA Sports also always does a terrific 
 job with the sounds of its interface and the music played off the court - kudos to their whole 
 audio crew.  

 EA Sports may arguably be the best publisher of electronic sports titles, but there are still simple 
 problems that never get corrected from one year to the next, and NBA Live 97 is no exception. If 
 you prefer to play an Arcade style game, many of its problems won't apply. But if you're like me 
 and prefer to play in Simulation and turn off Auto anything, you'll soon find that performing your 
 coaching duties is a pain, making a twelve-minutes-per-quarter game take much longer to finish. 

 The main reason for this is that the coaching screens are too inaccessible. At the start of every 
 game, you have to pause and exit the court screen before the tip-off because you are not given 
 the opportunity to enter the coaching screens beforehand. The same occurs after each quarter. You 
 are forced to return to the court screen without the ability to make coaching changes before the 
 game restarts, so you must pause and exit before the ball is inbound or wait until the next stoppage 
 of play. To return to the court screen, the program must reload the data almost entirely. On a 
 low-end system with a slower CD-ROM drive this can take as long as a full minute. It certainly 
 makes you hesitate and think about merely making one substitution.   

 On the court, the gameplay itself has its share of problems, some of which have existed since '95. 
 For one, the difficulty levels are still not right. Rookie is too easy, Starter is probably the 
 best, and All-Star is too hard. The main reason is that defense is still too ineffective. Even 
 at the All-Star level the game is a scoring fest. I know about the NBA's reputation for playing 
 defense, but geez! At the Starter level, the star players for each opposing team are just too unstoppable 
 no matter what you try to do. If you want to see what I mean, play Miami and see how well you can 
 shut down Mourning. Passes appeared to travel right through my defensive players, and big Zo would 
 just shoot and make an impossible hook shot from fifteen feet out - right over my triple team. 
 A strategy I've found that sometimes works is to do your best to dunk it on every possession and 
 then send a guard to press and try for steals as the opposing player brings the ball up the floor. 
 This should give you more shot opportunities than the opposition, and if you dunk a lot you won't 
 have to worry about not converting for some points each time. Many of the gameplay problems could 
 probably be blamed on an average AI: Computer-controlled players are often out of place and guarding 
 the wrong guy.   

 For all of its problems, NBA Live 97 is still a blast to play and features almost all of your pro 
 players and teams. If that's not enough, you can always create your own players and teams. Michael 
 Jordan and Charles Barkley are in the game sans photo and name (they are just called "Player") , 
 which is better than them missing all together. Many of the rosters are incomplete as well, but 
 you can fix those as you please by customizing them. For great basketball and NBA excitement on 
 you PC, NBA Live is still the way to go. But we'll hope that it continues to get better and better.

Review:  NBA Live is a game of the very famous NBA Live series, know for the good games it produces. So 
 it comes with NBA Live 97 which does many improvements over last year's version of Live.
  
  There is a significant improvement in the AI of the game, as the players won't just sit and watch, 
 instead they are moving all time. The court and what comes along is overally very good.
  
  What scrathes in the game is the interfaces of the menus which are hostile to the new players, 
 and difficult to get rid of even for the sophmores. Another minor problem of the game is, that 
 even with a stunning AI, some players in the defence won't do anything to stop you, perhaps due 
 to inapropriate difficulty levels, which are not placed on a balanced scale.
  
  The visuals of the game are very good, taking into consideration the age of this game. There are 
 also good sound effects and inspiring menus music.
  
  NBA Live 97 is not the experience of a lifetime, but it still deserves to be played.

Review:  I am going to write this review for the PS1 because that is what i have this game for. This game 
 all around is not all that great. The AI is way off and even tho the graphics were ok back then, 
 they are not good now. In this game you can shoot three pointers all day with shaq and make stupid 
 retarded fullcourt passes. They only reason I played this game was so my friends and I could make 
 fun of it. 
  
  But on the good side, I might have been making fun of the game, but deep down inside somewhere 
 I was having a blast! This game is made for people who have open personalities and are willing 
 to play a game outside of the box. 
  
  Overall just a good game.
