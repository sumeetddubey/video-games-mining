How uninspired. 

 It is a sad moment when you realize, before you even begin writing a review, that the predominant 
 expression for everything you feel about the game in question is not a word, but the prefix "un." 
 Unfortunately for Byron Preiss, the publisher of the un-dynamic duo release - They Call Me... The 
 Skul and The Suit, this review almost never happened. The only reason that the pair is reviewed 
 here is because to let it go unreviewed would mean forgiving the publishers of their larger offense: 
 that their entire recent lineup of games is practically unpublishable. Which means that They Call 
 Me... The Skul and The Suit must bear the unlucky brunt of both a critical review of its own unremarkable 
 existence, and a critical review of Byron Preiss in general, for ever letting these unforgivably 
 unplayable games out the door in the first place.  

 The first title that upset anyone in the GameSpot office who suffered through its flawed, system-crashing 
 installation was Westworld 2000. With its terribly acted cut scenes, unappealing graphics, and 
 dreary gameplay, Westworld 2000 is merely a hoax that hopes to capture gamers' attention by boasting 
 that it is "based on Michael Crichton's classic science-fiction film." Perhaps Crichton and company 
 merely licensed the rights to the "Westworld" name and premise but cared not to have any say in 
 what would be done with the work. Pity that. At any rate, nobody in the office wanted to review 
 the game.  

 The second strike against (or for, if you are) Byron Preiss was Spiderman: The Sinister Six, whose 
 one-dimensional script and impeded controls were so unappealing that only after threats from the 
 Reviews Editor did someone finally agree to review it. It wasn't until "playing" They Call Me... The 
 Skul and The Suit that the aforementioned offense of Byron Preiss' general disregard for publishing 
 playable games fully gelled. Like its weak siblings, They Call Me... The Skul and The Suit looks 
 horrible. As if the low-res graphics, sloppy animation, and uneventful sound and music weren't 
 unbearable enough, there's the ungameplay itself. Unless, that is, your idea of action is an unstoppable 
 conveyor-belt stream of easy-to-shoot targets that roll by for an unbearably long time. Scroll, 
 shoot, scroll, shoot, an unending stream of sorry scenarios that elicit resentment rather than 
 reward. The only real difference between the two games is that They Call Me... The Skul is a vertical 
 scroller, and The Suit is a horizontal scroller. How uninspired.  

 Which leads back to the game's publisher. How, Byron Preiss, did you even come upon these games? 
 Did you pick them up at some bad-games garage sale, where the unintellectual property rights to 
 piles of  games are sold by the pound? Each of these games, it 
 is worth mentioning, could have been something. Indeed, you nabbed Marvel's immensely popular character 
 Spiderman - but then tangled him in a web of poor game design. You reeled in a ripe Crichton property 
 - but shot yourself in the foot with what is unquestionably the worst 3-D interpretation released 
 this year. And with They Call Me... The Skul and The Suit, you took a promising tie-in -"Virtual 
 Comics" - and achieved... virtually nothing. That, in the end, is utterly unacceptable.  

 We're supposed to pay $40 apiece for these so-called games? When such notable titles as Command 
 &amp; Conquer: Red Alert, Quake, Wing Commander IV, and Abuse, to name a few, share the same shelf 
 space and compete for our cash? Take note of these games, Byron Preiss. Play them. Study them. 
 Learn from them. Then go out and create a few good games of your own. Please. We promise we'll 
 give them our undivided attention.

Review:  I Remember My Father Buying This Game On Boxing Day Eight Years Ago.
  I Inserted The Disk, Installed It, And Opened Up The Folder. 
  I Looked Around, Found The Virtual 
 Comic, And Read Through It. It Was OK. Pretty Interesting And The Music Wasn't Bad, Although It 
 Was Way Too Similar To The "Spiderman" Series. I Then Clicked On Something Else In The Folder. 
 It Brought Up A Black Window, And It Appeared To Be Some Sort Of Action-Shooter/Scroller. It Took 
 Me A While To Realize This Was The Game!
  Boy Was I Disappointed. It Had No Uniqueness To It Than The Other Clones Of It's Kind Over The 
 Internet. Only Difference Was That This Cost 20 Dollars And The Graphics Weren't Even As Good As 
 The Others For It's Time! 
  A Horrible Waste Of TIme, I Had 90% More Fun Reading The Comic That Came With The Game.
  
  
 
  
  If You Ever See This "Game", Make Sure You Skip It.
  No Matter What.
  It'll Save Money, Time, And The Trouble Of Uninstalling It, Which By The Way Takes Forever.
