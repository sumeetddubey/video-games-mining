:::Review:::
The game features an excellent and robust spell system, but gameplay itself is chaotic, messy, and 
 simple to a fault. 

 This fantasy real-time strategy game from the makers of X-COM was originally going to be released 
 in the US under the title Duel: The Mage Wars. It's a good thing Mythos decided to stick with the 
 European name, because Magic &amp; Mayhem is a much more fitting moniker. The game features an 
 excellent and robust spell system, but gameplay itself is chaotic, messy, and simple to a fault. 
 It can be fun at times, but some very problematic design issues mar the experience.  

 Magic &amp; Mayhem is not a real-time strategy game in the traditional sense. It is in real time, 
 and it is a strategy game, but because of its lack of base building, the game falls closer on the 
 spectrum to something like Myth: The Fallen Lords. Even this comparison isn't entirely accurate, 
 however, as Magic &amp; Mayhem lacks that game's tactical depth. Magic &amp; Mayhem also implements 
 a character-building system that would be right at home in an RPG, and this is certainly the highlight. 

 You control Cornelius, a young mage who has been apprenticed to his uncle, Lucan. Arriving at his 
 home to begin your studies, you find that Lucan has vanished. This sets you off on your adventure, 
 traveling through various realms searching for Lucan and, after finding him, trying to stop the 
 greater evils that possess the land. It's pretty typical fantasy fare, though there is a good element 
 of suspense that keeps things interesting, at least on the story side. Mythos has also included 
 a hodgepodge of references to famous myths and legends (Greek heroes, the Holy Grail) that seem 
 to serve little purpose other than giving the designers an easy way to name artifacts and enemies. 

 Each mission is roughly the same: Your goal is to kill an opposing wizard. To do so, you have a 
 selection of spells at your disposal, including the usual offensive (fireballs, lightning bolts, 
 summoned weapons) and defensive (armor, healing) requisites. But the majority of Cornelius' spells 
 summon monsters, which work as your troops. You can summon unicorns, manticores, elf archers, and 
 many, many more. You must have a supply of mana to cast spells, and mana can be obtained through 
 mana sprites (small, colorful power-ups your mage can acquire) or through places of power, which 
 are pedestals that slowly generate mana as long as your mage or one of your units stands on them. 
 Once you defeat your rival, a portal opens, and you move on to the next region.  

 As you progress through regions, Cornelius gains experience points based on how many tasks you accomplish 
 in each area. These tasks are generally simple, such as talking to a character (usually unavoidable) 
 or finding a special item. Experience points can be used to increase Cornelius' mana, his health, 
 the number of monsters he can command at one time, or to grant him additional talismans.   

 Talismans are part of the game's spell system. During some levels, Cornelius will find spell ingredients. 
 These ingredients are placed into talismans to create spells. Talismans fall into three categories: 
 chaos, neutral, and law. Each ingredient can be used to create three different spells, depending 
 on which type of talisman the ingredient is put into. For instance, the ingredient alectorus will 
 give you the ability to summon a hellhound, a crocodile, or a phoenix, depending on which type 
 of talisman you place it into. The ingredients can be moved around at will between missions, allowing 
 for many different spell combinations throughout the course of a game.  

 While the spell system is unique and intriguing, the missions generally descend into a simple click 
 fest. You summon some monsters. You throw them at your rival. They die. Repeat until victorious. 
 What's worse is that your biggest enemy in the game is not your rival - it's your allies. These 
 are characters that you encounter along the way and who will travel with you for a while, theoretically 
 aiding you in your quest. Problem is, they often do more harm than good. They take your mana sprites. 
 They throw their own creatures on places of power. They wander around the map aimlessly, then scream 
 for help when they get into trouble. And if they die, you lose. You have absolutely no control 
 over them, so your only hope is to set some of your own troops to guard them and hope for the best. 

 Magic &amp; Mayhem features claymation-like animation that looks good in theory but gets a bit choppy 
 and too often crosses the line from whimsical to silly. The sound effects add to the game's levity 
 but are a bit scarce. The music is quite good and, along with the spell system, is the game's highlight. 

 With more control over your allies, more interesting combat, or just a bit more depth, Magic &amp; 
 Mayhem would have been a better game. But with its numerous problems, it's just a fairly fun single-player 
 game and an only slightly better multiplayer game. The missions are just too repetitive, and the 
 mechanics just too unrefined, to be intriguing for more than a short spell.

Review:  Not very many people appreciate this game, but this was seriously my favorite game from the age 
 of 8 to 13 (when I discovered Starcraft) . I must have played through this game 5 or 6 times. I 
 still think it is one of the most original and immersive games ever. It is also in my humble opinion 
 the earliest and most successful combination of RTS and RPG to date.
  
  There are a lot of commendable things about Magic and Mayhem. The diversity of spells and creatures 
 you can cast/summon is definitely a plus. The plot is wacky but very enjoyable. The soundtrack 
 is honestly in my list of top 10 gaming soundtracks of all time. Most importantly battles are very 
 engaging and there is something epic about being able to summon a hoard of skeletons and watching 
 them take down a dragon.
  
  By the way a few reviewers commented on the lack of depth in the strategy of this game. After playing 
 it as much as I have I assure you this is not true. If you look hard enough you'll find a lot of 
 underlying synergy between your spells and creatures, and each mission in the campaign has various 
 approaches to completing it.

Review:  This is one of the few games that I've ever completed within two days of getting it. And, if you 
 think I'm jobless - no, it's because this game with it's cute storyline really grows on you. It 
 may be a simple game compared with the likes of Oblivion but it stands out simply because it has 
 an amazing storyline, and the characters have a certain personality that rounds up this game well. 
 The character of Cornelius grows on you real fast (pun unintended because Cornelius does age rapidly!!)
 
  
  Good:
  
  The graphics are quite great, and matches up really well with its contemporaries. 
  
  The plot 
 is really great, and keeps drawing you in for another level.
  The gameplay is actually pretty good, despite what the gamespot review says. Yes, it's a lot of 
 clicks involved but you do need to be on your toes. 
  
  
  This isn't a game where you need to play ten times to finish a level. And that's a serious bonus 
 when you're just out to have a good time without having to pluck your hair bald.
  
  
  A variety of useful artifacts helps spice things up and helps you out of tight spots, especially 
 at the end of the game.
  
  Bad:
  
  The recursive map which somehows allows you to go from bottom to top seems bizarre!

Review:  Now you don't necessarily have to play the campaign to get the best you can out of this game. Most 
 of my time was spent playing the Skirmish mode, setting different stakes, different spell points, 
 choosing different spell icons to summon different creatures and so fourth. 
  
  You can spend many hours at this game and never get tired. The only reason I ever stopped was a 
 glitch that started occurring in my game after so many hours at the skirmish mode.
  
  Now I would highly recommend at least starting the campaign as it will teach you all the things 
 you need to know to play, and you'll meet some interesting characters along the way. 
  
  This is a Classic game - not shoot em up, blood n guts, but ... classic. Check your bargain bin. 
 Well worth the 5 bucks.
