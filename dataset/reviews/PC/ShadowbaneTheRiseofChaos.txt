:::Review:::
For Shadowbane's population of player-versus-player aficionados, the expansion doesn't seem to do 
 much, nor does it do enough to compel new players to get into the game. 

  Massively multiplayer online role-playing games let you play as an adventurer exploring a persistent 
 online world with many other like-minded players. Although some critics would say that they're 
 all too much alike, for better or for worse, Wolfpack's fantasy-themed game Shadowbane is pretty 
 different. It has a clunky interface, it has dated 3D graphics, and it continues to have problems 
 with latency, which occasionally cause the game to slow to a crawl. However, of all the online 
 RPGs, it's also the most supportive of player-versus-player combat, as it lets players' characters 
 readily fight and kill each other. Perhaps as a result, most of the game's relatively small player 
 base consists of hardcore fans that are in it not for slaying dragons and rescuing princesses but 
 for honorably (and dishonorably) dueling against each others' player characters and claiming bragging 
 rights afterward. That's why the new expansion, Rise of Chaos, seems so puzzling. It introduces 
 a new player race, a few new character classes and skills, some high-level monster-hunting areas, 
 and a few miscellaneous improvements, like new graphical weather effects. These are additions that 
 might be attractive to traditional online RPG players who mostly prefer exploration, fighting computer-controlled 
 monsters, and recovering powerful weapons and armor for their characters. However, for Shadowbane's 
 population of player-versus-player aficionados, the expansion doesn't seem to do much, nor does 
 it do enough to compel new players to get into the game.  

          You can cross Shadowbane's Chaos Gate in Rise of Chaos, but you won't end up seeing many 
 things that fundamentally improve the game.     

  According to the game's background story, Shadowbane takes place in a postapocalyptic fantasy world 
 that was changed forever by the deeds of heroes and villains long past. None of the story plays 
 a role in the actual game, which lets you create a character by choosing a race, gender, character 
 class, attributes, and skills -- much like any other online RPG. Shadowbane lets you start your career 
 as part of a basic profession, and then you can "graduate" to an advanced profession, much like 
 in Mythic's Dark Age of Camelot. You gain levels by fighting monsters, and in Shadowbane you can 
 do so more quickly than in most other online RPGs (which made advancing your character surprisingly 
 enjoyable in the game's early days, when everyone was running out of town to beat on snakes and 
 spiders while chatting) .  

  However, Shadowbane is a more mature game now, and most of its players are interested in fighting 
 each other -- though the game has had numerous issues over its life that have perhaps led to its 
 low player population. Shadowbane continues to have intermittent lag problems, as well as an unintuitive 
 point-and-click interface that routinely spawns multiple windows on top of your character and obscures 
 the game's action. Furthermore, while the game lets player organizations build and lay siege to 
 castles, the sieging system continues to have issues. As a result, it's not uncommon to see very 
 few players online, depending on which server you choose. This can occasionally reduce Shadowbane 
 to a simple exercise in monster-bashing.  

  Moreover, Rise of Chaos' specific additions don't really seem to do much for the actual game. The 
 new character race, the demonic, bat-winged nephilim, can fly -- but so can the birdlike aracoix 
 race that was included in the original game. The two new classes, the doomsayer and the sentinel, 
 seem interesting enough. The former class focuses on magic spells that can weaken enemies, while 
 the latter is a holy warrior who has the ability to dispel magic and can damage demonic enemies. 
 The expansion also offers two new skills, which include darksworn, a school of magic that weakens 
 enemies, and conjurer, a school of magic that lets you summon "pet" monsters to fight at your side. 

          Rise of Chaos really doesn't add much to Shadowbane, otherwise.     

  None of these additions really add anything significant to the game, nor are they anything that 
 online RPG veterans haven't seen elsewhere in other games. The expansion's new, high-level areas 
 offer powerful new enemies to fight, and they also let characters increase in level to 65 (though 
 the game also has a "soft-level cap" that allows characters to go higher than that) . These new 
 monsters don't seem to exhibit any kind of exceptional cunning or challenge, but, instead, seem 
 more like excuses to let player characters gain their highest levels rather than anything else. 
 Otherwise, time hasn't been kind to Shadowbane. The game's graphics were dated last year, and its 
 simple textures and blocky character models and architecture don't look any better. With the exception 
 of some music that plays on certain menu screens, Shadowbane continues to be a mostly silent game 
 whose sparse audio effects mainly consist of character and enemy grunts and groans that can be 
 heard during battle or spellcasting.  

  The core game itself  does  still offer a few features that made the original Shadowbane so attractive 
 to some. Namely, there are diverse advanced character classes, and there is almost completely cutthroat 
 player-versus-player combat. However, you can get these features without the expansion, which is 
 modestly priced at $20. Aside from the extended level cap and a chance to start a new type of character, 
 though, it doesn't seem to offer Shadowbane veterans much. Essentially, Rise of Chaos' new additions 
 don't seem to have a significant impact on the core game, so if you're a Shadowbane fan, you may 
 want to think twice about ponying up for the expansion. And if you didn't like or weren't interested 
 in Shadowbane to begin with, Rise of Chaos won't do a thing to change your mind.

Review:  Having played many an RPG on the PC, going as far back as the Commedore 64, first impressions are 
 a must for me. I played the 15 day free trial, for a grand total of 20 minutes. The graphics were 
 reminisent of Baldur's Gate, which was a great game at the time of it's release. The camera chase 
 angel is terrible. I'm used to the camera being behind the character, not running along the side. 
 All in all, I don't like the game one bit, not worth the 12.95 a month subscription, which leads 
 to another complaint. Three race can't be played untill you unlock them after you pay one month's 
 bill, that's not good customer satisfaction, that greed.
