:::Review:::
All in all, Starship Titanic is an enjoyable tribute to an older era of adventure gaming. 

 For years now the adventure genre has been a stagnant place, overwhelmingly dominated by two styles. 
 At one end you have the descendants of Myst, tours through rendered locales filled with mysterious 
 gadgets and artifacts that you must learn to operate. At the other end you have the heirs of King's 
 Quest, defined by sprite-based animation and inventory-based puzzles. It's a rare occasion when 
 something innovative comes along, and games that do break from the formula - The Last Express, 
 Bioforge - are all but overlooked by the general public. In this environment, Starship Titanic 
 occupies a unique place. It isn't particularly innovative, but neither is it a Myst or a King's 
 Quest clone. Instead, it draws upon storytelling and puzzle-solving styles that originated in the 
 text adventures of old, and is a somewhat refreshing game as a result.  

 The text-adventure feeling makes logical sense. One of the creative forces behind Starship Titanic 
 (science fiction humorist Douglas Adams) developed two such games for Infocom. Those who have played 
 Adams' text adventures (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Bureaucracy) will feel right at 
 home on the Starship Titanic. The puzzles involve the same type of overly complex logic, requiring 
 you to go through mind-wrenching ordeals to accomplish the simplest of tasks. While there's nothing 
 on par with the classic Babel Fish puzzle from Hitchhiker's, the majority of the puzzles keep with 
 the same absurd spirit - such as when you must deal with a complex mechanism simply to turn on 
 the television in your cabin.  

 The text-adventure references don't end with the puzzles. The game actually includes a text parser 
 that is used for conversing with the many robots aboard the Titanic. It's not perfect (your statements 
 will often be misunderstood in unfathomable ways) , but it's a nice nod to the days of old. The 
 use of the text parser adds an element of discovery as well: The solutions to otherwise obtuse 
 puzzles will often become apparent through conversation.  

 But Starship Titanic lacks the one major element that elevated so many text adventures to classic 
 status: a story. There's a slight skeleton of a plot (you must repair a derelict starship) , but 
 apart from discovering why the Titanic is in the shape it's in, there's nothing to it. The game 
 does borrow a bit from older adventures (the moody robots bit is almost a direct lift from Steve 
 Meretzky's Stationfall) , but it doesn't create enough of a backbone to lend much purpose to your 
 actions.  

 That's not to say it isn't fun. It is certainly funny - and it's the kind of funny you'd expect 
 from such contributors. The voice acting brings the humor to life (two Monty Python veterans make 
 appearances - Terry Jones brings his talents to the annoying parrot, and John Cleese makes a particularly 
 funny appearance as a bomb) , and the graphics are good-looking, Myst-esque fare. All in all, Starship 
 Titanic is an enjoyable tribute to an older era of adventure gaming. It feels a bit empty at times, 
 but Douglas Adams fans and text-adventurers will undoubtedly be able to look past its shortcomings.

Review:  The celebrated sci-fi author of the 'Hitchhiker's Guide' series also engineered this adventure 
 game, in which your character goes on a space cruise and yearns to do nothing more than upgrade 
 the ticket to a better cabin. 
  
  Even in space, you can depend on big companies to mess things up. You are soon caught up in a massive 
 crash, which *really* makes it hard for you to find your room. Your 'onboard fun' now includes 
 trying to solve the mystery of the accident.
  
  Your character roams a massive electronic structure, searching rooms, solving puzzles and piecing 
 together conversations in order to guess the next step. It is an elaborate process and difficult 
 sometimes, but hang in there. With cranky robot servants and busted automats to contend with, how 
 can you go wrong?
  
  This is a clever and very funny game. I miss Douglas Adams. If you know his books, you'll get a 
 kick out of this adaptation as well.

Review:  Starship Titanic is an adventure game where you are in a space ship that is somewhere in space 
 and moving at very high speeds. All of the robot-staff on the ship are messed up and not doing 
 what they are suposed to. No, you do not fight them, it is just very hard to ask them questions 
 until you fix them, which is fairly early in the game.
  
  As far as gameplay goes, it is point and click, and not at all actioness. But it is still fun, 
 due mostly to the atmosphere. 
  
  The graphics are all static, but still look pretty good. The sound is excelent in everything from 
 FX to music. The music has an eerie yet relaxing sound, that you will most likely have stuck in 
 your head all day long. The sound FX mix with the picture onscreen unlike any other adventure game 
 before. Even when walking down a hallway, you can hear echoes of things going on in other parts 
 of the ship.
  
  As far as value goes, the game is well worth the $10 I paid for it at TJMAXX when I was like eight.
 
  
  Starship Titanic is like no other game out there. If you are looking for a break from blowing crap 
 up and blood and gore, or if you are a fan of such games as Myst or Aura, this game is for you.
