:::Review:::
Ho Chi Minh Trails makes up for its total lack of depth with the visceral thrill of raw, senseless 
 destruction. 

  A huge number of World War II games have been released over the last few years, but just when it 
 was starting to feel like overkill, game developers began shifting more toward the Vietnam War 
 for inspiration. We've enjoyed high-profile games like Vietcong and Battlefield Vietnam, and there 
 are a host of other 'Nam games already in the works. This new trend surely means we'll see some 
 real stinkers along with the thrillers, and Vietnam: Ho Chi Minh Trail looks like it should be 
 one of the stinkers. It doesn't exactly bode well that it's a homely looking budget game (only 
 $9.99 from the publisher's Web site) from an obscure Chinese developer. Taken for what it is, though, 
 Ho Chi Minh Trail is actually a pretty fun, if overly tough, action game.  

          One man versus an army; good thing you're armed to the teeth.     

  At first glance, 
 Ho Chi Minh Trail looks like a first-person shooter, but you quickly discover that you can't actually 
 move about. The game simply plops you down in the middle of the countryside and freezes you in 
 place, only letting you move your crosshairs with the mouse. This makes no sense, but in fairness, 
 neither do many old-school arcade games, which is what Ho Chi Minh Trail is at heart. With slight 
 variations, everything boils down to repetitive, mindless shooting where your only goal is to blast 
 everything in sight during the course of 60 levels. A handful of bland landscapes are reused across 
 multiple levels, with only the time of day or weather varying. The enemies are mostly as dumb as 
 stones as they advance right into your fire.  

  Fortunately, Ho Chi Minh Trail makes up for its total lack of depth with the visceral thrill of 
 raw, senseless destruction. As hundreds of troops (and later, vehicles) descend on you from all 
 around, you'll blast them with a host of weapons. You're armed with an M16 that you can zoom in 
 and snipe with, a minigun, a mortar, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, and a pistol that's laughably 
 superfluous in light of all the other weapons.  

  As if that arsenal weren't enough, you can also request napalm air strikes and artillery barrages 
 that you aim with a glowing crosshair. You'll want to use these strikes only on choice targets -- you 
 can call in unlimited attacks, but there's a significant delay between each one, so timing is important. 
 If you start running low on ammo for your personal weapons, you can call in a Huey for resupply. 
 (Why you don't just hop on board the Huey and fly out of there boggles the mind.) Oftentimes, the 
 chopper will get blasted to scrap before it can resupply you, which is frustrating, to say the 
 least. The game tells you that you're supposed to defend the helicopter, but that's easier said 
 than done when hundreds of enemy troops dot the surrounding fields and rice paddies.  

  Unfortunately, there are no difficulty options in this game. While the difficulty level ramps up 
 reasonably over the initial handful of levels, the game can become ridiculously hard before even 
 the 10th level. At least the weapons are better balanced than the game as a whole -- the more damage 
 one of them does, the longer it takes to spin up or reload -- and just as importantly, the weapons 
 are fun to use. It's a kick to drop mortar rounds into a crowd of enemies while air and arty strikes 
 are decimating their buddies on either side.  

          Air support at work: Napalm incinerates advancing troops.     

  Solid sound effects 
 add to the mayhem. Most weapons boast a satisfying aural punch, and the giant walls of fiery napalm 
 make a great "swoosh" when they burst high into the sky. The voice-overs, mainly radio calls for 
 support, are few and repetitive but acted well enough. The graphics, though, definitely fall into 
 the "get-what-you-pay-for" category. The graphics barely get the job done and, not to put too fine 
 a point on it, can be darn ugly. Drab lighting, lame weapon models, and generic, recycled terrain 
 all give Vietnam: Ho Chi Minh Trail a woefully dated, cheap look. At least some of the death animations 
 are colorful, with hats flying off VC soldiers and napalmed men running around on fire.  

  Either way, once the action really gets going, you won't have any time to dwell on the graphics -- you'll 
 be too busy swinging your crosshairs around to blast the next batch of soldiers. That frenetic 
 pace, coupled with copious quantities of carnage, make Vietnam: Ho Chi Minh Trail a simple but 
 exciting game, at least until the sometimes-extreme difficulty wears you down.

Review:  I love FPS games. I generally try to snatch them up whenever I see one on a store shelf. Even the 
 really cheap budget ones that you know are going to be pretty bad already, but still provide at 
 least a few hours of entertainment. 
  
  Enter Vietnam: Ho Chi Minh Trail. My expectations were already low on this one, but still I was 
 looking forward to having some fun. Everything about it screamed FPS game from the screen shots 
 to the text descriptions on the box. 
  
  What was NOT mentioned was the fact that you could NOT move. Sure you could turn and look around, 
 but forget about being able to walk in any directions. What this whole game comes down to is being 
 stuck in one spot and fending off waves of enemies that come at you from all directions - ala, 
 BeachHead.
  
  Even so, the game seemed entertaining for about 5 minutes. After that it became pretty monotonous 
 and well, boring.
  
  I believe I picked this one up for $5 and even at that low price, I still felt like I got screwed. 
 This game turned out to be a major disappointment.

Review:  Oh god, where to start with this game? well to start, if you think this is a game where you move 
 around on the Ho chi minh Trail killing enemy soldiers that got a low rating for its poor gameplay 
 and lack of any real replay value, then you are wrong. It is all that, except you don't move, you 
 kill enemy vietnamese soldiers coming at you from all around you. And you pretty much shoot from 
 around you, and the result is a game that may give you raw thrill the first few plays, but will 
 get boring very quickly. The gameplay is just, well..... boring. It is not a bad experiance to 
 shoot at enemies around you with napalm and gatling guns and all that crap, but it is not engaging 
 altogether. the graphics are ok. They dipict the events around you with somewhat unrealistic detail, 
 but the result is ok. The sound is the best componant. It doesn't sound bad, and the gunfire sounds 
 pretty real. And the voice acting is good. The value is not too bad, you play this once in a while 
 just to get some thrill out of it. Overall, I don't recommend buying the game, but I didn't buy 
 it, it came with the new computer my dad bought. So for that it is not horrible, but it is not 
 worth spending your cash for.
