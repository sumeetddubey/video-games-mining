:::Review:::
This super-deep strategy game would have benefited from online multiplayer. 

  Casual games are supposed to be easy, right? Not in the case of Catan, which is one of the most 
 engrossing and complex casual games we've seen on MSN. This game is a pretty solid PC version of 
 the popular German board game Settlers of Catan, a medieval-themed exercise in resource management 
 for two to four players. The object of the game is to be the first to get to 10 points by building 
 roads, towns, and cities; strategic placement of your settlements will let you get the necessary 
 resources to win, and so can shrewd trading with your opponents. The CPU players provide adequate 
 challenge, especially on expert mode, but the lack of online multiplayer is a serious flaw in an 
 otherwise very recommendable game.

Review:  I have played the board game "Siedler" for a number of years, and was pleased to see this version 
 of the game come out. Unfortunately, the developers had little or no ambition at all to take advantages 
 this platform offers. Instead, it is a rigid simalcrum of the board game on your screen. 
  
  The human player pits off against either 2 or 3 AIs in an attempt to settle an island. To do 
 so, you need to accumulate enough of the 5 resources available, either by harvesting or trading. 
 You choose initial settlments and can expand as you harvest your resources according to a simulated 
 2d6 die roll, exactly as in the board game. 
  
  The computer version does a good job of implementing the rules, which are simple, and depicts the 
 2d board and its dice, its cards, and its icons well enough. That is not difficiult. But unfortunately, 
 that is all. 
  
  While the game prides itself in having different flavors of AI (three settings: beginner, advanced, 
 expert, and 3 types, from friendly to aggressive) , I have not been able to notice a difference 
 in any of them. The "expert" AI plays just as poorly as the beginner. 
  
  But what is really frustrating is the lack of imagination and the lack of programming. There is 
 only ONE map, a circular island, which gets old fast, and no future developments of this ancient 
 boardgame (and there were many) were implemented. Neither can one change any of the parameters 
 (such as Victory Points required, handicaps, etc.) . To make matters worse, the programming is flawed 
 and the interface exceptionally clunky: The "trade" screen is unmovable and, when open, blocks 
 off the entire board so that you cannot see any segment of the map (the "board") whatsoever, the 
 menu is accessible by bizarre logic and mouseclicks without use of keyboard shortcuts, there are 
 bizarre bugs and crashes in the tiny 2mb .exe, and after long and hard searches I have STILL not 
 been able to find out where the game stores the "save" files (even by searching my entire harddisk 
 by "last changed") .
  
  This software is just really, really poor for its price. Which is too bad, since the game behind 
 this one (Siedler) is quite decent; it must have taken a lot of effort to mess it up this badly.
