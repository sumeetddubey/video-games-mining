As was the case with the movie, the plot becomes the game's own worst enemy. 

 By and large, most games founded upon feature-length movies have fared poorly in the marketplace. 
 The reasons are fairly obvious. Tethered to a storyline that, for all intents and purposes, was 
 designed to unfold at breakneck speed or rely upon various cinematic devices to propel the plot, 
 most game translations have failed to capture the same compelling intensity and epic workmanship 
 that was expressly developed for the silver screen. And, while it's certainly difficult - but not 
 impossible - to elicit and replicate the same awe-inspiring majesty and grandiose scale of, say, 
 a Star Wars extravaganza, it's doubly hard to craft an equally respectable game from an out-and-out 
 box office flop.   

 In the case of Universal Studios' Waterworld - the highly touted, multimillion dollar bust starring 
 Kevin Costner - Interplay had strangely decided to give the project a green light and construct 
 a real-time, man-to-man combat wargame rooted in the muddled machinations of a world succumbing 
 to global warming. In the game, you assume the role of a War Chief, tasked, in brutal if methodical 
 fashion, with amassing enough hydro (fresh water) , food, weapons, and critical information to successfully 
 evade the "smokers" - a tribe of seafaring scavengers - then somehow revert our inundated world 
 to its once former glory.   

 Comprising 25 sequentially playable missions, the game actually commences just prior to the introduction 
 of Costner's forgettable "Mariner" character, gradually acquainting you with the many perils and 
 pitfalls associated with perpetual life on the high seas. Virtually all of the missions are situated 
 on man-made atolls - enormous, misbegotten shantytowns - floating, without a purpose or port of 
 call, atop the world's singularly vast ocean. If you recall from the movie, these shantytowns are 
 composed of misshapen structures, docks, and jetties, all constructed from whatever debris or abandoned, 
 seaworthy vessels could be salvaged during the supposed "Great Deluge" when the world was engulfed 
 by sea water.   

 You are assigned a small taskforce, composed of anywhere from two to fourteen men, mustered out 
 by the computer in line with the mission at hand. Squad members are issued weapons and other stores 
 as you see fit; you will typically apportion what meager weapons and ammunition are available based 
 upon each member's special abilities, combat record, and accrued inventory at the outset of each 
 mission. Team members may also pick up additional stores - health packs, stimulants, ammunition, 
 etc. - during the course of play, sometimes stripping the dead while in other instances snatching 
 objects strewn haphazardly about each atoll. Prior to mission start-up, you may also barter your 
 wares with the "trader," exchanging items of lesser consequence for weaponry and accoutrements 
 better suited for the scenario.  

 As was the case with the movie, the plot becomes the game's own worst enemy. Because the world has 
 been inundated by melted ice floes, the so-called atolls represent the only real setting for conflict. 
 Each atoll looks and feels like the previous battleground, with an occasional new outcropping here, 
 a different lever and staircase there. By the time you reach the eighth mission, you can pretty 
 much figure out for yourself how each mission has been feebly choreographed and take appropriate 
 measures long before the first shell takes flight. Moreover, there's no way to issue explicit orders 
 to each team member, such as defend or patrol a specific area. As a result, the most effective 
 battle tactic proved to be banding together every available squad member into a close-knit if unruly 
 mob, unleashing the rabble upon the enemy, then trusting that at least one man survives the ensuing 
 carnage. Not exactly my idea of how tactical warfare should be portrayed.  

 Amidst the tidal wave of fresh and innovative real-time wargames already washing up on shore, Waterworld 
 barely manages to keep its head above water. By lashing together commonplace and repetitive gameplay 
 with a tale as tall as they come, Waterworld should be cast adrift and never seen or heard from 
 again.
