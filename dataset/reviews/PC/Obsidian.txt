:::Review:::
From beginning to end, Obsidian is an entertaining, surreal romp. 

 Okay, my confession is not uncommon for most PC owners, but I'll admit that I was addicted to Myst 
 - but only for about a day. It was after this exhausting 12-hour session that Myst's seductive, 
 painterly landscapes, intriguing puzzles, and general - dare I say - Mystique began to wear on 
 me, and I had to go on with my regular lifeof playing more games. Despite the visual gymnastics 
 that Myst performed, I had to stop because I felt trapped: Here I was, caged in terminal stasis, 
 stuck in what was simply a slide-show of beautiful pictures.   

 Rocket Science's Myst-like title, Obsidian, presents a pleasant departure from the lonely inertia 
 of Myst's gameplay. Obsidian is at least as breathtakingly beautiful as Myst, if not more so. Die-hard 
 Myst fans and those unfamiliar with the mega-hit title alike will be pleased. Obsidian simply offers 
 more movement, more character interaction, more interesting puzzles, and - another crucial difference 
 - many puzzles that actually require eye-hand coordination.  

 In Obsidian, you're cast as Lilah Kerlin, a scientific engineer who, with your associate (and significant 
 other?) Max Powers, has launched Ceres, an Earth-orbiting satellite that uses patented "nanotechnology" 
 to help rescue the increasingly moribund atmosphere surrounding Earth 2066 AD. The two go on a 
 hiking trip, only to discover a mysterious chunk of black, shiny rock, which grows several feet 
 daily. By the time you enter the game, this rock - dubbed Obsidian by the unsuspecting campers 
 - has formed an enormous tower. After a little investigation, you find that Max has been sucked 
 into the tower, and as you approach the nefarious mass, you too are abducted, becoming a prisoner 
 of Obsidian.  

 Once inside Obsidian, you have to find your way out of the topsy-turvy, Escheresque Bureau room, 
 an episode in one of Lilah's nightmares that has somehow been transformed into a concrete environment 
 by the uncontrollable Ceres. Later, you encounter a huge industrialized room inhabited by a dormant 
 mechanized spider which has similarly materialized from one of Max's dreams. The environments in 
 Obsidian defy conceptual physics; expect your adventures to include walking on walls and ceilings, 
 rapping with weird TV-headed droids, and entering portals into serene deserted beaches and creepy, 
 futuristic junkyards.   

 From beginning to end, Obsidian is an entertaining, surreal romp. Playing the game, it's obvious 
 that a hell of a lot of work went into detailing the animation and scenery. I was waiting for the 
 game to run out of ideas, but in the end, Obsidian is a seemingly infinite procession of bizarre 
 chambers, each with increasingly challenging puzzles (the title boasts some 60 hours of playtime) . 
 If anything, Obsidian piqued my interest in games of Myst ilk. And that's saying something for 
 me, a gamer whose main gaming interests include bombing Russian compounds and unloading a carpenter's-memory 
 worth of nails into an unfortunate multiplayer opponent.

Review:  Everyone knows the formula. A set of bizarre worlds, almost no inventory, and lots of logic puzzles 
 equals a Myst clone. While I've played my share of such games, none has ever been as cool as Obsidian. 
 In fact, I think it tops the Myst games themselves in terms of style and quality of concept.
  
  You play a scientist named Lilah, who, along with another scientist named Max, has designed 
 an amazing new technology system to restore the environment in a future earth scenario. However, 
 while you two are taking a vacation, you discover a strange formation, a huge black crystalline 
 structure you dub Obsidian. Max goes to examine it one day and disappears. You follow after him 
 and the adventure begins.
  
  The four "worlds" you explore in Obsidian are quite novel. The first is a bureaucratic nightmare 
 of rules and procedures you must overcome via overcoming gravity in order to get more information 
 about your missing companion, the second involves repairing a giant robot spider, the third iis 
 based on the dreams of a newborn computer, and the finale, well, I'll leave that a mystery. Suffice 
 to say it's fascinating from beginning to end.
  
  The graphics, for their time, are surreal and lovely. Since it's mostly still shots, it's easy 
 to make things look really nice. There is also a great variety of environments, and none of them 
 seem cliched or uninspired.
  
  The sounds is also generally pretty great. The sound effects are spot-on, with lots of great crunching 
 metal mixed in with organic sounds to produce a funky synergy that has to be heard to be truly 
 understood. The voice acting of the two main characters is adequate, and not too much of an issue 
 since they have minimal speaking parts anyway, except for the beginning. The voice acting of all 
 the side characters, however, is much better, especially in the first area. The music is the only 
 real weakness, good in some spots, boring and a little out of place in others.
  
  Ah, but what about the puzzles? A really nice variety of puzzles are provided, some involving verbal 
 logic, others involved spatial intelligence, some requiring basic memorization, and a mix of others. 
 Overall, they are quite satisfying, as none are insanely difficult, although plenty are challenging. 
 Also, they all make pretty good sense in the context of the story, which is refreshing.
  
  Of course, this is the kind of game that you play once and then forget about. However, after beating 
 it once about three years ago, I recently played through it again and had just as much fun, as 
 I'd forgotten almost all the details. Highly, HIGHLY recommended for anyone that enjoys adventure 
 games and is looking for a hidden gem from the Myst-clone era.
