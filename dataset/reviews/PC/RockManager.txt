:::Review:::
Rock Manager compensates for its shortcomings with good music and spirited voice acting that give 
 the game a lot of personality. 

 Though it was released without any sort of fanfare, Rock Manager from DreamCatcher Interactive is 
 actually a surprisingly clever and enjoyable little game. Rock Manager is a simple strategy game 
 in which you manage different rock groups in nine different missions. You'll have to assemble a 
 band, get a contract, license an album, sell lots of copies, get good press reviews, and go on 
 world tour. The game has an annoying technical problem, it can seem a bit too limited, and it isn't 
 always clear about your objectives or what you should do next. But it compensates for these shortcomings 
 with good music and spirited voice acting that give the game a lot of personality.           Don't 
 be fooled by Rock Manager's cartoon-style characters.    

  Rock Manager is one of the most deceptive-looking budget-priced games this year. It retailed for 
 $20 at release, and its plain black box (and the cartoon character on the box's inner fold) might 
 make it seem like just another lousy management strategy game, but it isn't. Likewise, Rock Manager's 
 cheerful-looking characters -- musicians, record company executives, and rival bands -- all seem like 
 smiling, lighthearted characters from a children's Claymation show. At least until they open their 
 mouths. Much of the game's voice work is delivered by British actors (some of whom try to sound 
 like Americans) , and it's mostly very convincing, very enthusiastic, and very profane. Your smiling, 
 Gumby-esque musicians will curse profusely when they're upset at a bad gig, use expletives to describe 
 how pleased they are about their album's success, and swear casually, even when they're just making 
 conversation. Rock Manager's voice acting may surprise you the first time around, though you'll 
 probably find it suits the game quite well. The game actually has at least a few different voice 
 samples for each character in each situation -- which, along with the voice work's generally high 
 quality, makes sure that these samples don't get repetitive, at least for a while. But Rock Manager 
 is definitely not for children.   

  Otherwise, the game looks decent and sounds great. You'll play through most of Rock Manager in 
 a dimly lit city full of important buildings. You can visit recording studios, show venues, and 
 even the docks, where you can meet with a shady cloak-and-dagger "businessman." This guy can cut 
 underhanded deals for your band to give you good press or help you win an embarrassing court case. 
 You use simple point-and-click interfaces to conduct all your business, including recording a new 
 album. The game's music sounds great -- your bands will generally choose and play a single song from 
 a list of bland top-40 rock music, vacuous pop tunes, and obnoxious heavy metal songs, all of which 
 sound appropriate. Each musician you'll hire will have three different styles of play, and you 
 can experiment with these styles (and add techno-music distortions) when you're recording a demo 
 and even save the song for later use, though you'll find that the best way to sign with a record 
 label is to play it straight.   

  The fact that it rewards you for taking the most obvious approach is one of the few but sometimes 
 annoying problems in Rock Manager. As another example, in each of the game's nine missions, you'll 
 occasionally get a helpful hint about how to keep your band members happy, but no hints on how 
 to accomplish your objectives. Additionally, the game will occasionally neglect to give you the 
 opportunity to properly finish your mission. For instance, you may need to get a favorable review 
 from a press publication, but you'll never actually get reviewed, even for months of game time, 
 and you'll eventually go bankrupt and lose the mission. In addition, even though Rock Manager has 
 both standard events (like signing up with a record label) and random events (like a rival group 
 smearing your band in the papers) , these events can sometimes seem arbitrary. Sometimes you'll 
 play a great show at a club you've done extremely well at, and later, under the very same circumstances, 
 you'll have a terrible showing.           Playing shows helps your band make a name for itself. 
    

  In addition, Rock Manager has problems with its best quality: its sound. The game relies heavily 
 on CD loading -- too heavily, in fact. Since it only has 50MB and 150MB install options, Rock Manager 
 generally loads all sound -- including voice samples and music -- directly from the CD. This can lead 
 to some annoying pauses: You'll be about to hear your band's hit single or be halfway though a 
 funny quip some character is making when the entire game will grind to a halt while your CD-ROM 
 drive loads up the sample. The game should have offered some sort of full-install option that would 
 have let you load all the music and sound to your hard drive. Finally, it's unfortunate that Rock 
 Manager has what seems to be a limited repertoire of music and musicians. By the time you get to 
 the very last mission in the game, you'll be able to access all of its musicians, but there just 
 doesn't seem to be enough of them, or enough different songs to license. However, this is really 
 more of a complaint than a criticism -- the main reason you'll wish for more songs and musicians 
 is because the few that Rock Manager does have are surprisingly great. And though the game has 
 only nine missions, it'll take you some time to puzzle your way through all of them, and you'll 
 have at least some incentive to go back to the earlier ones, as you'll be able to use the musicians 
 you unlock over the course of the game in any of its levels.   

  Rock Manager is a surprising game. Its combination of cartoon-style characters and foul-mouthed 
 dialogue may shock you. But what's most surprising about Rock Manager is that it's a budget-priced 
 management game that's actually quite good.

Review:  First off this a fun game rock fans would like it and some will dislike it. I don't like a lot 
 of rock music but this game is really fun to me. You're a manager and you take control of a band 
 well you create a band and you have to make them do an album and you basically take care of everything 
 they do. 
  
  Make sure they get radio play and stuff and take them on tours around the world and stuff make 
 them as famous as you can and earn them the most money that you possibly can. Sometimes the people 
 in the band fight and argue and one time I had my drummer leave and I had to get a new one.
  
  Sometimes people will take you to court basically saying you stole someone's song. The game 
 looks good and also the sound is pretty good to you'll have a lot of tracks to choose from and 
 stuff. 
  
  Rock Manager is a very fun game so there for I recommend it to anyone cause you'll have fun playing 
 through it. I don't even really like rock music but I still find this game very fun and interesting. 
 So you need to try it.

Review:  Rock Manager is a game that some people will love, and some people will hate.
  The game puts you in control of a band and you play through the highs and lows such as recording 
 a new album or breaking up an argument within the band.
  There are a few random events in the game which add to the fun such as copyright court issues etc.
 
  The graphics are simple but they're effective for the genre of the game and look clean.
  The sound is really good, plenty of songs to record and they'll stick in your head for the rest 
 of the day!
  If you can still find this game i'd recommend giving it a try as you'll probably enjoy it, I sometimes 
 find myself installing it again.
