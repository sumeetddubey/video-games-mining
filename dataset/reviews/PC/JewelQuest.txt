:::Review:::
Jewel Quest is a strong puzzle game, but that doesn't mean you can't get by playing the online version. 
 

  At first glance, Jewel Quest appears to be another game in a very long line of Match 3 clones, 
 because you're still trying to line up various types of objects in the right way. The difference 
 here is that you're not just trying to create a certain amount of matches, although doing so will 
 help boost your score; to pass a level, every space on the board has to have had a match made on 
 it. This type of gameplay, while initially pretty boring, becomes much more interesting on the 
 later levels, where you won't be able to succeed by accidentally touching off huge chain reactions. 
 The paid version of the game features some nice bells and whistles over the free Java game, like 
 an excellent jungle-beat soundtrack and enhanced graphics -- but unless you're already a big Jewel 
 Quest fan, it may not be worth the $20 buy.

Review:  Jewel Quest is a puzzle game released for the PC in 2004. It takes place in ancient ruins, in which 
 by solving puzzles you will uncover some ancient artifacts. It is a very fun game at times, but 
 it can also be VERY frustrating.
  
  Jewel Quest plays out very much like Bejeweled, in which by swapping two gems, or "relics," as 
 they're called in this game, you make a line of three or more relics, thus removing them from the 
 board. In Jewel Quest, when you make a match of relics, the squares they occupy turn into gold. 
 When all the squares of the level are turned into gold, you win and move on to the next level.
 
  
  While this game can be very entertaining, it can also make you want to smash your monitor sometimes. 
 Many of the puzzles have very unusual shapes, several of which require some very intense acrobatics 
 to get the correct relics in position to win. However, when relics are removed from the grid, new 
 ones cascade into place And if these relics formed more matches, these would be removed as well. 
 The problem with this is that sometimes falling relics would remove the relics that I had spent 
 so much time getting into the correct position to match with a relic in a difficult place. 
  
  Although it is very had to have no more moves ever in a level, each level has a time limit. 
 If you do not turn all the squares into gold in that time interval, you lose a life and have to 
 start over from the VERY beginning. It was VERY annoying to have to restart a whole level after 
 all that hard work just because I couldn't turn one tiny little square into gold in time.
  
  The final problem is that this game seemed too generic. There are no special powerups or anything 
 to make the game more interesting. It is just straight matching relics again and again and again. 
 While there are things like buried relics, which you needed to match multiple times for it to disappear, 
 there was nothing else to add a little strategy or pizazz to the game. Although I have only finished 
 the game up to the second rank, so there might be things that I haven't gotten to yet. 
  
  Jewel Quest is a great game for casual games or fans of other puzzle games such as Bejeweled, but 
 hardcore gamers and gamers who don't have a lot of patience (and I mean A LOT) might want to pass 
 on this one.
