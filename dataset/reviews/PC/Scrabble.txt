:::Review:::
Scrabble was made for computer play. 

 Okay, I'll admit it. When I read the box that proclaimed Scrabble as "the ultimate interactive experience," 
 I was something short of impressed. I mean, I've waded through the sewers of the damned in Quake, 
 I've trampled entire dynasties into the sand in Civilization, I've even stopped an invasion from 
 the stars in X-COM! It turns out however, that even with all of my world saving skills, I still 
 had yet to face the ultimate challenge - to defeat my copy editor at Scrabble. This is not a task 
 for the faint of heart.  

 Hasbro has taken this Milton Bradley favorite and converted it beautifully into a frighteningly 
 addictive computer game. "It's Scrabble! What could they have possibly done?" you ask. Well for 
 starters, Hasbro has created the perfect Scrabble board, hung in an impossibly beautiful sky in 
 crystal clear 640x480 with a full 256 color palette. Next they added the entire Official Scrabble 
 Dictionary as a behind-the-scenes deterrent for "imaginary words" (I still swear the qlazz is a 
 breed of weasel found only in South America) . Combine this with the fact that the game sports a 
 fantastic classical soundtrack with enough variation to stay entertaining and factor in the game's 
 flexible network and Internet play modes - and you're looking at the Scrabble of tomorrow. For 
 those of you who are, ahem, a little short on friends, you'll also be interested to know that Scrabble 
 features a realistic and challenging computer opponent (believe me, on its most advanced level 
 it's pretty talented at putting words together - frankly I'm a little worried for my job if the 
 boss ever gets a look at it) .  

 Scrabble was made for computer play: The pieces don't accidentally get dumped everywhere, your buddies 
 can't make up words, and you can always remember where you put it. Even so, the fact remains that 
 no matter how picture perfect this translation is, it's still Scrabble. If you like puzzle games, 
 or you find yourself looking for something a little bit different, I can't recommend a title more 
 highly. If you're only interested in words as a way to explain how you killed your last opponent, 
 you'll find Scrabble to be just what it is - a board game on a screen.

Review:  Scrabble has been around for decades, both on table tops and on the computer. With its need for 
 a dictionary, putting the game on a computer makes sense, and greatly simplifies things. This particular 
 version is the 2nd edition of the game I've seen on a computer, and it does what you expect it 
 to.
  
  The visual aspects of the game are clean and intuitive. The sound effects are solid, and the game's 
 light lounge jazz soundtrack is pleasant and unobtrusive. Playing the game is essentially drag 
 and click. There's nothing wrong and everything right about the user interface.
  
  The main complaint I have is with the dictionary, which contains a ridiculous number of two-letter 
 words. Many of them are foreign words, which makes little sense to accept in a game that does not 
 accept longer foreign words used frequently in daily English, such as adios . Unfortunately, I 
 found no straightforward ways to update the dictionary through the game interface.
  
  If you love Scrabble, you'll like this game, especially when you have no one else to play against. 
 But this is the type of game that screams out to be retrofitted for online play, or for multi-player 
 hotseat play, to really hit its stride. It is what it is, and that's mostly a good thing.
