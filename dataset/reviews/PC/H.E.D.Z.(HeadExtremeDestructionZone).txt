:::Review:::
H. E. D. Z.'s inspired design doesn't always translate into inspiring gameplay, and while it's frequently 
 funny, it's not very fun once the novelty wears off. 

 It sounds like a type of candy or cereal aimed at '70s acid casualties, but H. E. D. Z. is actually 
 a very innovative third-person arcade shooter that takes the concepts of enemies and weapon power-ups 
 and turns them on their heads (sorry, I just had to say that) . But H. E. D. Z.'s inspired design doesn't 
 always translate into inspiring gameplay, and while it's frequently funny, it's not very fun once 
 the novelty wears off.  

 H. E. D. Z. is an acronym for Head Extreme Destruction Zone, a series of arenas where aliens engage 
 in the seemingly brutal sport of head-hunting. But they're not taking the heads of their prey and 
 putting them on display; instead, they've figured out how to acquire the powers of their victims 
 through "brain to brain contact." The heads wind up in a trophy case, all right, but only so they 
 can be pulled out and worn whenever the aliens like.  

 Playing as an alien, you start each of the cartoonlike levels with five heads in your head case; 
 at any time you can switch to any of these and use its special weapons and powers. Kill a fellow 
 H. E. D. Z. combatant, and you can grab his head and store it in a backpack - provided he doesn't 
 pick it up first, of course, and he can always do the same to you. Only five heads can be active 
 at a time, but as long as you've got enough money (it's lying all over the place) you can swap 
 heads from the head case and backpack; if you're out of cash, then you can only use the ones in 
 the head case.  

 There are 225 heads in all, so it's easy to imagine some very cool puzzles requiring you to use 
 the right combination of heads in the right sequence. Just discovering the various types of heads 
 is pretty fun for a while. Each makes a cool signature sound when you activate it - choose the 
 German soldier and he says "Jawohl!"; Napoleon's head plays a snippet of "Le Marseillaise"; the 
 gangster says "Capice?"; Elvis is accompanied by a little boogie-woogie piano; and so forth - and 
 of course you need to figure out what they do and when you should use them. And the background 
 rock and pop soundtrack contains some of the best and most varied music I've heard in a game, running 
 the gamut from droning Link Wray anthems to a 1960s rave-up that'll have more than one person thinking 
 of the Velvet Underground.  

 But instead of exploiting the concept of hundreds of weapons and power-ups, H. E. D. Z. takes the idea 
 and runs with it for about an hour or two before it collapses under the weight of its design. The 
 reason is simple: There's too much emphasis on combat and not enough on puzzles. Instead of having 
 to use certain heads in certain ways to work your way through a level, about all you need to figure 
 out is which heads deliver the quickest death blows against other headhunters.   

 There's some challenge involved in that process, but thanks to the game's clumsy third-person point 
 of view, the only real hurdle is control. Walk into a room, and the lack of a free-look feature 
 means you'll take four or five hits before you even realize where the attack is coming from (you 
 can look around if you're standing still, but that's not much of a help) . Once you do blast a head 
 off a headhunter, the odds are good he'll retrieve it before you do. Combat's tough even on the 
 easiest setting, and it doesn't help that weapons don't start to recharge until they're completely 
 empty and can't be fired until they're completely recharged. Start attacking a headhunter when 
 you're almost out of ammo, and you'll have to switch heads in the middle of the fast-paced action 
 in order to finish him off. By the time you've reached the fourth or fifth level, you'll probably 
 wind up losing simply because you're so outnumbered and have run out of the requisite cash to grab 
 a head out of the head case.  

 If H. E. D. Z. developer VIS Interactive had lightened up on the combat, focused on making some puzzles 
 that were as creative as the game's basic concept, and slowed down the pace so gamers would have 
 time to come up with creative uses for the heads, this could have been a real sleeper. Instead, 
 it winds up being just an average third-person shooter with a good sense of humor.

Review:  Yeah the game is OK. At first it seems good but then it gets boring, repetitive, and frustrating. 
 Thats about it. You will be faced with enemies with powers greater than you, and you will have 
 to keep redoing the levels until you beat it or until you get too bored and decide to uninstall 
 the game and never play it again. I completely agree with what the Gamespot writer said. This game 
 is not that bad, but is not that good, where instead of being good, it is ok, being neither good 
 nor bad. This is why I give it a 5, mediocre, OK, not good or bad.
