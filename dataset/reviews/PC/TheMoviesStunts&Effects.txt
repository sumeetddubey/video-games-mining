:::Review:::
By seamlessly integrating into The Movies, the Stunts & Effects expansion offers a lot of cool new 
 toys for would-be studio bosses and virtual moviemakers to play with. 

  Hollywood's problem is that as movies become more complex, the expectations of the audience keep 
 getting higher. (The same could be said of games, as well.) This means that more effort must be 
 put into creating larger spectacles. To capture this sense of escalation, we have The Movies: Stunts 
 &amp; Effects, an expansion to last year's combination Hollywood Tycoon game and virtual moviemaking 
 studio, The Movies. Stunts &amp; Effects lets you create bigger and more spectacular movies with 
 the addition of death-defying stunts, as well as the ability to create summer-blockbuster-style 
 movies.  

          Stunts &amp; Effects will raise your level of moviemaking by adding exciting new elements 
 to The Movies, such as burning buildings.     

  By integrating seamlessly with the existing core game, the Stunts &amp; Effects expansion adds 
 a slew of new facilities and sets that are geared toward action and special effects. For instance, 
 the new stunt school lets you hire stuntmen (and women) so that you can create more intense action 
 scenes, while the new green screen and blue screen sets are where effects-laden movies are mostly 
 shot, since these make it easier to digitally insert the actors into any type of scene. Other new 
 additions include a miniature-city set that will let you create scenic flyby shots of the skyline 
 or let you indulge your love of monster movies by creating Godzilla-like epics, as well as new 
 scenes, costumes, and more.  

  Even with the expansion, The Movies retains its dual nature of both a Sims-like management game 
 and a virtual studio. As the head of a Hollywood studio, you oversee everything on your studio 
 lot, from the placement of buildings, plants, paths, and walkways to what your various employees 
 are doing, including the stars, extras, janitors, and more. The goal remains to make as much money 
 as possible while churning out the highest quality movies to gain more fame and prestige, particularly 
 during awards ceremonies. The addition of stunts escalates the challenge, as you have to create 
 better stunts than your competitors. As such, you'll see lots of new things in the expansion, such 
 as leaps off of buildings, smoky escapes from burning buildings, and more. Or you can film exciting 
 new scenes featuring a variety of new vehicles, including models on a miniatures lot, which you 
 can use to really capture an epic sense of scale.  

  All these new stunts and effects come at a slight expense when it comes to the overall complexity 
 of the gameplay. Stuntmen (and women) are treated sort of like actors, in that they must be selected 
 from a pool of applicants. You then train your stuntmen by constructing special training facilities 
 to increase their stunt skill. The higher a stuntman's stunt skill, the more daring that stunt 
 can be. Every now and then, you'll need to toss your stuntmen into the hospital (another new building 
 in the expansion) to let them heal up from all the abuse that they take. Since you're also mothering 
 over everyone else on the studio lot, especially your ever-fussy stars, all this micromanagement 
 can be a handful, though it doesn't become overly burdensome. The expansion also suffers from the 
 same staffing problems found in The Movies, in that you can never find enough workers to staff 
 your studio. You'll constantly have to shuffle workers from one department to another to keep the 
 place up and running at times, which sounds a bit odd since everyone in Hollywood wants to be a 
 part of the movie business.  

  The addition of stunts does add a bit more depth to the overall game. An effects-laden blockbuster 
 might take a year or more to shoot, which means that you may have to get a second crew to shoot 
 smaller, simpler movies to ensure that you have a steady stream of releases while your massive 
 blockbuster is in production. You only have a small pool of stuntmen, as well, and filming a stunt-heavy 
 movie may mean that none are available for use on another movie, which means that you'll have to 
 carefully oversee the types of scripts that your writers churn out. To create a stunt movie, just 
 pick up and drag a writer over the special stunt icon in the writer's building, and they'll get 
 to work creating a movie that takes advantage of your sets and your stuntmen's abilities.  

          You have to keep a close eye on the physical conditions of your stuntmen. If one gets 
 dinged up too much, it's time to send them to the hospital to heal up.     

  Of course, you can also custom create your own scripts. However, as with the original game, this 
 feature seems disconnected from the studio-management portion of the game. You can spend all the 
 time you want writing and directing your own blockbuster, but in the end, it has little effect 
 as to the performance of the movie in the marketplace, and it also brings the pace of the game 
 to a screeching halt. Still, this ability seems more geared toward players who want to simply create 
 their own virtual masterpieces to share online, and as such, the variety is certainly welcome, 
 as it allows a lot more flexibility and creativity. The new free camera mode lets you shift the 
 camera around on the set, which should also please would-be moviemakers.  

  In the end, the Stunts &amp; Effects expansion is a must for moviemaker fans, since they're the 
 ones who can take the most advantage of all these new sets and scenes to create even more imaginative 
 movies. If you're a more casual fan of The Movies who prefers the studio-management game, you'll 
 find that the production values and overall gameplay haven't change that much, as you'll still 
 find yourself guiding a movie studio through the decades, from the black-and-white era to today's 
 modern blockbusters. Only now, you can do so with a bit more flair and a few more broken bones 
 when a stunt goes awry.

Review:  The movies stunts & effects has finally improved from the last one and it has more to offer with 
 it's new camera system you can move any where you like then film the scean. Also there's some new 
 sets and costumes all of this is great. The downside to this game is your stunt men they always 
 injure themselves and then you have to take them to hospital it doesn't happen all the time but 
 it can be irritating the graphic's are still the same as the last one. The management has not improved 
 which is quite disappointing and your stars that you hire are always moody. At least it is better 
 than the last one
  
  Graphics - The models up close are great!
  
  Gameplay - This game has definitely improved.
  
  How long does the game lasts? - The lasts 
 for at least 90 hours of gameplay you will enjoy this game.

Review:  Lots of people want to make movies. In the Movies you could make movies. But in the Movies stunts 
 and effects expansion you can make spectacular movies. You may not be able to do whatever you want 
 but you can get it pretty close.
  
  There are a wide variety of costumes for your actors to wear and there are plenty of props and 
 sets to have them act on. 
  
  You can make any type of movie you want. And if you want a load of fun just make attempt making 
 a movie with a friend. You'll be sure to have a ton of good laughs. The one thing that turns me 
 down is that there isn't a super free mode. There is the one free mode "sand box", but you cant 
 have as much fun. In my opinion it would be fun to have a mode were you could have everything unlocked 
 and able to use right from the start with stunt men not getting injured and actors not getting 
 drunk etc, and you could just make a movie.
  
  When you put the movie together don't worry about the movie not running perfectly, because you 
 can edit the clips in the editing process, cut them to fit add sound and credits etc.
  
  When adding final touches to the your movie it is very hard to and dialogue for the actors. First 
 of all you have to have a microphone, and secondly if you have a mic you can barely hear what you 
 say into it, even if you scream.
  
  Overall the game is really good and you will get tons of fun out of it and enjoy it for a very 
 long time, when you're playing it and when you're watching your movies.

Review:  Stunts & Effects is an expansion pack for The Movies, which was a sim game focused around making 
 your own studio lot and movies. Stunts & Effects brings lots of new additions to the Movies, including 
 new costumes, a few new scenes, and most importantly, stunts. While these new additions all sound 
 nice, they don't really add anything lasting to the Movies. This makes Stunts & effects a tricky 
 expansion to truly recommend.
  
  The primary new addition of Stunts & effects are the stunts and stuntsmen you can now hire to pull 
 those said stunts off. When you have a stunt in a movie your shooting, you'll generally want an 
 experienced stuntsman to pull it off. You CAN have your own stars try the stunts, but its at great 
 risk, for your stars generally aren't as skilled with stunts as stuntsmen are. There's always the 
 risk of bothcing the stunt during shooting however, which really brings your movie's rating down.
 
  
  This is all great from a movie making standpoint, but not from the sim game's standpoint. Stunts 
 & Effects actually adds absolutely nothing to the sim game. Infact, it just adds one more type 
 of staff for you to keep track of, and the new issue of injuries to worry about.
  
  The new stunts don't add much to the movie making either in all reality. The Movie Maker itself 
 benefits from the fact that you can adjust the camera yourself now, which is probably the best 
 addition to the game for most people. But there is an appalingly low number of new scenes added 
 by the expansion, which is very disappointing. 
  
  In the end, Stunts & Effects doesn't add nearly enough to the game to be easily recommendable. 
 If you are a fanatic for the original game, then Stunts & Effects may be worth a purchase, but 
 otherwise, you won't be adding too much enjoyment to The Movies by getting this sub-standard expansion.
 
  
  Pros: You can adjust the camera in the Movie Maker.
  
  Cons: Doesn't add anything truely noteworthy to the game.
  
  Recommendable for: Only fanatics 
 for the original game need apply.

Review:  Most expansion pack/sets are good ways to rip people off. However the movies expansion pack, Stunts 
 and Effects is an truely amazing feat. The game adds stuntmen/stuntwomen to the game. They do the 
 tricks in your films and are a major part of the game. They also allow a whole new selection of 
 awesome scenes like bullet run, car shooting, etc. The game also adds many new insane features 
 like new scenes, new sets, overlays, stuntmen, better explosions, more awards, and much more. The 
 game is a must need for hard-core movies fans who are looking for more action and better features 
 in their orginal movies games.

Review:  GAMEPLAY:
  Same as the normal version, run a studio, shoot the movies, hire the stars. Except this version 
 adds stuntmen which is great because the stuntmen can get injured during their scenes and have 
 to go to the hospital for a while, and it adds great new features to the Advanced Movie Maker for 
 example: Wind, more rain etc. Lots of props, new sets and fantastic stunt scenes.
  
  GRAPHICS: Similar to the Normal version with a few upgrades to the fire, sets and studios, nothing 
 new though.
  
  SOUND: Mostly the same as The Normal version, with some added music, nothing else.
  
  VALUE: 
 Make any kind of movie you want-now including epic blockbusters with a giant monster in a city, 
 blowing cars up, buildings on fires, green screen and blue screens, what else would you want?

Review:  Well, after purchasing The Movies, I instantly found a new addiction. Soon enough though, that 
 faded, as there was always this boundary with The Movies that couldn't really be crossed. But, 
 when I found out there was an expansion pack, I made it my duty to make bigger, and better movies 
 than ever. Explosions, stunts, sweet costumes, and ultimate annihilation were in stock when I was 
 blown away with what the game had to offer.
  The Good:
  -Enhanced graphics
  -Stunts and effects really contributed to outstanding movies
  -New sets
  -More costumes
  
 -More props
  The Bad:
  -Limit with which cars could and couldn't be used in some scenes
  -Small problem with staff shortages
  -Extreme limit to what you can do in a scene
  (Eg. You 
 might want to make an ultimate quadding movie, or something like that, but what you can and can't 
 do is sort of limited, so such things can't exist.)
  
  It's an amazing game, but really doesn't go that far without modding. Outstanding otherwise!!!
 
  
  Umm, if you're still unsure if you should buy it, go to youtube. com and check out one of my movies 
 such as: Body Harvest, or Key To The Basement. That is, if I don't delete them for some reason.

Review:  The Movies: Stunt & Effects
  
  Reveiw
  This game is so fun. you start the game in 1920 to 2006 though te time you will make films and 
 unlock this packages witch contain new stuff for your studio. the best thing about this game is 
 after you finish the game you can post your movies online were people can rate them. The best bit 
 is if your smart you can go and put your own stuff in the game. I have played hours on this game 
 trying to unlock everything but it so fun.
  
  Good ponits
  +Gameplay is free so you can do what ever you want
  +Its got a online mode +t fun to play
  
 
  Bad ponits -Game can be finished in a day
  -Some of the stuff is hard to unlock I say:
  It a good game and it will make you think.

Review:  Expansions are always fun, who doesn't like expansions? A product designed to suck up all your 
 money because the developers want every last bit of moolah they can milk out of a product. Cynicism 
 aside, The Movies: Stunts and Effects is a solid expansion in my opinion, but only for the Movie 
 Maker portion of the original game.
  
  Stunts and Effects essentially adds what the title implies, stunts and effects. You've got a new 
 type of employee for the tycoon portion, the stunt double, who you train at new stunt school structures 
 and can be used in films from the 1960s onward. Aside from some new sets to gawk at, this is all 
 that this expansion adds to the tycoon portion of the game, so people who don't bother with the 
 movie maker might want to stop here. Some new scenes have been added to existing sets, and new 
 sets that allow the actor or a stunt double to perform a stunt. Depending on the difficulty level 
 of the stunt, the actor\double may end up being successful, or taking a trip to the studio hospital 
 (if you have one) . This can add some tension because you may lose your actor or a stunt double 
 for quite a bit of time thus slowing down the shooting of your film, but essentially that's all 
 that tycoon only players have to tinker with which is disappointing as I was a bigger fan of the 
 tycoon portion of The Movies.
  
  Movie makers have been having a field day with the new features of S&amp; E since its release. The 
 effects basically consist of visual modifications to some sets, such as special effects, as well 
 as new blue and green screen sets allowing you to add in custom backdrops. A lot of the new sets 
 obviously cater to the stunt portion of the expansion, but almost all of them also have some nice 
 effects that are available for use. Another feature introduced is the Free Cam which lets you move 
 the camera wherever you wish, opening up some new doors for fans of the tool. S&amp; E improves 
 upon the movie making part of the game quite a bit.
  
  Stunts &amp; Effects is a worthwhile expansion if you want the improvements for the movie maker. 
 If you're still not interested in that utility then there is little reason to track this title 
 down, as the stunt double addition doesn't really justify the price tag. I liked it, though, the 
 movie maker is a lot more fun to use with the new features added in the expansion.

Review:  to be honest i didn't really like the game at first but that was only cause i didn't even have 
 the right computer to be playing it on but after you have been playing it after a while it really 
 grows on you exspecially if you have real success on the game but it kinda gets you down if you 
 don't get alot going on right off the start. One of my favorite things about the expansion pack 
 is because of the stunts of course lol but anyways i really like the idea of the stunt double but 
 i wish that there could be other stunt doubles that come from other studios. I think i like the 
 game both of the ways w/ and w/o the expansion it is very addicting to me after i get going like 
 i don't want to stop until i get last or something like that which really kinda gets you down lol 
 but i think i am going over the same thing over and over but i think that is it and i hope that 
 Lionhead will come out with another ep.. enjoy the game like me !

Review:  First I choose the set. I choose the Urban - City Street. I then make a drunk guy get shot by the 
 police. Then I make it rain. Then I make it sunny. Then I make a zombie read the newspaper! OH 
 IT'S ALL TOO MUCH!!! You really have to try this game. My opinion, best game ever made, Lionhead 
 Studios have amazing ideas! Next, I make a guy jump off the building, lands in boxes, gets up, 
 and then is bitten by a vampire. He then goes and kisses a girl for no reason. Then, a sniper shoots 
 the girl. He bites the sniper rifle . You should really try this game.

Review:  Stunts &amp; Effects is the EP for The Movies, and manages to pull off the unexpected.
  
  The Freecam Mode in Custom Scriptwriting allows you to control the camera in a scene, and the game 
 does a good job of it.
  
  While the Stuntmen occasionly become an extra chore to handle (by having to constantly train them 
 while at the same time making your actors/directors happy) , they bring with them plenty of new, 
 over-the-top scenes to add to your movie, along with brand-new sets and costumes such as the green 
 screen set.
  
  Above everything else, this game is simply a must-buy if you liked the previous game, and it adds 
 plenty to the already-innovative game.

Review:  You can't relly say in depth how much PC fans were shocked to see Movies debut on the PC and make 
 a spectacular and imense debut and huge name for itself! A mix of tycoon and sim-like simulation 
 created a whole new gaming experience and genre (if you will) on the market..
  
  So if you hadn't figured this is The Movies Stunts and Effects which is the first EP (and apparently 
 last... long story) for the Movies and by looking at the title of the EP.......... BINGO! your movies 
 now contain stunts and Effects easy right?? but there is a lot more to that!
  
  First off there's this whole new Stuntmen area where yoy get this new stunt school and you get 
 your stunt people and you train them to do the better and bigger stunts from slipping on banna 
 peels to jumping out of flaming windows.... the better the stunt the better quality your movies 
 gain! easy? but there are certain things that stop you first off there is the training bit where 
 like I said your stuntmen are trained into being better and doing better stunts so it takes a while 
 for you to get the best stuntmen and in time they will succeed but in the end it doesn't really 
 boost YOUR MORALE PERSONALLY...
  
  Another thing with this EP is that there isn't much changed in the game overall you can get new 
 costumes for your stars and sets and scenes but there's like............ It just feels the same 
 you know as the original game and it doesn't feel right after playing it for a few good months...
 
  
  Beside the gameplay comments and a few faulty areas this EP for the movies should not be avoided 
 if you Do own the Movies and want a new better sets e. t. c. then please go to your nearest retail 
 store and give it a try!..

Review:  This Movies expansion did bring some life into the games. With the introduction of stunts and special 
 effects did throw some light and challenge in the games. Most of the added feature is more on the 
 Advance
  Movies Making option . But the result of making the movies yourself doesn't
  pay off . So, why bother to crack your head and do the scripting and editing
  the movies yourself 
 . You won't gain much from it .
  
  Its more toward how you manage and taking care of your employee . Keep
  them occupy , so that 
 they won't get bored and start drinking . The same old
  problem of staffing still persist . As you won't be able to find enough people
  to run the show 
 for you. Try juggle your staff to counter these problem . Just don't understand in this kind of 
 movies making industries you're facing shortage of staff problem. Not likely to happen in real 
 life.
  Try make one blockbuster movies and one small scale movies at a time . As big movies takes longer 
 time to produce. While the smaller scale can help you maintain your daily expenses. Get your scriptwriter 
 to produce some script which you can sell it to meet your cash flow demand .
  
  Graphic and sound doesn't seem to change much. Overall this expansion
  did make the games more 
 interesting and one would stick with it for some time. Nevetheless , its a great games if you're 
 not that demanding. SIM game lover should not miss this expansion.

Review:  I think the gameplay is amazing, but not perfect. It was also alot like the first, the only thing 
 different was the fact that you did stunts. The stunts and the way they classified stunts was brilliant. 
 I tried to do a car bomb stunt with a low level stuntman and it failed miserably. The Graphics 
 were just the same as the first, so i was kinda dissapointed by that fact. The sound was awesome 
 the way they had different voices for the different directors, but if you got a bad or annoying 
 voice, you were stuck with it for the rest of the game. I would've thought it would be less than 
 what i saw $34.99. It's $20 now so thats better but i think its worth more like $15 or so.

Review:  The Movies is a fantastic simulation game, this is one of the few or only kinds of it's genre and 
 rest assured that this game will be hard to top. The movies starts off similar to sims, after a 
 short tutorial your allowed free rein of a plot of land which is fixed in size (you cant buy any 
 more or sell any off) so you have to be very spaceually aware. You start offf in the tutorial with 
 it telling what you need to do and how you need to go about doing it, you will build about 5 main 
 structures and let loose on the rest, this game is fantastic because of the way it allows you to 
 play with its time, the timeline moves at a realistic rate with (like real movies) taking around 
 3 years to make. You have to make sure you have a tidy, comfortable, clean, well kept, well catered 
 enviroment which will boost studio ratings and your stars ratings to. You have to make sure you 
 stay ontop of research so you dont fall behind with the times, You have special awards ceremonies 
 which award you on your efforts with extra talents, such as, increased reseach speed, or more luck 
 with stunts. You have to make sure your stars are in a good condition, your stunt preformers wont 
 be happy and wont preform too well if you let there condition drop so make you always have a hospital, 
 another great feature is the ability to hire and fire crew / extras/ stars and directors this gives 
 you full control over your studio, you have to make sure you have scriptwriters to work on your 
 movies and a PR building to boost the media of your stars and movies, you also need to watch out 
 for stress and bordom since this can lead to bigger problems such as alcohol. All in all this is 
 a great game, dont forget that you can make your own movies! These then can be placed online amoung 
 a whole community with the availbility of various forums and advertising using posters, Lionhead 
 studios have tried to make this as realistic a game as they possibly can... they suceeded in doing 
 so. I recommend this game to anyone who considers buying it.

Review:  One might argue that the real value that this expansion to the original game brings to the fun 
 is somewhat superflious, it does add a host of new features for those keen amateur movie-makers 
 out there to enjoy and explore.
  
  While the expansion pack does integrate quite seamlessly into the original game-play mechanisms, 
 these new features can only be accessed from 1960 onwards in the "game" portion anyway, which means 
 that players won't really notice too many changes in the decades preceding the 1960's.
  
  In my opinion, the real value of this expansion pack really lies with the sandbox mode, where a 
 host of new camara, scene and actor capabilities become possible for those keen amateur movie-makers 
 out there.
  
  In fact, I would have liked to see most of these features in the original game to start off with.
 
  
  As far as the game-play is concerned, the real changes to the original really kick in once you 
 reach the 1960's and decades beyond. At this point you can start hiring Stuntmen (and women of 
 course) and start adding so-called stunt scenes to your movie scripts. While it adds some new dimensions 
 to the original game-play, it feels somewhat superflious from a pure playing perspective.
  
  On the graphics front, one would obviously have expected the same quality as was the case in 
 the original game and this is definitely the case. Some of the new scenes added to the original 
 script "catalogue" are actually quite good from a pure graphical "eye candy" perspective.
  
  In summary, I would say that players out there expecting massive changes to the original game-play 
 may be somewhat disappointed, but keen movie-makers like myself, that enjoy the sandbox mode more 
 than the game itself, will not be disappointed at all.

Review:  Its one of the most challenging real time stradigies, but thats what makes it so good. Its not 
 like you just grab an actor and director then shoot some short movie. Its way more complex than 
 that. You choose EVERYTHING. The costumes, the sets, the script, the lighting, its awsome. I can 
 tell the creators put a lot of research and work into this game. I respect that. A lot. I like 
 what they put in this one. The stunts and effects. Its just like the movies, just better and harder. 
 The graphics are ok. The sound is great. The price is just how it shoud be. And overall its a satisfying 
 game.

Review:  I played this game a lot but I think that the new game mode must have be done without to unlock 
 buildings. But if you want to make real movies you should play sandbox mode. Ones I maid a 56 scene 
 movie in the new game mode and after the shooting I was bankrobted. So who ever plays this game 
 must know that if you want to play the game like you are manager of a studio play new game mode 
 but if you want to make long and movies with your own scenario play sandbox mode. Also I think 
 that they shouldn't have maid to unlock the scriptwrite offices to make movies with more stars. 
 Although this two thinks I still think that the game is great.

Review:  A very good game but the managing your own studio is a letdown even more than the last one probably 
 because there is one more thing you have to manage stuntmen.
  
  The moving making part is bloody brilliant even better than the original, with free cam which gives 
 you your own unique angles on scenes even though when you want to move to a spot on the set you 
 have to move by scrolling which is very slow but icant be sure of that because my computer is really 
 really crap and bearly meets the minimum requirements.
  
  There is a better slection of scenes which is great and after your done with that ther is plenty 
 of modding to do' the best website for me is www.8eyedbaby. com. overall it is a letdown and and 
 great game at the same time.
  DJ is funny in the 60's.
  
  Note : I could not rate graphics properly becaus of my crap videocard which runs at a measly 32mb. 
 It's torture. So i just guessed graphics.
  
  p. s : don't download bittorrent version because you can't put movies on internet which means I 
 can't release my revent inventions: Santa versus Jesus ; The ressurection and Lost episode 1. check 
 out by first 3 Santa versus Jesus movies on the offical "The Movies" website.

Review:  Activision's movie tycoon grows bigger with the addition of an interesting expasion pack. The Movies: 
 Stunts & Effects comes to add more depth to the game, with a brand new stunt crew, new facilities, 
 more problems to solve and more features to play with.
  
  Stunts & Effects is, as the name indicates, based around incorporating stunts in your movies. Just 
 like in the real Hollywood business, audiences require new thrills and become more and more demanding 
 regarding what they want to see in the next blockbuster hit. The burden rests solely on your shoulders, 
 since you  the new motion picture mogul  are the one who has to make it happen. Most of all, 
 you have to make it happen right. 
  
  To first start your "stunty business" your previously saved game needs to be past the 1960's timeline. 
 If it's not, the new features belonging to the expansion will not be available. Alternatively, 
 you can begin a new game starting in 1960. Either way, a handy tutorial will tell you what you 
 need to know to include stuntmen and stunt facilities in your studio lot.
  
  The first step is to create a stuntmen recruiting office. Once the candidates start lining up at 
 the office, recruit two or three and you will obtain your first stunt movie script. Gather the 
 crew and you they will proceed to shoot their first stunt: your typical "board on the face" comedy.
 
  
  Once the stunt has been completed (successfully or not) , you will learn about your stunts condition 
 and skill. Each stuntman (or stuntwoman) has a condition and a skill meter. They both dictate how 
 successful the stunts will be performed. Stunt skill can be raised by training in the appropriate 
 facilities, while a stunman's condition can be restored in the hospital.
  
  As your stuntmen skills go up, they will be able to perform more difficult and outstanding stunts. 
 From boards on the head to rabid dogs gnawing on their arms, spectacular car crashes, fires and 
 explosions, falling from tall buildings, martial arts fighting and destroying entire cities through 
 UFO invasions of giant monster attacks, there is a stunt for every movie.
  
  Not only action movies can have stunts. If you drop your scriptwriters in the little helmet icon 
 in the respective genre room, they will write a stunt script for that genre, so any romance or 
 horror flick can have its own stunt too.
  
  Aside from new sets and facilities, the new content includes several wardrobe and hairstyle options 
 (you can make your actors look older or heavier if you wish) , many realistic backdrops, weather 
 effects, smoke screens, lasers, three new award categories and a bunch of new critic reviews (some 
 of them being quite harsh) .
  
  But Stunts & Effects doesn't stop there. For the hardcore movie-makers who already own The Movies, 
 the new Free Cam Mode will allow more flexibility for creating your own movies by letting you step 
 into the cameraman's shoes. Change the camera location, add new camera angles and customize your 
 own camera pathing to add a whole new artistic level to your work.
  
  That's not to say the game is flawless. The most apparent problem with The Movies is the lack of 
 candidates for the different job categories. It's difficult to find people waiting in line at the 
 doors to your recruiting offices, especially now that there is a new job. 
  
  The Movies: Stunts & Effects does get to be quite the handful with so much to do and so many things 
 to control in one lot at the same time. You must really enjoy micro-management to truly appreciate 
 it, since all this simultaneous activity makes it easy to overlook certain things. But it greatly 
 adds to the original title, turning it into a much more involving experience than you could ever 
 expect.

Review:  As most of The Movies fans became fed up with the lack of litiral BOOM in there movies Lion Head 
 did what needed to be done a CD-ROM to within it they poured all the Aliens, Karate and Firey Explosions 
 they could find... one Disk to rule the Movies... One disk to make them... One Internet to send 
 them all... and on the website Play them...
  Yes The Movies Stunts & Effects is by far one of the best Expansion Packs ever made... 
  
  
 The Movies Action...
  For the most part the original Movies did pretty well with action but c'mon whats an Action movie 
 without an exploson or car chace?
  
  The Movies S&E ACTION!
  Helechoptors Zoom and Explosions Rock major citys in S&E and if there is no that suits your need 
 use the green/blue screen SFX sets!
  
  The Movies Horror...
  Again the original was good but not great in horror costumes were limited and most of the monser 
 costumes.... sucked
  
  The Movies S&E AHHHHH! HORROR!
  New More Terrifiying Aliens Ghosts and Monsters have been added and help bring out your inner Jason, 
 happy slashing
  
  The Movies Sci-Fi...
  Alot of issues here
  Only 2 ships
  No outside views of ships
  and the hall ways all looked like they belonged to the same ship.
 
  
  2001: THE MOVIES S&E SCI FI... A Space Odyssey
  Green screen now lets you give the Four variations on star ships a new perspective with many diffrent 
 ways the ships interact they can dock or destroy
  
  The Movies Romance
  Bow-chick-wow-wow
  
  The Passonate movies S&E
  No change really i mean you cant add that 
 kind of boom to a Romance movie and you cant keep a TEEN rating if you add that kind of boom
  
  The Movies Comedy
  Only one problem, Actor apperince, people dont want to see a swave hansome 
 Man or a Sexy drop-dead-Beautiful woman in a comedy movie!
  Would "Tommy Boy" have done as good as it did if Chris Farely and David Spade were Ripped? or if 
 Napolion Dyanamite was a regular guy? no we would have one move about sales men and a guy who goes 
 to school and feeds a llamma 
  
  The Movies XD LOL HAHAHA COMEDY XD S&E
  The New Costumes help give charicters a funnyer edge and the Weight and Age controles can take 
 hours off prepareing you actors by makeing them go to the same burger stand over and over again.
 
  
  The realisum in the game is good as well 
  Like in real life if an actor falls and lands on cement rrather than an airbag, they will need 
 a trip to the hospital for Meidical attention
  
  Press
  "Hes Sleeping with Her!" "Devorce?!?!" "Eating Disorder" "Drunk behind the Wheel!" "Picked a Fight 
 with a homeless man" "Shes Pregnant!" "He Beats Up Reporters!"
  Like in Real life the Paparatzi only need to get one shot of you skipping lunch a BAM you are Hollywoods 
 new Anorexic
  In the game press enter the lot to get an embarcing picture 
  
  All-in-all the game unleashes the untapped potental the movies allways had 10 out of 10 :)

Review:  I don't often play the game The Movies. I mostly make movies with it. This means I am mostly in 
 Sand Box mode and I use the Advanced Script Writing and Post Production facilities. I of course 
 use actors, directors, crews, and even research scientists (so I can unlock new stuff faster!) , 
 but I don't have to worry about my star actor becoming an alcoholic and putting in a poor performance. 
 It also means I start out with the maximum available money and can forget about micro-managing 
 the movie studio.
  
  And so for someone like me Stunts and Effects make a lot of sense. The expansion pack provides 
 a lot of great new content, including almost all of the props, costumes, and sets you normally 
 pay for (using virtual credit, which can be hard to come by) on The Movies Online. But beyond that 
 it provides even more new content, plenty of new scenes to take advantage of the 'stunts' and 'effects' 
 in the title's name, and it tweaks the user interface in many useful ways.
  
  One of the most talked about new features is freecam, which stands for Free Camera. When in the 
 Advanced Script Writing facitily you traditionally use the camera shots built into the scene you 
 are using, but now you can set the camera up yourself. 
  
  For me the biggest advantage of this is I can setup my own shots that I would normally look for 
 a new scene to do. And as anyone who's spent considerable time in The Movies knows, that can be 
 frustrating. You can often find a scene with the perfect shot but it's in a slightly different 
 location than your other scenes and using it will make your movie look inconsistent. Now you can 
 reuse the same scene multiple times, if you wish, and change the camera as needed to provide different 
 shots. 
  
  Beyond this use, though, freecam also provides great opportunties to really express yourself in 
 interesting ways. You can do some weird and arty things with the camera that can make your movies 
 more interesting. Regardless of how you use freecam, though, you will find it a versatile new feature. 
 It has a lot of power.
  
  Both the Advanced Script Writing and the Post Production facilities have been expanded and tweaked, 
 and the changes really make using The Movies easier. They still have plenty of quirks, and some 
 things, like adding music and sound effects, is still painfully slow, but the changes are welcome 
 none-the-less. One thing I do wish to complain about, though, is the fact that even though some 
 new music was added, there still isn't enough stock music and sound effects. Also, the ability 
 to fade a given piece of music in and out would have really eased the burden but Lionhead didn't 
 change this feature at all.
  
  For a full list of new content and features in the expansion, please see the following web page 
 on The Movies Online forums: 
  
  http://allboards. lionhead. com/showthread. php? t=165024
  
  My closing words are, if you make movies with The Movies, Stunts and Effects is a must have 
 expansion. If you are playing the game and love it, I can imagine wanting to get it as well. If 
 you are hoping the expansion will dramatically change the game and have no intention of making 
 your own movies, you should probably pass.

Review:  If you have played the original then you would have experienced the pleasure of making your own 
 movies through this superior game, and this only brings more features to enhance your filmmaking 
 to the next level. But if you're a fan of playing the tycoon/simulation mode, you may feel that 
 there is something missing. 
  
  Stuntmen is the key feature in the tycoon aspect. This is a really good addition as it expands 
 your management skills in the gameplay. You are given new buildings and sets, and to work with 
 stuntmen in your performances is the extra joy of it all. You train your stuntmen to participate 
 in deadlier stunts and depending on how experienced your stuntman is, can depend on the overall 
 movie quality. 
  
  But you may be thinking what are the incentives on this new feature? If you are familiar with the 
 original then you will be given milestones to be achieved from stunt performances to unlock new 
 and ideal sets. Unfortunately that is all there is to offer in terms of the tycoon mode if you 
 have already completed everything in the original.
  
  However, the movie-making part is another story. Some awesome features added. Not so much new scenes 
 and sets (they are a big plus) but the expansion implements a new tool called the free-cam feature. 
 This is a very impressive aspect as it gives you the opportunity to precisely pick your shots and 
 gives a new meaning of making films using the game. Also there are various visual effects you can 
 use, as it expands the limitations and improves the quality of your films. On top of this, there 
 are various explosive scenes and new style sets to use. The new features highly emphasises on the 
 "Action" and "Sci-Fi" genre more than anything else, though the free-cam can also improve the other 
 genres depending on your creativity.
  
  Never-the-less, a great expansion that lives up the tastes of the original, and definitely takes 
 movie making to another level, though tycoon mode is left empty..

Review:  The Movies Stunts & Effects is based around when the year of 1960. The movie industry is envolving. 
 Since the dawn of cinema, audiences have had a hunger for one thing: bigger and better pictures. 
 With the Stunts & Effects expansion pack you can introduce a whole new world to them. New aspects 
 of gameplay and moviemaking that will turn your 2-star snoozer into a 5-star box office smash.
 
  
  If you're already familiar with The Movies, you'll find that basic gameplay is still intact: run 
 your studio, make nobodies into stars, shoot the movies. The Movies Stunts & Effects expansion 
 pack introduces several new ways to turn those three simple steps into hollywood success story.
 
  
  When I first started up The Movies Stunts & Effects I was introduced to a new Auto play pop up 
 screen with some new music that suits the game expansion. I continued my game from 1996 and was 
 surprised when I seen the new features, building for recruiting stuntman and training your stuntman 
 'you can also train your regular stars for stunts so they do their own but they might have to visit 
 a hospital if they are not trained enough.
  
  When I seen some of these features and went into the custom script writing office to start my dream 
 of making a mafia movie. I spent from 9:00pm too 4:00am one night to get half way in my movie and 
 then from 6:00pm to 12:30am to finish the other half of the scenes (This is a 30 minute movie I 
 made in sandbox mode, if you were playing a real career mode I would not agree to make a movie 
 of this length) . I spent another 3 hours adding sound effects and music to complete my greatest 
 production ever, a smashing report in the charts a 5-star superb. The expansion pack added alot 
 of the scenes that I would have needed to make such a movie with such action.
  
  Overall I find this game lack a bit in new buildings and no updated Starmaker which I find needs 
 a bit of improving but overall a must have for serious movie makers.

Review:  As I said before, The Movies: Stunts and Effects adds ttwo of the most essential parts of moviemaking 
 into the game. You guessed it, stunts and effects. Despite what some people say, the moviemaking 
 is very intuitive. Stunt scenes are marked with the difficulty of the stunt before you put them 
 into the film, and all new content is marked with the logo of the expansion pack; a star with a 
 billboard underneath it. The game part is also extremely intuitive. Everything in your studio can 
 be tweaked, and it's all easy to understandThe only problem I have is that some of the comments 
 in the reviews for the movies I've made I found offensive.

Review:  The Movies was a great game in its own right, combining tycoon style gameplay with the freedom 
 of making your own movies. Stunts and Effects puts the emphasis on the latter, with new sets, costumes 
 ans stuntmen.
  
  While it doesn't add much to the campaign, those that enjoy making their own movies will love the 
 additions of Stunts and Effects, such as stuntmen, cool special effect sets, and freecam. While 
 this may mean that the other part of the game (the tycoon gameplay element) is pushed to the sideline, 
 it does mean that the game finally has a sense of direction (more or less) .
  
  With the same quirky humour that was apparent in the original, and gameplay elements that will 
 make for some interesting movie making moments, Stunts and Effects is an addition that feels like 
 its part of the original, which is either an incredibly good thing, or a very very bad thing...
 
  
  If you like the movie making portion of the game, then you will love Stunts and Effects, if you 
 like the tycoon portion of the game, don't expect too much to change.

Review:  For those who like the movies game, they are going to love this EP, its added more fun and more 
 action for the films making, there is going to be new sense fore stunts.
  
  For the first look, if u just started to play the movies and just started to make a studio, there 
 is going to be only few adds for the game, 3 or 4 new stage, but later on there going to be more 
 and more new stages and new buildings, first of all there is going to be the stunts school and 
 the hospital, then they are going to add the stunts training faculties, and after it you can start 
 making movies with stunts.
  
  When you ask the writers to write a movie, you can chose wither you want it with stunts or not, 
 if u chose stunts, there going to be some difficult sense and other easy, so it could go right 
 or maybe fail.
  
  A more trained stunt make a better movie, and better rate for sure, now if u used extras for dangers 
 sense, they going to get hurt real bad.
  
  The bad thing that I hated very much is when I did a movie, and used a stunt, they keep going out 
 the movie, I add them again and they go.
  
  If you really like the movies, you shouldnt miss this EP, its going to give the acting a new name.

Review:  Ok, I got this game yesterday and spent the whole day playing it. 
  
  The Movies: Stunts and Effects is possibly the first Movies game expansion pack but there will 
 probably be more. Stunts and Effects is pretty much in breif words GREAT, but it has it's letdowns. 
 For instance I thought that there would be more up-to-date graphics but I was greted with the same, 
 but then again some good parts make up for the bad, For starters there is tons of new stuff for 
 you to play around with and loads of new sets which can give your movies more 'edge', and like 
 the previous game in the 'career' mode there are more sets to unlock thanks to the new stuntman 
 award.
  
  The Upside: More varity, better movie effects, more costumes, more sets (the miniature city is 
 my favourite!) and the tutorial tells you everything you need to know about the new add-ons, new 
 menu layouts.
  
  The Downside: The same graphics, same style of gameplay in parts.
  
  My Verdict: I like this game, there's more to do, more cool stuff to unlock. Overall, The Movies 
 team could be onto something with these expansion packs.

Review:  Being addicted to the original, The Movies, this little extra expansion does increase the lifespan 
 of the game somewhat more or less, but, in my own personal opinion, all these extra gizmos, stunts 
 and scenes they've added, they could've all been included in the very first version.
  
  Don't go reading between the lines here. The expansion pack does come in handy when you want a 
 special scene where your moviestar has to fall off a tall building or get blasted into thin air 
 by a powerful explosion (or the flying vehicle scenes which I personally like very much) 
  
  And I like the way they changed the system so that old movies you've done and haven't exported, 
 but would like to export, you now have that possibility in the movie player, in the game menu.
 
  
  Not much changed graphics wise (none that I have noticed anyway..)
  Except for the few new sets they've put in (blue-screen, green-screen, scrolling landscape etc..)
 
  
  Overall, I'm still waiting for an expansion where there is a FULL-freecam mode, where you can locate 
 the camera ANYWHERE Y-O-U wanna put it... As of now, the freecam doesn't quite live up to the hype 
 it's been raved about... Only being able to decide the distance between the actor and the cam is 
 not what I had in mind with the freecam...
  
  So... as a conclusion...
  Stunts & Effects doesn't give a disappointing experience, no no, but it doesn't deserve a full 
 score either... unfortunately

Review:  Okay so I got Stunts and Effects a couple weeks ago. Since then, it has repeatedly proven itself 
 to be well worth what I payed for it (only 29.99!! Wow thats cheap for such a great game!!!) . It 
 adds a lot of new content to The Movies, and it has been fine-tuned to improve things like post-producing 
 a film along with loads of improvements to the advanced movie maker. Also, Freecam mode allows 
 you to make your own seens. All in all, its a great game that you should definetly go buy if you 
 haven't already. It is my second favorite game of 2006 (the first is Oblivion) .

Review:  Well I loved the movies game, but the game had many problems. The expansion does solve some of 
 those problems, but not all of them. Lets start with the things they have fixed shall we.
  They have added, ofcourse, thousands of effects and stunts for you to toy around with. There are 
 alot of new sets that you will be dieing to get your hands on. The advance movie making has been 
 updated alowing your movies to be that much better. 
  Now the bad things. MICROMANAGMENT! Everyone hates micromanaging everything in this game, and alot 
 of people said lower the micromanagement, but instead they raised it. There aren't any new music 
 selections to choose from which is a big bummer.
  Now if you loved the first one, get the expansion. You will love it, but still see alot of problems 
 in it. I also set the difficulty to hard because of the micromanagment.

Review:  With Playing the movies lately i was on anticipation to get the add on. Well i got it and hear 
 we go.
  
  First Impression: New splash Screen... nice. Graphics are the same. The only addon that i see are 
 the stunt men. 
  
  - Gameplay: The gameplay hasnt really changed at all. There are a few awards that are added and 
 there are stunt men and some more action stuff. If your not into the making of your own personal 
 movie making than this really doesnt benifit you at all. The Major Pet Peeve is that there are 
 not enough workers to go around. Sure there are plenty when you first start and for the first 3 
 decades there are enough people. but then on out there isnt enough. If this was to be a true Sim 
 there should be a PANT load of people lined up to work at a movie company. For the next expansion 
 this should be fixed as well a nice Paper addon so you can do some classified adds for jobs should 
 be cool. 
  
  - Sound: The same as the original, Really nothing to fancy
  
  - Overall: Great idea for a Addon but in all essence creaters of games who make a addon or a part 
 2 should read reviews and take peoples comments serious.

Review:  Firstly, I have to admit I was a little disappointed with the first incarnation of The Movies. 
 Its tycoon play required too much micro-management, while the movie-making side of things was fairly 
 restricted and it took a lot of creativity to come up with something original. However, many of 
 these problems were fixed with the coming of Stunts and Effects.
  
  The expansion pack mainly consists of stunts, and some more effects (hence the title) . The stunts 
 add a lot to the realism of the game, being able to see cars roll, buildings explode and gunshots 
 actually affect the enviroment makes action and sci-fi movies a lot better. The addition of more 
 'scenes' in the movie-making editor also allows you to add a bit more variety to the movie. Stuntmen 
 are a reasonably well-balanced addition to the game, and do not require too much user attention 
 (apart from training them) . However, you will probably find that you will need one stuntman per 
 actor, as movie rating is affected by how well the person performing the stunt resembles the actor 
 they are replacing. Actors can perform their own stunts, however the risk of injury means this 
 is not a great idea unless you spend time training them up.
  
  The effects side of things is just as good. The new green screen set allows you to get those exterior 
 shots of spaceships and planes so you don't just see the inside of them. The blue screen set is 
 very, very flexible and will be a boon to people who just want to make their own set - it is essentially 
 a blank set where you can select the background, floor, props and any other stuff. The miniature 
 city is also great for exterior shots of buildings, and can really add a sense of scale to the 
 movie. There aren't many other new sets, although Activision have included the entire contents 
 of the Propshop from the Movies website (http://movies. lionhead. com) .
  
  The tycoon part of the game hasn't changed all that much, apart from the addition of stuntmen. 
 Unlike stars, stuntmen don't require trailers or an entourage and their mood is always the same, 
 although you will have to send them to the hospital every once in a while to repair the damage 
 caused by stunts. Some aspects of the game are also far more flexible, for example you can now 
 alter a star's weight in the makeover room. Unfortunately the problem of not having enough staff 
 for the studio is still not resolved and doesn't really represent the way the real world works 
 (it wouldn't be that hard to hire an extra builder in Hollywood, surely!) .
  
  Overall, the game is great, with the addition a new graphics engine to create weather and explosion 
 effects very useful. There was no real change in the sound, and as far a value goes it's fairly 
 standard for an expansion pack. My tilt is at 10 however, because Stunts and Effects did fix a 
 nasty graphical glitch I had using the makeover room in the original game. Stunts and effects is 
 probably more useful to people who focus on movie-making, but shoudl be enjoyed all round.

Review:  I just got Stunts & Effects yesterday. Actually, I'd stopped playing the movies months ago, frustrated 
 with how difficult it was to make a decent movie without having to jump through hoops trying to 
 use "work-arounds" that themselves don't work that good. Let me say now that I don't really like 
 the "tycoon" part of the game, it just involves too much micro-management! So this review will 
 be looking exclusively at the "movie-making" portion of the game.
  
  The Stunts & Effects expansion pack adds oodles of new options, and eye-candy to The Movies! The 
 special effects are spectacular looking, just as Hollywood blockbusters should be. Many of these 
 additions to the game are something that was sorely lacking. The ability to show what I'll call 
 "connecting" shots. Scenes that help to pull together different scenes that before would seem like 
 an awkward shift. One of the best of these involves the new "miniature city" set. With this set 
 you can do wide, panoramic shots of a modern day city, helicopter chase scenes, or just shots of 
 busy city traffic. This set alone helps to widen the scope of movies made with the game. 
  
  On the editing side of the story, the expansion pack seems to have addressed a slew of problems 
 with the advanced movie maker and post-production facilities. Editing seems to go much smoother 
 now and the glitch that caused voice-overs to echo seems to be gone. 
  
  The Stunts & Effects expansion pack is well worth the money, if you enjoy making movies with The 
 Movies, you can't do without this expansion pack!

Review:  The Movies is one of the best tycoon games to come out in recent years. Its first expansion pack, 
 Stunts and Effects, promises to give movie-makers more power and plenty of new stuff to use in 
 their films. The biggest question is: is that enough? Yes. Stunts and Effects adds a lot of new 
 scenes, costumes and more to the original game, but it's biggest addition is the stuntmen and stunt 
 films. Stuntmen are basically extras that are trained to preform stunts. You can train them on 
 stunts just like you train actors and can use them as stunt doubles for your most fragile actors. 
 More action sequences have been added to scene selection that use these stuntmen and push them 
 to their limits. If your stuntman get's banged up too much, you can send them to the hospital so 
 they can heal. A number of special effect sets have also been added including a blue screen, a 
 green screen, and a miniture city for those giant monster fight scenes you always wanted to do, 
 but couldn't in the original version. With it's $30 pricetag and the host of new features, Stunts 
 and Effects is easy to recomend for fans of The Movies.
  
  Gameplay: This expansion pack adds a lot of new features that make The Movies' fantastic gameplay 
 even better!
  
  Graphics: It looks pretty much the same as the original version.
  
  Sound: Ditto.
  
  Value: It's $30, which isn't that much of a strech for an expansion pack, 
 but that's a small price to pay for so many great additions.
  
  Final Thoughts: The Movies: Stunts and Effects is simply a must buy for everyone who loved the 
 original game and want to be more creative in their moviemaking.

Review:  Stunts & Effects is the first expansion for The Movies and it's worth buying. Last year, The Movies 
 got criticized of it's limited movie making parts. Hopefully, this expansion will feature lots 
 of new sets and scenes for movie-making lovers.
  
  The gameplay is just the same from the original game, with some additional micromanagement. Most 
 people complained about the micromanagement of this game like taking care of stars, managing the 
 lot and keep the money flowing. With this EP, taking care of stuntmen is the another micromanagement. 
 But it's not like the stars, the stuntmen only have two new additional 'needs'. The stunt skill 
 and condition. The stunt skill is how your stuntmen can perform well in some stunt difficulties. 
 This will greatly improve your movie ratings. Their skills can be trained in 3 new buildings. 
 
  
  As for the condition, everytime your stuntmen completed the training or finishing a stunt when 
 filming a movie, their condition will drop. If the condition is too low, the stunt can't be performed 
 well. You can tell how the stunt will success or fail by listening to the 'audiences' after each 
 stunt attempt. Injured or low conditioned stuntmen must be sent to the hospital (new building) 
 to recover. The condition will gradually recover but sending stuntmen to the hospital is the best 
 choice. Just don't try to send your stars to the hospital as their stress and boredom meter will 
 drop. There are lots of new sets and buildings like some of the sets from PropShop, miniature sets 
 and the blue screen set.
  
  The movie making part just got better. With the new free cam, you can move your camera everywhere 
 giving total freedom for your movies. Tons of scenes have been added that will give you more ideas 
 to make movies.
  
  The graphics and sounds deserved to get full scores. Everything in this game is very detailed like 
 you can even see some words in posters. The environment is very fresh and the characters textures 
 are amazing. One of the improved graphics in this game is the fires. You can see smokes formed 
 when a fire started. Moreover, the explosions are one of the best I've seen so far. The sounds 
 are very catchy as the explosion occurs. Despite the stars making repetitive gibberish voices when 
 making a movie, you can change it with a simple microphone. The radio station is quite humorous 
 and the DJ will sometimes change according to the year.
  
  I simply recommend this game for all you people who have the original game. You will never regret 
 buying it because the movie making is extended with lots of contents! For people who don't have 
 the original and EP, buy it for it's addictive tycoon part and it will keep you playing for hours!

Review:  I tried this game a few weeks ago, I wanted to buy it, but first I rented the game ... Its a fine 
 game if you want to distract your self a while, but at the end there is no background ..
  
  This is kind of a "sims" game, The Sims got Stunts :) its a linear kind of game, repetitive and 
 somehow a little bit boring, but worth the while if you are just looking to spend your time playing 
 something ...
  
  There is a game kind of, sort of, .... Fahrenheit or Indigo Prophecy, half a game half stunts ... 
 but there is background on the game, you can look fot it here on gamespot. com

Review:  I pretty much agree with the GS reviewer. This pack does add quite bit to the game, especially 
 for the "moviemaker" types. It also lets you jump right in to later periods (1960's, etc.) , so 
 you don't have to wait for the "good stuff" to come around. Anyway, it's a decent add pack that 
 enhances the game.
  
  My only objection is, and this is a left-over from the original game: The freaking lack of Staffing! 
 WHY would the designers include this kooky aspect to the game? Why can't we simply hire as many 
 people as we want, Lionhead? If I hire too many people and I go broke as a studio, then isn't that 
 my tough luck? And aren't people literally beating down the doors to get in to Hollywood studios 
 (in real life) ? As the reviewer said, this is annoying as ____ ! When are they going to fix this 
 quirk?

Review:  Hi. As most of you, when I heard that The Movies was coming out with an expansion pack, I was extatic! 
 I was so totally going to get it! I was looking at the videos, and pictures, and previews, and 
 walkthrough's! Then when I got it, I was as happy as could be! I played it, and then after 10-15 
 minutes, I started figuring out how to work things. It was great!
  
  The Movies: Stunts & Effects adds many new sets, scenes, objects and opptions. Let's talk about 
 new sets. Here are the new seta that I know of so far. Tropical: Jungle, Sci-Fi: Corridor 5, Sci-Fi: 
 Bridge 3, Urban: City Street 2, Moving Backdrop, Miniature City, The Blue Screen, and the Green 
 Screen. You also get the sets that are available in the Propshop on www. themoviesgame. com. Such 
 as: Suburban: Bathroom 2, Travelling Vehicle: Wild West, Wild West: Saloon Bedroom, Suburban: Haunted 
 Corridor, and Sci-Fi: Corridor 4. The Suburban: Haunted Corridor is a set that you have to unlock 
 in story mode by winning awards and stuff. So I haven't gotten it yet.
  
  I would go on and on about information about this wonderful game, but I have to go to bed. So, 
 I'll continue it later......... if I can.

Review:  Being a huge fan of the original game, The Movies, I was psyched to hear that an expansion pack 
 would be coming out. I pre-ordered it as soon as possible, and just not received it. Let me tell 
 you, this game does not disappoint. It gives you more of the same (and looking back at the last 
 game, that's not a bad thing at all) , plus a new punch with the stunts and special effects. Each 
 feature is implemented into the game superbly.
  
  GAMEPLAY: Although I normally dwell in the Sandbox Mode to create my movies, I have played through 
 the campaign ocassionally. They both work exactly the same, and the formula continues to impress. 
 The newly implemented FreeCam is taking some getting used to, but I'm still able to make some sweet 
 camera angles that I was unable to do in the first game. The game never grows boring. Believe it 
 or not, there are many things you can do during downtime. Think one of your actors is too fat? 
 Give him plastic surgery! Is one of your actors pissing you off? Get him drunk and photographed 
 by the journalists. That'll show him! The point is, there are lots of things you can do with your 
 actors. While they might be mundane in real life, the game makes it enjoyable to watch. Watching 
 the stuntmen train is one of my favorites in particular.
  
  GRAPHICS: More of the same. The graphics haven't changed, except for a few small details. For instance, 
 the quality of the explosions in the game have been ramped up. There's now more smoke and particle 
 effects, and in my opinion, it looks alot better than in the first game. The character animations 
 can bug me at some points, but I guess they overexaggerated them for a reason (to be funny) . I'll 
 let that slide. There haven't been many improvements in the graphics department, but the graphics 
 were already really good to begin with.
  
  SOUND: Again, more of the same. The music for this game is, as always, amazing. The radio broadcasts 
 continue to entertain with their humor. My only complaint is that during shooting, the mumbling 
 they put in for actor's voices gets really annoying sometimes. But hey, turning down the volume 
 can easily solve that. As it was said in the graphics section, not much has changed here, but since 
 when was that a bad thing?
  
  All in all, The Movies: Stunts and Effects continues to impress with its already-working formula 
 with the addition of explosive stunts to ramp up the Wow-factor of your movie. I would definitely 
 recommend picking this up. You're bound to have an explosively good time (oh, such a bad pun...) .
