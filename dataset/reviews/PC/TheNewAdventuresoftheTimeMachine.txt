:::Review:::
It's a nonsensical story periodically interrupted by a string of infuriating puzzles. 

 Much like Ring: Legend of the Nibelungen, The New Adventures of the Time Machine is another adventure 
 game sequel to a classic work. In this case, the classic work is H. G. Wells' novel, The Time Machine. 
 And, much like Ring, the game has very few redeeming qualities - it's a nonsensical story periodically 
 interrupted by a string of infuriating puzzles.   

  The title should be a warning. Can a time machine have adventures? And even if it could, would 
 they really be "new" to an object for which linear time is meaningless? Unfortunately, the premise 
 of the game makes even less sense than its moniker. You assume the role of H. G. Wells himself, 
 who takes a trip in his time machine. How this machine has gone from being a subject in one of 
 his novels to a real-life device is never explained. Wells lands in the year 800,000, where the 
 natives have magical powers. They also worship an hourglass and speak the Queen's English perfectly. 
 The only major change in the language is in Wells' name, which inexplicably becomes "Wales" once 
 he arrives in the new time.   

  Even if you choose to ignore the language issue or the hero's mysterious name change, there are 
 still several problems in the game from the outset. Among the most curious is how Wales was able 
 to build a time machine to begin with. One would assume some complex math and physics was involved, 
 but the hero apparently can't even do simple arithmetic. After traveling from 1839 to 800,000, 
 he exclaims "I'm stuck more than 800,000 years from my era!" Uh, no, he isn't.   

  You'd imagine that the year 800,000 is a very wondrous place. But it looks a great deal like the 
 year 800. Wales lands in a small desert community with no technology to speak of, save for its 
 fancy guns. The community is actually so uninteresting that he immediately starts looking for a 
 way home, which will be difficult because his machine disappears without a trace upon arrival. 
 "I need to get back to my world," he says over and over again. Luckily, no one's around to point 
 out that this is, in fact, his world. What's even luckier is the fact that he's one of the chosen 
 few who's been gifted with magical powers. He learns spells from the priests of the city, and the 
 head priest tells him to be virtuous. He then goes out and steals stuff and kills someone to solve 
 the game's first puzzles.   

  Like many Cryo games, Time Machine suffers from obtuseness. Characters throw nonsensical philosophy 
 at you like confetti, but there are never any dialogue options to further inquire about what is 
 being said. And the puzzles suffer from this problem as well - one character asks Wales to find 
 something for his back pain, and tells Wales that it's a common ointment. But the lack of dialogue 
 options makes asking anyone about it impossible.   

  In exchange for the ointment, this character gives Wales a missing holy relic that is required 
 to find the way to the next location. This would seem ridiculous, if it weren't explained by another 
 nonsensical plot point: At random times, a large wave sweeps the city, erases everyone's memory, 
 and changes everyone's age. Unfortunately, this has little impact on the gameplay.   

  The puzzles go on and on like this: You'll encounter sound puzzles, maze puzzles, and even a few 
 action sequences. The action sequences are made possible by the fact that, unlike most Cryo games, 
 The New Adventures of the Time Machine isn't a first-person adventure. Instead, the game's third-person 
 perspective is more reminiscent of Alone in the Dark or Grim Fandango.   

  This new perspective brings its own host of problems. The camera changes angles frequently - at 
 times, the ever-moving camera can even be somewhat nauseating - and the camera over-employs a sort 
 of fly-by effect in which Wales runs under the viewpoint while the camera tracks his movements. 
 The action sequences are frustrating, because the keyboard control is somewhat unresponsive. But 
 what's most frustrating is the intense slowing down that occurs after you've been playing for a 
 while. The game can slow to a crawl, which makes quitting and restarting your only option.   

 
  Time Machine does have one thing going for it: The backgrounds are nicely rendered. The 3D models 
 are a bit blocky, but the backgrounds look great.   

  Unfortunately, pretty pictures can't make up for the sheer number of frustrating elements in the 
 game in addition to the problems with the story, the puzzles, and the control. For instance, you 
 lose health when you save your game. Crucial cutscenes won't cue properly, which makes progress 
 impossible. The list of complaints goes on and on.   

  Basing adventure games on classic works is not a bad idea - Alice in Wonderland, Ulysses and the 
 Golden Fleece, and Below the Root are just a few examples of older games that used their source 
 material well. But The New Adventures of the Time Machine falls into another category, along with 
 Cryo's Ring and Byron Preiss Multimedia's The Martian Chronicles. They are bad games inspired by 
 great works of art.

Review:  This game is crap from the opening movie to the anti clamactic ending. honestly, I beat the game 
 without knowing what is happening because of a FRIGGIN BUG! friggin frustrating. Im supposed to 
 look in this thing (i wont give away the story for the people who make it a hobby wasting time 
 and money) , but after I trigger the cutsene, the character walks towards the thing, then right 
 into a CHAIR! he wont move past it, just running infront of the chair nonstop. I dont even know 
 what I was doing until a read a walkthrough. Oh, and when you fight some bosses, you cant even 
 see them cause of the nutty camera angle. Just shoot in the general direction and hope ya score 
 a hit. the only upside is there is a uninstall button in the game. I didnt hit it soon enough.
