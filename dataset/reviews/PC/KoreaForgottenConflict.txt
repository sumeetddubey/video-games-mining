:::Review:::
It's an admirable effort to make a Commandos-style game about the Korean War, but Forgotten Conflict 
 suffers from bugs, bad AI, and some frustrating gameplay. 

  Korea: Forgotten Conflict takes its name from the fact that the Korean War has always been overshadowed 
 by the two larger struggles that bookend it -- World War II and Vietnam. This holds true in gaming 
 as well. While there are plenty of World War II-based games and an emerging number of games about 
 the Vietnam War, very few games have been made about the Korean War. Korea: Forgotten Conflict 
 is the rare exception, and it's an attempt to take the gameplay of the World War II-based Commandos 
 games and transplant it to Korea. Czech developer Plastic Reality makes an admirable effort of 
 it with a beautiful 3D graphics engine, but, unfortunately, the end result is hampered by some 
 frustrating gameplay, poor AI, and bugs.  

          In order to steal a MiG, you have to get the hangar keys off of this Soviet adviser. It's 
 time for a little wet-work.     

  The gameplay in Korea: Forgotten Conflict could have been lifted straight out of any of the Commandos 
 games, as you're given command of a small squad of five commandos, each of whom has distinct skills 
 and personalities inspired from Hollywood war movies. Think of them as  The Dirty Half-Dozen, Minus 
 One . From a bird's-eye point of view, you'll control each of them as they infiltrate enemy territory 
 on a wide variety of missions -- from kidnapping Soviet advisers to blowing up a dam to rescuing 
 POWs to covertly stealing enemy plans. Success depends on timing and precision, in addition to 
 a great bit of luck.  

  The game's 12 massive levels are gorgeous and showcase environments that include the gutted streets 
 of Seoul, underground bunkers, a giant river dam, and a prisoner-of-war camp. Each level packs 
 an impressive amount of detail, and there's a wide range of interaction in each environment. One 
 of our favorite moments came when the commandos dug up an enemy minefield and repositioned the 
 mines into the path of the enemy. When you need to get around the map quickly, you can jump into 
 a number of drivable vehicles, including jeeps, trucks, and tanks. Quite often, the Korean member 
 of your team can steal an enemy uniform and drive a truck past a checkpoint while the rest of the 
 squad hides in the back.  

  In copying the Commandos formula so thoroughly, Korea also inherits many of the same problems. 
 While you're given a certain amount of open-endedness in how to accomplish your mission, there 
 are also plenty of moments when the designers force you to jump through hoops. For instance, it's 
 not enough that you can commandeer any number of enemy trucks on one map. To escape, you have to 
 commandeer a specific truck that's surrounded by guards. There's no good reason for this other 
 than to put yet another obstacle in front of you. Then there's the genre-wide contrivance that 
 each commando has a unique ability that only he can use. So only the engineer can plant explosives, 
 and only the medic can use the tranquilizer needle to knock out officers. It's an annoying gameplay 
 mechanic because these squad members have to be shepherded along just so you can put them in places 
 where they can use their special abilities.  

  Though it's possible to use stealth in a majority of the missions, it's incredibly easier to use 
 force. Using stealth means spending a lot of time analyzing enemy patrol patterns and then dashing 
 from hiding point to hiding point. The game then essentially becomes a timing puzzle that requires 
 plenty of saving and reloading before you get it right. Using force is a lot easier because the 
 AI is so lackluster. You can pick up and hide bodies, but it's not worth the trouble because the 
 enemy has an incredibly short memory. A guard who encounters one of his buddies lying dead on the 
 ground will only be alarmed for about 10 to 20 seconds before he resumes his patrol. In fact, we 
 had a commando who actually got caught rifling through an officer's quarters and was fired upon. 
 As a result, the commando quickly jumped into a closet. The enemy officer ran into the room, looked 
 around, and then walked away like nothing had ever happened.  

          This sentry doesn't seem too concerned that the rest of his squad is lying dead just a 
 few feet away, courtesy of our sniper.     

  The personalities of your squad members consist of some tired cliches. Your squad leader is B. J. 
 Goodlover, a Harlem native who also sounds like he's an extra from a '70s-era blaxploitation movie. 
 Nighthawk, the team's scout, is a Native American who spouts mystical mumbo jumbo like, "The desire 
 for knowledge of my grandmother flowers in me." Aside from the corny dialogue and some awkwardly-phrased 
 narration, the sound effects in the game are quite nice. For instance, during the battle for Seoul, 
 you can hear a fuzzy radio broadcasting a speech by President Truman while gunfire and artillery 
 boom in the background. The game's stability leaves much to be desired, though, as it constantly 
 crashes to the desktop and even shut our system down a few times. The frequency of crashes was 
 nearly unbearable until we turned off shadows and antialiasing. That drastically cut down on the 
 number of crashes, but it didn't eliminate them. Hopefully, the developers will provide a patch 
 to address these problems.  

  There's a lot of promise and potential in Korea: Forgotten Battles, but it's sadly crippled by 
 bugs and poor AI. Plastic Reality has some good technology at work, so if they can address the 
 game's problems, it bodes well for future efforts. For now, Korea: Forgotten Battles remains a 
 somewhat flawed Commandos clone.

Review:  This Game could have been so good but know its most frustrating!!
  The graphics and gameplay is very good but what will that do when the game crashes every half hour. 
 Even if you update with the newest patch!!
  I really tried to play the game to its end but after half the game it wouldnt run anymore. The 
 length of the game for they who can play the whole is ok but not more and the sound is also ok
