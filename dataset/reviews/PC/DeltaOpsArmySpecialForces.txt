:::Review:::
Delta Ops: Army Special Forces is an awful game that isn't worth your time or money, and that simply 
 shouldn't exist. 

  Remember the 2002 budget game Shadow Force: Razor Unit? Probably not. As forgettable as budget 
 PC games get, Shadow Force was a shabby, uninteresting first-person shooter that put you in the 
 soldier role as a member of the Air Force Special Operations Unit. The levels were ugly, the AI 
 was a mess, and the game was simply not worth the time or effort it took to play. Nearly two years 
 after Shadow Force, Activision Value released a "new" game called Delta Ops: Army Special Forces. 
 And by "new," we mean "Shadow Force with a new name."  

          Delta Ops: Army Special Forces is really just Shadow Force: Razor Unit with a new name 
 slapped on the box.     

  The only indicator that an otherwise-unsuspecting customer would get that this is actually a 2002 
 release is found on the back of the box, where the package admits, in fine print, that Delta Ops 
 was "previously released as Shadow Force." However, if you look a little deeper, you'll see a few 
 other signs that this game isn't a recent development. For instance, the game tries to install 
 DirectX 8.1 as part of its install process, even if you already have a later version installed. 

  After an entirely needless training session, the game drops you into the desert for 10 levels of 
 bad enemy AI, ugly graphics, and, above all, very boring gameplay. While the game gives you objectives 
 to complete, none of them are interesting enough to cut through the game's problems. Even when 
 you compare it to the fairly low standards of most budget games, Delta Ops comes up short. The 
 weapons are bland, the controls for picking up or manipulating items are clunky, and there really 
 just isn't enough to do.  

  Interestingly enough, some changes have been made to the game, but they don't really improve matters 
 very much. Finding multiplayer games -- if there were any -- in Shadow Force was nearly impossible, 
 since the game didn't have an in-game server browser, and it didn't offer support for third-party 
 browser tools. Delta Ops has a server browser and a lobby option, which is nice because it takes 
 the guesswork out of the process and lets you know right off the bat that there aren't any multiplayer 
 servers running. In the strange event that you were to actually find a server running, or if you 
 wanted to mess around with the game's dodgy, well-hidden bot support, you'd be able to play deathmatch, 
 team deathmatch, or capture the flag in 16-player matches.  

  Graphically, Delta Ops wasn't a looker when it was released in 2002. So, as you can imagine, it 
 certainly doesn't look any better today. The movement feels jerky, the textures are a total mess, 
 and the environments are completely bland. In addition to that, on some machines, the game runs 
 at a stuttery, unplayable pace. This isn't a system requirements issue, since the systems we tested 
 it on outpace the game's measly Pentium II requirements by a long shot, but it affects everything -- from 
 the gameplay to the video intro to the menu screens.  

          Shadow Force was a pretty bad game, and rereleasing it well over a year later certainly 
 doesn't improve its chances.     

  The game's sound certainly doesn't save it either. Delta Ops has some voice work that pops up throughout 
 the missions -- usually to point you in the right direction -- but it sounds incredibly unprofessional, 
 both in content and in recording. It's almost as if the developer just had the programmers step 
 up to a broken stick microphone so that they could record some random dialogue.  

  There's really no need for this game to exist. For Activision Value to have essentially repackaged 
 a bad old game as a bad new game is an obvious and despicable attempt to cash in on the recent 
 military operations going on in the Middle East. Despite this, Delta Ops: Army Special Forces is 
 an awful game that isn't worth your time or money. Avoid it at all costs.

Review:  Although all other reviews of this game piont to a worthless game, I didn't notice its strong points 
 mentioned - the guns are very well modelled and the aiming system is good, the multiplayer would 
 also be ok if any servers were running. The single player campaign is also quite fun at first. 
 Having said that, the maps are terrible and all of the single player missions have predictable, 
 basic AI. It becomes tedious after the first few missions and I gave up half way through from boredom. 
 One thing that may make this game worth getting however is that if you're totally skint then you 
 can buy it for next to nothing and it will probably seem to be worth more than you bought it for. 
 The game may last a bit longer after the singleplayer missions as you can play the multiplayer 
 maps with some (poor) bots if you want.

Review:  First of all, this is the down right worst game ever played. I've seen games come out in 1998 and 
 1999 with better graphics than these. The game play is stupid, well, not that stupid, but stupid. 
 The only thing that makes the game's score better is that when u r wounded, you will become dizzy, 
 even that isn't well made.
  
  The weapons were boring, and the worst part of all, no blood. When you shoot someone, there's suppose 
 to be blood, but in this game, no blood to be seen. The AI is stupid, all it does is walk sideways 
 everywhere firing aimlessly. Plus, stealth is not a factor here, they know you're coming. The first 
 mission, i was crouching down and slowly making it around a large rock not making a sound, when 
 all of a sudden a bunch of terrorists jump in front of me.
  
  Also, the bad point is that you cannot regain health, once u lost it, its gone. The music was awful, 
 the speech was awful, and you will never ever want to play this game again once your finish with 
 it. EVER! 
  
  Do not get this game, and I do believe that no stores still have it in stock. Thank you stores...
