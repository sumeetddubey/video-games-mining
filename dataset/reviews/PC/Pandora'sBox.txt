While the individual pieces may be a bit weak on their own, the overall experience is satisfying 
 and worthwhile. 

 Alexei Pajitnov's name will forever be linked to Tetris, arguably the best puzzle game of all time. 
 Luckily, the accomplishment of designing what is probably the most addictive game ever overshadows 
 his recent track record, which includes mediocre selections such as Microsoft Puzzle Collection 
 and a string of mediocre games for MicroProse, including Knight Moves and Qwirks, a poor PC adaptation 
 of the excellent Puyo Puyo.  

 Pajitnov's latest, Pandora's Box, is a welcome return to form. While not quite as mind-and-finger-numbingly 
 addictive as the game he is famous for, it still makes for a fun diversion.  

 Pandora's Box isn't actually a single game, but rather a collection of ten different puzzle types. 
 For the most part, each type is a variation on the jigsaw puzzle, and some are more fun than others. 
 In each puzzle, you must arrange the pieces to complete a picture or an object. What the pieces 
 are, and what you need to do to arrange them properly, differs from puzzle to puzzle.  

 The puzzle types themselves range from renovated versions of old favorites, such as Rotoscope, a 
 circular slider puzzle, to innovative variations like Outer Layer, which requires you to place 
 the textures on a 3D object such as a vase or a sculpture. Other puzzles types are a bit more typical. 
 Overlap is a straightforward jigsaw puzzle; the only difference is that the pieces can, as the 
 name suggests, overlap. Slices is simply a vertical jigsaw puzzle that requires you to stack pieces 
 of a 3D object. And Focus Point, the best of the lot, requires you to assemble out-of-focus pieces 
 of an image.  

 There are also two puzzle types that stray from the jigsaw formula. Image Hole, probably the least 
 interesting puzzle in the game, involves a covered picture. Shapes move around the board, revealing 
 the image as they pass over. Your goal is to line up the shape with its corresponding portion of 
 the picture underneath. It sounds interesting, but the shapes are too vague to make it anything 
 more than frustrating most of the time. The other non-jigsaw puzzle is Find and Fill. In this puzzle, 
 you are presented with a picture with sections missing and a separate jumble of shapes. You must 
 use a simple paint program to find and fill the shapes that are missing from the picture. It's 
 fun, but the picture that's provided for reference is so tiny the puzzle often ends up being nothing 
 more than a guessing game.  

 What makes Pandora's Box more interesting than just a puzzle anthology is its attempt to give meaning 
 to the proceedings. The story follows the basics of the Greek myth from which the game takes its 
 name. Pandora has unleashed chaos - in the form of seven trickster gods - into the world, and you 
 must recapture them. To do this, you must solve puzzles. What's intriguing is that the jigsaw nature 
 of the puzzles fits the theme somewhat - you must restore order to chaos by piecing together fragments 
 of puzzles into a whole - and your overall sense of purpose, even if it's the most basic "find 
 the stuff" premise, is rare for the genre.  

 You must capture the seven tricksters: mythological and religious figures such as Eris, Puck, and 
 Coyote. You pursue each of them to several cities, each of which has ten puzzles. Under one of 
 the puzzles is a piece of the box. There are four pieces associated with each of these mischievous 
 spirits, and once you have obtained all four pieces from one, you then go after the trickster himself. 
 Once you've captured him, you move on to the next trickster, the next set of cities, and the next 
 set of puzzles. There's a lot to do and a lot of puzzles to solve. The escalating difficulty and 
 the slow introduction of new puzzle types help to keep things interesting.  

 Pandora's Box isn't the Half-Life of puzzle games, but it is revolutionary in a sense. It's not 
 only a great way to divert yourself for short periods of time, but the overall sense of accomplishment 
 you'll feel when you complete a series of its puzzles makes it something you'll go back to time 
 and time again. And while the individual pieces may be a bit weak on their own, the overall experience 
 is satisfying and worthwhile.

Review:  Pandora's box is a game that I've bought many years before (in fact when it was released) . i was 
 curious and desperate to find out how a puzzle game was. And then I saw it. I was a bit unsure 
 for my choice... but I was absolutely right!
  
  Unlike other games of the same genre, Pandora's Box is a game with a well-based scenario, which 
 is part of the greek mythology. Furthermore, unlike the majority of them, the puzzles are not such 
 as real life's ones. There is a variety of puzzle types which will keep you interested. Another 
 amazing feature is that you must solve puzzles throughout the globe, which means that you will 
 find puzzles associated with a great number of civilizations. Finally, the soundtracks associated 
 with each city you visit are perfect, while they are don't prevent you from concentrating to the 
 puzzle which you're solving-they are proved a great help instead.
  
  Of course there are no cons!

Review:  Pandora's Box is a puzzle game. Not a game where you walk around a world solving puzzles. No, a 
 real actual puzzle game. How could it possibly be interesting you ask?
  
  Well, first of all, there are A LOT of puzzles. Like a few hundreds of them, and they're all very 
 different. As you progress through the game, you will travel to different locations in the world 
 influencing the themes of the puzzles, some which may be pictures of a city, while others can be 
 paintings or even sculptures and vases. This implies a large variety of puzzle types. Also, you 
 will hear different parts of interesting legends as you solve them and you're allowed to choose 
 which type you want to do next.
  
  Secondly, the music is fantastic. Each country visited has its own unique soundtrack that doesn't 
 prevent you from concentrating and gives you a feeling of being away from home. The graphics are 
 good but not revolutionary, but the layout of the game screen is quite original.
  
  In overall, I would recommend this game for anyone who likes the genre and the joy of travelling.

Review:  Great gameplay, inventive and varied puzzles makes this game a no brainer for a bargain price. 
 While the game consists mostly of still pictures and making them together, the way you put them 
 - and there are quite a few on this game - is a hell lot of fun, and challenge. Of course in the 
 end the game is allways the same, and some of the puzzles arent as good as others and to progress 
 you have to do some of the less enjoyable ones, wich somehow makes the experience less satisfying. 
 But still a great game and a great choice for a few hours fun.
