:::Review:::
It's not as addictive as the original, but it's still a lot of fun. 

 As if strategy gamers didn't have enough reasons to lose sleep this holiday season, MicroProse has 
 unveiled its latest add-on for Civilization II. Civ II: Fantastic Worlds is not just another group 
 of historical scenarios but a set of bizarre, intriguing, and sometimes funny variations on the 
 all-time classic strategy game. It's not as addictive as the original, of course, but it's still 
 a lot of fun.  

 Fantastic Worlds patches Civ II to version 2.42 and also creates a duplicate copy of the original 
 civ2. exe file. More importantly, Fantastic Worlds adds 19 scenarios and a host of new editing tools 
 to help simplify the art of designing your own visions of world domination. As you might expect, 
 Fantastic Worlds requires the original Civilization II to run.  

 MicroProse designed eleven of the game's scenarios, including tributes to X-COM, Master of Magic, 
 and Master of Orion. Others include a very cool Age of Reptiles scenario and one based in the world 
 of Jules Verne's classic novels. Like the first Civ II add-on pack, this one also features several 
 scenarios created by dedicated Civ II players. Grouped under the heading "Best of the Net II," 
 these include a Christmas-theme variation called Santa is Coming (my favorite) , along with a great 
 Battle of the Sexes scenario.  

 Gameplay is basically the same old Civ for most of these scenarios, though a majority of them are 
 "total war" scenarios in which spacecraft development is unimportant. Some of the MicroProse scenarios 
 include custom music, while many of the others include customized unit and terrain art.  

 The briefing for each scenario is pretty skimpy. In fact, some are downright inadequate. The manual 
 offers some basic information, but you'll have to rely heavily on the Civilopedia for many of these 
 missions - especially the Age of Reptiles. Not only do you have to brush up on your paleontology 
 to identify the various beasties, but you also have to relearn all of the civilization advances. 
 After all, you might find that researching spiny fins is more important than acquiring duckbills. 

 The X-COM and Santa scenarios are the most enjoyable. The familiar, eerie atmosphere of the original 
 X-COM is fairly well represented in its Civ II scenario. The moon of Phobos is the setting and 
 you must lead your forces against eight well-defended alien bases. The art and music are customized 
 for this one and the objectives are quite challenging. The Santa scenario, on the other hand, is 
 just plain fun. After all, how often do you get the chance to crush rival toy makers under your 
 jolly, shiny black boots?  

 Civ II thrilled long-time Civ fans with its scenario editor, but Fantastic Worlds ups the ante. 
 This game includes several powerful editors that let you customize everything from unit types and 
 appearance to tribe behavior and event scripting. You can edit existing scenarios or create them 
 from the ground up, customizing just about every aspect of Civ II play. Creating an entire scenario 
 is still a time-consuming effort, of course, but these new editors help make the process much more 
 intuitive.  

 I didn't run into too many problems with Fantastic Worlds, except for one notable glitch during 
 the New World scenario. After acquiring the advancements necessary to build several military units, 
 I was unable to access these units from my city build windows. Regardless of how many times I tried, 
 I was never able to build anything more powerful than an archer. Needless to say, my tribe was 
 wiped out quickly and decisively.  

 Still, the rest of the scenarios are quite enjoyable and challenging. If you're looking to play 
 or create some new Civ II adventures, you'll definitely need to get your hands on Fantastic Worlds.
