Good looks and a fast pace don't add up to top-shelf gameplay, and Redline Racer falls a bit flat 
 where it could have easily excelled. 

 Redline Racer from Criterion Studios and Ubi Soft is a slick-looking motorcycle racing game that 
 delivers arcade-racing action at breakneck speeds. Unfortunately, good looks and a fast pace don't 
 add up to top-shelf gameplay, and Redline Racer falls a bit flat where it could have easily excelled. 

 The game features ten tracks and eight bikes, but - as in most arcade racers - you don't have access 
 to all of these when you start out. Instead, you begin with a choice of three tracks and three 
 bikes. Once you manage to win a few races at increasingly tough difficulty settings, you'll gain 
 access to more tracks and more bikes.  

 The tracks start out with fairly simple designs and progress to much-more-challenging courses with 
 numerous hairpin curves. Settings include desert roads, sandy beaches, and a racetrack encircling 
 a large castle. Gameplay is run-of-the-mill arcade racing against 15 AI opponents, with a timer 
 and checkpoints that enable you to increase your racing time. Annoyingly, there is no option to 
 disable the timer in the arcade mode. Of course, you can get around the time limits by racing in 
 time trial mode, but then you can only race against a single ghost racer. For some reason, this 
 game offers no championship mode that links a bunch of tracks together. Multiplayer options are 
 pretty solid, with support for up to eight players via direct link, modem, LAN, or Internet connections. 

 Though the bikes at your disposal have four different attributes (top speed, acceleration, handling, 
 and braking) , the only ratings that seem to matter are top speed and handling. On the snow-swept 
 roadways of Le Grand Blanc, in fact, a good handling rating seemed absolutely crucial. Still, the 
 different ratings don't have as much of an effect as they should. Acceleration in particular seems 
 rather useless, as you can jump to your top gear in about five seconds even on bikes with poor 
 acceleration ratings (and the computer-controlled bikes consistently out-accelerate you off the 
 line even when you have the best bikes) .   

 Redline Racer's strongest point is its graphics engine, which is for the most part simply phenomenal. 
 The game's viewing distance alone is extremely impressive, as you can see the upcoming twists and 
 turns clear as day - there is none of that lame "gray curtain" fogging to hide the draw-in (which 
 is minimal) . The tracks are nicely detailed and most include some sort of animated landmark - waves 
 lapping at the beach, an operating ski lift, a passenger train, and even a helicopter are among 
 the most notable. The bikes and riders are pretty well modeled, but you'll find plenty of sharp 
 edges in both. Also, I noticed that my rear wheel disappeared midway through some of my races - 
 I could still race, I just couldn't see the wheel anymore. Finally, you'll see into and through 
 walls and other boundaries if you get too close to them - not a critical weakness, but something 
 that stands out in an otherwise stellar graphics engine.  

 You'll run across plenty of crashes as you race around the tracks in Redline Racer. No, the game 
 itself doesn't crash (at least, not that I noticed) , but you and your bike will. This game employs 
 collision detection algorithms that can only be described as baffling. If you steer too far to 
 either side of any track (and even sometimes when you stay right in the middle) , you seem to have 
 a 50-50 chance of catching some invisible bump and flying headlong through the air while your bike 
 bounces along beneath you. Other racers can sometimes cause you to crash, while at other times 
 you can bump and bounce your way through them as if they didn't exist. Inconsistent seems to be 
 the operative word in this game, which is a shame because it otherwise has the makings of a truly 
 enjoyable arcade racer.  

 Overall, Redline Racer is the sort of game that should provide a modest thrill for any arcade racing 
 fan who doesn't mind timer-limited racing, getting upended by invisible obstacles, or the occasional 
 graphics glitch.
