:::Review:::
Much of War Inc.'s potential goes unfulfilled because the real-time combat doesn't measure up.

 War Inc. is a game that, at first gander, looks like it has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, much 
 of that potential goes unfulfilled because of a real-time combat mode that doesn't measure up. 

 There's a lot to like in War Inc., which looks like Jagged Alliance crossed with Command &amp; Conquer 
 and Capitalism. The premise puts you in charge of a private security force that performs "services" 
 for major corporations. Each element of your corporation is under your control: investments, research, 
 designing and building units, selecting freelance jobs, creating a grand strategy, and fighting 
 the battle itself.   

 The over-arching design has a lot to recommend it. The big picture is controlled from your "office," 
 and allows you to dabble in as much or as little of the detail work as you want. Finances and research 
 can be handled automatically, or you can control them personally. Using the financial screen, you 
 buy and sell stocks to try to drive your profits up and attempt to take over other companies. Some 
 information on the performance of these stocks is provided, but more is needed to make this segment 
 of the game useful to the novice.   

 The money you make can be put back into hiring researchers and designing new units. Research gives 
 you access to better classes of hulls, weapons, armor, engines, and other features that compose 
 a unit. To make the most of these advances, War Inc. enables you to put your own vehicles together, 
 equipping them with the firepower, horsepower, technology, and other features for a completely 
 custom set of fighting units. This is very nicely done.  

 As freelance missions become available, you can choose which ones to take, with victory yielding 
 a profit ($5 million, for instance) . Of course, your operating expenses come out of this, so you 
 not only have to fight the battle, but fight it cheaply. Creating a strategic approach to each 
 mission is made possible with a planner that lays out all the objectives. You begin with a base 
 that enables the construction of units. Once your forces are built, you can divide them up among 
 different squads and send them out to attack the primary, secondary, and tertiary targets in real 
 time. When a strike force reaches a target zone, the game drops into a real-time combat mode.  
 

 And here's where the game falls flat. Everything leading up to the combat (maybe 20 percent of the 
 game) is quite interesting. The other 80 percent is a whackingly subpar Command &amp; Conquer-style 
 real-time combat game. Enemy AI is marginal, and battles always seem to unfold the same way, with 
 a large strike force winning the day over any tactical finesse. Units have strange properties, 
 with soldiers using TOW missiles on each other and strolling blithely by enemies without attacking. 
 The maps aren't very good, the graphics are boring, and the soldiers are rather dim. All the good 
 stuff that came before can't make up for this.  

 In addition, missions seem to follow similar patterns of attack an objective, fall back for base 
 defense, attack another objective, defend, and so on. This makes even the finest grand-strategy 
 seem a bit pointless. There's a single campaign game, some quick combat, and network play, but 
 I just wish it all added up to a more satisfying experience. I also wish it were more stable: It 
 crashes often, refuses to run in Windows 95, and has a flawed, outdated DOS installation routine. 
   

 As it is, despite some interesting and innovative touches, War Inc. will be buried beneath the coming 
 flood of real-time games. And that's a shame because it started out looking like a real contender.

Review:  I won't bore you unless you want to hear about the good stuff. This game sucked, and the RTS portions 
 were too linear and confined. Where this game really shined was in between missions. 
  
  Basically you run a mercenary company and accumulate money for completing missions. You use that 
 money and other resource (s) during your missions to build units. Between missions you use your 
 money for hiring scientists, researching and unlocking techs. 
  
  Here is where one of the best freaking RTS portions come into play. You use the tech you have researched 
 to design your own units, or upgrade existing ones. You pick a base unit or chassy, like the "jeep." 
 It will have a certain number of points that you can put weapons on. Then you add, engines, armor, 
 weapons, computer chips (for sight) , and other equipment. So say you slap the largest gun you can 
 on the jeep (like a mini-gun) biggest engine you have, best computer chip, and very light armor 
 and you have a reasonable land scout that pops like a balloon but can get the jump on some units 
 and mow down infantry or be a problem for light aircraft.
  
  I have yet to see any other RTS add this depth of unit creation. Frankly its the kind of feature 
 that would set other RTS's apart from the rest of the pack. Lets face it. The market is saturated 
 with RTSs these days. Some are good, some are bad, some are ugly. But, the only games you can find 
 unit construction options in are strategy games. I would love to see this feature reawakened and 
 in more games. Sure, not everyone is interested in it (like I am) but think of the possibilities 
 and new dynamics in multiplayer games.
  
  Ok, I am slightly stretching the truth. Cyberstorm, and Cyberstorm 2 you could customize your units 
 somewhat. I admittedly have not played all the RTSs out there either, I'm just trying to let people 
 know what I like.
