:::Review:::
It not only makes all the wrong moves, but it also finds new and innovative ways to make them.

  There are a number of surefire ways to ruin an otherwise perfectly good game. Unfortunately for 
 Druuna: Morbus Gravis, it features many of these design problems. The game is plagued by poor control, 
 an unintuitive interface, time limits, ugly graphics, grating music, and one of the worst save-game 
 systems ever devised. It not only makes all the wrong moves, but it also finds new and innovative 
 ways to make them.           Druuna's world is drab and ugly.    

  Druuna: Morbus Gravis is based on Paolo E. Serpieri's graphic novel of the same name, which was 
 in turn based on his comic series from the bastion of nudie science fiction,  Heavy Metal  magazine. 
 Visually, you get mostly what you'd expect: an abnormally buxom heroine and a menagerie of strange 
 creatures that are more often than not shaped like things usually hidden by bathing suits.   

 
  The premise could make for a good game. Druuna is in a sort of coma, and you must access her memories 
 to restore her to consciousness. You do this through the "brain container," a device that lets 
 you enter her mind, move around in her synapses, enter her memories, solve puzzles, and then move 
 on to the next memory. It's an interesting premise; back in 1998, Sanitarium proved that an adventure 
 game based on exploring someone's psyche could be both frightening and entertaining.   

  Although the concept isn't bad, the execution is. Druuna's psyche is fragile, and certain situations 
 take her closer to the point of no return -- situations such as physical exertion, getting too close 
 to monsters, and saving the game. Druuna has three statistics that you must keep an eye on -- cognitive 
 effort is a measure of how much time you've spent in her brain, cardiac activity rises in stressful 
 or physical situations, and nervous tension increases when the other two increase. You can reset 
 the first two at the expense of the third, but when nervous tension gets too high, you are cut 
 off permanently. You can save the game or continue at a predetermined location after dying, but 
 either of these actions causes a decrease in her mental well-being. After a certain number of saves 
 or continues or just spending too long trying to figure things out, you'll be unable to go on. 
   

  Never has a game been so dead-set on making you fail and then punishing you so severely for doing 
 so. The adventure game sequences are broken into two distinct types. The most common is like something 
 out of a typical 3D adventure game, in which you walk around the world, pick things up, and solve 
 puzzles. Actual puzzles are very rare -- mostly you'll just be maneuvering through silly mazes and 
 jumping over holes in the floor. There are other equally uninspired action sequences -- for example, 
 having to walk and duck under a pair of spinning metal blocks.   

  These sections would be unexciting in any game, but Druuna's control scheme makes getting through 
 them downright unpleasant. Druuna walks, ducks, and turns slowly. She can run, but doing so causes 
 her vital signs to become unstable. You can execute a quick 90-degree turn, but often you'll need 
 something more precise than that to move around in the narrow environments. It's almost impossible 
 to adjust her direction while moving, so you must stop her, do her little shufflelike turn, and 
 then hope you are lined up perfectly with whatever area you are trying to get to. If she's too 
 near an object, she can't turn at all, so you need to back her up and try again. The keyboard controls 
 are unresponsive in the extreme -- there are moments when you'll hit a key two or three times before 
 she responds.   

  And while the control problems are bad in the action sequences, they are even worse in what the 
 manual calls the "interactive segments." These are nothing more than reaction-based puzzles reminiscent 
 of the game Dragon's Lair, in which you must hit the appropriate arrow key when it is indicated 
 on the screen. Often, though, you'll need to hit the key before the indicator appears, as the game 
 takes a moment to register your keystroke. In either type of puzzle, you'll inevitably die a few 
 times. But because of the aforementioned save and continue restrictions, you'll end up reverting 
 to a much earlier position, losing a great deal of progress and having to jump over a bunch of 
 annoying holes you've already jumped over before you get to the problem area, fail, and repeat 
 the whole process again.           The action puzzles are incompatible with the horrible controls. 
    

  Fans of the Druuna comics may appreciate seeing some vague semblance of the original in 3D, but 
 for the uninitiated, it all just looks bland and ugly. The "erotic" moments -- there's plenty of 
 topless cavorting -- just look embarrassing due to the simple character models. There's some attention 
 to detail in the environments, but they're mostly just your average, dystopian empty warehouses, 
 filled with scrap metal and hanging wires. Some of the creatures look decent, but they are all, 
 with the exception of Druuna, burdened with terrible voices. And the whole game is saddled with 
 a boring metal/techno soundtrack that probably sounds "edgy" to some people but in reality just 
 sounds like a new-metal version of the theme from  Melrose Place .   

  And after a few hours in Druuna's psyche, you'll begin to wonder if saving her mind is really worth 
 losing your own.
