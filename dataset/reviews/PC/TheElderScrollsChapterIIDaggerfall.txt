:::Review:::
Someone has finally returned to the RPGs of the old school and created an adventure that will take 
 even the most experienced gamer months to unravel. 

 It's been a long time coming, but someone has finally returned to the RPGs of the old school and 
 created an adventure that will take even the most experienced gamer months to unravel in a world 
 incredibly full of life and experience. That someone is Bethesda and the product is The Elder Scrolls: 
 Daggerfall, the follow-up to the popular TES: Arena. From start to finish, Daggerfall shows itself 
 to be an epic product that surpasses the time-crunching power of even the legendary RPGs of old. 

 At its core, Daggerfall is a well-written adventure game with solid role-playing systems plopped 
 into what is basically an action engine. Players design their character using a creation routine 
 that is second to none, choosing from one of 18 classes that includes knight, warrior, healer, 
 assassin, and sorcerer, or design their own with a specialized sub-creation system. Those who aren't 
 into RPG statistics can let the computer make the choice by answering a moral quiz (&amp; agrave; 
 la Ultima IV) that selects the class most appropriate to the player's personality. Once that's 
 finished, players take control of their alter-ego through a first-person interface that in many 
 ways resembles the Ultima Underworld series. From here, as if actually transported to another realm, 
 players are free to do whatever they wish, with computer response mirroring that of the real world. 

 Although Daggerfall does sport an absorbing storyline (several, in fact) , it's the potential for 
 adventure outside of the standard plot that is so exciting. No longer forced to play the way The 
 Man wants, we are now free to ignore the pleadings of the princess, wander off, and get involved 
 in other complex tales that change and evolve in response to our actions! Here lies the greatest 
 strength and weakness of Daggerfall. Those who are looking for an adventure that follows a straight 
 path, that they can sit down and solve, are bound to be terrified (and annoyed) by the entropic 
 nature of this game. Since, as in the real world, events take place at certain times and in certain 
 places, it's also very easy for players to stray accidentally from the beaten path, just because 
 they decided to stop for a bite to eat. It's also easy to get wrapped up in struggles between the 
 game's various guilds without even meaning to. If you join a guild, you instantly make several 
 new friends and even more enemies, and open up new adventure opportunities. The sheer size of this 
 product is staggering, and even the most open-minded player is certain to be overwhelmed at times 
 by the thousands of people to talk to, the scores of weapons and spells to keep up with, the hundreds 
 of books to read, and the vast amount of landscape to cover in the game. To play Daggerfall successfully 
 requires one of two mind-sets: to remain ever-vigilant, taking notes and going exactly when and 
 where you're told; or to relax and let life take you where it will.  

 Daggerfall is not without its problems. By creating such a large world, Bethesda must have made 
 it impossible for play testers to even scratch the surface of the play possibilities. Players who 
 are determined to push the envelope - crawling, jumping, and swimming into every crevice of the 
 landscape - are sure to find themselves stuck between two polygons with no way to continue except 
 for suicide. Along these same lines is the game's tendency to crash occasionally for what seems 
 to be no reason at all. Patches are bound to be forthcoming, but for now my recommendation is to 
 save early and save often.  

 For those willing to exercise a little patience with its quirks, Daggerfall will deliver some of 
 the most entertaining and absorbing adventures available. Those who are even the slightest bit 
 put off by subtle storylines or RPG statistics, however, will probably find the game totally unbearable. 
 The bottom line is this: RPGs have always attracted a fanatical core group, and this title was 
 designed with those hard-core gamers in mind. For the rest of you, play another round of Quake 
 and leave the adventuring to the pros.

Review:  Having played Elder Scrolls: Arena a time or two before Daggerfall came out, I was eager to play 
 this game and see what the sequal would do for me. The graphics looked great and the gameplay was 
 fun. 
  
  I never got too far in this game and that was for one reason: the dungeons. I remember having to 
 enter a dungeon for a quest and finding it absoluetly impossible to find my way out of. I ended 
 starting anew and made sure to get the recall spell so I could set a recall point at the entrance. 
 That was just too tedious and the dungeons were still too rediculous. The rest of the game was 
 fine, and improvement over Arena.
  
  I have since lost my copy of Daggerfall but have discovered a Daggerfall strategy guide at my parents' 
 house not too long ago that must have stayed around. It was worth a good chuckle and nostalgia 
 to thumb through the thing. 
  
  It is interesting to note that Arena can be downloaded free of charge now and playable via a dos 
 emulator. You want old school, then you play that game and see what started this whole shebang!

Review:  Sure I was gaming long before I began doing so on the PC. Scratched the surface on some Atari, 
 of course endless hours on NES, Genesis, SNES, on and on it goes. But in 1996 a game was released 
 that would forever change the way I looked at my favorite hobby. A game that re-defined everything 
 I was used to, and thought a game should be. The game responsible for taking my console gaming 
 obsession to another platform, and making a new obsession that still stands today. That game was 
 Bethesda's second chapter in the Elder Scrolls saga: Daggerfall.
  My cousin dropped off his copy one day stressing the fact that I HAD to play this game. Well, after 
 he took it back, I was lost, and had to get my dad to send me a copy from across the country because 
 it was hard to find here where I'm from! This game was full of bugs, but it's the only game that 
 the bugs didn't bother me. It's that good. Everything from the music, the weapons system, guild 
 interaction, skill development- you name it I love it. I was only 12 years old when it was released 
 but it left memories I will keep forever. I still refer to it sometimes when I'm waiting for that 
 next great experience. The next great 'masterpiece'. The next... Daggerfall!

Review:  Daggerfall is a computer roleplaying game (CRPG) . You create a "character", a person who is to 
 be your host body in the game world. You then possess this character as a young adult. You see 
 the world of Tamriel through your character's eyes and hear it through his or her ears. In effect, 
 your character is your incarnation in Daggerfall, and it's up to you to make your own fate in a 
 world filled with conflict and magic.
  
  Most computer roleplaying games (like "Ultima" or "Might & Magic") are based on a group of characters 
 (a "party" in RPG jargon) . This is a heritage from the original role playing games played by a 
 group of friends around a table, with pencil and dice. Daggerfall accepts and embraces the fact 
 that most computer players now play alone. (No, there is not a network or internet option. Sorry.) 
 In Daggerfall, you are your own man or woman. If you choose to spend all your time studying spells, 
 you will have that much less experience with weapons, and the other way around. It is up to you 
 to find the right balance, and take the time you need to build your skills.
  
  Most significant, however, is the fact that you are on your own. The creators are not holding your 
 hand. There is a main quest which you can follow if you feel like it, but you can ignore it completely 
 if you prefer to pursue other goals. (Actually the main quest is sort of frustrating, in my opinion, 
 and hardly worth the trouble.) The appeal of Daggerfall is in its openness. It is not like a narrow 
 path, but like a wide open plain with only scattered landmarks.
  
  character portrait Creating your own character
  You can choose your character from many different 
 races, each with some strength or weakness. You can also choose one of the many different classes 
 that come with the game, such as knight or healer or acrobat. Or you can compose your own class, 
 which most of us do after a while. You can choose between a lot of special advantages and disadvantages. 
 These must offset one another in the end, but let you create really unique characters. For instance, 
 your class of character may be unable to use certain types of weapons or certain metals. Also some 
 are quick learners, while others spend a lot of time mastering even the most common skills.
  
  Combat skills are not the only ones in this game. There are six different schools of magic, 
 and you can even study foreign languages like Orcish or Nymph! Sadly there is no actual conversation 
 with these creatures, though a "pacifist" class would appreciate the ability to pass peacefully 
 by another race if they know the language. (And an assassin would pass peacefully, then kill them 
 unexpectedly...)
  
  Even after you have played for a while, your character can change dramatially if you happen to 
 be infected by lycanthropy or vampirism. Werewolves, wereboars and vampires have strengths that 
 normal humans can not match, but at a severe cost. For those who search diligently, it is possible 
 to lift the curse and return to a normal life - but not all choose to do so ...
  
  spellcasting Magic
  Magic, or "magicka" as it is called in Daggerfall, is a power that floats 
 richly through this game world. Almost everyone can harness it to some extent - even a warrior 
 may be able to cast a simple spell if he learns how. But the various classes of mages can hold 
 much more of it at any time.
  
  However, inborn capacity is not nearly the whole of it. With sufficient training, anyone can learn 
 to use the magicka more efficiently. When you fully master a school of magicka, even powerful spells 
 require only a moderate amount of magicka.
  
  For those who don't have the time or inclination to follow that long path, there are potions that 
 cover the basic needs, like healing and protection and levitation. There are also enchanted items 
 of many kinds. Some of these are found naturally in dungeons or on fallen enemies. Others can only 
 be made through the "item maker", which is available to advanced members of the Mages Guild or 
 the Temple of Julianos. At a price, any item can be given magickal properties.
  
  Finally, the Mages Guild also allows their members - even new ones - to compose their own spells. 
 For non-members, the most common spells are sold ready to put in your spell book.
  
  village A huge world
  The game world of Daggerfall is only a small part of the empire of Tamriel, 
 but it still covers the area of a moderate American state or European country. There are literally 
 hundreds of cities, towns and villages, and also scattered temples and farmsteads amid wilderness 
 where you can travel for weeks of real time. Luckily, you can also choose to fast travel from one 
 place to another, if you get bored by forest or mountain or desert or jungle. Yes, there are several 
 different climates, each with their own plant life and architecture and weather pattern.
  
  The ancient civilization of Tamriel also supplies hundreds of ruins and dungeons, many of these 
 the size of a small game in themselves. Do not visit those if you are in a hurry! The dungeons 
 are without exception infested by potential enemies, either humans or other races, or at the very 
 least critters like giant rats or bats or humongous spiders.
  
  For those who prefer the daylight, life is more quiet. Though you should think twice about sleeping 
 out in the woods without weapons. Luckily most enemies can be run away from, especially with a 
 little practice. Your running skill will increase when you use it. And of course you can buy a 
 horse, which should be able to outrun anything except a well placed arrow.
  
  Store Worldly goods
  In Daggerfall, you can buy various items from weapons and armor to gems 
 and herbs. But that is not the whole of it. I've mention the riding horse, but you can also buy 
 a wagon with room for 750 kg of merchandise. If the travelling life is not for you, you can start 
 saving up for your own home! You can have only one house at a time, so this is mostly for those 
 who want to settle down after their travelling days. By then you should have amassed plenty of 
 money; but if not, the local bank is usually willing to extend a loan.
  
  A ship is a good alternative in the meantime. There are two different sizes of those, and the largest 
 is quite as large as many houses. The benefit of the ship is that it has its own teleport function: 
 You can hop to your ship from any outdoors location, and then hop back to where you came from. 
 This makes it an ideal place to sleep during your travels, and to store items that you don't want 
 in your cart.
  
  While you can't buy or sell furniture, you can buy clothes. There is a wide selection of those, 
 particularly for women, in many different cuts and colors. This may not interest you if your focus 
 is on fighting; but in that case, it may be worth mentioning that weapons and armor can be had 
 in different metals, one better than the other: Iron, steel, silver, elven, dwarven, mithril, adamantium, 
 ebony, orcish and deadric. These also have distinct colors and can be quite fashionable if you 
 manage to gather a whole armor of one metal. Some of them are quite rare, however. A daedric gauntlet 
 costs about the same as a house, if you can find it for sale at all!
  
  guild teacher Guilds and politics
  Daggerfall has several different guilds: The Mages Guild and 
 the Fighters Guild are federal institutions, and your membership in these follow you wherever you 
 go. The same holds true for temples, but each province has its favorite deity. Luckily there are 
 several provinces which have the same patron god, and here you will find their temples usually 
 less than a day's travel from wherever you are.
  
  There are a couple dozen different provinces in the game, and each has its local government. You 
 can have a good reputation in one province and be considered pond scum in another. In fact, sometimes 
 two of them are in a state of cold war, and you could get in trouble for being involved too heavily 
 with one or the other.
  
  Some of the provinces have their own knightly orders. As for temples, you can only join one such. 
 And like temples and guilds, they confer certain benefits on active members. You graduate through 
 the various guilds by studying the skills they value particularly highly, and by doing quests for 
 them. Each type of guild has its own set of quests. At any given time you can choose between many 
 different quests, but some of them only become available after you have proved your worth in simpler 
 quests.
  
  Royal throne Quests and storyline
  Quests are the driving force in Daggerfall. Less a game and more a gaming environment, Daggerfall 
 provides a huge and detailed game world. But to become more than a tourist in that world, you have 
 to take on quests. As I mentioned, quests decide your standing in the guilds, along with your dedication 
 to the guild's lore. But there are quests also outside the guilds. Merchants and bartenders are 
 the employment officers of Daggerfall, and may or may not know of a way to earn a quick buck. The 
 quests can be dubious, like smuggling or assassination. Or they can be heartwarming good, like 
 rescuing a kidnapped child. Choose wisely, for your reputation will eventually catch up with you.
 
  
  Each faction in the game world - and there are about 400 of them - have their own balance of reputation 
 with you. As for provinces, almost any faction can be at war with any other, but they can also 
 be allies, in which case you improve your standing with two or more at the same time. You can always 
 ask the local populace for the latest rumors, and they will eventually tell you who is at odds 
 with who. If you really care.
  
  More importantly, the royal courts of the major provinces have quests for you. They offer a wide 
 selection of quests like any guild, but they also administer the Main Quest. In so far as Daggerfall 
 is a game and not just a game setting, it is due to the Main Quest. You supposedly arrive in Daggerfall 
 in order to investigate two mysteries on behalf of the Emperor, who lives far away from all this. 
 One mystery is a letter that has disappeared; another is a slain king who has returned as a ghost 
 and haunts the capitol with his army of wraiths. As you succeed in a series of increasingly difficult 
 quests, a plot of dark intrigue is revealed.
  
  As with everything in Daggerfall, the Main Quest is entirely optional. And even if you undertake 
 it, there is no guarantee that you will be able to conclude it. There are some good walk-throughs 
 on the Net (see for instance MarStinson's website in my link section) but if you start the quest 
 too early you may still have to give it up. Luckily you cannot lose the game, except by getting 
 bored. As long as you have a save game where you are still alive, you can continue to enjoy the 
 alternate world of magick and bravery that is known as Daggerfall!

Review:  After playing Oblivion and Morrowind, I quickly studied up on Daggerfall. After watching several 
 gameplay videos, I knew I had to get it. So, after scanning Ebay for some good copies I promptly 
 ordered Daggerfall. After anxiously waiting for it to arrive, I installed it and started playing. 
 Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed.
  
  Daggerfall follows the same gameplay style as the original, with many improvements. The player 
 has unlimited freedom, able to travel to countless cities, towns and dungeons. They can undergo 
 (literally) infinite quests and jobs. The game never ends. Of course, the game has a main quest 
 they can choose to follow as well.
  
  On the subject of freedom, Daggerfall is easily one of the most customizable games to date. At 
 the start of the game, you can change your race, skills, appearance, and game difficulty. Do you 
 want to go through the game as a swordsman, or an archer? Do you want to attack with a sword, axe, 
 or blunt weapon? You choose it all.
  
  Once you finally make your final decision on your character stats, your quest begins. You must 
 investigate the death of the late King of the city of Daggerfall - and stop him from disturbing 
 the streets of the city at night. Later on, as you get further in, the storyline evolves into something 
 much more complicated...
  
  Now, like in all games one of the first things you'll see are the controls. Daggerfall surprised 
 me here. You've got your basic controls that shouldn't be much of a problem; but the combat system 
 really shines. To attack an enemy, You must aim in their direction, click and hold your left mouse 
 button, and drag it across the enemy. The sword jabs/slices at the enemy in different ways, depending 
 on which direction or way you swung it. I personally find this really cool, very innovative for 
 its time.
  
  Graphics I can't really say the same. They're extremely pixelated, but hey... It was 1996. Personally 
 I think other FPSs at the time had better graphics (such as Duke Nukem 3D) but these are still 
 above average for the time. Basically if you've played DOS games before you know what to expect.
 
  
  Now, we get to the flaws. Only one. The stability. Daggerfall is victim to random crashes and broken 
 quests; when the game was first released it was impossible to finish the main quest, among others. 
 Bethesda released patches that fixed some of the problems but I still find lots of problems. There's 
 also the void , a large black area that you can fall into if you push into corners and use the 
 climb interaction in stairs. If you fall in here you must reload a past save game, or be stuck 
 forever.
  
  The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall could quite possibly be one of my favorite PC games ever. Everything 
 is average or above, with the exception of the bugs and glitches that damage the game. If you can 
 stand DOS-quality graphics and sound, then Daggerfall is worth your time.

Review:  As a single-player, real-time RPG, Daggerfall is literally packed with fantasy RPG elements and 
 features, in addition to a HUGE 3D gameworld that encompasses millions of square miles, including 
 dungeons, ruins, snow-filled plains, and even underwater (!) areas. Unlike most RPGs which are quite 
 linear, Daggerfall virtually lets you create your own RPG story. You can be a valiant paladin, 
 traditional protector of virtues. Or be a dark elf mercenary, wandering from town to town on horseback, 
 with your bow always at the ready. You can even become a carefree thief, making your living by 
 stealing valuables from people's houses at night. Similar to Darklands, there is an overarching, 
 uber plot you can follow to see the game's ending, but you can just as easily spend countless hours 
 following literally hundreds of sub-quests in the game.
  
  One of Daggerfall's hallmarks is the character creation system, which gives you unprecedented control 
 over the process. Start off by choosing your race, background, class (or you can design your own) , 
 skills, physical attributes, and so on. You can even choose what your character is allergic to, 
 hates, likes, etc., and all of these choices will effect gameplay. There are also no less than 
 27 different skills that your character can learn and use in the game, ranging from the serious 
 to the frivolous. If that's not enough, Daggerfall is chock full of magical spells, weapons, armor, 
 and magical artifacts. You can even create your own custom magical spells and items - the first 
 fantasy RPG to offer this feature.
  
  Of course, the game will be quite boring if there isn't much you can do with such an arsenal of 
 weapons and spells. Fortunately, the world of Tamriel is brimming with life. There are hundreds, 
 if not thousands, of NPCs to talk to and glean information from. Text dialog is used extensively 
 in the game, and fans of TES: Arena will be happy to know that the repetitive, stock dialogue text 
 that made most NPCs in Arena seem like clones of one another is gone. NPCs are much more diverse 
 and interesting in Daggerfall, and even remember your previous dealings with them. Add to that 
 a great 3D graphics engine (with weather effects such as rain and snow nicely simulated) , countless 
 monsters to slay, and many fascinating locations to discover, and you won't want to leave the world 
 of Tamriel.
  
  Daggerfall is one of the few RPGs that truly deserve the term epic. If you are a hardcore RPGer 
 who prefer a vast, virtually non-linear game to one with tightly-knit storyline, Daggerfall is 
 classic in every respect.

Review:  This game was everthing i thought it would be. The game was hard to track down, but it was worth 
 the effort. I have played many games, but this one is one of the best. The graphics weren't the 
 best, but because it was all that they had to work with i'm giving it a ten too. The game was fulfilling 
 and earned my money. This is hands-down a definate 10. The impact it had on many was many hours 
 of gameplay.. and each one of them enjoyable. It was a great game, and after all without this game 
 their ould be no Morrowind or Oblivion.. Just another in the greatest series i have ever played.

Review:  When I decided to clean out my basement I did so begrudgingly, not realizing how this chore would 
 fundamentally change my weekend. I went into the deepest darkest corner of my basement. I figured 
 I better start with the worst area possible. I dove into a land that has been untouched by man 
 since 1996. One of the first items I came across was one of the greatest role playing games of 
 all time: Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall.
  
  I immediately grew giddy with anticipation of playing this forgotten relic and my cleaning plans 
 flew straight out the window. Even the box excited me. It has one of those chrome/flip flop box 
 art schemes that was extremely rare at the time. I surprisingly found it easy to install. Thanks 
 to the DOS backwards compatibility of Windows XP. Gates does do something right occasionally. 
 
  
  As with most RPGs the first thing you have to do is create your character. At the time this came 
 out, this was the most groundbreaking character creation scheme ever. You get to choose through 
 a plethora of models and choose one of eighteen professions. You could customize everything from 
 the socks to the gauntlets. Forget ten years ago, this creation scheme is still great today. Hardly 
 do I play an RPG where you have as many professions and wardrobe options. 
  
  Then it is onto the game of course. The map in the game has about the same surface size as two 
 Great Britains. I would compare it in size to the original Asherons Call. Its not small by any 
 means, even by todays standards. Now this game has a very linear adventure story path. However, 
 what made this game great is this was the very first open-ended game. If you dont know what I 
 mean by open-ended, please see the Grand Theft Auto series. You can choose not to follow the 
 story at all, and just run around doing your own thing. There are some amazing dungeons in this 
 game. There is amazing array of baddies in your rouges gallery as well. Some of the physics of 
 the bat-monster thingies is quite impressive. This title has all of the RPG elements youd come 
 to expect, only this title did them first. It has plenty of leveling up and attribute management 
 options to keep even the most anal retentive occupied. 
  
  This game was defiantly a game of firsts. I think this game is more important historically then 
 most people realize. It was the first game to have in-game time the rotated from day to night flawlessly. 
 This would later be perfected in the Zelda series. Its character creation scheme is still being 
 duplicated by about every RPG on the market. Its leveling and attributes rivals those currently 
 found in the Everquest and Ultima series. Also to top it off, the story was actually good! It wasnt 
 your typical save a princess kind of thing. Bethesda really put a lot of time and effort into the 
 story and made it extremely cinematic. 
  
  I dont really have anything bad to say about this title. I feel it is one of the top ten greatest 
 titles of all time. If there was anything bad it was that it was ahead of its time and really 
 pushed hardware limits. There have been a number of patches released over the years to take care 
 of any crashing issues. Of course this in no longer an issue today. I know that no current gamer 
 is going to go out and search from a game that is ten years old. But you really should. This title 
 has lost almost nothing as a result of aging. It may not get the shock and awe expressions it once 
 did, but it is still a joy to play. If it was a 5 canner in 1996, it hasnt fallen further then 
 half a can today.

Review:  Reviewing a 1996 game 10 years later is likely to result in an exercise, but as far as I remember, 
 I was never conquered by the vastity of Daggerfall.
  Too vast, too complex, and with a certain number of conceptual flaws that let the interest for 
 the game fall quickly.
  Yes, the graphic was impressive, for the time few games could show the sun moving in the sky, the 
 different weather conditions, but the game lacked that "quid" that links the player to the game.
 
  Dungeons in the end were repetitive: more or less the same pieces differently packed together, 
 there were no absolute link with the outside world (a simple pile coul result - inside - in two 
 corridors going up, a towe could only go down) , the exaggeration in the number of places meant 
 too repetitions, guild quest at the beginning were always the same and meant for the player repeting 
 the same quest over and over too many times to advance a level.
  In the end: graphically marvellous, but quickly boring.

Review:  Whenever my family first got this game in '97, its humongous installation size took up over half 
 of the hard drive space on our computer. I remember my parents balking at the size of the maximum 
 installation. "The game better be worth it, son."
  
  It was, and still is.
  
  I've been playing this game for going on nine years, and it is by far one of the best games that 
 I've ever played in my entire gaming career. I had never seen a game like it before in my entire 
 life. Coming into the RPG, making my own class, choosing my abilities... it smacked of D&D on the 
 computer. A plus for me.
  
  The biggest feature about this game is its size - it's colossal. Absolutely overwhelming. The fast 
 travel feature in game was an absolute necessity, as, given the playing field size, it could take 
 you days to get from one side of the playing map to the other. I had never seen an electronic game 
 as open as Daggerfall is. It was a dream come true.
  
  Of course, this dream is armed with dangerous perils. It would be foolish to say that bugs don't 
 exist in the engine. Now and again, the game would crash, and time spent not saving was time spent 
 gambling with character development. At times, you would seem to find a crash bug and literally 
 fall off the map - your character would somehow go between floor polygons and just keep on falling 
 down and down and down... you couldn't see anything but darkness, and the only way out was to load 
 an old save. It was very frustrating, but it didn't detract too much from my overall enjoyment 
 of the game... I just simply found it too fun.
  
  Now, of course, the game just doesn't seem that impressive. In 2006, with Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion 
 out, Daggerfall doesn't seem that great. The graphics deparment clearly wins for Oblivion... and 
 in Oblivion, people have schedules and move around and are all clearly voiced. You can't milk the 
 Oblivion engine like you can the Daggerfall (no one really seemed to mind, for instance, if you 
 broke into a locked house in Daggerfall; they could be walking right next to you, and it wouldn't 
 bother them in the slightest) . But, this is a totally unfair comparison. In 1996, when this game 
 was developed, it was the Colossus of its time... the fact that it achieved so much was definitely 
 a great point.
  
  Besides, graphics have never been the selling part of games.
  
  If you're looking for an excellent, open, huge game that is, in my opinion, one of the best RPGs 
 ever made (better than Morrowind and Oblivion, I think) , look no farther than Daggerfall. You may 
 have to find special support today in the form of DOSBox in order to run it on your computer, and 
 a special Windows installer to even install it to your computer if you're packing XP... but the 
 work to get this great game running will most definitely pay off for you.
  
  9.5/10.

Review:  En realidad este juego espectacular que nadie se puede perder. Aunque es un poco viejo sus graficos 
 estan a la altura del Doom pero con la diferencia que este tiene accion de 360. Ademas la interaccion 
 con los NPC es totalmente interactiva, ya lo era en el Arena, los detalles de los jugadores y demas 
 tambien tenes la posibilidad de viajar por un mundo, que ademas es inmenso, a caballo, a pie o 
 en barco son algunas de las formas de viaje. La historia es muy rebuscada. Ademas de que lleva 
 muchas horas terminarlo, salteando la mayoria de las quest, ya que hay un monton de aventuras en 
 este juego, yo ya lo termine varias veces y siempre encuentro una nueva quest que no habia visto. 
 Bueno en difinitiva para mi a lo que a RPG respecta la serie The Elder of Scrolls son como los 
 amos de este tipo de juegos y DaggerFall es uno de esos clasicos que nunca te cansan, bien realizado, 
 muy buen rol altamente recomendado para los jugadores de ROL clasicos.

Review:  I would recommend this game to just about anyone, low learning curve, amazing 1996 graphics and 
 an all around great game. Huge amount of spells, classes, NPCs, guilds, and a lot to do in the 
 game. I can remember back in 10th grade when this first dropped about people taking about how it 
 was the computer game world equivalent of walking from top to bottom of England in real-life. 
 
  
  Note that now with windows XP, ME, or 2000 you need to install and run this game with DosBox (Google 
 it) to get it running. Back in the Windows 95/98 days most games ran via DOS on top of windows, 
 this is no exception. Since XP and the like do not run DOS games worth a damn you need to get in 
 and use it. Can be a bit tricky, but a little bit of reading or some old-school BATCH file experience 
 will get you through it. If youre looking for it, Id check e-bay or bethsoft. com for the game, 
 you can usually find it there!!

Review:  I have played tons of RPG games, mostly of the fantasy genre. This game is the undisputed granddaddy 
 champion. This game has laid the foundation for what an RPG should be. At the time, the graphics 
 and sound were pretty good. Considering the amount of content, they should be considered excellent. 
 This game outdoes itself and any game before it with content. The main quest/plot is pretty darn 
 good and pretty dang long. The side quests are what make this game awesome. You can do so many 
 different things through out the game it is hard to imagine finishing this under 100 hours. I also 
 loved the diversity of the character classes. They miced and matched skills very well. If you aren't 
 satisfied with what Bethesda gave you, that's right. make your own. While this game is old, it 
 is still something that was never done before and rarely attempted after. If your system can run 
 it, pick this one up.

Review:  When I first played the first game (The Elder Scrolls: Arena) , I was completely amazed by its well 
 designed world maps were made and how it was able to 
  
  transition from one area to another. Plus the seemingless unending flow of how the world was made 
 is completely amazing.
  
  Now comes this game. Just when I thought Bethesda had topped the RPG world, they go and make this 
 game and make the original even better than before. Most cases, that's not possible, but in this 
 case, it is possible. This one surpasses the original beyond belief.
  
  First off, the world looks several times bigger than before. You literally travel MILES before 
 you have a chance to see a town, dungeon, or cave. Plus, if you don't know where something is, 
 you can get lost fast. Just so you know, you don't have to just travel normally, you can do a quick 
 travel and you are instantly there, the game will then calculate days travels and the time it took 
 to get there. Towns, dungeons, and caves are also several times bigger than before. Plus the sprites 
 (Trees, rocks, people, etc.) are a little more developed to give a more realistic and detailed 
 world. Cities can get very big and take a while to get to your destination. One example is the 
 city of Daggerfall. If you came in from one end of the city and you needed to get to the castle, 
 it takes quite a while just to get to the castle once you are in the city. Almost as if it were 
 real life. And lets not forget that certain areas have water levels, so you also have to deal with 
 the hazards of drowning and even fight creatures that live in the water. Some cases, you can't 
 avoid the water because you have to go through the water to reach the other side of a cave or dungeon.
 
  
  They also improved and increased the types of weapons and artifacts found in this game. There is 
 a wide range of weapons to choose from. Some normal, some powerful, some magical. Another cool 
 thing they did was allow you the ability to type in stuff in MAP MODE when you are in a city, so 
 you can identify which building is which and who lives there. Day and night is also simulated to 
 give a more realistic mood to the game.
  
  The real plus to this game is that you don't have to just solve the game to beat it, you can do 
 other things, even have a job so to speak. You can be a 
  merchant, selling items to stores or what not. You can be a warrior for hire and help those who 
 might ask for your aide. You can work for a guild and stop evil creatures from becoming a threat 
 or help defend a guild leader from villainous bandits who wish to do harm. (Although no real threat 
 actually happens, it's just for drama of course, and in most cases they focus on you more than 
 they focus on killing the real target. The only real threat is the real story of the game once 
 you get into the real story) I should warn you that some quests are timed, they tell you have so 
 many days to accomplish the task. You can also just travel to distant areas of the world finding 
 items and artifacts for yourself. And hey, if nothing else, you can become a murderous villain 
 that slays everyone in the world, just because you are all powerful and you think you are god. 
 You can even buy a house and OWN a house. This is done by going to a bank and asking to buy a deed 
 for property. You can even buy a horse and even own a sailing ship.
  
  This is, by far, the BEST RPG/Adventure game ever for DOS. If you still own an old PC, and want 
 a game full of adventure and quests without having to deal with the "REAL" story, this game is 
 what you want. You literally have complete control over what you want to do. Plus, you can take 
 your time doing it, so there is no time limit on when you need to solve the real game.
  
  Anyone who is a major RPG fan, or wants a game that is very realistic to mideval life, you will 
 definitely enjoy this game to the fullest. It's the closest you will get to real life mideval times.
