:::Review:::
Top Gun may be of interest to diehard fans of the movie, or as a training simulation 
 for those intimidated by EF-2000. Everyone else is advised to turn and burn." 

 By attempting to simultaneously appeal to both the arcade gamer and the flight-sim fanatic, Top 
 Gun tries to offer something for everyone. Unfortunately, like so many games that seek to bridge 
 genres, Top Gun ultimately disappoints both of its intended audiences. The problem lies in its 
 gameplay: too complex for the arcade fan, and too simplistic to pose a real challenge to experienced 
 fighter jocks.  

 Spectrum seems to have forgotten that the one critical element of any arcade-style game is action. 
 Even on the Arcade setting, Top Gun fails to deliver any sort of rewarding play. Dogfights 
 are typically quick, long range missile engagements, followed by relatively long periods of uneventful 
 flying.  

 On the other hand, the most critical element of a traditional flight simulation is realism. Once 
 again, Top Gun fails to score a kill. The simplistic combat model is made even worse by the seemingly 
 intentional disregard for realism found in the dialog. To be fair, though, the movie never attempted 
 to be very realistic. This flaw was easily overlooked in the movie because the action, cinematography, 
 and music were all first rate. Sadly, this is not the case with the game.   

 The graphics in Top Gun are as schizophrenic as the gameplay. In hi-res mode, the aircraft are rendered 
 with detailed texture maps, giving them a nice, clean look on par with US Navy Fighters. Unfortunately, 
 the terrain looks absolutely atrocious. Even in 640x480 resolution, the earth looks blocky and 
 cluttered. Even worse, it is almost impossible to pick out any detail among the flickering brown 
 and green globs (even airports are difficult to see until you are right on top of them.) The cutscenes 
 within the game are often marred by cheesy dialogue and mediocre acting, and even the theme song 
 Dangerzone has been redubbed by an unknown artist.  

 In summary, Top Gun is a title that is sub-par in almost every aspect. It may be of interest to 
 diehard fans of the movie, or as a training simulation for those intimidated by SU-27 
 or EF-2000. Everyone else is advised to turn and burn.

Review:  3.8 wow, that has to hurt. But I completely disagree. No where in his review did he mention the 
 characters or the story (something PC flight sims lack to this day) . That to me is the biggest selling 
 point of this game, you know and actually care about (or are annoyed by) your fellow pilots and 
 enemies. 
  
  Every flight sim I've played has had the boring out in the middle of nowhere, dead calm action 
 and complete lack of audio traffic. In this game you have not only the most detailed com traffic 
 ever (where else do you get a rio who talks about life is probably a game and I'm being controlled 
 but some fat guy with a joystick) but a good amount of action (though it often feels more like a 
 battleship game of launching your missiles miles away and hoping they hit their target.
  
  Also it uses FMV that was a trademark of the mid 1990's. but its actually done well here (something 
 only the Wing Commander series can claim) . James Tolkan reprises his role as Hondo. the rest of 
 the cast is unknown but do their job quite well, especially your RIO who basically speaks for you (think 
 half life you never say anything and are never seen) .
  
  Graphically he's wrong again (not about the terrain) , the jets in TG are photoreal (though lacking 
 in polys) where as USNF was pathetically cartoony. The terrain indeed is choppy (some kind of mode 
 2 or 7 or other) but can do some interesting effect (grand canyon is amazing) . Also above the clouds 
 at sunset it looks like actual video footage.
  
  The not quite arcade and not quite hardcore sim doesn't hurt it in my opinion but sets it apart 
 from the other dime a dozen games out there.
  
  Granted the sim isn't complex or easy and the combat is a bit... lacking. but the atmosphere, story, characters 
 make it a amazing experience, its also the first sim game I actually cared enough to play all the 
 way through.
