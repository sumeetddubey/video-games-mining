:::Review:::
The developers of 7th Legion forgot to include something in their game: strategy. 

 The developers of the real-time strategy game 7th Legion forgot to include something in their game: 
 strategy. They relied instead on gimmicks, blind luck, relentless action, and an all-powerful computer 
 AI that easily overwhelms your dumb-as-a-post soldiers.  

 Vision Software, 7th Legion's New Zealand-based development company, has created a frenetically 
 fast-paced game. Structures appear the moment you click, barracks and factories quickly create 
 soldiers and weapons, and some units sprint to new locations. But, if you pause momentarily to 
 assess your situation, undetected enemies may suddenly swarm onto your base, overwhelming your 
 stunned infantry. The winning strategy clearly is to build your base quickly, defend it relentlessly, 
 and as one Microprose PR person put it, "KILL, KILL, KILL." But, despite all this action, the nearly 
 nonexistent strategy coupled with other frustrating features will soon wear down players who prefer 
 using skill and planning.  

 Ostensibly the two warring sides are humans who have spent about 200 years incommunicado on separate 
 planets. So you'd think they'd have created different weapons, structures, and exoskeletons. Not 
 so. Both sides are equally matched in all categories including healing priests. No attempt was 
 made to create different but balanced weaponry or soldiers.  

 The manual makes a big deal about each unit's back story, but that's wasted ink when it comes to 
 translating the story to gameplay. All you have is about a dozen types of infantry, tanks, and 
 weapons. Why they look and behave the way they do is apparently immaterial. What's missing from 
 the manual and game is a tutorial, or at least a minimal explanation of all the gaming elements, 
 icons, and actions.  

 The game is also behind the technology curve. The tiny 2D warriors look like they predate Warcraft, 
 none of the structures is animated, and the grainy, between-scenario cutscenes have no connection 
 to your latest victory (they do make nice promotional box shots, but don't be fooled) . Vision Software 
 does get extra credit for some reasonably cool-looking explosions. And the incessant techno soundtrack 
 maintains a fever pitch, but the wimpy sound effects are abysmal.   

 With a nod to Magic the Gathering and other card-based games, 7th Legion has a deck of 50 "battle 
 cards" that it doles out randomly at regular intervals. Some cards annihilate anything and everyone 
 in sight, which comes in handy in a pinch. But to get such a card is truly the luck of the draw 
 and, unknown to you, your computer or human opponent may have the same immolation ability. That 
 element of chance may appeal to some, but it is darn discouraging to build up a huge base with 
 beaucoup units, then see them all suddenly burn to a crisp. Throw in multiple power-ups that pop 
 up haphazardly around your map and you'll quickly see that Lady Luck rules this game.  

 In addition, 7th Legion has no resource management, supposedly to let you focus on the nonstop, 
 battlefield action. But since your troops are nearly brain dead, you'll likely grow weary micromanaging 
 them as they go up against very intelligent enemies. The game's one saving grace may be its multiplayer 
 mode. At least there you're on equal footing.  

 Here's the deal: If you like essentially mindless action where skill takes a back seat to luck, 
 7th Legion is for you.

Review:  7th Legion boosts originality following the concept and the idea.
  
  The units are very good design like Mechs or 3 canon tank. Now these things you don't see in other 
 strategy games.
  
  Commanders have banners and are equipped with a special weapons. The funds are increased with a 
 certain task or after a longer period... this makes the opportunity to wage war with few units 
 against a mass computer enemies... if you know what you're doing.. using tactics of course... something 
 like Sudden Strike... where your tactics beats overwhelming enemy forces...
  
  In addition at your disposal are playing cards with a specific spell - like armageddon or dominate 
 enemy..... these cards are important to claim victory.. and of course upgrading your Mechs or other 
 units - otherwise failure is at yoour doorstep.
  
  For the time when this game was released I cant say too much negative about the terrain detail 
 and... the game is old.
  Positive are the animations after each mission - victory or defeat.. ruthless and bloody...
  
 Only remark is to the controls - sometimes the units don't listen to the mouse control - proves 
 to be annoying in the crucial moment.
  
  Too bad nobody wants to make a sequel.. with new graphics... well most probably because it would 
 resemble Warhammer series.
  But still some units and these 7th Legions mechs are really unique for a strategy.

Review:  7th Legion looks like a regular sci-fi Red Alert-clone, but at the heart it is nothing more than 
 a frantic shooter where you are more or less along for the ride. When first playing you will probably 
 start planning out your base and get a slew of mixed units. Instead of mining, cash will trickle 
 in periodically or when you complete various tasks, such as killing a set number of enemies within 
 a given time period.
  
  Building the base is simple enough, and is usually done within the first 30 seconds. Then, while 
 your are busy building your assault force, suddenly all your units on screen are hit by massive 
 explosions, and half of them vanish in smoke. But there is no enemy in sight?
  
  Yes, the computer has played a "battle card", one of up to six that each player can hold. Most 
 of them boil down to giving the enemy an ultimate smackdown, while others allow for stealth or 
 control of enemy units. As you can tell, strategy immediately goes out the window, and then it 
 all boils down to pumping out as many units as possible, lasso them all and send them in the general 
 direction of the enemy.
  
  I can safely say that few games will annoy you as much as this one. The interface is unpolished, 
 pathfinding is dire, and response times are horrible. Usually you will lose a number of units in 
 every confrontation simply because it takes them seconds to actually start engaging the enemy. 
 It's a shame, because underneath all this you can feel a playable game peaking out, this game could 
 have been implemented so much better.

Review:  Command and Conquer meets Magic the Gathering this game is go-go-go with a good sound track 
 and lots of action. Unfortunately it was supposed to fall into the strategy category but is more 
 of an action game with 1996 class AI.
  
  It is rather fun to play and demanding at times but there is no sitting on your laurels from level 
 one. Very basic mind set that numbers dont win a battle, but they sure help out and a few playing 
 card applied to your strategic groups are all that is required to thwart your enemy and his units.
 
  
  Once you get pass about the 6th level (being kind to the game) you will have already gotten tired 
 or the basic units and moved on to the mechs and larger tanks which dominate most of the remaining 
 game.
  
  Very much comparable to Krush Kill and Distroy from the same period but a very good game after 
 you come home from work and want a game that wont take much skill or the whole day to finish a 
 level.

Review:  all around i though this was a fun game to play, even if it did lack the essentials of stratagy 
 game its supossed to be. i mean seriously there is absolutly no skill needed for this game at all. 
 all you really need is a lot of troops and that still isn't even enough to defeat your enemy. the 
 game developers, i think, did a really bad job putting this one together. i know it sounds like 
 i dont like the game but i really do. i like making a ton of troops and then going to destoy the 
 enemy. i know it sounds kinda boring but it is fun. they do have a somewhat decent amount of units 
 to choose from. some of the mech units are pretty sweet. they were like the only ones i actually 
 liked in the entire game well, i guess the legion riders are kinda cool too
