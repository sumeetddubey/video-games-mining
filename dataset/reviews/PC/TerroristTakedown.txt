Its one redeeming feature is that five percent of the game's proceeds will be donated to the Special 
 Operations Warrior Foundation. 

  Terrorist Takedown promises to let you "push back against today's face of evil" by manning High 
 Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles or, as the military refers to them in a real mouthful of 
 an acronym, HMMWVs. The game can best be described by another official military term: ALBTTTDTPIV -- Another 
 Lousy Budget Title That Thankfully Doesn't Take Place In Vietnam.  

          About to take down some terrorists.     

  Where does the game take place? According 
 to the box, the "blisteringly intense action" is "set in the scorching sands of terrorist-riddled 
 lands." But since the box is wrong about the "blisteringly intense action" part, who really knows? 
 Everything is sort of a sand color, and there are a few minarets dotting the largely barren landscapes, 
 so maybe it's Yemen.  

  What is for sure is that you're fighting terror. You can tell this because there's an unseen soldier 
 who shouts both encouragement and warnings at you, and many of these statements mention terrorists. 
 And about a quarter of them mention the word "ass," which must be the one sort of swear word you 
 can employ with alarming frequency and still get a Teen rating. Technically, he doesn't actually 
 shout these warnings. Even though they all sound like messages that should be imparted with some 
 real urgency -- such as the helpful refrain, "We're surrounded by badass terrorists!" -- the line readings 
 aren't particularly urgent.  

  The game is a series of 16 on-rails shooting missions. Sometimes you're firing a gun off the side 
 of a chopper, sometimes off the back of an HMMWV, and occasionally you're standing behind a machine 
 gun bolted right to the scorching sand of Yemen. Bucking the trend of having on-rails missions 
 take place in active, cinematic living battlefields, not much interesting happens in any of Terrorist 
 Takedown's levels. Somebody drives you through or above the desert, and you shoot at anything that 
 moves, though most of the things you shoot at don't actually move. Basically, you target anything 
 with a big red box surrounding it, which is everything that isn't either sand or a building. In 
 the levels where you man a stationary gun, the positions are reversed: you stay in one place and 
 the enemy comes to you. A couple of times you get to actually pilot a helicopter, controlling it 
 from a slightly overhead, third-person perspective.  

  The missions are incredibly easy, and some of them are comically short -- a few clock in at less 
 than two minutes. With a couple of bathroom breaks, the whole game will be over in about an hour 
 and a half -- or at least the first 14 missions will be. After 14 completely challenge-free levels, 
 the game turns impossible with mission 15. In it, you control a missile turret on the ground, and 
 your task is to knock down enemy choppers as they whiz by. If more than two or three make it past 
 your position, you fail the mission. In order to fire at a helicopter, you have to keep the sluggish 
 cursor on top of it for a few seconds until you get a missile lock. Choppers buzz in from all directions, 
 and, unfortunately, if another chopper gets anywhere near the one you're currently targeting, you 
 lose your lock. With weeks of practice and some luck it might be possible to beat this mission. 
 Or it might not. The world may never know. So the actual length of the game is 90 minutes, plus 
 infinity, plus however long it takes to finish level 16.  

          Piloting a chopper.     

  Terrorist Takedown's mission design, visuals, and sound effects 
 are simplistic and completely devoid of any atmosphere-building details other than the bare minimum 
 necessary to make you feel like you're in a desert shooting at people. Its one redeeming feature 
 is that five percent of the game's proceeds will be donated to the Special Operations Warrior Foundation. 
 But you may as well cut out the middleman and just give all $20 to charity.

Review:  The sound people make when they die is by afar the most entertaining thing in this pile of code. 
 And there's no variety either. Without fail each guy gurgles out 3-5 seconds of over the top grunting 
 and caterwauling. If this is what people really did when they died I just may have to try it out 
 sometime.
  
  The few levels I made it through were simple, only one way to go, shooter blandness. The details 
 are pretty weak, though it did scale to a decent WS resolution. The animations just don't cut it. 
 especially after playing games that get it right for the most part, like COD4, these weak attempts 
 just look all the worse. I'd much rather play through a good game I've already beaten than play 
 through more of this. I enjoy a middling to bad shooter for mindless fun. I've played through a 
 few of them such as the SOF series, this game just isn't fun enough to stick with.

Review:  I'm not sure what I can honestly say here. I've played many a rail-shooter, and many a war game, 
 and I've never seen one quite like this. To drag out an overused internet meme, if this is the 
 future of budget games and rail shooters, then the terrorists have already won.
  Terrorist Takedown is another game set in the ever-popular Middle East, where generic "terrorists" 
 with guns, rockets, jeeps, and sheer numbers assault American forces. If that sounds bland and 
 uninspired, then you're right along with me  there's not exactly a surplus of creativity here. 
 You're an unnamed soldier with an unnamed unit in an unidentified location somewhere in the Eurasian 
 continent. It's obvious that you're an American male, but beyond that, there's no backstory whatsoever. 
 
  The game itself won't exactly make you get out of your seat and enlist either. The engine here 
 is serviceable and nothing more, with sparse detail and nearly no animation to speak of. It doesn't 
 help that the only "enemy" you see tends to be out at some enormously long range, giving you nothing 
 to look at but generic brown terrain or generic grey buildings while trying to shoot ants in the 
 face. Don't expect any spectacular special effects or heavy explosions  this is 1999 all over 
 again. The sound is far from astounding, too, with weak gunfire and ... well, that's about it. 
 
  For something so simple, the controls are a serious failing point  the mouse is sluggish and jittery, 
 and the zoom mode you desperately need in order to see smaller targets is practically useless because 
 of instability. Pouring on the firepower generally doesn't work either because of restrictions 
 placed on you to avoid just that.
  The first two missions are hard enough to put most gamers off immediately, but pushing through 
 them results in four extremely easy missions in a row, followed again by a painfully hard mission.
 
  I have NOTHING good to say about this game.
  NEVER buy it........
