What little manic energy the game manages to build is quickly replaced by tedium. 

 Tanktics is a strategy game about the construction and tactical deployment of tanks, only wackier. 
 The graphics favor primary colors, the combat vehicles are cute, and bug-eyed sheep are the game's 
 most precious resource. It's unfortunate that developer DMA Design, creator of Lemmings, chose 
 to extend the wackiness into Tanktics' eccentric control scheme.  

 In the tradition of real-time strategy games, Tanktics requires you to gather resources, raise an 
 army, and assign your units to the basic tasks of defending your base and attacking the enemy. 
 Family-friendly cuteness aside, the game makes an interesting deviation from the formula. Instead 
 of progressing through a technology tree with various construction and upgrade sites, you have 
 just one manufacturing unit, the immobile Part-o-Matic, which also acts as your base.  

 The Part-o-Matic is a Dr. Seussian contraption composed of a funnel mounted on a large rotating 
 disc sitting beside a tall horn. You drop raw materials into the funnel, and an unseen mechanism 
 converts them into tank parts, which then come shooting out of the horn onto a growing pile of 
 junk. The speed at which the disc turns is what controls the frequency of parts creation - faster 
 disc rotation results in faster parts production. You can increase the spin rate by picking up 
 the sheep grazing peacefully around the map and placing them on the disc, at which point they'll 
 begin to run on it like an exercise wheel. You have no control over what the Part-o-Matic produces. 
 It has its own agenda and spits out components sequentially from a predetermined queue, sort of 
 like the puzzle pieces in Tetris.  

 Your task is to decide what to build with the tank ingredients that drop out of the Part-o-Matic. 
 There are four basic categories of parts: treads, engines, guns, and radar dishes. Except for radar 
 dishes, the parts come in various flavors. Certain treads are better suited to particular terrain 
 types; engines are ranked by the number of guns they can power; and the guns themselves include 
 cannons, flamethrowers, homing missile launchers, and about 20 more. You design a tank by stacking 
 engines and weapons on a set of treads, then bring the pile to life by placing a radar dish on 
 top of it. With over 60 parts across four time periods to choose from, a huge number of different 
 tanks can be constructed. In theory, it's an exciting idea that promises unusual strategic depth. 
 In practice, there isn't a lot of deep thinking involved. Since the Part-o-Matic controls what 
 parts are available at any given time, you don't have the freedom to construct whatever you want. 
 You'll almost always end up building the biggest possible tank with the available parts. And while 
 there are a lot of design options, your finished tanks can only be issued two basic orders: move 
 and shoot. Commands common to almost every other modern real-time strategy game, such as guard 
 and patrol, are not included in Tanktics. Their omission might be an attempt to simplify the interface 
 for the casual gamer but comes at the discouraging expense of having to micromanage your army. 

 Tanktics' single-player game is a series of 24 consecutive levels and a training course. Five out 
 of every six levels have the same goal: Destroy several "receivers," which are pieces of equipment 
 your enemy uses to beam in its tanks, and then decimate the enemy's entire division. The sixth 
 level of every series requires you to capture the enemy's transmitter, at which point you advance 
 to the next "era." Each era represents a time period - prehistoric, medieval, modern, and future 
 - and has a unique set of enemy vehicles and tank parts. However, aside from those differences, 
 your goals and strategy remain virtually identical from mission to mission. Tanktics wears its 
 zaniness like a badge of gonzo honor, but every level after the first is distressingly unsurprising. 
 What little manic energy the game manages to build is quickly replaced by tedium. There's no skirmish 
 mode or any multiplayer options, so once you finish the single-player campaign, you're done. But 
 since saving your progress is only permitted between levels, and since most levels take about 30 
 minutes to complete, there's a good chance you'll grow bored with restarting Tanktics' missions 
 from scratch long before you ever see its ending.  

 On a more positive note, Tanktics looks and sounds good. The sprite-based graphics are purposely 
 simple but are well animated. Your tall, skinny tanks roll over the game's isometric landscape 
 with appropriately noisy rumbling clacks, and the scenery vibrates with color and life. However, 
 getting those attractive tanks to actually move from point A to point B can be quite a chore thanks 
 to Tanktics' unorthodox command interface. Instead of making you an omnipotent overseer, able to 
 instantaneously move to any point on the map, you are instead represented by an actual in-game 
 vehicle called the crane. To view a portion of the world to set a unit's destination, or simply 
 to see what's going on someplace else, you must physically move your crane to that point. It's 
 a useless rethinking of a strategy game convention and, combined with the demands of babysitting 
 your forces, only adds frustration.  

 There's a decent game somewhere deep inside Tanktics. The tank-building idea is a good one and could 
 have been put to better use in a more traditional strategy game. Yet by choosing to focus on puzzle-solving 
 elements, and then apparently forgetting to create any ingenious puzzles, DMA Design has created 
 a game that is simply not involving. Tanktics tries to be crazy and fun but only manages to be 
 the former.

Review:  As far as creativity and genre innovations Rockstar North has had its share of hits. Yes, there 
 have been a few misses, but this is not one of them. The unique game play Tanktics offers is well 
 worth the hunt to find a copy. In fact, no game to date has duplicated the ideas presented in Tanktics. 
 The game has strategy and customization, and this is coming from an era when very few games had 
 one of these qualities. Yes, the graphics are a bit childish, but the amount of depth offered overshadows 
 its graphical shortcomings. The campaign is extremely hard and fast paced so expect to get frustrated. 
 Even so, (to my amazement) you can have fun losing. It is easy to see what you did wrong and apply 
 the knowledge to your next game. The controls are a little wonky at first, but after getting used 
 to them they fit the game well.
