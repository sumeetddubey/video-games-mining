Star Fighter has plenty of problems - the biggest being the way it looks and flies. 

 Even though I've always been a real champion of PC games, loquaciously proclaiming their superiority 
 over games designed for console systems, I've always been ready to admit that some types of games 
 are just better on consoles. Fighting games? Consoles rule. Platform games? It's getting closer, 
 but consoles still have the edge. But when it comes to flying, nothing matches a PC - and if you 
 want proof, just load up Star Fighter, a PC translation of a game obviously designed for the 3DO 
 system.  

 The storyline in Star Fighter is hackneyed, but that's not a unique gripe when it comes to flyin'-and-shootin' 
 games: As a pilot for the "Federation" (God, don't you just love the Federation!) , you fly from 
 planet to planet and basically shoot everything in sight. Just about any object - be it animal, 
 vegetable, or mineral - yields up "energy crystals" when destroyed, and you earn various power-ups 
 by grabbing certain colored crystals; there are also parachute drops you can snatch that upgrade 
 your ship in various ways. (Unfortunately, reaching a parachute before it hits the ground is a 
 dubious proposition at best, thanks to one of the most user-unfriendly navigational maps ever created 
 for a simple arcade-style game.) It seems kind of anachronistic to have to grab parachutes in mid-air 
 to replenish a spaceship that can fly in the atmosphere or outer space, but that's the least of 
 Star Fighter's problems.  

 And believe me, Star Fighter has plenty of problems - the biggest being the way it looks and flies. 
 The graphics are big and blocky, especially when you get close to an object; swoop near the ground 
 or water and you can see the terrain warp and bend in ways that might earn accolades in an art 
 film, but only shatter your sense of disbelief in a computer game. With no throttle per se - you 
 either fly at minimum speed, top speed, or coast in between - trying to line up a target can be 
 maddening. Guided missiles, whether air-to-air or air-to-ground, can only be locked on to a target 
 by pointing the ship directly at them - now there's something you'd expect from technology in the 
 distant future, eh? And even though I tried three different controllers - CH F-16 Combat Stick, 
 Microsoft Sidewinder 3-D Pro, and Gravis Gamepad - the ship still handled like a winged cow.  

 
 Because there's no HUD to speak of, you're forced to switch constantly between the cockpit view, 
 a strategic map, and a ship status screen, slowing gameplay to a crawl. And even if you don't switch 
 to the map, the pace of the game still feels slow. If you've just come off the adrenaline rush 
 of a game of Magic Carpet II, Fury3, or Hellbender, you'll feel like you've entered the Geritol 
 Zone when you climb in the cockpit of Star Fighter. This game just isn't fast enough to satisfy 
 a real (or aspiring) action-hound, and I'm not talking about frame rate, either (though that drops 
 into single digits even on a high-end machine whenever there's an explosion of multicolored polygons 
 signifying the destruction of a target) .  

 Thankfully, we now live in an age where you can try out a game to see if the writer who panned it 
 was right or not - or, more appropriately, to see whether or not you agree with his or her tastes. 
 Go ahead, try the demo for Star Fighter - but once you've banished it from your system, don't blame 
 me for the time you spent downloading it, or for the hard drive space that was fragmented during 
 its short and unwelcome stay.
