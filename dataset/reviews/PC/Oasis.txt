:::Review:::
Defeat the barbarian hordes threatening ancient Egypt in this excellent turn-based strategy game, 
 which has plenty of depth despite how easy it is to start playing. 

  You must guide the people of ancient Egypt to salvation in this elegant turn-based strategy game, 
 which offers the simple but addictive charm of the classic board games you used to love to play 
 (or maybe still do) . In Oasis, you control a powerful sorcerer attempting to lead his people through 
 the scorching desert. The object of each map is to overcome an inevitable barbarian raid. You have 
 only a certain number of turns to explore the desert, discovering as many cities as possible, building 
 roads to unite them, researching new military technology, and marshalling your defenses to meet 
 the hordes head-on.  

  That might sound pretty complicated, but a typical game of Oasis takes just a few minutes. The 
 game's clever design distills the gameplay down to the essentials, making for a briskly paced experience 
 that's fun to play for minutes or hours at a time. Combat resolves automatically, depending on 
 how numerous and well equipped your forces are compared to the enemy's forces. There's an element 
 of luck involved, which keeps things from getting predictable. Various campaigns and multiple difficulty 
 levels also help make Oasis suitable for players of all skill levels, and the game's got a great 
 presentation too.

Review:  I'd read a lot about Oasis before playing it but none of the descriptions of the game really conveyed 
 just how much fun it can be. Yes, it's true, the game's maps can be played in short 5-15 minute 
 sessions and each map delivers enough suspense, challenge and strategic depth to keep you coming 
 back for more. 
  
  The mechanics are simple, as a pharaoh you must defeat the impending barbarian horde on each map 
 by gathering followers, discovering and connecting cities with roads, finding power ups and researching 
 technology. Research and road building require you to invest followers in each endeavor. You find 
 followers, cities and power up treasure by uncovering portions of the map as you travel. You are 
 given a finite number of turns before the invading barbarians attack so you must manage your resources, 
 strategically place and time your moves and have a bit of luck in order to prevail. All in all 
 it's a pretty deep game fronted by a simple point and click interface that's easy to learn.
  
  Graphically the game is decent. It holds up to the prevailing indie game standards. The game 
 does do a little zoom in on the city battles which is a nice effect though all you end up seeing 
 are little red and blue dots fighting. The sound is similarly serviceable and nothing spectacular 
 but considering it only costs $20 to unlock the full game, you get a great deal.
  
  Download the demo and play through the tutorial so see for yourself. It's a gem of an indie game 
 and worthy of a sequel.

Review:  Here is another game that recently caught my eye for two reasons: first, because it features an 
 Egyptian theme; second, because it looked a lot like the original Civilization (which I love, was 
 one of my first addictions and I still own) .
  
  Oasis is a great recipe consisting of one part puzzle and one part strategy. You explore the land, 
 find cities, connect them with roads, and uncover the map to find the Glyph of Power and locate 
 the barbarian cairns (blue rock piles) . This isn't exactly as easy as it sounds, since you have 
 a limited number of turns before the Barbarians attack. When they do, you need to move your troops 
 to the city being attacked first.
  
  The mechanics of exploring the world map is a bit like playing Minesweeper, except there are no 
 numbers in the adjacent squares to help you make a decision. Instead, there are subtle hints of 
 what may be there. For instance, cities have crops around them. Nomad camps are located in desert 
 areas and they consist of a large central tent, an inner circle of five little tents per square, 
 and an outer circle of three little tents per square. These camps and will give you extra followers, 
 which you will need for building roads, mining and increase your army ranks.
  
  As you explore, you will also find characters that will agree to join you, providing a certain 
 number of cities survive the attacks. These friendly people each have a special skill (they can 
 give you extra followers, let you build roads through mines or allow you to redeploy your army 
 between attacks) but unfortunately they will retire after 5 levels. Still, they are great to have 
 even if for a short while.
  
  You also have to search for the obelisk, which is basically your last resource weapon against the 
 barbarians if all cities are destroyed. The obelisk is usually located on a lake at the edge of 
 the map. Uncovering the lake tiles will give your staff more power, which means you can kill more 
 barbarians with it. When all cities have been destroyed, if your Scarab Power number is higher 
 than the remaining number of barbarians, then you win and move on to the next level.
  
  Other ways to increase your defenses against the barbarians are by discovering technology improvements. 
 These are unlocked by having a number of your followers work in the mines, and you can watch their 
 progress towards the next discovery on the bottom of the map (they're shown as little workers digging 
 a tunnel) .
  
  Some of the technology improvements you will have beneficial effects. They can increase your soldiers' 
 damage done to Barbarians, increase your army ranks, automatically defeat a number of barbarians 
 at the start of a fight and even locate important places on a map.
  
  Oasis may seem like a really easy game at first glance, but once you get to higher levels, you 
 will be uncovering maps with tons of cities, no mines and hordes of 400 Barbarians to start the 
 attacks with. Acquiring Scarab Power is basically the only hope here, since after each city that 
 is destroyed, the barbarians gain bonus strength and become pretty much invincible.
  
  The Pharaoh's Challenge is very well worth playing for the storyline. As you progress and conquer 
 the different parts of the map, you will find yourself trying to survive the different plagues 
 that fell upon Egypt when Moses tried to free his people.
  
  This is a game that you can choose to play for a couple of minutes on a coffee break (that's how 
 long a level takes) , or immerse yourself for hours in your campaign to defend your kingdom from 
 a barbarian slaughter and become the Scarab King. 
  
  If exploring and conquering the world is your kind of game, then grab the trial version at the 
 official PlayFirst site and experience the challenges that Oasis has to offer.
