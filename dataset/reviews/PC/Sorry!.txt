:::Review:::
Hasbro Interactive has not only crafted a faithful representation of this ageless board game, but 
 in so doing has included an array of extraordinary features that breathe new life into a time-honored 
 favorite. 

 Over the last few years, Hasbro Interactive has established a growing presence in the interactive 
 entertainment business, taking many of its most popular board games of yesteryear and translating 
 them to the PC CD-ROM platform. This astute if conservative strategy has paid off handsomely for 
 the fledgling computer game publisher, capitalizing on its library of renowned board games to a 
 huge, pre-installed base of consumers that fondly remember playing these classics.   

 In the case of Sorry! CD-ROM, Hasbro Interactive has not only crafted a faithful representation 
 of this ageless board game, but in so doing has included an array of extraordinary features that 
 breathe new life into a time-honored favorite. For the uninitiated, Sorry! is a simple yet enjoyable 
 board game, in which you take turns hopping your four pawns along a single rectangular track, moving 
 each pawn from its separate starting area to its home base. You take turns drawing cards from a 
 special deck, moving your pawns in accordance with the card's instructions. Pawns can move forwards 
 or backwards along the track, advancing several additional squares if they land at the start of 
 a slide. Depending upon the card played, pawns may also trade places with an opposing player's 
 pawns or perhaps land on them, sending them back to their starting location to repeat the process 
 all over again. The object of the game is straightforward enough - be the first player to successfully 
 move all four of your pawns into your home area.  

 From game setup through actual play, Sorry! CD-ROM employs a mouse-driven point-and-click interface 
 that's both intuitive and simple to use. In addition, you can choose to view the board from either 
 a catty-cornered 3D perspective or a more traditional head-on vantage point, and you may even rotate 
 the board to have it face any desired direction. Once you decide which pawn you'll move and where 
 you'll move it, a letter-boxed window momentarily replaces the game board, depicting, in rather 
 whimsical fashion, where the pawn has relocated. Pawn movement is portrayed using a wide array 
 of cute animations, ranging from steam-rolling flywheels to hoola-hooping buffoons. Moreover, all 
 of the pawns, be they computer or human controlled, routinely utter short, amusing remarks, which 
 hold your attention even if it isn't your turn to move.  

 Several different modes of play have been included, covering everything from the familiar, classical 
 game of Sorry! to an entirely new variant called Way Sorry!. In Way Sorry!, several new cards are 
 added to the deck, including the so-called "Bully" and "Buddy" cards. The Bully card lets your 
 pawn switch places with an opponent's pawn, sending the opposing pawn back to start. On the other 
 hand, the Buddy card lets you move your pawn adjacent to the nearest pawn, which can be located 
 in either direction on the board. Furthermore, you can opt to play the game by yourself or with 
 a teammate, or you may play the game in either classical or strategy mode. In classical mode, you 
 take turns drawing and playing one card from the deck moving as many pawns as you dare onto the 
 game board. In strategy mode, you start out with five cards, which are kept hidden from your opponents. 
 When it's your turn, you may choose to play any card in your hand, which is then replaced by a 
 new card at the conclusion of your turn.  

 As with Monopoly, Scrabble, Risk, and Battleship, Hasbro Interactive has successfully ported the 
 venerable game of Sorry! to the computerized medium, reacquainting a legion of hard-core and casual 
 gamers with an old, if sometimes forgotten, friend.

Review:  If you enjoy the board game Sorry at all, buy this game! The animations are hilarious!! Your piece 
 might sneeze its way to a new square on the board, or blast off like a rocket, or countless other 
 ways of traveling! And they talk too! I like the board game, but this computerized version had 
 me laughing for more than an hour when I played it, and continues to delight me as I go back to 
 play again. There are additional modes that let you play in great new ways, whether alone or with 
 friends. If you enjoy computerized versions of traditional games, this is definitely one that deserves 
 a look!
