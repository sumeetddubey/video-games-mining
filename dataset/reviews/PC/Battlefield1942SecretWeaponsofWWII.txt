:::Review:::
Its additions are extremely enjoyable to play around with and, in some cases, really change the 
 gameplay of the original in new and intriguing ways. 

  EA Games and Digital Illusions' team-based World War II action game Battlefield 1942 took first-person 
 shooter fans by storm last year. Despite its initial technical problems, the game had a combination 
 of fast-paced action, powerful and easy-to-use vehicles, and surprising depth that made it an incredibly 
 popular multiplayer game. The game was followed by the Road to Rome expansion pack earlier this 
 year, which added larger maps and more-balanced vehicles. Now Battlefield 1942 has been supplemented, 
 yet again, by another expansion pack, Secret Weapons of WWII. The latest expansion adds a lot of 
 interesting new features and an additional eight maps. What it offers should be enough to keep 
 Battlefield 1942 fans playing, though it could have offered more.  

          Like the expansion's other vehicles, the German King Tiger tank is extremely powerful, 
 but not unstoppable.     

  As its title suggests, the expansion pack focuses on experimental secret weapons that saw little 
 or no use in the actual war. Some of these additions -- especially the new personal rocket pack that 
 lets you take high-flying leaps -- might seem pretty far-fetched, but they work out well in the game 
 and seem surprisingly balanced. The personal rocket pack can't be used to fly indefinitely, and 
 it saddles you with an unimpressive MP40 assault rifle. In addition, its volatile fuel reserves 
 explode instantly if you take a solid hit, thus killing you. Likewise, the game's new heavy-duty 
 tanks, such as the German Sturmtiger and the US T-95 Supertank are exceedingly powerful, but they 
 are limited by such factors as a lack of ammo, speed, and turret-turning radius. The same can be 
 said for the expansion's new aircraft, such as the incredibly speedy F-85 Goblin and the Natter 
 rocket jet. Both have so much forward speed that they can be difficult to shoot down, but both 
 are also relatively fragile and not heavily armed. Just controlling these jets is a challenging 
 task and should prove to be entertaining for ace Battlefield 1942 pilots.  

  While the expansion does introduce plenty of new aircraft, it also introduces plenty of new countermeasures, 
 such as the antiair Flakpanzer tank and the Wasserfall guided missile -- the latter of which is controlled 
 from a first-person perspective (similarly to the redeemer weapon from Unreal Tournament 2003) . 
 Several of these vehicles actually give you brand-new options on the battlefield. For instance, 
 the C-47 cargo plane acts as a mobile spawn point that lets you parachute behind enemy lines, while 
 the LVT-2 Water Buffalo and Schwimmwagen are amphibious vehicles that can be used to cross bodies 
 of water you might otherwise have not bothered swimming across -- since swimming remains exceedingly 
 slow. The expansion also adds a few modified weapons for infantry soldiers on its eight maps, such 
 as the new shotgun weapon for Allied engineers and the grenade launcher for Axis engineers. Though 
 some may take getting used to (especially the shotgun) , these weapons represent a good change of 
 pace for on-foot battle, and none is horribly overpowered or underpowered. So, if you were concerned 
 that the game's outlandish weapons and vehicles might somehow destroy its balance, you needn't 
 worry.  

  Secret Weapons of WWII also introduces eight new maps that, interestingly enough, seem to be designed 
 around the vehicles they feature. The Essen weapon factory level, for instance, puts the Allies 
 and Axis on opposite ends of the map and equips the Allies with plenty of powerful aircraft, including 
 the C-47 transport plane (which can carry a whole host of Allied infantry across enemy lines) . 
 The Axis control a weapon factory on the opposite side of the map, complete with antiaircraft Flakpanzer 
 tanks and a Wasserfall missile silo. The maps seem extremely well designed, for the most part. 
 Maps that do feature lots of aircraft also feature numerous stationary antiair turrets so that 
 airstrikes aren't as overwhelming as they could sometimes be in the original game's maps. The expansion 
 also introduces a new objective-based gameplay mode that generally tasks one team with completing 
 a specific goal -- such as destroying fuel silos or key documents -- while the opposing team must prevent 
 it. The objective mode can, in the best cases, make matches considerably shorter (at least shorter 
 than the constant back-and-forth of the game's basic conquest mode, anyway) . In the best possible 
 cases, objective mode is a focused and enjoyable gameplay mode -- if you have skilled and coordinated 
 teammates. However, it can often become frustrating and tedious if you end up with a team full 
 of goof-offs who don't bother trying to complete the goal.  

  Considering all the gameplay additions, it seems a bit disappointing that the expansion doesn't 
 add much in the way of improved graphics or sound -- aside from new weapon noises and new models 
 for the new weapons and vehicles. Then again, Battlefield 1942 still looks really good, and the 
 game comes updated with the version 1.45 patch, so, by now, most of the bizarre sound issues that 
 plagued the original game seem to have been solved. However, though we experienced no technical 
 problems -- playing both single-player and multiplayer games -- we have read scattered reports about 
 players who continue to have problems playing the game or connecting to online sessions. Unfortunately 
 for these players, the expansion does nothing to improve the single-player bot AI -- which remains 
 unimpressive -- nor does it add a new single-player campaign. Battlefield 1942 was all about multiplayer, 
 and this continues to hold true for the new expansion. Also, it seems doubtful that anyone will 
 appreciate the fact that if you have Secret Weapons installed, you still have to swap CDs to switch 
 to a Road to Rome map or to specific maps from the original game. While this requirement may serve 
 as good copy-protection, it can be annoying if you like to play a variety of different maps each 
 session.  

          The Wasserfall anti-air missile is a great new weapon. Too bad it isn't in more maps.  
    

  While Secret Weapons' new maps (which can be played in objective mode as well as standard conquest 
 and deathmatch modes) all seem well designed and enjoyable, there are only eight of them. It's 
 true that the development and production teams were essentially forced to balance the new maps 
 twice -- once for conquest and general gameplay and once for objective mode. But all the new vehicles 
 and weapons are so interesting that they really should have been featured in more new maps. This 
 seems especially true when you consider the expansion's $30 retail price (as opposed to the $20 
 price for Road to Rome) and the continued work of independent hobbyists, who have been hard at 
 work crafting new modifications and maps for the game for some time.  

  Secret Weapons of World War II adds plenty of new features, and nearly all of these new features 
 are great. However, considering how much it retails for, it probably could have offered more. Nevertheless, 
 its additions are extremely enjoyable to play around with and, in some cases, really change the 
 gameplay of the original in new and intriguing ways. The new additions should give fans of Battlefield 
 1942 reason to keep right on playing their favorite online shooter.

Review:  I have to assume that you have already played battlefield 1942 when you want to get your hands 
 on this one -- cause this is an expansion of the original. The Battlefield game is a stunner; no 
 matter what genre you are into -- you will enjoy its large environment and open-ended game play. 
 As expected, in the Secret Weapons expansion, you get to play with surprise weapons -- WW2 style. 
 The game hovers around letting you use different types of experimental weapons like jet pack type 
 stuffs to advance weapons, which you have to find in secret locations in the game. Plus, off course, 
 you get to play new maps. The expansion lives very much to the expectations and its worth trying 
 it out.

Review:  The expansion was probably received with high expectations. Gameplay was basically similar to the 
 previous two games. The system requirements were a bit more demanding and I experienced some slowdown. 
 Some notable vehicles in the game was the rocket propelled jets which were really fast and the 
 air transport vehicle. New gameplay modes added a few new things which added a different dynamic 
 to the game. There weren't too many people on the servers at that time so I assume that nowadays 
 (as of this writing) , there are not too many people playing this. The graphics are slightly improved 
 from the original game. Explosions and other events looked the same. Value was okay at the time 
 because the name 'Battlefield' basically made it appear like a valuable add-on to a great series.

Review:  This game was a nice expansion to the 1942 series. With new maps ( if my memory serves correct 
 ) and new weapons of mass destruction the battles are more intense and in-depth. Nothing really 
 exciting about it. If you are bored with the original i suggest getting vietnam or this game ( 
 both expansions) . gameplay : same as original with a few new maps and weapons/vehicles
  graphics: same as original
  sounds: just about same as original
  value and reviewers tilt: 
 i enjoyed this game untill i lost it =P
  
  once again... i reallly recrommend going on battlefieldfiles. com and downloading the mods for this 
 game... they are killer!!! ( for example, pirates, forgotten hope, 1918, desert combat, just to 
 name a few )

Review:  Battlefield 1942: Secret weapons is one of the most fun and interesting games to play. Battlefield 
 1942 offers the player to experience fictional, but historically battles with a new level of intensity. 
 While graphics and game play lack due to the program, the multi-player aspect of the game provides 
 the the player with extreme challenges. Certainty, i can't even put the game down. The one major 
 aspect of the game is the fact that you get to play with different people from all over the world. 
 Well, to admit, I only have the demo version. But, still, the game offers a unique challenge that 
 is sure to satisfy the average first-person shooter junkie. I recommend that you should get this 
 game. It is really worth playing.

Review:  BF1942 : Secret weapons of WWII's title says it all.. secret weapons. This is another expansion 
 pack, so again theyre probably wont be alot said here. This game is defiently enjoyable, lots of 
 fun online and off. There's a bunch of different vehicles, and air crafts and whatnot. my personal 
 favorite is the rocketpack, which is used by the germans. unfortuantly when you have the rocketpack 
 you have a pretty weak mp40, or whatever the gun may be called. but whats cool about the rocketpack 
 is well.. when your in the middle of fighting you can just shoot right on up into the air. It isnt 
 like a really crazy rocketpack, just a shoot up into the air and back down. nothing really amazing. 
 Some of the airfighers are also pretty cool, the rocketplane, and then the f-85 goblin, which is 
 the coolest airfighter in the game IMO. Theres also modified tanks with rockets up on top. pretty 
 insane. theres even a harly davison bike with a machine gun on the side of it. Theres only about 
 6 levels i believe, but theyre all pretty cool. what i like about this game is that it actualy 
 gives you a challenge while playing. unlike the orginal BF1942. You can actualy be in the heat 
 of battle and it will be a close one all the way to the finish, which i enjoy. it actualy brings 
 out the excitement of the game.

Review:  Where to start... well, first off. Battlefield 1942, to me, is THE best in the series. Not completely 
 for its gameplay, but, for the sheer freedom it gives player's, and mod-developers. 
  
  Battlefield 1942 is an astounding game, wrought of hard work, fresh idea's, and is always forward-looking. 
 The Secret Weapons of WWII, is just that. Offering another playing field. Another outlook, and 
 another sense of appeal. If you can manage to fly a jet five times around a prop-plane, before 
 it has a chance to pull away, not only are there new skills to be aquired, but... there are new 
 ways to aquire them aswell. 
  
  Though, many of the vehicles, and maps have difficulties, and things need to be understood, before 
 their true power can be tapped fully... I believe that SWoWWII is what I was expecting from The 
 Road to Rome Expansion. I can't always play online, and offering 25% of my CPU Time to AI, in the 
 Road to Rome Expansion, did nothing, but the AI had something new to accomplish, somewhere new 
 to go. And it did it, just as well as any.
  
  The maps are from area's that, yes, are difficult. But therein lies the challenge, and what makes 
 it fun. The Eagle's nest. With those Artillery-firing German Tanks, its not easy to get across 
 the bridge. But if you can make it, it isn't the same way the second time. And over-all, the skill 
 base, the new weapons, and the new vehicles, and maps, are welcome, and make this expansion a culmination 
 of the overall dream of DICE and this series that we see now.

Review:  This expansion pack is a good addition to BF 1942 because it adds several new weapons, vechicules, 
 and maps to the game, making BF 1942 more interesting. Also it adds a new game mode to the new 
 maps which changes the way people play on those maps. The graphics and sound are good, however 
 again the command interface is confusing and there is still no auto-reload and the AI sucks again. 
 Overall though you should buy this game if you want your BF 1942 game to be enhanced. You should 
 play this on multiplayer if you want to have more fun playing the game. Also there is no new campagin 
 with this expansion pack.

Review:  If you didn't get enough with the original and the first expansion, there is another expansion 
 pack to enjoy. Secret Weapons of World War II provides an upgraded arsenal, new maps, and better 
 online support.
  
  I really enjoyed all of the additions to the game, but the biggest problem I want to get out there 
 was the price tag for an expansion that did virtually nothing to the graphics and sound and had 
 great upgrades but too few of them. EA could have done a lot more with this game with even more 
 maps, cleaner graphics and crisper sound. Nonetheless, the multiplayer is improved with additional 
 maps to play online and some new weapons and vehicles to test out on people all over the world.
 
  
  I suggest finding a way to get this game discounted, but still getting it.

Review:  Now some people like to play shooters by themselves because they'll think the other people playing 
 the game will absolutely destroy them, but fear not, this game is easy enough to play and is more 
 addictive than the substances used in the making of the Katamari games.
  
  Let's face it, very, very few people will be playing this game for the singleplayer missions, which 
 makes me wonder why they're even included. Anyway, the multiplayer is simply incredible even today 
 as you can have over 30 people play in one map at the same time in a variety of modes. These modes 
 include all of the standard tpes you'd come to expect from these games: deathmatch, CTF, capturing 
 bases, etc. you get the picture. These modes, although old, somehow manage to keep you interested 
 for an uncountable number of hours.
  
  The graphics are slightly adjustable to make your PC feel comfortable and prevent lag. The graphics 
 vary slightly on how high or low you put them at, but they're decent enough to get a passing grade. 
 The characters look alike, but sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between friend and 
 foe. Luckily, the game adds the ability to differentiate between the two by having the appropriate 
 color for their name over their heads. The vehicles are also decent enough, sometimes blocky, but 
 it's good enough for me. The environments are decent and they over some diversity, but soon enough 
 you won't really care as you're too busy picking off enemy soldiers.
  
  The gameplay for this title is easy to pick up and can be mastered in a few rounds, which makes 
 this easy for any newbie to fight with the big dogs... well, almost anybody. You aim with the mouse 
 and move with the designated keys, which makes aiming easy, but sometimes a little frustrating. 
 The problem with mouse aiming is that if you have a laggy computer, you'll have trouble stopping 
 a turn at the right time to be able to score a hit. Lag will significantly hinder your abilities, 
 making some actions impossible, but as said earlier, you can adjust the graphics to prevent this 
 from ever happening .
  
  There's also a wide variety of vehicles to ride around in. Tanks for those who want to blast through 
 and commence artilery strikes, jeeps fror those who want a quick getaway, but decent protection 
 from gunfire, motorcycles for those who want to run over people and make a lightning-fast escape, 
 and many more. Each vehicle has its own unique feel to it and they all handle well. The airplanes 
 do take some practice to effectively bomb enemies and engage in dogfights, but when you do get 
 around to mastering that, this game is going to be the most fun that you ever had on your PC.
 
  
  Overall, the multiplayer is very well done, you can create your own games to play online, it has 
 a singleplayer mode, which felt unnescessary by the way, and the game is just fun to play. If you 
 want to play an online shooter, but your PC is too sluggish to effectively run Battlefield 2, this 
 is the game of choice.

Review:  Back in 2002 a PC game called Battlefield 1942 got released and it was an instant hit. With great 
 multiplayer and fluid combat, it was easily one of the best multiplayer PC games ever made. After 
 the first expansion, Battlefield 1942 road to Rome, which was a solid expansion, the next expansion 
 in the Battlefield 1942 series is also quite solid. Although the type of gameplay and combat are 
 still intact and un-changed, the graphics have been upgraded, along with some new weaponry, vehicles, 
 and maps. Although it doesnt reinvent the genre, its a solid expansion that continues the great 
 Battlefield formula. 
  
  Although Battlefield 1942 secret weapons of WW two is a rather lengthy title for a game, its a 
 much more improved expansion than Road to Rome. Secret weapons of WW 2 is basically a new take 
 on the Battlefield maps, only this time youre in Germany once again. Because of this, you might 
 think that there wont be any new vehicles and weapons, just a bunch of maps that look the same 
 as previous Battlefield 1942 maps, but youd be right and wrong.
  
  While the maps arent that much different from previous Battlefield 1942 releases, there are plenty 
 of new vehicles at hand that are pretty cool looking, if not a bit on the fantasy side. The new 
 take on vehicles were probably used in WW 2 and they look almost futuristic. One vehicle is a motorcycle 
 with a side where a passenger can be with a machine gun there. Another one is a tank that can float 
 on water and can carry approximately ten people. All of the new vehicles sound about as great as 
 they drive and the controls are pretty precise, which is just icing on top of the cake.
  
  On the downside, weaponry hasnt really gone anywhere. Apart from the new Italian weapons in Rode 
 to Rome, honestly, the only new addition is more grenades. It would have been nice to have seen 
 some new weapons as well, but considering that its the German take on WW two again, and youve 
 been fighting them the entire time, its no surprise that theres no new weaponry.
  
  The maps have also been upgraded. Although not that much difference in terrain, theres a lot more 
 detail to everything with the improved graphics engine. It really makes the game look cleaner with 
 better textures and some really large levels. Although flying is the best way to go, it still makes 
 babies cry and honestly is tough to do. Although its not so much about flying as it is landing, 
 which is remarkably difficult and makes driving the easiest way to get around these huge maps, 
 its a continued problem with the franchise. 
  
  Battlefield 1942 Secret weapons off WW 2 sound are also un-changed. No much really plays except 
 in the menus, but the improved weapon sounds make up for that. Still, it can be eerie to be running 
 in a lone canyon with nothing but strange silence. 
  
  Although there is a lot more to the gameplay in Battlefield 1942 Secret weapons of WW two, you 
 need Battlefield 1942 and the expansion Road to Rome to play this game, you can read my separate 
 reviews for both of those games.
  
  Thats about the only new things that have been added. Just like in Road to Rome, not a lot has 
 been added to the fantastic Battlefield 1942, but with baby-step improvements like this, it wont 
 be long before Battlefield 1942 takes over franchises like Quake and Unreal tournament. Ok, maybe 
 thats pushing it, but still this is a great expansion, so if you have the two previous games and 
 you enjoyed them, then you cant go wrong with Battlefield 1942 Secret weapons of WW two.

 from a first-person perspective (similarly to the redeemer weapon from Unreal Tournament 2003) . 
 Several of these vehicles actually give you brand-new options on the battlefield. For instance, 
 the C-47 cargo plane acts as a mobile spawn point that lets you parachute behind enemy lines, while 
 the LVT-2 Water Buffalo and Schwimmwagen are amphibious vehicles that can be used to cross bodies 
 of water you might otherwise have not bothered swimming across -- since swimming remains exceedingly 
 slow. The expansion also adds a few modified weapons for infantry soldiers on its eight maps, such 
 as the new shotgun weapon for Allied engineers and the grenade launcher for Axis engineers. Though 
 some may take getting used to (especially the shotgun) , these weapons represent a good change of 
 pace for on-foot battle, and none is horribly overpowered or underpowered. So, if you were concerned 
 that the game's outlandish weapons and vehicles might somehow destroy its balance, you needn't 
 worry.

Review:  Well it is good that we have seen this pack may be some players like it or may not. There is a 
 lots of changes happened since BF 1942 released. Changes for good and it seems that it is going 
 to be continue.
  
  First of all game play just brilliant, graphic has the best to say, sound actually I didnt feel 
 any difference but my friends said that there is a lots of done in sound improvement. However, 
 yes there have been done lots of improvements in: textures, environment, new ammo and transport.
 
  If you remember or if you have taken any screenshots from original version of BF 1942 then just 
 for interest compare some with this pack screenshots. Well, there is not big deal but it is really 
 fell good that something has improved and modernized. 
  I wouldnt like to compare expansion packs to the original version of game but there is some thing 
 I need to say. A lot of improvement works has been done by developers on this pack. Compare to 
 original version of the BF 1942, BF1942 Secret Weapons of WWII game play is really comparable. 
 With this you are having exact BF 1942 experience but with new weapons and vehicles in new landscapes. 
 This is making game more revolutionary attractive and keeping up with existing game generation. 
 
  I am pretty sure that you will felt that. At least I did.

Review:  BF1942 is the best FPS to come out since Half Life. There ARE cheaters out there, but they are 
 few and far between. I have tried to catch people cheating (spectator mode) , but have yet to come 
 up with anything definitive. Sometimes a kill seems suspicious, but then after you humiliate that 
 same player a few times in a row; you realize they were just lucky. I myself get accused of cheating 
 a lot, but I just take it as a compliment and laugh at their noobness.
  
  Graphics; same thing as HL good but not great.
  Sound; I wish they would work a little harder 
 at making the weapons sound a little more impressive and "real", but the ambient sound and most 
 of the explosions are very nice.
  
  Game play; what a ride! SW makes the slightly aging BF1942 seem fresh and new again. The new air 
 vehicles are a blast to ride (literally sometimes) . The tanks are more team-oriented, and the mobile 
 flak cannon makes the 'sometimes overpowered' air vehicles run for cover. The new weaponry is fun 
 to play, especially the rifle propelled grenade and the shotgun. The jetpack isn't exactly what 
 I expected, but is still great for those death-from-above kills and catching burrowed snipers by 
 surprise. The maps are a lot of fun with more complexity than the R2R maps. A couple like "Eagles 
 Nest" are a little imbalanced, but with above-average teamwork can still be won. There are more 
 PAKs and static defenses than past maps. The guided missile is a little buggy at times, bouncing 
 off of planes and such, but it is still a great AA/AG weapon and is balanced with the ease in which 
 it can be destroyed in the air and on the ground.

Review:  This Expansion pack for BF 1942 is great and a must have for Battlefield (BF) gamers.
  
  The gameplay is pretty good. It is the same BF experience except with new weapons, jents, and land 
 vehicles. It also has new maps too. The reason I took some points off from gameplay was because 
 there was a lot of glitches. Not any that messed up the game, but one time I saw a guy bail out 
 of a jet and the jet just kept going and spinning around in circles. The pilots in single player 
 for the Douglas also arn't very good. You could be flying along and then all of a sudden die because 
 the pilot slamed into cliff. I did really like the new jets though. A lot of them have rockets 
 to shoot. I really liked the german rocket. It takes a lot of time to get used to though (1-2 hours) .
 
  
  The graphics are great. EA made alot of improvements on the gun texture. I noticed that om the 
 panzerfaust. It looked a lot better in this than it did in BF 1942. The jets also look amazing. 
 It's hard to resist flying in a Horten and switching to flyby and just watch it. They look great.
 
  
  The Sound was great also. Although, sometimes the guns don't make a sound when you shoot them. 
 That can get a little frustrating sometimes. I also did not like the sound the sten made. It looked 
 great but sounded horrible. THat is the gun that most of the time skipped. The jets sound amazing. 
 They sound like a real jet. The douglas also had a few flaws in the sound but nothing major. Sometimes 
 you could't hear the propeller when you were right beside it. The sound was good overall though, 
 only minor flaws.
  
  Overall, this game is a must have for Bf gamers. WIth new improvments, this game can get very addicting. 
 Even if you have never played any BF games, you should get this game. I would reccomend that you 
 play one of the older levels the first time if you are new to BF.

Review:  This expansion ROCKS!!!! The jestpacks, jet planes, amphibious vehicles, the (my personlal favs.) 
 sturmtiger and the t64 Super Tank, thats a pretty big gun! And much more! The gameplay will have 
 you playing for hours! (online of course) . The maps are pretty cool too. This is basically a mod.
 
  What they should have had was a campaign mode!!! Imagine that. Another thing is that they should 
 make more maps. There is only a few maps. The Mimoyecques map has a beutiful terrain. I like the 
 new weapons too. What they should have had was ith the jetpack kit, they should have had a anti-tank 
 missle launcher instead of a mp40. Another cool thing is the V2 rocket silo. If you like battlefield 
 1942 youll love this expansion!!!

Review:  This is where this game got the biggest upgrade. There is still the Campaign, and Instant Battle 
 modes. There are, however, new maps for these modes, all of which are very unique and feature all 
 of the new units in them. There are also objectives on the Campaign mode maps. Instead of the old 
 way where you just captured the outposts. The online play remains the same from what I have seen; 
 you just pick a game from the menu and start playing! 
  
  Now the new units on this game are as cool as they are weird. I am going to try to explain some 
 of them to you. First off we have the 'Wasserfall Guided Rocket' the name speaks for its self. 
 This is just a rocket that you drive like you would a plane, I have done this a few times and it 
 is not as easy as it sounds, the missile goes FAST. Next up we have the 'McDonnell F-85 Goblin' 
 which is a very little Allied plane that goes fast. I assure you that you will have more fun doing 
 tricks in it then you will use the dual 50 cal. to mow down enemies. Then there is the 'Armstrong 
 Whitworth AW-52' once you see this plane you will know, it looks like a stealth bomber in a way, 
 it's nickname is 'the flying wing' so that will give you a few clues. There are also motorcycles 
 with side cars that have 50 cals. mounted on them, these can be useful for recon missions. Well 
 those are just a taste of the new units, there are 15+, all of which are very cool. 
  
  The graphics remain pretty much unchanged. I mean maybe some edges were smoothed out or something 
 to that extent. There are, however, new guns for all sides, which look even cooler then that last 
 ones, my favorite of which is the 'Gun Grenade' for the Axis team engineer. There are also some 
 new vehicles, and some old ones with new looks, all of which still tie into this WWII era. With 
 the new and old stuff all put together this is still a visually pleasing game. 
  
  The sound is, again, unchanged. The cool fan fare type music is still there, the same old gun fire, 
 etc. The only new thing in the sound I have spotted is if there is a fire fight going off in the 
 distance the sounds all sound different; muffled kind of. This makes it really creepy when you 
 are running towards the noise from far off. 
  
  Overall this game is a must buy for anyone with the first Battlefield 1942.

Review:  Even tho the original game was amazing this is a bit of a waste of money because there is hardly 
 anything different. It is not worth buying because you could download mods for the game which give 
 you more things. There are only a few extra tanks, planes and maps but thats it. I recommend just 
 sticking to the original and downloading a good mod for it like Desert Combat. This is just another 
 waste of money expansion pack which EA like to do and by looking at "The Sims" series it prooves 
 my point. I am still giving it the high ratings because its basicly the same as the original but 
 my Value rating is lower.

Review:  It's a good addition to the series, and has some new interesting gameplay tweeks, but the fact 
 is, you just don't need it. The original game is as good as it comes, and while the new add ons 
 to the game are kind of interesting, they just aren't anything fabulous. You'll also find a lack 
 of servers running any of the maps for the expansions. This is just another instance of EA squeezing 
 as many pennies out of their customers as possible.
  
  If you're new to the Battlefield series, may as well get it in the 3 for 1 pack, but otherwise, 
 don't bother with this add on.

Review:  This is one of the best ones that EA had brought out, It has so many new things. This expansion 
 is based around the secret weapons in WW2, and they are great. The new things added into this game 
 is great fun to play around with online. You have, new weapons, jets/planes, JETPACKS!!, Tanks, 
 Jeeps that can go in the water, everything, it's fun!. Even the demo will have you playing it for 
 hours and hours. It still keeps all the same fun elements that were in the orginal battlefield 1942 
 game. It keeps the same single player etc, but adds new maps and other great stuff to the game!.

Review:  OkListen up everyone! Ill tell you about this game. 
  
  This wont take long. If you dont know already, this is an expansion to the original Battlefield 
 1942 and Battlefield 1942: Road to Rome. It adds a few more maps and vehicles to an already fantastic 
 game. However, even though the new maps and vehicles are a great addition in my opinion, you wont 
 see hardly any of them used in online games. Its mostly all the original bf1942 maps. I'm not 
 exaclty sure why. Probably because the orignal maps are just better. So if you get this game youll 
 either be playing the new maps by yourself or on some LAN (good luck getting that many people together) . 
 I still think its worth buying because the expansion has been out long enough that you can get 
 it pretty cheap (around $10 or less on ebay) . 
  
  So despite the fact that you may not play it online much, for the price tag its still worth getting 
 just to say that you have it.

Review:  I have been playing this expansion since the demo, the new planes and tanks alter the game strategy 
 dramatically. Its like a whole new game. An exellent map like Peenemune with 64 people is fun, 
 addicting, and unmatched to this date. When you first start playing battlefield you will probably 
 die a lot as a little assault-man with far less kills than deaths. Then, you discover the beauty 
 of the sniper... usually out of sight, and definitely not the one in first place. When you first 
 get into a plane you'll crash and die because of the strange mouse-keyboard aggragate, but then 
 all of a sudden you'll be flyin high and dog fighting. The point is... this game... unlike many 
 others, grows with the player giving them new challenges and makes for an incredible experience 
 that will last far longer than any other game I've ever played... (Call of Duty) . Anyone else who 
 says otherwise probably hasn't played the game long enough to realize this.

Review:  This game is fun and great to play. I haven't found anything I haven't liked except for the missile 
 glitch , but Im not complaining. If you have this game and don't like it because you think the 
 single player mode stinks, you must have took too many stupid pills because the value in this game 
 is the multiplayer. When I got this game all my friends were "Oh you got that?" ,but after they 
 played my version got thiers and played the multiplayer with me and other people they changed their 
 minds real quickly. As for some PEOPLE who are talking out of thier a**es and dont know how to 
 spell "farther" who haven't even gotten the game yet SHUT UP and play it before you mouth off it'll 
 make a difference.
