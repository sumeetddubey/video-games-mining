The developers of Football Mogul 2003 seem to have forgotten something rather important: This is 
 supposed to be a game. 

 Text-based sports management games like the Football Mogul series are a great pastime for fans who 
 study the sports section of their newspaper every Monday morning and wonder what might have happened 
 if they had been in charge. In some ways, playing games like this is even better than reading the 
 paper, since you don't have to wait four months to see who makes the playoffs and who stays home. 
 But the developers of Football Mogul 2003 seem to have forgotten something rather important: This 
 is supposed to be a game.           The game results screen displays a lot of stats.    

  Football Mogul 2003 is supposed to be a simulation of professional football that lets players guide 
 franchises to victory in the boardroom and on the gridiron. It isn't supposed to be a statistics 
 generator in which your main role is to click buttons and cheer from the sidelines. The game asks 
 you to do so little that you might as well be spending your time following the real-life NFL instead. 
   

  The actual gameplay in Football Mogul 2003 is minimal. You select a team, choose your starters 
 on offense, defense, and special teams (meaning you pick punt and kick returners) , set prices for 
 tickets and concessions, decide on a couple of budgetary figures involving your scouting and medical 
 staffs, and then start simulating games. That's it. There are no player depth charts, no playbooks 
 to fool around with, no plays to edit, no coaches to hire or fire, and no way to watch games in 
 progress. Football games are played, football stats are accumulated, and real NFL players stock 
 the 32 club rosters. To its credit, the game generates figures that seem realistic enough, both 
 when it comes to team and individual player performances. Football Mogul 2003 rates players individually 
 in five skills according to their positions, and a college draft is held each off-season, although 
 you have so little impact on these factors, and on pretty much everything else, that it's hard 
 to care. In short, there is no strategic depth to the game, at least when it comes to the gridiron. 
 Following your team through a season is very similar to following your favorite NFL team through 
 the season in the sports pages, since you do practically nothing but read game summaries and scan 
 stat columns. The only difference is that you can actually send poor performers to the bench, instead 
 of watching the real-life game on TV and vainly hoping that somehow your least-favorite players 
 will get injured or pulled from the game.   

  The management side of Football Mogul 2003 is similarly sparse. There are just a few settings to 
 adjust when trying to maximize your profit margin, and very little of it has much effect on your 
 overall success. Dropping ticket prices, cutting the cost of beer in half, setting a scouting budget 
 that dwarfs every other team in the league -- all these things are practically meaningless if your 
 team isn't playing well on the field. The game's finance model is simplistic and unusually unforgiving, 
 even at the game's easiest difficulty setting. Fans abandon your team in droves after just a few 
 losses, let alone a losing season or two. Even successful clubs have a tough time at the box office. 
 Even if you price tickets well below the league average, sell cheap food, drinks, and souvenirs, 
 and win your division, you still have a hard time filling your stadium to much more than half capacity. 
   

  Even worse, experiencing just a single losing season can put your team into an inescapable downward 
 spiral. Even the most prosperous franchises don't make a lot of money in Football Mogul 2003. Have 
 a banner year and you're still likely to have only $10 to $15 million to spend -- which doesn't go 
 very far when you have to deal with contract extensions and signing draft picks. Ready cash never 
 seems to be available to sign the draft picks you want, making it next to impossible to rebuild 
 a team with youth. You can actually run out of money altogether before or on draft day, making 
 it impossible to select anybody. When this happens, you have to turn the draft over to the computer, 
 which apparently makes selections on your behalf like some sort of bankruptcy trustee -- which might 
 explain why it tends to make poor decisions when it comes to the actual game of football. The computer 
 AI seems to draft mostly defensive players, regardless of team need, and it occasionally gets stuck 
 selecting players from one position.   

  Football Mogul 2003 has other serious bugs and design flaws, too. The onscreen box containing your 
 starting offense sometimes turns completely white a season or two into a league, making the text 
 completely unreadable so that you can't see who's in and who's out. When this happens, all you 
 can really do is hit the autoselect button and hope for the best. The game's player information 
 screens often lack scouting comments, making it more difficult to get a read on a player's abilities. 
 This gets particularly bad after four or five seasons, at which point it affects at least one out 
 of every three players in the draft. Finally, the game has a few stat bugs, most notably one that 
 gives players credit for starting more games than they appeared in, and occasionally more games 
 than they could have appeared in.           Contract negotiation is one of the few duties you need 
 to perform.    

  Still, Football Mogul 2003 isn't all bad. Since you don't have to make many decisions, you go through 
 literally decades of play in just a couple of hours. The game's interface is well designed, with 
 a menu bar that takes you everywhere you need to go with a minimum of clicking and detailed game 
 summary screens that encapsulate all the information from an entire game. And it looks good, too -- for 
 a game that is almost purely composed of text. The developer has used a lot of color on the stat 
 screens and relied on big fonts so you can read through all the numbers without squinting your 
 eyes. Unfortunately, Football Mogul 2003 has no real sound to speak of. But drafting a team can 
 be enjoyable, although you have to read through a lot of player information screens, because there 
 is no way to sort players by statistics or skill ratings. Overall, there is nothing obtrusive or 
 annoying about the game, and its rapid pace can carry you along for a few hours of football dynasty 
 building.   

  But that's it. Football Mogul 2003 offers no real depth and consequently isn't very promising as 
 a long-term pastime. Football fans would be better off sticking to their sports sections and dreaming 
 about what life would be like in the owner's chair.
