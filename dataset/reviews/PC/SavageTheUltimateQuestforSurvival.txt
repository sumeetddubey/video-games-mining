Savage simply doesn't cut it as a game. 

 Savage: The Ultimate Quest for Survival attempts to rule the Serengeti like the king of the jungle; 
 in the end, though, its impact is much closer to a domesticated feline's meow than it is to a lion's 
 roar.   

 The concept of the game is admirable: you play a lion living on the vast Serengeti, bringing down 
 prey such as gazelles and wildebeests while avoiding deadly foes like hippos and leopards. Do well 
 and you'll get a bunch of points for your troubles; do poorly and you may end up as an elephant's 
 throw rug.   

 Unfortunately, the game's graphics and gameplay detract from what could have been an exciting quest. 
 From the very beginning, the visual quality of the landscape is hampered by incomplete graphics. 
 Hills that should be solid appear to have holes in them when viewed from certain angles; occasionally, 
 when moving towards a river or climbing up a hill, you'll find yourself hanging in midair for no 
 apparent reason. Your interaction with other animals is also erratic. Sometimes, when you have 
 an animal cornered, you can't close straight in to apply the fatal blow. Even though it looks like 
 you're close enough to strike, you're stuck in your tracks until you change your angle of attack. 
 Perhaps this is a tribute to realism - no one said hunting is easy. But if realism is the goal, 
 it seems curious that consuming an entire wildebeest doesn't completely fill up your food level, 
 as it obviously would for an real-life lion.  

 There are ten levels in the game, each with a different objective. After you meet the goal, the 
 level ends with a Doom-like tally that compares your performance in several categories to the level's 
 par. Bonus points are awarded for each level; you also earn points each time you kill an animal. 
 Again, this doesn't seem realistic - nature doesn't award bonus points for gratuitous killing. 
 In fact, to the degree it wastes precious energy, it penalizes it.  

 One bright spot is the game's remarkable presentation of animal behavior. Over 20 different species 
 appear in the game, most of which seem to act like the ones you've seen in those wildlife documentaries. 
 For example, when you (the lion) fail to catch a wildebeest, the would-be meal scurries away, leaving 
 you with nothing to show for your efforts but a drain on your resources. The hyenas in Savage pester 
 and annoy your lion, just as they do on the Serengeti. And chasing helpless tourists can be fun 
 -- especially as they scream for help to no avail. Like most creatures in Savage, tourists are 
 fair game and worth points if killed. But be warned! Your lion can sustain injuries or even die 
 while attempting to attack large creatures, be they humans or water buffalos.  

 If the gameplay leaves you unsatisfied (and it probably will) , you can switch Savage into multimedia 
 learning mode. With the same attention to detail as it puts into its wildlife documentaries, Discovery 
 has created several self-running video clips for each level, highlighting a particular aspect of 
 lion behavior or experience. For example, during your first encounter with giraffes, a clip informs 
 you that adult giraffes have been known to kill lions who wander too close to their young.   

 
 But even with its wonderful videos and detailed animal behavior, Savage simply doesn't cut it as 
 a game. You'd be better off saving your money and taking a real safari - or at least a trip to 
 the zoo.
