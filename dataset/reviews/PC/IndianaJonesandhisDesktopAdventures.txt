:::Review:::
If you were a big fan of the early eighties Nintendo adventure games, check this one out. 

 With so many multi-million dollar software projects in stores these days, it's easy to lose track 
 of the real purpose of a game: to entertain. LucasArts has remembered this credo and combined the 
 graphics, sound, and gameplay of yesterday to create Indiana Jones and his Desktop Adventures, 
 a title that won't turn any heads but will keep quite a few bored business people entertained for 
 hours on end for less than half the price of most games on the market.  

 Indy's Adventures is basically an overhead adventure game in the vein of Nintendo's original Legend 
 of Zelda. You take control of the incorrigible Dr. Jones and wander through screen after screen 
 of jungle landscapes, in search of the objects you need to complete your quest. Along the way, 
 you encounter typical Indiana Jones enemiesnatives, Nazis, and local banditosthat you'll 
 need to avoid (or lay waste to) while trying to sort out the game's brainteasers. Puzzles are logical, 
 but very, very, linear, requiring you to get one object, which you use to remove an obstacle, which 
 gets you to the next object and so on Even though the game consists of almost limitless adventure 
 threads, the format is very basic: pick up object X and give it to person Y. Once you've found 
 the last item in the game, you'll need to defeat whichever crime kingpin the randomizer has come 
 up with for you in order to receive your final score, delivered in the form of a player IQ (not 
 suitable for Mensa entry) .  

 Indiana Jones and his Desktop Adventures isn't greatin fact, its low quality graphics, sound, 
 and control keep me from even calling it good, but it is a nice way to waste a few hours while 
 you're stuck on a plane with a laptop. If you were a big fan of the early eighties Nintendo adventure 
 games, check this one out. If, however, you're a fan of high production values or novel video gaming, 
 you'll probably want to leave this one on the shelf.

Review:  The Man in the Hat returns! Instead of sticking to his sidescrolling roots, Jones embarks on hundreds 
 of micro-ventures similar to NES titles of old. Though its graphics are simplistic and blocky, 
 fans of IJ and adventure titles will not be disappointed. You need more than a quick trigger-finger 
 to whip your way through the adventures. You need smarts. Puzzles abound and artifacts are rewarded. 
 But, unfortunately, the only incentive is getting your IQ (indy quotient) rated. Other than that 
 and the constant trading of artifacts, this is a worthy, if quick, outing.
  
  Last Words: If you have 15 minutes and this game, you won't be disappointed. But you'll keep comin' 
 back for more.

Review:  This game gave me some problems while beginning to write this review. Would I dare to recommend 
 everybody a game that's not so good? Certainly not. But how could I condemn a game that's not so 
 bad? Perhaps the right thing to do is to simply state the facts about it and let you decide.
  In this game, you incarnate Indiana Jones, and your task is to complete the quests your friend 
 Marcus gives you at the beginning of the game, which is a classic point-and-click adventure but 
 on reduced scale. Apparently, both of you were on a archaeological field investigation on Mexican 
 pre-Columbian cultures, problems arose, and since you are a hero certainly you could was some dishes 
 in your spare time. The program has a lot of different missions for you to accomplish, and it has 
 a randomizer that assures you that even if you play the same plot again you will have different 
 maps to explore and different puzzles to solve.
  The first thing to do any time you launch an Indydesk game (sorry, I wanted to abbreviate) is to 
 find Marcus (that's very easy, he's inside a house on your starting screen) so he can give you 
 your quest and one item you'll need while solving puzzles. The second thing to do is to get into 
 your own house, which is in the starting screen, and retrieve your whip. And the last thing to 
 do once you arrive there is to find the world map (since you start the game with no map at all) , 
 which is usually hidden near the starting screen. From then on, it's only adventuring.
  The map is extremely necessary and useful in this game. It gives you the complete outfit of the 
 world, tells you if a screen was explored yet or not, and marks all the explored screens that had 
 something important with an icon, so you can recall what was there. A puzzle piece icon suggests 
 a screen with a puzzle. A doorway icon tells you that if you solve the puzzle there you may travel 
 to another location of the world, which is otherwise inaccessible. A starry icon marks the screen 
 where the ending will take place. An outlined, blank icon suggest that the puzzle of that screen 
 wasn't solved yet, and clicking on it may give you a clue about what you need to do so. A filled 
 icon tells you that the puzzle was already solved.
  Adventuring is not so exciting as the map feature. It's true that adventure games are mainly about 
 finding objects and using them or trading them, but in Indydesk this feature becomes annoying. 
 Most of the time you will do errands strolling along the whole map. You will trade with X an object 
 for another object that will be traded with Y on the other corner of the world for yet another 
 object that must be carried to... And so on, until you managed to retrieve the two or three objects 
 you really needed for triggering and completing the final screen.
  The interface is very easy to learn and to use. There's no music or speeches in the game, except 
 for some sound FX and MIDI versions of the Indy jingle. Interaction with the NPC is text-based, 
 so expect to read a lot.
  When you're finished, the program will give you an score rating your performance, expressed in 
 IQ points. That's it. You're finished. Go back to perform calculations with Excel.
  Compared with Indydesk, its following clone (Yoda Stories) is a much better game because is not 
 as annoying as the other one. For example, There's no medikits on Indydesk. The only way to cure 
 yourself is to return to the village in order to eat some weeds some Mexican guy hands to you, 
 so is not infrequent that you die and lose while trying to return to the village in order to get 
 cured. In Yoda Stories, you may return to the village to get cured, but you will find a lot of 
 medikits in all of its flavors (First aid kits, roots, fruits, bacta fluid, food, and others) , 
 so you probably don't meet the doctor robot ever.
  There was a lot of controversy about this game and its clone, and people didn't agree yet if it's 
 a bad game or not. They complain about its graphics, about its Game Boy feeling. I think that we 
 cannot demand those games a complexity that was not their authors' intention. LucasArts designed 
 them as a quick game for you to play in those direst straits of life when you are forced to play 
 only Minesweeper: at a lunch break at the job, or at school, or while travelling (the game even 
 has a boss feature that instantly hides the game from view, which is very useful on those unpredictable 
 boss rushes through the office) . In those occasions, Indydesk really rules!!! With only 6 MB, it's 
 a far better experience that Minesweeper or those pathetic and boring Flash web games that seem 
 8-bit console games fatted with hormones. Obviously, is not a choice when you have the possibility 
 to play something else. If used in the situations it was meant for, it's terrific. And since some 
 abandonware sites have Yoda Stories and Indydesk for you to download for free, you certainly should 
 give them a try.
