:::Review:::
The missions will take you through a variety of combat environments, from mountain ranges to snowy 
 glaciers, all packed with turrets, enemy tanks, and building complexes. 

 The industry is constantly responding to owners of next-generation graphics accelerators, who are 
 always desperate for some new game to show off their powerful hardware - even if it's an older, 
 repackaged game with 3D support slapped on. Case in point: Swiv 3D Assault, a year-old British 
 title that's been revamped with support for 3Dfx cards, MMX, and Windows 95.  

 In the short time since its creation, SWIV is already retro. At its roots, this is a reworked 3D 
 version of an action-shooter on the Commodore 64, where you're issued one of six combat vehicles 
 and drive (or fly) around, killing rebels 'til you can't kill no more.  

 The missions will take you through a variety of combat environments, from mountain ranges to snowy 
 glaciers, all packed with turrets, enemy tanks, and building complexes. Though the terrain rendering 
 looks pretty impressive, your view is "fogged out" after a few dozen feet, obstructing what might 
 lurk ahead. The frame rate is more than acceptable on the base system, and the control is similarly 
 fast, auto-adjusting your helicopter's altitude so you won't keep smacking into mountains.  

 On the other hand, the auto-targeting system is a double-edged sword. When you draw a bead on 
 an enemy vehicle, the computer takes over - but shrubbery gets targeted alongside enemy tanks, 
 so you can expect a missile or two to miss its mark and demolish a tree instead. Hitting ground 
 targets in the helicopter is equally annoying, since you must get close to your target so the shots 
 don't pass over their heads - and by then, you'll already have been nailed by a swarm of bullets. 

 This brings up another problem (or blessing, depending on your skill) : SWIV is an extremely difficult 
 game. You have one life and a very short power bar, health is sparse, and your standard-issue weapon 
 is about as ineffective as the axe in Quake. There are a few treasure troves of missiles here and 
 there, and you must find them, since seek-and-destroy missions are impossible without more advanced 
 instruments of war. Discovering these is a quest in itself, as the overhead map at the top of the 
 screen has a highly limited range. SWIV does have a musical perk, however: the game CD contains 
 some tracks with classical music, and you can rain napalm upon your enemies while cranking out 
 Ride of the Valkyries in true Apocalypse Now style.  

 Getting SWIV up and running under Windows 95 may prove to be as difficult as playing the game. The 
 plain-vanilla test machine encountered Windows crashes out the wazoo before the game would even 
 launch, and unless you have a 3Dfx card, you might want to consider installing the straight DOS 
 version instead. You won't miss much, as 3D acceleration does very little for this game - aside 
 from smoother-looking terrain, there's little worth mentioning.  

 Bugs aside, SWIV is a fun but shallow shooter. Keep in mind that you'll need the reflexes of a six-year 
 old Nintendo junkie to stand a chance - but if you think you've got what it takes, this is a solid 
 blast-fest that shooter fans should consider picking up.
