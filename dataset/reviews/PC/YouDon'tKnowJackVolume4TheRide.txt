:::Review:::
Arguably the best You Don't Know Jack since the original. 

 Don't look now, but You Don't Know Jack could turn out to be one of the most enduring gaming franchises 
 of our time. How many other game series born in the '90s have seen as many different iterations 
 or possessed such phenomenal staying power? By surviving and thriving for the better part of a 
 decade, and even more remarkably, for staying essentially unchanged over that entire period of 
 time, You Don't Know Jack demands to be recognized as a landmark gaming series.  

 But, as we all know, even the best games get old after a while. And to be frank, before playing 
 this latest release (curiously subtitled "The Ride") , I had the sneaking suspicion that You Don't 
 Know Jack was beginning to run out of steam. It wasn't so much that the quality of the games had 
 diminished - they're all pretty much the same, and they're all pretty darn good - it's that my 
 interest in the format itself was beginning to wane. The pop-culture references were growing tiresome, 
 the humor seemed predictable, and the questions lacked the ability to surprise and entertain as 
 they once had. In short, my extensive experience with the series was beginning to work against 
 me, and as a result, each new game was marred by an underlying sense of "been there, done that 
 - and more times than I care to remember."   

 Thankfully, Jellyvision, creator of the You Don't Know Jack series, must have been thinking the 
 exact same thing. And as a result, it's made a number of changes to the game this time around. 
 And thankfully, they all work like a charm.  

 First off is the game's new episode-based format, which is hinted at by "The Ride" moniker. The 
 Ride refers to a ride on an elevator, which drops you off at different thematic "floors," which 
 serve as the subject for any given game. The floor you end up on is determined by your answer to 
 an either/or question at the beginning of the game. For example, if in response to the opening 
 question you pick "the Land o' Lakes woman," you'll end up with a dairy theme, while if you choose 
 "the Red Baron," you'll end up with a food theme (for Red Baron pizza, get it?) .   

 In general, the themes make the game a lot more interesting, because rather than consisting of a 
 random series of unrelated questions, each game has its own unique and discernable identity. The 
 themes also make the host more engaging, as he'll refer back to questions from earlier in the game 
 or even have a running gag throughout. For example, in the alcohol show, the host starts off by 
 cracking open a beer, and then gradually drinks himself into a stupor as the game progresses. Obviously, 
 not all themes are created equal - some are definitely stronger than others - but not knowing exactly 
 what's in store is part of what makes playing the game fun.   

 As the alcohol theme might indicate, the other big change is a decided move towards adult subject 
 matter. The Ride is filled with sexual double entendres, expletives deleted, and not-so-subtle 
 references to various forms of intoxication. It's about time someone created an adult game that's 
 based on mature, rather than pornographic, content. You'll also find that The Ride is generally 
 more cynical and sarcastic than the earlier games and doesn't shy away from mocking you at every 
 opportunity (even typing your name in can be dangerous) .   

 There are also some new twists during the game itself. First off is the near-random value assigned 
 to the questions (selected by the player hitting a key as values quickly flash on and off the screen) . 
 With ranges from $183 to more than $10,000, the randomization means that the lead can seesaw much 
 more quickly than in previous versions. There is also a new type of question, dubbed "Roadkill" 
 - which basically requires you to find a word that connects two other phrases - and it's a very 
 good addition. Without giving too much away, there are also some one-off questions that only appear 
 every few games, again adding some extra variety to the gameplay. The game is also faster paced, 
 with shorter breaks between questions, another welcome change for veteran Jack players.  

 The graphics have also been mildly updated, with the transition scenes sporting a sleek, psychedelic 
 look. And the production values are just about perfect - at this point, playing The Ride is pretty 
 much like watching TV - and testing on numerous systems revealed none of the clipping or choppiness 
 sometimes associated with the earlier games.  

 In conclusion, The Ride is a blast and arguably the best You Don't Know Jack since the original 
 release. Jack is back, and that's very good news, indeed.

Review:  This installment of the popular quiz show is undoubtedly the best one yet. Taking cues from the 
 first few games, they have upped the comedy, added new "side-games", and several hosts to guide 
 you through the fun.
  
  Upon entering the game, you are faced with a moral question. Depending on your answer, you are 
 then taken "several floors below" to a given topic, which all following questions are loosely based 
 on. You then enter the number of players (1-3) , your name, and whether or not you've played before. 
 Then, the ride begins!
  
  Like in prior games, you buzz in and answer the given questions. Then, sometimes, you're thrown 
 into a side-game. In this game, there's "Roadkill", where you have to buzz in on a word that completes 
 two phrases, "Dis or Dat" where you have to choose whether a something is this, that, or both. 
 Also is their take on "Bingo", where you buzz in when answer to the question begins with whatever 
 letter in the word "bingo" lights up.
  
  All in all, this game is a GREAT party game, and isn't half bad to play by yourself if you're all 
 alone. The commentary is enough to keep you hooked. This is definitely not a quiz game you should 
 miss!

Review:  Though you do need the "you dont know jack 1" disk to play this game , you will not regret it. 
 This game is fun, hilarious, and a great game to play with your family! With the great humor this 
 game features, you will always want to play this game. The challenge varies, depending on what 
 level you select, so everyone can answer a question sometime! The questions the game gives are 
 always a different category, and they are always delivered with a humorous hint in them! You won't 
 care what the graphics look like, since it is a question based game, but they aren't an eyesore 
 or anything. This game is for those who want to spend time with their family or friends, or for 
 people who just want a good laugh. Nevertheless, you should see for yourself!

Review:  Ahh, trivia and screws. Isn't it nice to be playing a game with two of your best friends and then 
 you turn around and slam on the S-key as fast as you can to screw your friend as much as humanly 
 possible? That's friendship.
  
  This game has no pity for the timid or the slow to draw. The game features an interesting four 
 different hosts that take over for one another when they get the chance to steal the spotlight. 
 The other interesting thing is that you know the category of the questions based on the question 
 you get before you start logging in. Then you may get an automatic name based on the possible related 
 words to the topic.
  
  You basically get screwed a lot, play for point values that don't add up to simple 5 or 0 numbers, 
 and enjoy the antics of the cast and the questions they come up with.
