:::Review:::
As well intentioned as it might be, the game feels limiting and repetitive and as such is suitable 
 only as a fleeting diversion. 

  Sunstorm Interactive has been at the forefront of the budget-priced 3D shooter genre since the 
 mid-1990s, and to date it has racked up surprisingly impressive sales numbers with wantonly destructive 
 sub-$20 affairs such as Deer Hunter, Trophy Hunter, and even Turkey Hunter. But now, with the release 
 of the fire-fighting game 911 Fire Rescue, Sunstorm has temporarily spurned the shooting and killing 
 that has become synonymous with first-person three-dimensional gaming. In 911 Fire Rescue, your 
 goal is to stop the carnage rather than initiate it and save lives rather than end them. However, 
 as well intentioned as it might be, the game feels limiting and repetitive and as such is suitable 
 only as a fleeting diversion.           911 Fire Rescue's decidedly unusual flames neither spread 
 nor burn out.    

  Outwardly, the 911 concept is quite intriguing. Beginning with a training exercise that places 
 you at the site of a car fire, you'll be asked to take on a total of 17 fire-fighting missions 
 that range from single family homes and office buildings to multiple vehicle pileups. As the game 
 progresses, you'll face a series of increasingly stressful scenarios, each designed to accentuate 
 speed and efficiency. Soon, you'll not only be expected to extinguish a fire, but also rescue victims, 
 scour large mazelike environments for "hot spots," and deal with equipment shortages.   

  One mission may involve a massive highway pileup where your standard truck hose and its unlimited 
 supply of water is of no use against what has become a furiously blazing fuel fire. Here, you'll 
 be forced to drop the hose and employ the limited reserves of your foam backpack unit or your tiny 
 vapor-charged extinguisher. Another mission might situate you inside a burning three-story office 
 building, where the only course of action is to somehow locate a "level hose" without first being 
 overcome by the smoke and tremendous heat that surrounds you. In this case, you'll carefully monitor 
 the health indicator and temperature gauge at the top of the screen in order to understand what 
 parts of your body are being impacted. Once your onscreen persona has sufficiently deteriorated, 
 you may wish to break out the first aid kit or oxygen mask and apply a little instant relief.  

  If you ultimately perform above and beyond expectations, you'll soon find yourself promoted from 
 a simple crew member to captain and right on up to fire chief. You'll also unlock the next mission 
 and thus continue on your quest to become the greatest firefighter who ever lived. But if you fail, 
 you'll replay the last unsuccessful mission ad infinitum until you can finally solve its mysteries. 
 This tired old procedure of having to unlock new content is just one of 911's weaknesses.   

  Despite some believable and undeniably perspiration-inducing moments, the game clearly fails 
 to deliver a realistic depiction of the true fire-fighting experience. In 911, fires do not spread, 
 retract, or devour chunks of scenery. They do not eat through walls or collapse ceilings. In fact, 
 they just sit there, burning at the same rate and with the same ferocity from the beginning to 
 the end of a mission. And though some environments are totally consumed by an impressively fierce 
 wall of flames, others merely contain little disconnected globules of fire, perhaps positioned 
 innocently behind a computer terminal or in the middle of a roadway.   

  Worse still, the game forces you to seek out and eradicate every single spark before the level's 
 time limit expires. This formula becomes particularly annoying when you've already doused 99 percent 
 of the fire, rescued all the victims, and have no idea where in the vast maze of corridors or rooms 
 that last spark may be. The superb source-sensitive sound of crackling flames and the telling remarks 
 of your fireman do help somewhat, but you won't hear a thing if the last remaining embers are situated 
 far from your current location.   

  Furthermore, though the actual fire fighting seems relatively authentic, most other elements do 
 not. To rescue a victim, for instance, you'll merely locate the prone body and click the right 
 mouse button. Voila! He or she is magically transported away from the scene. To use your oxygen 
 mask or first aid kit, you need only click the left mouse button and wait for a moment to partially 
 or fully recover. And because nothing ever really burns -- meaning your only real nemesis is the 
 constantly ticking clock -- you're left with the distinct impression that 911 fires really aren't 
 so bad after all.           You'll find that foam must be used to extinguish class B fuel fires 
 such as this.    

  Visually, the game runs from awesome to well below average. Certainly the bland, flat environments 
 do little to convince you of their realism, and the water or foam that spews forth from your hoses 
 consists almost entirely of primitively rendered white ovals. Yet the actual flames flicker and 
 blaze in fully animated brilliance, and the thick smoke that fills many of the indoor locations 
 is darned realistic. Unfortunately, much of the indoor world becomes prohibitively dark once the 
 immediate danger has been extinguished, compelling you to look for a flashlight that simply isn't 
 a part of your equipment.   

  But perhaps the most damning aspect of the game is its length. The first dozen missions can be 
 completed in a single afternoon, leaving five more that challenge only because they're so damn 
 big and their time limits are so damned short. It doesn't help that multiplayer fire fighting is 
 not permitted either. The bargain-basement price and relatively original subject matter are definite 
 selling points, but don't expect 911 Fire Rescue to burn brightly for more than a few hours or 
 days.

Review:  It's was fun on the first and second mission. And then... there's nothing special about it. The 
 overall gameplay is a bit monotone. Not much improvement from one mission to the other missions. 
 It's easy to learn how to play. But I don't like the part that I have to find the hose myself inside 
 the unstable & burn building. Plus, I'm running out of time.
  
  I haven't finish play this game. The graphics makes my eyes hurt and my head dizzy. But I think 
 the Sound is pretty good. It's not worth to collect this game. I just randomly pick this game at 
 the store (urgh....) .
  
  But at least, now I know how the fire fighters work.
