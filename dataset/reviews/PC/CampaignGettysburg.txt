If you're a fan of the period and can find a willing foe, Campaign Gettysburg gives you everything 
 you need to reenact one of the most epic campaigns of all time. 

  Gettysburg is among the few battles in history that needs no introduction. If only the Rebs hadn't 
 needed shoes, this decisive battle likely would have been fought elsewhere, and the South may have 
 held on to its chance, however slender, of forcing the North out of the war. HPS Simulations' wargame 
 Campaign Gettysburg covers not only the eponymous battle, but also the entire campaign leading 
 up to it, using a combination of an elegant strategic layer and an excellent tactical combat system. 

          This is just a small portion of the enormous Gettysburg map, which isn't even the largest 
 map featured in the game.     

  Most games in this genre welcome players with a campaign map, letting them shuffle units around, 
 partake in politics, and see how the war is playing out on a grand scale. The campaign engine used 
 here sticks to the combat, putting players in the boots of a general and giving them options that 
 play out like a Choose Your Own Adventure book. For example, playing as Robert E. Lee, your cavalry 
 may or may not obtain important reconnaissance information at Brandy Station during the opening 
 stages of the complete Gettysburg campaign. If they don't you must blindly choose whether you want 
 to risk surging north quickly (leaving your 3rd Corps trailing behind) , or advance more slowly 
 to consolidate your forces. If you meet the enemy as a result of your decision, a battle is fought 
 using the tactical engine, and the outcome determines the menu of choices that will appear in the 
 campaign interface.  

  If you are interested in the period but don't want to commit the time it takes to fight an entire 
 campaign or even a single monster battle like Gettysburg, this package has you covered. The designer 
 created more than 300 scenarios covering every aspect of the campaign, including historical and 
 hypothetical engagements, and a complete scenario editor also is included for the "what if" junkies. 
 You can learn the system playing a little four-turn scenario re-creating the opening shots of Gettysburg 
 or the seven-turn fight for Little Round Top, and then take on larger and longer scenarios as you 
 absorb the mechanics.  

  The gameplay is easy to grasp, and it does a good job of capturing the essence of combat during 
 this period without burying players in minutiae. Infantry units do the bulk of the fighting and 
 can deploy skirmishers to harass the enemy and probe for weaknesses. Cavalry units are used in 
 their historical role as the "eyes" of the army and are terrific for harassing weakened infantry 
 units or artillery units but are awful in direct combat with infantry. Artillery dominates the 
 battlefields in which it is used, and learning how to advance in the face of withering cannon fire 
 is one of the first skills players must develop.  

  As in the real war, you don't necessarily have to annihilate the enemy to win a battle. You just 
 have to shake them up enough that they flee in disarray. This is modeled in the game by tracking 
 unit fatigue, ammunition levels, and disruption, and it is vital to keep an eye on these stats 
 so you know when a unit is about to break. Since routing is so common it also is important to keep 
 a reserve in place whenever possible, and to put the best commanders in places where they will 
 do the most good, since they can push their troops to fight harder and inspire disrupted units 
 to rally. Players who can juggle all this while reading the terrain to find the best avenues of 
 attack and the best perches for artillery will find that the game's turn-based combat system is 
 very rewarding.  

  The graphical interface powering this game was used in several previous releases from HPS and is 
 showing its age. Graphics for the strategic layer are crisp and legible, but amount to only still 
 images and text. The tactical engine has colorful but plain maps, rudimentary 2D unit graphics, 
 and blocky fixed-perspective 3D unit graphics that are not very appealing. Sound effects are limited 
 to gunfire, and in fact everything is utilitarian, which is fine, considering the game's turn-based 
 nature and accurate combat model.  

          The strategic layer presents you with choices based on your performance in the tactical 
 battles, offering historical and "what if" options.     

  The sheer scope of some of the battles included in this package demands that the graphics be clean 
 and crisp instead of flashy, or players would soon lose track of everything. The monster 205-turn 
 hypothetical Collision in Maryland scenario, for example, uses a map that is 242 hexes high by 
 436 hexes wide. It takes forever to scroll around this huge environment, and scrollbars on the 
 side and bottom of the screen would be invaluable but unfortunately are not included. A jump map 
 providing an overview of the entire battle is available, but it must be manually activated each 
 time a user wants to quickly view another area of the map.  

  This sounds like heaven for Civil War buffs, but Campaign Gettysburg has an unfortunate Achilles' 
 heel in an AI that simply doesn't know what to do with all the freedom this game affords. The computer 
 puts up a decent fight in the smaller scenarios but falls flat on its face in the larger battles 
 that play out over dozens or hundreds of turns. This isn't necessarily the fault of the designer, 
 as no turn-based AI we've ever seen has been able to handle battles this massive -- so if you want 
 to enjoy the larger battles in this package, then finding a friend who wants to take you on is 
 practically a requirement. Direct play, play-by-e-mail, and hotseat multiplayer modes are supported, 
 so if you're a fan of the period and can find a willing foe, Campaign Gettysburg gives you everything 
 you need to reenact one of the most epic campaigns of all time.
