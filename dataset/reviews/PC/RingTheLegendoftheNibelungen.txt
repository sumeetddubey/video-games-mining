:::Review:::
High-concept is one thing; bad concept is another altogether. 

 Taking the phrase "space opera" a bit too literally, French developer Cryo has created this science-fiction 
 adventure game based on Richard Wagner's The Ring. And while Wagner's opera seems like a questionable 
 premise for a computer game even as it stands, setting it in the "40th century AD" just seems like 
 a mistake. High-concept is one thing; bad concept is another altogether.  

 Ring: The Legend of the Nibelungen is an adventure game in the Myst tradition, filled with strange 
 locations and environment-based puzzles. The graphics engine is actually quite good and provides 
 the sort of freedom of view that was the Holy Grail about two years ago when games such as this 
 were still commonplace. While you still can only move along predetermined paths, you can look all 
 around at will from each stopping point, with little degradation in graphic quality.  

 And while this technical accomplishment is notable, it would be more so were the game better looking. 
 The technical quality of Ring's graphics may be great, but the design itself is uninspired despite 
 the influence of French comic book artist Philippe Druillet, whose distinctive work influenced 
 the look of the game. Characters look bizarre but not very interesting - Alberich the dwarf tyrant 
 looks suspiciously like a cyborg version of a Blue Meanie. For the most part, the environments 
 are bland and colorless.   

 The confusing story, which takes elements from the source material and mixes them with a paper-thin 
 science-fiction premise, doesn't help matters either. For instance, in the first chapter of the 
 game, you must steal gold from the Rhinemaidens in order to forge the titular ring. This pretty 
 much follows Das Rheingold, the first opera of Wagner's cycle. But in order to steal the gold, 
 you must first drive around in a little mine car that uses a monster for an engine, and find some 
 antigravity cells for your boots.  

 Further, the lackluster puzzles serve only to drive the final nail into the coffin. The puzzles 
 essentially involve hunting around the screen for hotspots then trying every object in your inventory 
 with every object you can interact with. There's very little rhyme or reason to the logic behind 
 the puzzles and, worse, there's little to no information as to what exactly you are supposed to 
 be doing at any moment. This means progressing through the game becomes a process of blindly stumbling 
 upon some successful string of actions. But to make matters even more frustrating, not only can 
 you die in the game whilst blindly stumbling, but you will undoubtedly do so dozens of times without 
 warning. And dying in Ring doesn't even refer to death in the traditional sense: The only evidence 
 that you've made a fatal mistake are eulogies like "To renounce love, you must have a love to renounce. 
 You have failed." Heavy stuff indeed, but perhaps a bit too severe a punishment for trying to open 
 a door.  

 Of course, the one great part of Ring is the soundtrack. Performed by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, 
 the sound quality is good and makes playing the game more bearable. Unfortunately, its presence 
 is sporadic, but welcome nonetheless when it does come in to underscore some moment in the game. 

 There are many problems with Ring, but the greatest one is that it is so utterly uninviting. A cold 
 world filled with uninteresting, incoherent characters, bad voice acting, puzzles involving little 
 or no logic, and an almost absolute lack of direction all add up to create a world that is unpleasant 
 for all but its musical accompaniment.
