This add-on pack pushes Incubation closer to the excellent, long-lasting strategy game it should 
 have been in the first place. 

 Blue Byte's Incubation was an ambitious strategy game that offered a satisfying alternative to the 
 slew of real-time games that hit the market in the second half of 1997. Its tactical turn-based 
 gameplay was reminiscent of classics like X-COM, while its graphics and interface were sleek and 
 state-of-the-art. And while the game garnered considerable praise, it was often criticized for 
 its short single-player campaign with its simplistic, puzzle-like missions, as well as its limited 
 multiplayer functionality. Six months later, Blue Byte has released The Wilderness Missions, an 
 add-on that brings back all the strong features of the original and fixes many of its shortcomings. 
 Containing a long and very challenging single-player campaign, a slew of new weapons and enemies, 
 additional multiplayer features, and even a powerful map editor, The Wilderness Missions will please 
 those who felt Incubation did not meet its full potential.  

 The original Incubation took place exclusively within the future city of Scay-Hallwa, and so the 
 promise of leaving its bleak industrial confines for the great outdoors is attractive indeed. Yet 
 ironically enough, you won't see any sign of the wilderness until many more hours' worth of cityscape 
 in this new campaign. The story picks up where the original left off, with Sergeant Bratt having 
 facilitated the evacuation of Scay-Hallwa's citizens after it was overrun by the mutant Scay'Ger. 
 Now Bratt and his marines face a desperate situation where their own lives are at stake as they 
 search for a means to flee the planet. Meanwhile, the challenge carries over much like the story, 
 insofar as the very first mission in this add-on is significantly tougher than anything the original 
 had to offer. Bratt and company will immediately face overwhelming odds, and conserving ammunition 
 and making certain each and every move counts will be far more important than ever before. The 
 difficulty of the new missions may come as a shock - many of the missions border on frustrating 
 or even seemingly impossible. But with perseverance they can indeed be completed in a satisfying 
 fashion, even if doing so requires playing at the easiest difficulty setting.  

 The missions are far bigger than those in the original, and rather than limit you to solving them 
 in some specific fashion, they tend to be much more open-ended. Though they're all unforgiving, 
 many of the missions are very cleverly designed and implement Incubation's 3D engine to full effect, 
 with enemies attacking from above and below. Other missions demand you split your team and complete 
 several objectives simultaneously, forcing you to consider several situations at once and plan 
 many turns ahead. Though the majority of your foes remain bluntly predictable, one of the new critters 
 you'll face is especially cunning - it can open doors and is liable to use defensive fire during 
 your turn, making it a near-equal match for your troops. And if that's not bad enough, you'll also 
 face a brand-new set of traps including flame-spewing stone statues and laser barriers. The campaign 
 remains narrative-driven like the original, and it branches frequently, thus offering plenty of 
 replay value, if only a chance to try a different route if you find yourself hopelessly stuck. 
 While the high difficulty setting will certainly alienate at least a few fans who'll expect the 
 same relaxing pace they encountered in the original, those who wrestle through this new campaign 
 will find it much more satisfying on the whole.  

 Incubation remains the best-looking turn-based strategy game to date with its accelerated, high-color 
 3D graphics. The Wilderness Missions add-on looks identical for the most part, though the new factory 
 and wilderness graphics are more colorful and detailed than the original industrial setting. Meanwhile 
 the new weapons, including a handheld plasma gun and an enhanced minelayer that fires remote-control 
 spider mines, boast excellent new special effects to rival the finest first-person shooters out 
 there. Incubation sounded fantastic, from the gritty weapon effects to Sergeant Bratt's deadpanned 
 mission briefings, and this add-on sounds just as good. At the same time, the original's excellent 
 cinematic music score has since been expanded with several new tracks to go with the new environments. 
 Even now, Incubation remains an aesthetically powerful game.  

 If you can get through the campaign, you'll find still more value in this supplement. A new cooperative 
 mode allows you to team up with one or more human allies to tackle a handful of stand-alone missions. 
 There's also the mission editor (sufficiently well documented in the game's manual) that allows 
 you to build full-featured scenarios using a powerful set of design tools. Ultimately, this add-on 
 pack pushes Incubation closer to the excellent, long-lasting strategy game it should have been 
 in the first place. If you enjoyed the original, or felt disappointed by its limited challenge 
 and lasting value, you'll be wholly pleased with The Wilderness Missions.
