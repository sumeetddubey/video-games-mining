It's WWF. In Your House. Yep, that's what it is. Says so right on the box. 

 One word - cheese. No, I take it back, not EVEN cheese - Velveeta. Velveeta and "lite" beer, that 
 would be the official dish of WWF In Your House, if it (God forbid) had one.   

 WWF In Your House, limping grimly on in the Mostly Korny tradition of digitized fighters, features 
 bouts between 10 of the WWF's biggest and baddest: Sternocleidomastoid-clenchers like Ahmed Johnson, 
 Shawn Micheals, Bret "Hit Man" Hart, and my personal least-loathed, the Alice Cooper-esque Undertaker. 
 I gotta tell you, words just fail me when it comes to this game. It's all the same goofy, overblown, 
 ooh-that's-gotta-hurt antics (complete with combatant and announcer sound bytes) you would watch 
 as a dedicated fan of televised pro wrestling (although if you're one of these, I guess that pretty 
 much precludes you being able to read this review) , with a few extra tricks thrown in. Like all 
 sprite-fighters, you've got the expected base moves and character-specific realms/backgrounds... but 
 wait! What's your opponent doing?! He's running into the ropes and slingshotting across the mat 
 toward you like a fat, spandex-clad torpedo! That poofy Hunter Hearst-Helmsley just whupped you 
 upside the head with a silver-tipped walking stick! Is that in the rules? That masked porkbarrel, 
 The Man They Call Vader, is mounting the turnbuckle and launching himself into the air above you! 
 Down he comes like a 458-pound bird turd and THOOM, that's GOTTA hurt!  

 No pro wrestling game would be worth its weight in tobacco spit if it didn't allow things to get 
 out of hand - or in this case, out of the ring entirely. In each character-themed arena (or "house") , 
 the brawl can very easily spill over (or get kicked or slugged or flipped) into the surrounding 
 region, which might be anything from a Victorian reading room to grass bordered by troughs and 
 junker cars to a rock club to an ostentatiously gothic dungeon. The game tilts from the merely 
 flashy and overblown into the world of absolute lunacy once the special moves start to come into 
 play - everything from the aforementioned walking-stick stunt to fighters who morph into charging 
 hogs, and even to the Undertaker's "Tombstone Piledriver" attack - with actual tombstones.   

 
 It smarts like heck to admit it, but the game actually does get briefly interesting when up to 
 four players are going at it hell-and-sidewinders in the ring simultaneously. Just like on TV, 
 ludicrously elaborate three-on-one set-ups worthy of the Three Stooges can mark a combatant for 
 the inevitable Finish Move ("PIN HIM"! I'm not kidding, it actually says that) , and the mayhem 
 starts to feel like some weird eye-boinking, gut-punching session of the old three-player arcade 
 game Rampage. Oddly, the game is KA rated, because instead of blood pouring from your pummelled 
 opponents, it's personal effects - decks of cards, gloves, hearts, as appropriate to the persona 
 of the fighter in question. It gets old, really old - we're talking neutron-star old - fast, but 
 one has to admit, for a while the gameplay is there. And of course, real WWF fans will eat it up. 

 Um. Er. What else can I tell you? It's WWF. In Your House. Yep, that's what it is. Says so right 
 on the box.   

 I'm gonna go read some Flannery O'Connor now.
