:::Review:::
Alchemy is a solid puzzle game, although it can get quite difficult. Check this one out if you're 
 serious about puzzle games. 

  The concept of Alchemy is simple -- arrange colored symbols into columns or rows to clear them off 
 the board. The catch is that you can only place a piece of an identical color or symbol in any 
 given adjacent square. While each round starts out simple enough, things can quickly get out of 
 hand with a few badly placed pieces here and there. The game ramps up the difficulty over time; 
 but if you've been around the block with puzzle games, you're probably up for the challenge. With 
 enough patience and practice, Alchemy can be very rewarding.
