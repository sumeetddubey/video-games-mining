:::Review:::
The game was obviously made by people who love the subject matter, and that affection comes across 
 in every element. 

  The original Riddle of the Sphinx from 2000 was obviously a labor of love. The fact that it was 
 essentially put together by two people was impressive. Equally impressive was the sheer amount 
 of research put into the game and how this knowledge formed the backbone of most of its puzzles. 
 For the sequel, developers Jeffrey and Karen Toler were obviously given a bigger budget. The production 
 values are higher, and the game is bigger, and better, in every way, and has more places to visit 
 and more puzzles to solve. The result is a lengthy and challenging game.           There's a lot 
 of required reading.    

  The Omega Stone picks up just moments after Riddle of the Sphinx ends. A colleague has come to 
 the Sphinx with dire news -- a scroll has been found that predicts a great calamity. This prediction 
 is echoed, as you'll learn over the course of the game, in the Maya calendar and the mysteries 
 of Stonehenge. The doomsday plot is a bit overdramatic, especially compared to the first game's 
 low-key story, which basically amounted to "Hey, let's check out the Sphinx." Stranger still is 
 the revelation that the game takes place in the year 2012, but the only noticeable change in this 
 vision of the future is that Stonehenge is about to be turned into an amusement park.  

  Even if the story is a bit silly, it gives you an excuse to visit mysterious locations all over 
 the world, including Chichen Itza, Easter Island, Stonehenge, and others. And though these aren't 
 the most unique settings for an adventure game, the amount of historical and theoretical information 
 provided about each location more than makes up for any unoriginality. The Omega Stone may not 
 be the first game to use Stonehenge, but it's most likely the first to give you a detailed lecture 
 on its inaccuracies as an observatory.  

  Like Riddle of the Sphinx, The Omega Stone requires a great deal of reading. You'll read research 
 notes, journals, cryptic maps, and even several chapters of a trashy science fiction novel. And, 
 again like in Riddle of the Sphinx, all of the reading is required. You will be tested: Almost 
 every puzzle solution requires you to put together information from various sources. Occasionally, 
 the use of this information seems silly, as you jump through hoops just to open a locked door. 
 But most of the time, simply arriving at a solution is reward enough. The puzzles in The Omega 
 Stone are tough, and there are plenty of them, but they are consistently logical and organically 
 integrated into the story. They are also lengthy and often have several steps -- including other 
 puzzles -- to their solutions.  

  If there's a problem with The Omega Stone, it's that you have to do an unrealistic amount of traveling. 
 Flying from Mexico to Egypt to England over and over again may give you flashbacks of Sierra's 
 adventure game Time Zone, another disc-swapping nightmare. (In fact, we recommend you perform a 
 full installation of the game, which removes the need for changing discs.) For the most part, no 
 single location is self-contained: You'll need items from one location to solve a puzzle in another. 
 Occasionally, new clues will appear when you revisit an area, which makes an already lengthy game 
 even lengthier. Not that this is a bad thing in and of itself, but there's so much to explore in 
 The Omega Stone that having to reexplore everything can become overwhelming.           Easter Island 
 is just one of the historical enigmas you'll get to explore.    

  Luckily, the exploration is enjoyable, and the sites are rendered with great attention to detail. 
 Though the graphics are occasionally muddy, making key elements blend into the background, the 
 game generally looks good. The Omega Stone also uses live actors integrated into the rendered backgrounds. 
 It's not state of the art by any means, but it's a pleasant change from the barren locations common 
 to the genre. It would be easy to criticize some of the acting, such as the Scottish archaeologist 
 whose accent flickers on and off like a faulty bulb, but that would be missing the point. Even 
 with its new technical bells and whistles, The Omega Stone retains the homegrown quality of Riddle 
 of the Sphinx. The game was obviously made by people who love the subject matter, and that affection 
 comes across in every element.  

  This affection also makes the game easy to recommend. The difficulty of the puzzles will undoubtedly 
 limit the game's appeal, but those who enjoy a challenge will find plenty to like about The Omega 
 Stone. And the detailed information about the various locales only serves to make the game that 
 much more enjoyable.

Review:  This game starts just where Riddle of the Sphinx left off. After opening the ark of the covenant, 
 you are sent flying and fall unconcious. You wake up in Geoffreys tent, where he proceeds to tell 
 you all that he knows and has discovered from the ark, scrolls and a secret chamber in the secret 
 chamber of the sphinx. You, his friend must venture to five different ancient civilization and 
 their monuments, to discover how they are all related to one civilization, Atlantis, and how they 
 speak of the Omega Stone, which will bring the end of times.
  
  Graphics are just as good as in the Riddle of the Sphinx. This time, providing much more 360 view 
 than in the last game. The monuments, the cutscenes and the different places you can see are represented 
 almost as if you are really there, and just a hand away.
  
  Gameplay is exactly like ROTS (Riddle of the Sphinx) , except for the "fast-inventory" mode, in 
 other words, if you right-click, you have the inventory.
  
  Music and sound are amazing. Period.
  
  Finally, to conclude, for anyone searching for a solid 
 archaeological mystery game, Omega Ston is for you.
