:::Review:::
While it may appeal to nostalgic Starcraft fans, there isn't anything in Outlive that isn't done 
 much better in any number of recent games. 

 Real-time strategy gaming changed forever with the release of Blizzard's Starcraft back in early 
 1998. For some reason, though, the genre never experienced a flood of Starcraft clones comparable 
 to the earlier proliferation of Command &amp; Conquer copycats. Although three years have passed, 
 Outlive clearly is still heavily indebted to Blizzard's unforgettable classic.   

  Outlive is a science-fiction-themed real-time strategy game that carries the indelible mark of 
 Starcraft. In fact, from the moment you're presented with the 640x480 default graphics and the 
 game's perspective (which is virtually identical to that of Starcraft) to the first time you hear 
 the unit acknowledgements, it's like a flashback to 1998. The two games are similar in overall 
 looks, and some of the unit graphics directly resemble their Starcraft counterparts. For instance, 
 the memorable firebat unit voice-over from Blizzard's game has a close counterpart in Outlive's 
 functionally similar flamethrower unit. There are even special hero units with signature voice 
 acknowledgements. It's as though the Outlive designers had set out to design a Starcraft tribute 
 game.   

  Unfortunately, Outlive lacks the very elements that made Starcraft so exceptional. Instead of the 
 three distinct yet balanced races in Blizzard's game, there are two similar but uninspired sides 
 in Outlive: the humans and the robots. Starcraft's three successive campaigns that took you through 
 each side in turn and told a compelling story both through cutscenes and in-game events have given 
 way to a stale, sterile plot about the threat of the extinction of humanity and the competing attempts 
 to ensure its survival through either genetic engineering or robotics. Mission briefings are presented 
 with scrolling text and voice-overs, which make the game seem rather hollow. Some real-time strategy 
 games like Total Annihilation succeeded in spite of thin storylines through excellence in gameplay, 
 but that's not the case with Outlive.   

  The design of Outlive follows the tried-and-true harvest-build-conquer model. You need power to 
 run your base's buildings, and credits (obtained by refining ore) are necessary to buy or build 
 units and structures. Some of the details include wind-powered power plants (akin to those in Total 
 Annihilation) , which can generate more power when placed at higher elevations, and the rate of 
 resource recovery can be increased through researching improvements. Units can obtain better armor, 
 weapons, or special abilities through research as well, but none of these concepts seem cohesive: 
 It's as if the developer tacked a bunch of ideas onto a Starcraft framework instead of really attempting 
 to produce an original game. Even the market structure, which lets you buy units directly and adjust 
 prices based on the demand created by previous purchases, seems like a gimmick.   

  This manifests itself in the gameplay as well, which seems very much like Starcraft. Units move 
 and attack like those in Starcraft, and large battles degenerate into masses of units shooting 
 at each other without your being able to distinguish what is going on. Tactics definitely take 
 a backseat to mouse clicking. It's true that there are some tactical elements to consider, such 
 as which ground units can fire at flying units, but controlling large armies in combat is almost 
 impossible. It's possible to give units some advanced instructions and set parameters for when 
 units should disengage, but tactical finesse is not what's required to win.   

  That's not to say that the missions are easy. Some of them are quite difficult, although not because 
 of any especially clever artificial intelligence displayed by the computer opponent. Instead, the 
 computer relies on masses of units, and in some cases these can be very difficult to fight through, 
 even on the normal difficulty setting (there is also an easy setting and a hard setting) . Otherwise, 
 for its skirmish mode, the game offers a variety of maps, which are similar to those used in the 
 campaign missions. Outlive's multiplayer mode allows for up to 16 players and supports cooperative 
 play. Optional modes such as deathmatch, free for all, and capture the flag are supported. There 
 is even a cooperative mode for the campaign, which two players can play together. Unfortunately 
 these extra features don't begin to address the inherent problems in the game.   

  Had Outlive been released at the same time as Starcraft, it would have compared unfavorably with 
 Blizzard's classic. Three years later, it's a reminder of how much the earlier game advanced the 
 real-time strategy genre. While Outlive may appeal to nostalgic Starcraft fans, there isn't anything 
 in Outlive that isn't done much better in any number of recent games. The real-time strategy genre 
 currently has many excellent games available to satisfy a lot of specific kinds of preferences. 
 With so many games to choose from, it makes little sense to revisit three-year-old concepts.
