:::Review:::
In light of recent space sim successes like Descent: Freespace and Independence War, it's difficult 
 to take Ares Rising too seriously. 

 It cannot be wrong to generalize that, much like the first-person shooter, the space flight simulation 
 is a genre whose visual presentation is critical to its overall quality. Although a plausible physics 
 model, fast action, and even a good story are components whose importance are not to be understated, 
 when you get right down to it, a space flight sim is only as good as it looks. After all, the goal 
 of the genre is to accurately re-create what it might be like to fly a spacecraft, a goal that's 
 become all the more approachable recently with the advent of powerful 3D graphics accelerators. 
 To that extent, several recent contenders in the genre not only look incredible, but offer sophisticated 
 gameplay to match - Wing Commander: Prophecy, Descent: Freespace, and Independence War all combine 
 top-notch flight dynamics with stunning visual effects, the illusion of relativistic speed, and 
 awe-inspiring scale.  

 So in light of these recent successes, it's difficult to take Ares Rising too seriously. It's a 
 game whose visuals look worse than the first batch of polygonal space sims like X-Wing and Wing 
 Commander III. Ares Rising offers a solid flight engine, a detailed story, a nonlinear campaign, 
 and a slew of multiplayer features, but its graphics restrain it from any measure of greatness. 

 If anything, at least Ares Rising goes to show that 3D-accelerator support doesn't automatically 
 equate to good graphics. Sure, you'll get a smooth frame rate out of it if you've got a decent 
 system, but even at 60 frames a second, ships still look like they turn into corn flakes and cotton 
 balls when they explode. Big bitmapped background images of planets and galaxies and so forth make 
 outer space look downright tacky, and the ship designs in the game run the range from plain to 
 just plain ugly. Gratuitous bits of debris drift by every now and then but do little good toward 
 creating any sense of speed. Each ship you fly has its own clunky-looking bitmapped cockpit that 
 obscures your view to varying degrees unless you turn it off, complete with a counterintuitive 
 radar display and other difficult-to-read controls. By comparison, both Prophecy and Freespace 
 feature nonintrusive, authentic 3D cockpits that shudder violently when struck, adding to either 
 game an even deeper sense of involvement and realism. Ares Rising sounds bad, too, with rude buzzes 
 and clacks reporting its various weapons systems, and its soundtrack bears down with heavy-handed 
 repetition.  

 Just as its in-flight graphics show a lot of room for improvement, so does its interface in between 
 missions. Ares Rising situates you within a typical Wing Commander-style facility where you can 
 click around to various locations and do things like buy equipment, launch missions, and so forth. 
 Aside from the high resolution, there's little evidence that the graphics on these screens are 
 anything less than a decade old. But beneath the layers of dust, you'll find what's actually a 
 perfectly acceptable simulation that recalls Origin's Privateer more than anything else, what with 
 its nonlinear structure and open-ended ship design. The similarity is not homage or coincidence, 
 as Ares Rising's developer includes several Origin veterans.  

 The idea is, you choose from a number of different missions, most of which are quick and fairly 
 exciting under the circumstances. On their successful completion, you earn money in addition to 
 salvaged equipment. You also get to advance the plot, primarily through a series of e-mail transmissions 
 and personal log files. The story is interesting enough, and tries to make its main characters 
 interesting and plausible, but because the lengthy e-mails and logs are so difficult to read, let 
 alone scroll through, the story in Ares Rising is easily forsaken. That leaves just the space combat 
 itself, which feels a little sluggish but otherwise offers enough variety and challenge. You can 
 dynamically adjust power levels between your shields, your weapons, and your engines; you can launch 
 missiles and countermeasures; you can lead your target with electronic tracking; and you can manage 
 your wingmen. If you've played a space simulation before, you know the drill. Ares Rising also 
 offers a multiplayer mode, heavily advertised on the packaging because it allows you to maintain 
 a persistent record that tracks kills and so forth. That's all well and good, but the biggest problem 
 facing multiplayer is the probable lack of opposition in light of the game's shortcomings.  

 It seems petty if not entirely unfair to lambaste a game because of its less-than-average graphics, 
 especially if what's left of the game is all right. But in the case of Ares Rising, its look is 
 not only disagreeable, but distracting to the point where you need to go out of your way to accept 
 the problem. And what with this game having at least three competitors that offer gameplay that's 
 at least every bit as good, along with some of the most incredible graphics to date, Ares Rising 
 must be approached only with deliberation and skepticism.

Review:  Ares Rising made a bit of a splash back before it was released, created by a split of of Origins 
 Privateer team, it had the community going - Deep universe, good gameplay, D3D graphics, open endedness. 
 It had it all. However, previous to its release FreeSpace was released - And as we all know, it 
 was 'the thing'. And since Ares Rising didn't follow it as a 'clone', it was subpar.
  
  However if you look to the game as it actually is, an open ended, mercenary space combat simulation 
 with an interesting storyline and tight gameplay - Its quite good. Not only does it deliver on 
 the singleplayer gameplay, but also has a progressive, coop multiplayer - Something that was never 
 taken into account I think. Its very enjoyable.
  
  It is not perfect, this is true, if you're in D3D mode the game can look a bit off (and on XP with 
 SP3 DD or SOFT mode are the only two modes that work, D3D will lockup.) And some of the missions 
 are indeed difficult, but overall if you want a unique gaming experience you can find it here. 
 It is also easily available, still in retail stores.
