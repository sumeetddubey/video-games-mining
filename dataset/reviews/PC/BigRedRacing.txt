:::Review:::
A racing sim it's not, but arcade fans should get a real kick out of it. 

 When Gamespot asked me if I wanted to review Big Red Racing, I laughed. "What is it,? I said, "a 
 stock-car simulation/adventure where you have to finagle Wrigleys into sponsoring you?" Well, it's 
 a racing game alright, but you've never seen races like these: dump trucks are pitted against bulldozers, 
 snow plows against snowmobiles, hovercrafts against moon buggies - you get the idea. And the race 
 locations are equally bizarre, ranging from streets, quarries, and rivers all over the globe to 
 tracks on Venus, Mars, and the moon. With 16 vehicles and 24 tracks - plus multi-player support 
 via split-screen and modem (two players) or network (for up to six players) , Big Red Racing has 
 a lot going for it.  

 But I gotta admit that the first time I took it for a spin, I couldn't find many nice things to 
 say about it. Take the in-your-face commentary, which assaults you as soon as the game starts. 
 I like crude, stupid humor as much as anybody, but this stuff - farts, belches, guffaws, and smart-ass 
 remarks - was too retarded (and deliberate) , even for me. And things didn't get much better once 
 I picked a track and started a race: I found myself bouncing all over the place, just struggling 
 to stay on the track for more time than I spent off it.  

 One thing I've learned reviewing games, though, is that ya gotta give 'em a second, third, fourth, 
 or even fifth chance - after all, that's what somebody who bought the thing will do before they 
 take the trouble to return it. So I went back to Big Red Racing, again and again and again - and 
 about the fifth time around, the magic finally kicked in. Now I try a couple of races every day, 
 made easier by the game's excellent performance in Windows 95. It's great to take a break from 
 writing, fire up BRR, and run a few laps. And that commentary? I found out that you can turn it 
 off if you don't like it.  

 Finding the best perspective for racing can be tricky: because the "in the driver's seat" view is 
 almost worthless (you're bouncing around so much you can't see where you're going) , you'll inevitably 
 wind up using an external view. And I still find some of the vehicles (especially the helicopters) 
 tough to control. The truth is, though, if you stick with it long enough, you'll find yourself 
 winning some races - and feeling pretty damn good about it, too.  

 Once you get the hang of it, BRR's a real gas, especially in its multi-player mode. A racing sim 
 it's not, but arcade fans should get a real kick out of it.

Review:  No matter what, this games really fun. A highly addictive game for people of all ages. This game 
 is not like most normal racing games, its even better!!! But it has more of an arcade type gameplay 
 racer to it. What you do in this game is you get to race a unique variety of different vehicles (trucks, snow 
 vehicles, helicopters etc..., and then choose a character to race with, and your off! You get to 
 choose from tons of different locations on earth and more..... hint*space*. From different planets, 
 to snowy locations on earth, Italy, the endless amount of locations make this game awsome. Geting 
 this game is worth your money and time and you deffintly won't be dissapointed. From just looking 
 at this game you would think that it isn't all that great but trust me on this, you'l like it.

Review:  Aside from the TERRIBLE graphics, the game was quite amusing. The controls are simple enough for 
 a kid to remember and use, but they are distinct enough from each other to be effective. There 
 were quite a few maps to race on, with several different types of vehicles. The space levels were 
 difficult because of the lack of traction (gravity) , and the air races were interesting simply 
 because of the concept of racing in helicopters. The Great Britain races were fun because of the 
 turning ability of the Beetles, and the desert races were some of my favorites because of the top 
 speed of the tractors. A pretty decent game.
