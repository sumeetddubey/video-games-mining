:::Review:::
All I can think of as I drag my putter through this unimaginative game is its unrealized potential. 
 

 Pardon me while I wax nostalgic.  

 It is a rite of passage for teenagers living on Chicago's north side and northern suburbs to go 
 out on a date to Par-King Skill Golf in Morton Grove. There may be a better miniature golf course 
 somewhere, but Par-King, with its Mount Rushmore, roller coaster, and Prudential Building complete 
 with elevator, has packed them in for more than 30 years. Weekend evenings with two hour waits 
 to tee-off may be long gone (it's down to about a half-hour now) , but it's still the place for 
 wholesome fun.  

 And I wish I were there now because 3D Ultra Mini Golf is no substitute. All I can think of as I 
 drag my putter through this unimaginative game is its unrealized potential. If you're a Par-King 
 alum, I know you've conjured up numerous dream holes, and now, with all the power of computer graphics 
 and sound, the mind quivers at the possibilities.  

 I'm sure the designers of 3D Ultra Mini Golf considered those possibilities, but they unfortunately 
 settled for something much more mundane. Where are the pyrotechnics? How about some real surprises? 
 And, most important of all, where's the fun?  

 That's not to say some of 3D Ultra Mini Golf's 18 holes aren't creative. Where else can you putt 
 on a Moon Base, amongst dinosaurs, or underwater? But none of the holes offers anything that resembles 
 excitement, and the feeble attempts at humor don't work. Multiple announcers with multiple accents 
 explain each hole's objective with musical accompaniment. But a Jamaican accent and Reggae music 
 for a hole set in an Aztec temple? Come on.  

 And not only are the holes uninspired, but the gameplay is kludgy at best. You have two putting 
 speed options: either power meter controlled (like most golf sims) or pushing the mouse at variable 
 rates. Neither works well. Lining up your putts is a pain since there are no variable camera angles. 
 Your ball can be off to one side of the screen with the hole on the other side. In some instances 
 the hole can be behind you, off-screen. This is equivalent to putting backwards, between your legs, 
 with your eyes closed.  

 On many holes, you tee-off with no idea where the hole is. Why not display a little bull's-eye? 
 Most holes have hazards that go so far as to blow up, disintegrate, crush, or ground your ball 
 into sawdust, but none of the animations is entertaining. The graphics are decent, but how about 
 a drop shadow for the ball or a ball's eye view or tracking cameras? These are standards in golf 
 games; why should mini golfers expect any less?  

 If you see this puppy on the discount rack for $5 to $10, then snarf it up for its momentary diversion. 
 Otherwise, head for Par-King.

Review:  3D Ultra Minigolf features a lot of unique holes... among them a dinosaur-loaded prehistoric landscape, 
 an underwater hole, and even a hole based on Sierra's The Incredible Machine game. Many of the 
 props and creatures on the holes are interactive; hit a bird with a ball and perhaps it will carry 
 it and drop it into the hole, but run over a spider web and maybe the spider will take the ball 
 and you'll have to start over!
  
  The camera angles can be a bit unaccommodating at times, but the game offers an aiming bar to help 
 you line up your shot. The power bar, in which you power-up your shot by holding down the mouse 
 button shorter or longer, is generally easier to use than true putt, which has you thrust the mouse 
 at different speeds to make your putt. Sometimes there is more than one way path to follow to the 
 hole, and if you have the animations and voices turned on, it will generally point them out to 
 you. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on your point of view) , you can restart any hole 
 at any time without penalty. You will get better at this game with practice.
  
  While this game may not be a great match for someone who plays a lot of more advanced golf games, 
 it's a great beginner's game or for young kids. I have had it for more than 5 years and still take 
 it out occasionally for a round of minigolf. If you find a copy of this great older game, pick 
 it up and give it a try.
