:::Review:::
Pro Pinball is one of the most realistic pinball simulations in the computer gaming circuit. 
 

 You've pulled back the plunger and launched the ball, commencing the game. Your eyes trace the familiar 
 mercury sphere as it ricochets off this bumper and that target. You slap the flipper buttons, trying 
 desperately to remain afloat. But hold on: the ball is rolling straight down the center! With an 
 unorthodox, violent heave, you shove the table to the right and the ball is saved. Wait a minute, 
 you just destroyed your friggin' keyboard!  

 Interplay's new release Pro Pinball caters to those who love the physicality of playing on a good 
 pinball table, whether they're hard-core computer gamers or not. A no-frills pinball game, Pro 
 Pinball won't offer you any live critters or powered spaceships living under the glass. No, it's 
 simply based on a modern table you might find in any arcade. But the most amazing thing about Pro 
 Pinball - as you'll recognize after only a few moments - is that its high-resolution graphics and 
 true table physics combine to make it one of the most immersive pinball titles out there.  

 You play on a table called "the Web," replete with loads of standard pinball provisions: ramps, 
 loops, bumpers, targets, and flashing lights galore. You control three flippers, trying throughout 
 the game to knock the ball into the various trapdoors and ramps scattered about. Three additional 
 buttons enable you to nudge the ball up or to either side (don't hold them down too long, or you 
 risk getting chastised by the game's commentator and receiving a "tilt") . As in regular pinball, 
 you earn privileges such as "automatic kick-back," "magnetism," and "multi-ball" for exceptional 
 play. When certain targets are hit, a mission light is activated and you'll need to shoot specific 
 ramps, strike specific targets, or play out a separate challenge on the dot-matrix screen just 
 above the table. One of the dot-matrix games, which has you shoot asteroids as they careen toward 
 you, is actually almost as fun as the pinball. Setting itself apart from most pinball titles, Pro 
 Pinball also has an object: beat five missions during a single game and you get a chance to overthrow 
 the conceptual antagonist of the title, the Dark Queen.   

 In the final analysis, Pro Pinball is one of the most realistic pinball simulations in the computer 
 gaming circuit. The graphics and ball movement are so stunningly accurate, you'll almost feel as 
 if you're controlling a real table. To make the experience even more realistic, developers Empire 
 Interactive have added a feature to their web page where players can enter their high-scores for 
 all to view. The only real complaint here is that there's only one table to choose from, making 
 overall replay value a little lower than some of the competition. While computer pinball will probably 
 never be as fun as the real thing, folks who enjoy pinball games of any kind will probably be shooting 
 toward this title like quicksilver.
