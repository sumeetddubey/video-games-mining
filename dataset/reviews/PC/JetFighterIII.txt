:::Review:::
JetFighter III is a good game, if not a great sim, and that's good enough. 

 No less than four-and-a-half simulations of the next generation F-22 Lightning fighter jet are winging 
 their way to computers, developed by Novalogic, Mission Studios, DID, and Interactive Magic (with 
 EA's effort in ATF counting as a half) . Novalogic and now Mission Studios have both weighed in 
 with their entries, but gamers will have to wait for DID and IM to see a real simulation. While 
 F-22 Lightning II and now JetFighter III both have good graphics and gameplay, as sims they're 
 closer to TIE Fighter than Su-27.  

 And that might not be a bad thing, depending on what kind of gaming you like. If you like just getting 
 up in a high-tech fighter and running through air engagements and ground strikes without a lot 
 of simulation fuss, then JetFighter III is a good package. Since it's going toe-to-toe with F-22 
 Lightning, we'll spend some time comparing the two, but first the basics. JetFighter III continues 
 the tradition of this venerable series by including the older F/A-18 Hornet, as well as the new 
 F-22. The game engine is set around a virtual cockpit that you can walk through to access different 
 parts of the game. This becomes more of a nuisance than an asset after the novelty value wears 
 off, leaving you with several separate screens full of navigation before you get from briefing 
 to cockpit.  

 Gameplay is based around two full campaigns and an extensive set of training missions. Some stand-alone 
 canned missions are included, but no custom mission builder is available as in ATF, USNF, and F-22 
 Lightning. Your role as a pilot in a UN rapid deployment force puts you onboard a carrier during 
 ops against Cuban-backed drug lords and an Argentinean invasion of Chile. Missions are a familiar 
 and satisfying mix of stand-off air-to-air engagements, tight furballs, and ground strikes with 
 dumb munitions and AGMs. You can continue through a campaign despite mission failure. Mission AI 
 is actually pretty strong, stronger than that in F-22 Lightning. This means you have fewer instances 
 where you launch an AIM-120 and take out the enemy before you see him, allowing for more intense, 
 close-in dogfighting.   

 Graphically, JF3 is sharp, but not as sharp as F22 Lightning. Both have significant frame-rate problems 
 on many systems, but JF3 seems to have the weaker performance. I got a fair chop on higher settings 
 despite running it on a P200 with 32 megs of RAM and a Mach 64 Rage board. There were also frequent 
 3-5 second pauses which, I later found out, could only be remedied by manually copying some terrain 
 files to the hard drive. JF3's external views are handled quite well, with the notable exception 
 of the "external padlock view" (where both you and the locked enemy are kept in view from outside 
 the plane) , which is absent. The virtual cockpit in JF3 is quite well done, however, with a smooth-flowing 
 perspective as you move your "head" around the cockpit. The cockpit itself is not as well done 
 as F22's, and the HUD didn't look right at all. Switching between instrument views was easy enough, 
 but the optional one-fourth-screen band of cockpit along the bottom was inexplicable, especially 
 since it polarized several times.  

 Flight modeling is, alas, simplistic, with the usual complaints of over-forgiving handling, poor 
 drag effects, ridiculous stalls, "turn-table" rudders, and the rest of the sins that will take 
 it off the lists of serious sim enthusiasts. Still, it's a better flight model than F22's, with 
 all these problems being far less pronounced in JF3 than in F22. For instance, rudders in F22 would 
 spin you on a dime, while in JF3 it's more like spinning on a quarter. None of this will matter, 
 however, if you just want to get into the air and shoot stuff, and at this JetFighter performs 
 admirably. Gameplay is good, with plenty of action and easy cheat options available USNF-style 
 from an ingame drop down menu. There is never a shortage of targets, and several missions are just 
 fun shooting galleries, such as one with a phalanx of stationary choppers.   

 The most important thing to note is that JetFighter III makes no claims of realism, and actually 
 boasts that it's the "easiest-to-use" flight simulator. For this alone Mission Studios scores the 
 extra point for delivering what they promised, a point F22 lost with their outrageous claims of 
 realism. Ironically, JF3 DOES have a more realistic flight model than F22, though they make no 
 claims for it.  

 Unfortunately, while JetFighter III wins in gameplay, it fails in features. There is no multiplayer 
 option and no custom mission builder, as in F22 Lightning. You also can't edit mission parameters 
 or waypoints, or customize your flight group. You can, however, create custom squadron logos and 
 place them on your planes: a useless but nice feature.  

 JetFighter III is a good game, if not a great sim, and that's good enough. Neither it nor F22 is 
 forgiving on your system, and for higher res modes you'd better have a Pentium, and even then some 
 features will need to be turned off during engagements. JF3 has better actual gameplay due in no 
 small part to better opponents and mission structure, and it is very easy to use. F22 has multiplayer 
 play, more customizable features, and better graphics. Which you buy depends upon your priorities.
