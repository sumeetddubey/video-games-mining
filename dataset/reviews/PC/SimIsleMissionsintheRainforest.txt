:::Review:::
The big change in SimIsle, aside from its heavy-duty, protect-the-rainforest theme, is that it's 
 more like a role-playing game than its predecessors. 

 Trees are a poem the Earth writes across the sky. Humanity cuts them down for paper so we 
 may record our emptiness. -a quote from Kahlil Gibran, on page one of SimIsle's 100-page 
 paper manual.  

 The cynic would say that SimIsle represents Maxis' effort to make up for creating a generation of 
 developers, polluters and high-risers with their excellent and incredibly popular SimCity series 
 of games. I say that after SimFarm, SimTower and SimAnt, they have simply run out of places to 
 develop. Whatever the case, Maxis has come out with a new sim that manages to keep most of what 
 was good about the other titles, and incorporate just enough change to create a new challenge for 
 all of the SimAddicts out there.  

 The big change in SimIsle, aside from its heavy-duty, protect-the-rainforest theme, is that it's 
 more like a role-playing game than its predecessors. Where SimCity allowed you total freedom in 
 initial creation and then forced you to face the consequences, SimIsle is more concerned with having 
 you think of your actions as a means to an end. Each new island presents a different challengesay, 
 building a tourist industry or developing local culturesand you must utilize your agents' 
 special skills to achieve these goals within a preset time period (although you can play in FreeForm 
 mode, with no limits) . As in a RPG, your actions are restricted to those that will help you on 
 your way, and everything you do serves as a stepping stone to success. If you cut more trees, you 
 can build more hotels; more hotels mean more tourists, more tourists mean more cash, etc.  

 The graphics keep the same colorful, busy feel as earlier Maxis titles, with little planes and 
 trucks zooming around the island. Multimedia film clips and sound effects are included but are, 
 for the most part, repetitive and extraneous. One exception is the game's soundtrack, which ranges 
 from tribal chants to metal rock with no apparent rhyme or reason.   

 In general, SimIsle won't disappoint the high expectations of hardened SimFans. It may not be the 
 best of the bunch, but, if you can handle the sick feeling you get when the first high-rise goes 
 up on a previously unspoiled island, your free time will soon be the endangered species.

Review:  INTRO
  Have you every wanted to have your own island? Well I think we all now the answer to that question. 
 The answer is a big YES! The maxis team had the same idea and made a game for that idea and therefore 
 Simisle was created. You would think that a game from the guys who brought you Sim City and Sim 
 Ant would also be able to help you live a dream (digital dream that is) of having that island you've 
 always wanted. Unfortunately the game is very difficult to the point where you spend at least ten 
 failures just to get the hang of the controls and options. The game has three major points of interest 
 the sim itself, gameplay, and graphics.
  
  THE SIM
  I have played many of the Sim games that are offered but this one left a bad taste in my mouth. 
 The sim itself was a great idea that just didn't seem to translate well to PC screen. The island 
 is yours. Thats the idea and you now must manage it from having nothing but a few villages and 
 your HQ. You must now finance the place. Well know how would someone do that on a seemingly deserted 
 island? Are you seeing the problem? The idea just is bogged with difficult problems and worries 
 that a person wanting to enjoy a game may find too stressful to handle.
  
  GAMEPLAY
  The gameplay is hard at best. I played the game for hours with nothing happening or improving, 
 well except that my money was running low and production of minerals was dismal. Upgrading to new 
 things was very difficult and cumbersome, not to mention that earning the money to do it was almost 
 impossible. After maybe ten hours on one island I finally was able to do something.... I actually 
 got tired of the slow and painful struggle and found some debugging codes. I had money and was 
 finally able to start doing stuff on a very small scale, can you say resort? After that the money 
 started slowly coming in after a few more resorts and an amusement park. Getting started is the 
 hardest part of this game and doing it without cheats or debugs is nearly impossible. Once the 
 money is rolling its so much easier. GRAPHICS
  Graphics are nice for the time very good and detailed for the PC's of the time. Each building could 
 be made out and moving in and out made it a little interesting too. Very much like the more successful 
 Sim City 2000 game. FINAL THOUGHTS
  Simisle is a game for those looking for a very difficult game to play. I found the game much more 
 enjoyable after I found some cheats and debugs. The game had such a cool idea but with so many 
 things that make it difficult I don't see myself playing it again anytime soon. Go out and have 
 fun!
