:::Review:::
You're more of an observer than active participant. 

 "If you liked Civilization and Command &amp; Conquer, you will love Outpost 2!" reads the tag line 
 on Sierra's web page. A more accurate boast would be: "Outpost 2: The Hurry Up and Wait game!" 
 Simply put, Outpost 2 is one of the most tedious, boring games to grace the market in a long time, 
 leaving you very little to do but wait and watch.   

 The first Outpost, a turn-based game, was plagued with a massive number of problems ranging from 
 gameplay problems to technical issues. So why would Sierra decide to create a sequel to a game 
 that didn't do so hot to begin with? The answer is simple: Sierra decided to capitalize on current 
 trends by making Outpost 2 real-time and throwing in some combat, which was lacking in the first 
 game - and by doing so, hoped to shake off the "sins of the father." Too bad Sierra forgot that 
 a game succeeds if it's fun, and not simply because it's part of a trend.  

 Outpost 2 has a lot of great features. It sports 16 bit color graphics, has a day/night cycle, offers 
 plenty of choices when it comes to unit commands, and offers two levels of play. One level is a 
 colony building game much like the first Outpost, but in real time. The second level is the typical 
 mission-based game where you lead one of the two sides through a variety of scenarios. You can 
 also play with up to six people through a network or Sierra's own gaming service. The multiplayer 
 setup has five different types of end goals to chose from, something more interesting than the 
 usual "kill them all" goal (though it's still one of the five choices) .   

 But features don't make the game; gameplay is what really counts. That's where Outpost 2 falls flat 
 on its face. The game is slow. Even on the highest game speed, units crawl around like ants struggling 
 in a puddle of molasses. Buildings look alike, making finding the right one for the task at hand 
 a hunt and peck chore. Combat is poorly done - usually, it's as simple as whoever has the most 
 units wins. The AI is terrible, with units in the proximity of battle just sitting motionless, 
 waiting for their turn to become space slag. Morale is supposedly an important part of colony management 
 but you can win a scenario regardless of the state of the troops' morale. The worst offender in 
 terms of bad gameplay is the scenarios themselves. A typical scenario: keep a certain number of 
 colonists alive, build a certain number of units, and research a certain number of ideas. This 
 is all accomplished by a couple of clicks of the mouse. Once you have made your building or research 
 decisions, you can literally go off and watch TV, coming back every so often to make some more 
 choices. Sadly, even the combat can be won while doing something else and paying little attention 
 to the game. Try reading a novel while playing Command &amp; Conquer and see where that gets you. 

 Outpost 2 is, in the end, a great deal of clicking and waiting with very little user control. Even 
 the features that should be its saving graces, such as combat and multiplayer support, help very 
 little. A patch to speed up play might help, but you are still faced with the fact that you're 
 more of an observer than active participant. This game is a prime example of what happens when 
 a company worries more about cashing in on a trend than actual gameplay. And, sadly, Outpost 2 
 probably would have been a lot better had it been turn based.

Review:  O2 is a classic. Granted, it doesn't cater to as wide of an audience, because it is an inherently 
 more complex game which forces the player to balance military and domestic issues at the same time. 
 That everything is hostile, even your own people, doesn't necessarily help. However, it's first 
 in its class for a simulation of how to pull your race together without an Earth there to help 
 you. I'll bet you didn't know that they consulted NASA engineers to learn about the issues of living 
 on a hostile planet, did you? It's more accurate than your petty score of 5.0 is admitting. Let 
 this classic live in it's glory, the glory of 1997, when 2D was hot, 3D wasn't there yet, and when 
 we all were more like those kids who can immerse themselves in a book. Sure, there aren't any cool 
 graphics, but the story and the gameplay combine to make it a wonderful experience.
  
  I've spent probably at least a twentieth of my short life playing this game, and it got me interested 
 in my career of Computer Science, it formed my pragmatic compulsion, which forced me from Computer 
 Scientist to software engineer, and it also kindled the gamer in me.
  
  I am a video game programmer because of this game.
  
  Until you play it as much as I, don't 
 bash it. Let this Revolution of 1997 live on in history with honor.
