:::Review:::
Hanging 10 in this movie-licensed surfing game has its moments -- just don't expect to enjoy it for 
 very long. 

  Thank god for the occasional bucked trend. Surf's Up could very easily have been yet another lamely 
 produced platformer or action adventure game based on an animated film. Instead, it's an oddly 
 competent surfing game. The game eschews any attempts at retelling the film's story, and is instead 
 content to act purely as a companion piece, letting you play as all the key characters from the 
 film in a game that feels like a combo of Kelly Slater and Wave Race for kids. It's not a remarkable 
 game, but at times it can be a decent bit of fun. It's just a shame that it offers so little in 
 terms of content.  

          Surf's Up isn't remarkable, but it's a decent little surfing game; and hey, it beats the 
 heck out of T&amp; C Surf Designs any day.     

  Jumping into a game of Surf's Up is a little off-putting at first. Your chosen surfer essentially 
 travels through the level on rails, and it's up to you to guide him or her past the various obstacles 
 that litter the game's courses. All along the way, a constant wave moves along with you, and you 
 can use this wave to perform tricks. The trick system is rudimentary, only tasking you with moving 
 up the wave until you get to the peak, then jumping off by hitting one of the trick buttons. While 
 you're in the air, you can do one of several different trick types, from grab tricks to special 
 tricks that can only be performed once you've built up a special trick meter. This meter is also 
 tied to speed boosts, which you can use to power past certain obstacles or opponent surfers.  

 
  As you go, you'll also be trying to pass through various gates, collect power-ups, grind on various 
 rails, and occasionally go crashing through stuff. All these tricks net you points, and the goal 
 of most levels is to hit a certain point target. There are actually two point targets in each stage, 
 but you only have to hit the first to progress.  

  The trick system works fairly well, and the controls are solid. The Wii version is the only one 
 that deviates from the standard control scheme, but it doesn't go overboard with motion controls. 
 The only motion you use in the game is to swing the Wii Remote downward to engage a speed boost. 
 However, the one caveat is that the Wii version is also missing a trick type, seemingly because 
 of the controller's lack of buttons compared with all the other console versions. The Wii version 
 doesn't necessarily suffer because of this, as it's pretty easy to hit the score targets without 
 this trick type, but it does come off as lazy that no effort was made to keep the missing trick 
 in the game. Interestingly enough, the GameCube version isn't missing any tricks and is $10 cheaper 
 than the Wii version. So, if you're a Wii owner, happen to have a Cube controller lying around, 
 and don't mind that it doesn't look quite as good as the Wii version, the Cube version is basically 
 an all-around better deal. Though, in truth, the PC version is probably the best deal of all at 
 only $20. The system requirements are modest, and it supports gamepads, so if you're hot to buy 
 any version of Surf's Up, that's probably the best way to go.  

  If there's any real complaint to be lobbied against the gameplay on all versions, it's that it's 
 occasionally bewildering. The tricks and other mechanics are quite simplistic, but getting your 
 surfer to engage in certain actions -- rail sliding, for instance -- is an inconsistent process. The 
 game is unpredictable with when it wants to magnetize you toward a rail to slide or have you miss 
 it altogether. You also may end up wrecking into a few more rocks or other immovable objects than 
 you'd prefer due to character movement not being quick enough or the sometimes-wonky physics pushing 
 you toward an object even though you were turning in the opposite direction. These issues don't 
 really make the game frustrating, as the difficulty is easy enough to where even crashing on a 
 regular basis doesn't detract from you passing a level. They're just kind of annoying.  

  The other issue of note with Surf's Up is that there's just nothing to it. The game's primary mode 
 is the championship mode, where you move from level to level, hitting the score targets and eventually 
 taking on the big kahuna of surfing, Tank, in the last stage. However, besting the championship 
 mode doesn't take more than an hour and a half the first time through. Granted, you won't collect 
 all the various idols and other hidden doodads in one play, but it's hard to imagine anyone taking 
 more than three or four hours to pull that off. Beyond this mode, there's a basic multiplayer mode 
 that's for two players on the Wii, PC, GameCube and PlayStation 2 and four players on the Xbox 
 360 and PlayStation 3. It's not online, and the number of maps you can race on is limited, but 
 it's there. Finally, there's a lame side game called Leaf Sliding, where you're lugging a big leaf 
 down one of three down-sloping courses. This mode is mildly amusing once, but that's about it. 

          If only there were more to do in the game thanwell, just this.     

  The game does at least have some decent presentational values backing it up. The graphics aren't 
 stellar, but the characters look good, the water moves nicely, and some of the trick animations 
 are pretty cool. Other animations look stiff and glitchy, but not horrifically so. Of course, the 
 360 and PS3 versions look significantly better than all the other versions, but the Wii and PC 
 versions actually look quite good too. The PS2 version is another story. The frame rate is much 
 choppier in that version, and all the neat little visual effects on the water and environments 
 are absent, making it look a lot blander than the other versions. The Cube version is somewhere 
 in between the PS2 and Wii versions. It's looks a little snazzier than the PS2 version, but it 
 also lacks some of the visual effects found in the Wii version. The game's audio is decent, mostly 
 because some of the actors from the film reprise their roles here, albeit in an extremely limited 
 fashion. Most of the dialogue comes from little news blips that act as surf reports before each 
 stage, and though most of the jokes are pretty dumb, the voice acting isn't half bad. Less entertaining 
 is the soundtrack, which is mostly generic rock, including some exceedingly generic songs from 
 bands like Simple Plan and Homegrown.  

  Surf's Up deserves a bit of credit for turning in something that isn't just a cakewalk action platformer 
 that does a lousy job of retelling the film's story. Sure, it would have been nice if the developers 
 had included any story to speak of, but from a gameplay perspective, the surfing-on-rails mechanic 
 works better than you'd expect and provides periodic moments of legitimate fun. It won't appeal 
 much to older players, and regardless of which platform you pick it up on, it's not worth its overly 
 expensive price tag, given the barren amount of content the game offers up. But for younger kids 
 who dug the movie, you'll get everything you need out of Surf's Up over the course of a rental 
 period.
