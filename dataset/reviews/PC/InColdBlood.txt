:::Review:::
It's good that the story of In Cold Blood is so interesting, because the game suffers from being 
 a bit light on both action and adventure. 

 In Cold Blood tells an interesting story, and tells it well. It's a good enough story to keep you 
 playing despite the game's many problems, and it eventually make you want to ignore these problems 
 altogether. You play as John Cord, a British spy with a James Bond complex who works for an undisclosed 
 agency. Your first task is to find a missing American agent, who is imprisoned in a uranium mine 
 in the fictional Russian state of Volgia. While exploring the mine, you'll find something else 
 entirely. The Volgians, it seems, are up to something very strange. They've harnessed a strange 
 form of energy, and their intentions for its use are unclear.  

          John Colt travels to a variety of locales over the course of the game     

  From this 
 starting point, the game takes off in unusual directions. It flirts with science fiction without 
 becoming too fantastic, and there are so many twists, turns, and complications that it remains 
 consistently interesting. And it gets progressively more disturbing, with both sad and startling 
 moments along the way. The nature of the narrative is interesting as well. Much of the game is 
 told in flashback -- each mission is framed as one of Cord's confessions during what appears to be 
 a very painful interrogation session.  

  It's good that the story is interesting, because the game suffers from being a bit light on both 
 action and adventure. In Cold Blood is similar to Metal Gear Solid, but without that game's ingenious 
 employment of its mechanics. You'll run into plenty of opponents, but the combat is fairly easy. 
 It's great that Cord can dispatch enemies from behind with a single blow, but you can just as easily 
 shoot your way through most levels. Occasionally, remaining unseen will be a key to success, and 
 the game would have been better overall if more of its areas required you to think your way past 
 guards.  

  The puzzles are pretty straightforward. They're more complex than those found in most console action-adventures, 
 such as Resident Evil, but experienced adventure gamers will have little trouble getting past In 
 Cold Blood's toughest roadblocks. Even so, many of the puzzles work well within the game, and require 
 you to find some key piece of information before you can continue. There are a few truly bizarre 
 puzzles -- using a particle accelerator as a glorified crossbow, for example -- but they're good for 
 the most part. And when they aren't good, at least they're simple. Your REMORA device, which lets 
 you hack into most electronic devices, will actually solve a good majority of the potential puzzles 
 for you, decrypting passwords and opening locked doors and the like.  

  If the REMORA can't figure it out, Cord often will, and at times the game seems a bit too eager 
 to ease. For instance, at one point you must find a means to disable a huge gun. All you need to 
 do is find the right computer, and Cord will tell it what to do. His solution is rather ingenious, 
 but the game might have been better off had you been required to figure it out for yourself. When 
 you do get to solve the puzzles yourself, the solution will usually be obvious from the elements 
 at hand, and only a few will require you to move more than a room away to find whatever it is you 
 need to move on.  

  There are also a few action-oriented puzzles. These are made frustrating by the game's terribly 
 imprecise movement. Cord will often get stuck on objects and walls, and doorways not clearly in 
 view tend to be terribly hard to move through as a result. The interface can also make combat frustrating, 
 as you must hold down one key to draw your weapon and another to fire it. Firing from a crouched 
 position requires the holding down of a third key. Luckily, the keys are all close to one another, 
 but it would have been more logical to have keys that toggled your stances, instead of forcing 
 you to play chords on your keyboard.  

  Another problem with the interface involves the most basic actions in the game. When you interact 
 with an object, you push an action key. This is straightforward and good, except you can interact 
 with almost anything from any position in the room, which can be frustrating. You'll be trying 
 to get Cord to access a computer terminal in one corner of a room, but every time you push the 
 action key he'll walk across the room to call the elevator.  

          These deadly patrol robots are immune to your weapons     

  In Cold Blood does include 
 some inspired gameplay elements. For instance, pointing your gun at people will often cause them 
 to divulge more information than speaking to them in a friendly tone will. Small touches like this 
 add enjoyment to the game. The dialogue is good, and the voices are great. In Cold Blood manages 
 to be slightly funny at times, but even when the humor fails, it does so with dignity -- it has little 
 of the embarrassing sort of failed humor found in many games.  

  That the story is enough to keep you involved says a great deal about the pacing of the game. The 
 music and the visuals both help create an almost relentless atmosphere of suspense and tension, 
 and the simple game mechanics help keep the pace brisk. Those who want action instead of fiction 
 will find the game somewhat dull, but those who appreciate an original story and great atmosphere 
 will find In Cold Blood to be a satisfying blend of espionage and science fiction.

Review:  In Cold Blood is a f*ckin' great game! I enjoyed it so much! I played it on the ps1 a few years 
 ago and i loveeed it, for real, you really should play this game, 'cause it's so cool ! The graphics.... hmm 
 well for a playstation 1 game the graphics are superb, if you play it now it looks pretty ugly 
 if you look at a game like Crysis, but still it's worth it and it's not a short game. You need 
 to take the time to play it and sometimes you really need to think about how you're going to complete 
 the mission. Just play it. I guarantee that it's worth it!
