Beach Head 2002 delivers arcade-style shooting in its most basic -- and repetitive -- form. 

  Beach Head 2002 is an updated version of Beach Head 2000, a repetitive arcade-style shooter that 
 lets you assume the role of a lone gunner trying to fend off a beach invasion. The new game takes 
 the same approach, but replaces the beach environment with some rolling hills. The few improvements 
 it includes do little to address the flaws of the original game, and since the new game is just 
 more of the same endless waves of enemies, it can't really be recommended even to those who might 
 have enjoyed Beach Head 2000 in some way.           The game consists of stage after stage of stationary 
 shooting action.    

 Beach Head 2002 gets old quickly, primarily due to its premise -- you're stuck in a bunker with a 
 few guns and limited ammunition, and there's an army of infinite size on the way to kill you. It 
 might make a good plot for an action film, but it's not much fun as a game. In this situation, 
 there is no hope of retreat, since you can only rotate about a fixed position and shoot at moving 
 targets. There is also no hope of victory, since the game will just continually throw more enemies 
 at you in the form of tanks, armored personnel carriers, helicopters, airplanes, and soldiers. 
 There is very little rhyme or reason to how these targets appear and move -- the units have no obvious 
 objective other than to destroy your bunker, and they come from all directions, giving the impression 
 that the invasion has already taken place long ago, and you're the only survivor. Since you can't 
 move and you can't win, your only goal is to do better than you did the game before and maybe gain 
 access to a new weapon or enemy unit to shoot at.   

  At times, the game is visually pleasing. The weapon and explosion effects are fairly realistic, 
 and the enemy units and environments look fine. The game's animation is repetitive but otherwise 
 acceptable. Unfortunately, some parts of the game's graphics don't add up -- your suspension of disbelief 
 will falter when a jet flies into a nearby hill and out the other side. And like its predecessor, 
 Beach Head 2002 has the habit of making units pop up out of nowhere, but whether this is a graphics 
 problem or a cheap way to keep you on your toes is unclear.   

  The weapon, vehicle, and explosion graphics are supplemented with decent sound effects, although 
 like the rest of the game, they quickly get repetitive. Shells hitting your bunker cause an appropriate 
 explosive rumble, and small-arms fire ricochets off armor with a metallic patter. Helicopters will 
 buzz the bunker with a distinctive chopper sound, and fighters will fly past your base with their 
 jet engine whine. Soldiers will catch on fire from nearby explosions and cry out in horror, but 
 there's very little variation in their screams.   

  The game would have benefited tremendously from more variation in weapons, enemies, and environments. 
 The few differences that you come across in the game are a welcome relief from tedium -- all of a 
 sudden, it might be nighttime and you only have a flashlight and a few flares to see your targets. 
 Or perhaps instead of the usual combined-forces raid on your bunker, the enemy has decided to send 
 a squad of fighter jets to attack you, and you have to replenish your ammunition by shooting at 
 air-dropped crates.   

  Your weapon choices also vary slightly from level to level -- one time you might just have a few 
 missiles, a machine gun, and an antitank cannon, while the next level will require you to rely 
 only on your handgun. While these changes make the level look different on the surface, it quickly 
 becomes clear that the underlying game plays like a broken record. And indeed, breaking your record 
 is the only reason you would continue to play the game after your first few tries. It almost seems 
 as if the publisher knows that nobody will play the game more than once, since the game tries to 
 install itself on your computer each time you put it in your CD drive, even if it is already installed. 
           Despite a few variations to the theme, Beach Head 2002 gets old fast.    

 To its credit, Beach Head 2002 is tough. Its combination of realistic particle effects, explosive 
 sounds, and endless waves of enemies can create some tense moments, especially when you are running 
 out of ammunition. While the game does not include adjustable difficulty settings, it does feature 
 built-in cheats that will give you unlimited ammunition or unlimited armor or let you skip to the 
 next level without having to complete the present level. This minimizes any frustration that might 
 arise from the game's relentless onslaught.   

  Beach Head 2002 delivers arcade-style shooting in its most basic -- and repetitive -- form. If the 
 idea of endlessly shooting wave after wave of the same few enemies with the same few guns in the 
 same exact environment appeals to you, you're better off buying Beach Head 2000 from the bargain 
 bin. If you've played and enjoyed the previous game, Beach Head 2002 is more of the same with some 
 minor tweaks, but those few tweaks are not worth the game's $20 retail price.

Review:  This is a good massacre game. I'm not sure what to say about the graphics, because I don't know 
 when it came out, but they would probably be good a while ago. Diagonal textures up close look 
 like small staircases, but you can see unit details from some distance away. With the tank explosions, 
 the turret comes off and goes maybe 10 feet into the air, then disappears into the ground, leaving 
 a scorch mark but no hole on the top of the bottom of the tank. APC and aircraft explosions, however, 
 look like you just blew up a bunch of black planks that loosely resemble outside parts of whatever 
 you just blew up. I don't get the weapon selection, also. There's an anti-tank gun, An M60, a double-barreled 
 anti-aircraft gun, and a minigun. The M60 and the minigun both have almost or the same rates of 
 fire, but the minigun may be slightly more powerful. Problem is, you can only have one M60, anti-aircraft 
 gun, or minigun in any one level, even though they said in the manual that the anti-aircraft gun 
 and the minigun are good for shooting planes and the M60 is less effective, like you can choose, 
 you're stuck with the M60 most of the time, even with planes and helicopters everywhere. You also 
 have a cannon for tanks and APCs (one-hit kills with the cannon) , and it's also good against troop 
 clusters. The missiles are probably the best weapons overall. They're as powerful as the cannon 
 on the ground, and good against troop clusters, too. They're also supposed to seek, which works 
 well with aircraft, but only sometimes with ground targets.
