:::Review:::
This game sucks all the fun out of drag racing, presenting the sport as slow and tedious instead 
 of fast and furious. 

  Drag racing is exciting because it distills auto racing into a very short, very intense event that 
 emphasizes the core strengths of American-made cars -- they go really fast, really quickly, and in 
 a really straight line. Even just watching these land-bound rockets is a viscerally thrilling blend 
 of noise, speed, and fumes. IHRA Drag Racing: Sportsman Edition, on the other hand, captures none 
 of the excitement of drag racing, instead presenting the sport as simplistic, ugly, and tedious. 

          Driving in a straight line has rarely been such a bore.     

  Every race in IHRA Drag Racing: Sportsman Edition goes something like this. First you enter your 
 dial-in time, which is your own rough projection of how long it's going to take your car to run 
 the quarter mile. It's extremely important that your dial-in time be as accurate as possible without 
 being over your actual race time, as it's used to handicap the delay between the two lanes on the 
 light tree. Set it too low and your opponent gets a head start on the light tree; set it too high 
 and you'll basically be disqualified from the race. If your car is equipped with a delay box, you 
 then set the delay time, which can be useful for getting off the starting line quicker but is difficult 
 to fine-tune. You go through the burnout phase in order to heat up your tires for optimal grip, 
 which simply requires you to lean on the accelerator button until the onscreen meter tells you 
 that your tires are suitably hot.  

  Then comes the staging mode, where you roll as far up on the starting line as you can without going 
 over; once you're staged, you're ready to race. If there's any challenge, it's in timing your acceleration 
 so that you're off the starting line within thousandths of a second of the light turning green. 
 There's rarely much challenge in keeping your car in its lane, and by default, the game handles 
 shifting gears automatically, though for a more realistic experience you can choose to shift manually. 
 From a strictly nuts-and-bolts perspective, it's technically fairly accurate, and gearheads will 
 probably appreciate realistic touches like the dial-in time; but in practice, the whole experience 
 is just mind-numbing. All the prerace preparations are basically mechanical, but the game still 
 requires you to go through them yourself every single time, and once you're actually off the starting 
 line you get no sense of power, speed, or danger, all of which are key to the experience of real 
 drag racing.  

  IHRA Drag Racing: Sportsman Edition packages its dull racing experience in two different ways, 
 neither of which is compelling enough to excuse how lackluster the core of the game is. An arcade 
 mode lets you jump right into a race against an artificial intelligence opponent or a friend using 
 prebuilt, tricked-out dragsters, while the season mode offers something a little more in-depth. 
 You start off with a beater, though by winning races you'll earn cash that you can spend on part 
 upgrades like new front and rear tires, engine blocks, cylinder heads, carburetors, blowers, nitrous 
 kits, camshafts, valves, transmissions, and delay boxes, as well as new cars.  

  The game has zero licenses beyond the IHRA name, which means that all of the parts you'll buy have 
 fake aftermarket names, and the cars you can buy look like knockoff versions of Challengers, Chargers, 
 Camaros, Monte Carlos, and so on. There's also some light tuning you can do, such as suspension 
 stiffness and your fuel ratio, and you can also choose from a handful of paint designs and colors. 
 The season mode focuses on a series of 12 bracketed events where you can earn not just cash, but 
 points that go toward your overall position for the season, though if you go straight into one 
 of the 12 season events with your stock car, you won't make it past the first qualifier. Instead, 
 you'll have to go and engage in single races, over and over again, in order to build up enough 
 of a bankroll to get your car into serious competition shape. The fact that you have to go through 
 a bunch of monotonous races for cash before you can think about going through the monotonous season 
 races speaks to how poorly the season mode was laid out.  

          The lackluster graphics and sound do little to improve what's already an underwhelming 
 experience.     

  Making IHRA Drag Racing: Sportsman Edition even harder to sit through is its muddy, underwhelming 
 presentation. The cars themselves actually look like decent approximations of real hot rods, but 
 everything else is just flat, barren, and ugly. The PC version of the game naturally looks clearer 
 than its console counterparts, but the improved resolution just makes it that much easier to see 
 the low-res environmental textures and pixelated cardboard-cutout crowds. The game can't even muster 
 some decent noise for the cars, which are inappropriately subdued, as if they're not even getting 
 out of idle as they race down the track, and are often overwhelmed by the game's antiseptic heavy 
 metal-inspired soundtrack. And you can forget about bells and whistles like track announcers.  
 

  It can be tempting to forgive certain production-value shortcomings when you're looking at a budget-priced 
 game like IHRA Drag Racing: Sportsman Edition, but the whole of this game is so shallow and so 
 unengaging, it doesn't warrant any such charity. This is a dreary approximation that makes the 
 genuinely exciting world of nitro-burnin' dragsters just look like a drag.

Review:  Embarrassing! I'd Rather play Burnout. No Steering Wheel Support, and Generic cars that are bad 
 representationss of real ones. SHAME I waited years for this? The menu is sparse, the options are 
 nearly non-existant. If you owned the original IHRA drag racing you will be so disappointed. Bethesda 
 would have done better to just come out with an updated version of that game with better graphics 
 and car physics. This is real amateur hour for a company with this kind of reputation. I think 
 they produced this game on their lunch budget. Not a Camaro or Mustang in site. I mean come on-"The 
 Horseman"? Where are the customizable controls? I paid all that money for a force-feedback wheel 
 so I could type my way down the track?
