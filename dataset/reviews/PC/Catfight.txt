Let's just get right down to the nitty gritty: Catfight is, without a doubt, the worst computer 
 game ever released. 

 Let's just get right down to the nitty gritty: Catfight is, without a doubt, the worst computer 
 game ever released. Touted as the ultimate female fighting game, what's most surprising 
 about Catfight is not how offensive it is, but on how many different levels it manages to offend. 
   

 The worst thing about Catfight (and, believe me, that's a hefty accomplishment) is that the gameplay 
 is just so damn bad. On the surface, the game seems like another generic, mano-a-mano fighter. 
 There's the obligatory story (evil person summons great fighters to otherworldly arena, yadda yadda 
 yadda) , plus diverse characters with special moves. Unfortunately, the game steals all of these 
 characters and moves from other games, without managing to steal any of the fun.  

 From the opening options screen, the game is almost impossible to control. If you're lucky enough 
 to be playing with a gamepad, the control is merely bad. With the keyboard, however, playability 
 sinks to horrible. On the keyboard, all of your character's special moves are single keystrokes, 
 but even with this advantage it's almost impossible to defeat the computer opponent 
 (not because of cunning AI, but because of the terrible response time) . To counteract this obvious 
 problem, the designers have included an easier difficulty level, which (get this) turns 
 the computer completely off, pitting you against an opponent who just stands there.   

 And I'm just getting started here. Catfight's graphics are blocky and pixelated, and the color palette 
 is horrible. The digitized actresses look like paper dolls moving at unnatural angles. The soundtrack 
 consists of annoying and repetitive squeals backed by bad heavy metal guitar. And, adding insult 
 to injury, turning the sound off in the options menu has absolutely no effect.   

 Catfight's sexism is almost too blatant to mention. In case you haven't guessed, Catfight's unique 
 spin on the genre is that all the combatants are scantily clad women. Strangely enough, Catfight 
 isn't even that offensive, just pathetically juvenile. The Mortal Kombat meets mud wrestling 
 concept has potential for some humorous kitsch, but the designers seem too preoccupied with their 
 prepubescent sexual fantasies to see any irony in their project.   

 No, what's truly offensive is that the designers (who, not surprisingly, use pseudonyms in the credits) 
 seem to think there is an army of like-minded social misfits, all more than willing to fork over 
 their hard-earned money to see buxom boxing beauties. But if this frightening target audience does 
 exist, and if there are people out there salivating at Catfight's premise, they should heed this 
 advice: buy Mortal Kombat or Battle Arena Toshinden and play mirror matches with Sonja or Sofia 
 to your heart's content. You'll thank me, and I'll sleep easier knowing there will never be a Catfight
