:::Review:::
Test Drive: Off-Road 3 demanded a lot more attention to detail than its developers actually invested. 
 

 Because sport utility vehicles are becoming more popular on the streets, it makes sense that Infogrames 
 is trying to capitalize on its popularity with a game that lets you drive some of the coolest SUVs 
 out there on real off-road tracks. Most SUV owners haven't even driven on bumpy roads; it'd be 
 nice to see how their cars might actually react in extreme road conditions, such as those in this 
 game. Unfortunately, Test Drive: Off-Road 3 demanded a lot more attention to detail than its developers 
 actually invested.  

 The gameplay itself is as simple as any other arcade-style driving game: Choose between manual and 
 automatic transmission and drive your car as fast as you can around a variety of courses. There 
 are two modes of play: a world-circuit mode that lets you advance through sets of tracks and an 
 arcade mode that lets you race on a single track at a time. Test Drive: Off-Road 3 has ten courses, 
 from a wild race up and down the Canadian Rockies, to a trek through the lush landscapes of the 
 Yucatan, to a sprint through the snowed-in streets of New York City. The concepts for the tracks 
 are great, and some of them are a lot of fun, including the aforementioned Rockies and the course 
 around the top of Mt. Fuji. Unfortunately, there are several glitches in the gameplay that weaken 
 the experience. These include races where you start behind an obstacle, tracks with an incredibly 
 annoying design that makes them no fun at all, and the computer racers' artificial intelligence, 
 or lack thereof.  

 While the graphics are generally acceptable, they break up in a lot of places, and there is considerable 
 distance fill-in on some of the more complex tracks. The polygon count is also pretty low, and 
 the software-rendered mode of the game doesn't look drastically different from the accelerated 
 version. In addition, during the countdown to some races, the camera will clip through an obstacle, 
 and you'll see all of the underlying polygons that exist behind that object, which is a pretty 
 ugly mess. At least the cars themselves are modeled well, although they cannot be damaged at all. 
 Even a 200-foot drop won't make the slightest bit of a difference to your vehicle, which is disappointing. 

 Test Drive: Off-Road 3's sound doesn't really add a lot to the game. Typical engine rumblings, skidding 
 sounds, and other basic noises are present, but when you're driving through mud or snow, you'll 
 only hear an odd sloshing noise that sounds nothing like you'd expect. Some of the other sound 
 effects are just as mysterious or nonexistent. Bands like Blink 182 and Incubus provide the soundtrack, 
 and while their songs occasionally mesh with the gameplay, you'll likely wish you could listen 
 to your own choice of music.  

 However, all this is not to say that the game itself isn't fun. The majority of its flaws are minor, 
 so if you can get past them, you won't mind playing. The world-circuit mode progresses as you complete 
 each group of tracks; you earn money to buy new cars and modifications, and you also get access 
 to new courses and new vehicles. Some of the more advanced cars like the Hummer have impressive 
 handling and can really scream down the tracks, so the game can get even more enjoyable as you 
 progress through it. There are also a few hidden cars that are only accessible in the arcade mode, 
 such as an ambulance and some military vehicles.  

 Unfortunately, there are also some annoying issues in the way various cars perform. Each vehicle's 
 statistics screen shows its handling, top speed, acceleration, and other characteristics. However, 
 this screen neglects to mention the weight of that particular vehicle, which can make a massive 
 difference in the way it handles. A light car is likely to careen out of control over a jump, even 
 if it has a good handling rating. Facts like these should be indicated somewhere in the game, but 
 don't ever seem to be addressed.  

 Test Drive: Off-Road 3 is a fun game that has some high points. However, most of the fun is overshadowed 
 by the game's many minor problems. Such problems won't dissuade you from playing the game if you 
 already own it but should dissuade you from owning it if you do not.

Review:  I don't know why, but this game just struck a chord that I liked.
  
  Gameplay- Decent interface that gets the job done.
  
  Graphics- OK not bad, but not outstanding 
 either.
  
  Sound- I always liked the soundtrack for this game the music just seemed to work with the game.
 
  
  When I think about this it, this game really is terrible. But no matter what I do I can't bring 
 myself to uninstall this game. I think it is the music that really makes this game work. I sometimes 
 find myself doing a certain map just to here the song that accompanies it. In short, this game 
 is good for some mindless time killing, but not much more than that.
