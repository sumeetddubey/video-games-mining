:::Review:::
EA has built the foundations of a terrific title with NHL 96. Let's hope they finish the job 
 with NHL '97. 

 While NHL 96 is probably the best PC hockey game available today, it may also be the first 
 PC sports sim to suffer from being too realistic for its own good. Anyone who knows hockey knows 
 that it is a low-scoring game; far too often in NHL '96, it is a no-scoring game. During one stretch, 
 I played three consecutive full time games that all ended in 0-0 ties. A testament to my lack of 
 shooting ability? Perhaps, but I don't think so. More skillful players may disagree, but I found 
 what little scoring there was to be fairly arbitrarya move would suddenly work 
 when it had previously failed time and time again. This unsettling sense of randomness is felt 
 throughout the game, including in the calling of penalties and the outcome of brawls.  

 But having said all that, NHL '96 is still fun to play, both on the ice and off. The graphics are 
 superb, from the on-ice reflections to the numbers on the back of the player jerseys, with graceful 
 player movement and fluid animation. (You will need a very powerful machine to see all this in 
 hi-res mode.) After a few games, you'll be able to pass with relative precision and disable your 
 opponents in any number of ways, from simple body checks to full-on fist fights. Your ability to 
 trade players and immediately jump into exhibition, regular season, or playoff mode allows you 
 to play with the team you want in the game you want, and the head-to-head option is almost fun 
 enough to make you forget what a bore the single player game can sometimes be.

 with NHL '97.

Review:  NHL is one of the best hockey games, thanks to its solid graphics machine and sense of realism. 
 However, this realistic play is sometimes more than it should. You will seldom find yourself scoring 
 more than three goals in a single game. To make matters worse, if you put a high difficulty you 
 will be trailing behind by three or four goals in no time. But otherwise the graphics of the game 
 are quite good (nevertheless, dont be surprised if the game crashes in higher resolutions) and there 
 are many good moves and numerous tricks your players can perform. Noticeable it is the user-friendly 
 interface which gets you into a game immediately, without nonsense additional options or stuff. 
 NHL 96 is the base of what the series is doing all these years, even there are minor inaccuracies 
 on ice, and you should do a small rewind.
