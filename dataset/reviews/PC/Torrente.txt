:::Review:::
Torrente's a typically rotten movie-licensed budget shooter with an exotic pedigree. 

  Released in 1998, the Spanish film  Torrente, El Brazo Tonto de la Ley  ( Torrente, The Stupid 
 Arm of the Law ) was a huge hit in its country of origin. The comedy about a homophobic, racist, 
 sexist ex-cop who, for good measure, drinks too much and abuses his crippled father, reportedly 
 grossed more money than  Titanic , at least in Spain. This exotic pedigree gives Torrente the game 
 an air of intrigue that eclipses the final product, which turns out to be a typically rotten movie-licensed 
 budget shooter.  

          Like a lot of bad games, Torrente features a bunch of inexplicable ads for itself.     
 

  Whatever charm the movie had didn't survive the translation from screen to game. Other than some 
 brief narration before each mission and a handful of repeated catchphrases (all voiced by the film's 
 director and star, Santiago Segura) , there isn't any story here, or any humor beyond the level 
 of a bad Duke Nukem clone. Apart from the fact that he's a fat guy with a comb-over, Torrente may 
 as well be any generic action hero.  

  The game begins in Madrid before moving to the seaside resort town of Marbella (the setting of 
 the original film's sequel) . Both areas are largish, clockwork environments with plenty of cars 
 and pedestrians, as in Grand Theft Auto. You have more or less free rein of the entire city during 
 each of the game's roughly 60 missions, but that's where the GTA analogy ends. The cities aren't 
 particularly complex, lacking the interesting nooks and alleys of the GTA universe. You also can't 
 drive any vehicles.  

  The game was released last year in Europe, but the graphics look more dated than that. The environments 
 are colorful, but boxy and simplistic. The textures are blurry, as if ported from a previous-generation 
 console, and the draw distance is short. Some of the character designs have an unusual elongated 
 look reminiscent of the arcade classic Rolling Thunder, but the character animations are uniformly 
 stiff and artless. Other than Torrente's 10-or-so quips and the sound of gunfire, the game is also 
 oddly silent, though the little music that does exist is actually kind of catchy. Not 20 dollars' 
 worth of catchy, though.  

  Torrente's missions feature a variety of goals. There are some escort tasks, some timed delivery 
 jobs, and a few straightforward combat assignments with an occasional requirement to collect something 
 along the way. Once in a while, the game tosses in an oddball contrivance, such as shooting manhole 
 covers in order to close them before a blindfolded hostage falls into the sewer. There are also 
 several on-rails bonus levels, which effectively deliver a sense of high-speed chaos that ends 
 up being the best part of the entire game.  

  The core gameplay is bad enough to make the mission variety irrelevant, however. Aiming, both in 
 the default third person and optional first-person views, is loose and imprecise. Enemies have 
 two behaviors -- they either run straight at you or stand in one place and shoot. The vast majority 
 of them pose little threat. The remainder, equipped with rocket and grenade launchers, will kill 
 you with one shot, often before you see them. Survival often feels like a matter of luck rather 
 than skill.  

          One of the actually decent on-rails levels.     

  Since there's no in-mission save feature, the game becomes an exercise in replaying each level 
 over and over again until you finally map out the positions of all the one-hit kill enemies. The 
 missions often take place over a large area, and Torrente moves at a realistically pokey pace for 
 a fat, middle-aged man, so expect to spend a lot of time covering the same ground. No matter how 
 well you've committed a mission to memory, though, you'll occasionally -- and seemingly arbitrarily -- get 
 rammed by a stray car and die. It's frustrating in the first mission and unbearable by the 60th. 
 In fact, it's hard to imagine anyone who isn't getting paid to do so ever finishing Torrente.  
 

  There's no multiplayer, but, well, no great loss. Given its lurid subject matter, Torrente, bad 
 as it is, might have been some kind of epic disaster or at least an interesting failure. Instead, 
 its awfulness is entirely, depressingly average. If nothing else, collectors of all things Torrente 
 can buy it, store it, and keep it in mint condition in the box, and not feel as if they've missed 
 anything.

Review:  So , i bought the game, came home and installed it, tried it.... then threw the game in the garbage... honest.
 
  Games dont get any worse than this, this is the abyss, the absolute worst.
  If you get this game for free.... its still overpriced. I feel insulted and humiliated for buying 
 this game.
  Yes it only cost $4.99 but still, overpriced. I wonder how is it possible for such garbage to actually 
 find a publisher.
  You know what? Go ahead and buy it, for a few dollars you actually get to see how the worst game 
 in the world looks like, i think its worth it.
  Miserable graphics is not so bad, graphics dont make a game, but please play it, you owe to yourself 
 the unique experience of playing a game that bad.
  The sad part is im at a loss of words, i simply cannot describe this product.
  Torrente is so 
 bad that it deserves to be remembered

Review:  Im just going to come out and say it... this game is so bad that if you so as look at it your eyes 
 will literally bleed! If you make it past the horrible fly cursor than the flat out ridiculous 
 gameplay and glitches will turn you off way to quickly. Don't buy it or rent it! It will steal 
 your precious time and maybe, just maybe your ability to play another shooter as long as you are 
 on this god given Earth! Heres a list of things to do besides play this game: 1. Go outside for 
 once. 2: Visit your lonely girl friend. 3. Play Halo 2. 4. Play anything else but this. 4. Watch grass 
 grow!
