:::Review:::
Humvee Assault is simple, short, slightly buggy, and generally not very good. 

  Humvee Assault is a straightforward third-person car combat game with one surprising feature: Whenever 
 you feel like it, you can hop out of your Humvee and run around assaulting things on foot; you 
 just won't cover ground as quickly as a vehicle. Humvee Assault is also a budget game. And as you 
 might expect from a budget-priced game, it's simple, short, slightly buggy, and generally not very 
 good.  

          This screenshot makes Humvee Assault look more exciting than it actually is.     

  
 According to the description on the game's box, you play as a soldier performing "anti-terror missions 
 in global hotspots like Iraq, Cambodia, and Afghanistan." (Your missions also include two other 
 global hotspots, steamy Colombia and snowy Bosnia, which evidently weren't "hot" enough to warrant 
 a mention on the box.) These antiterror missions -- all five of them -- involve picking one of four 
 different Humvees and then driving it all over the place looking for the level's key targets while 
 shooting at a handful of different types of enemies.  

  This isn't necessarily a recipe for disaster. Humvee Assault's levels are huge and generally wide 
 open, leaving you plenty of room to drive and shoot. The problem is that the vehicle physics are 
 neither realistic enough to provide much of a challenge nor wildly unrealistic enough to deliver 
 any thrills. In fact, there barely seems to be any vehicle physics at all. You'll never catch air, 
 flip over, powerslide into a turn, or feel any real sense of speed. Virtually every detail that 
 games traditionally use to separate driving from walking is missing. It often seems as if you're 
 simply controlling a person shaped like a Humvee.  

  The game's vehicular enemies include four-wheelers, tanks, and pickup trucks. Generally speaking, 
 they have one tactic: to drive toward you and then drive in circles around you. The game's lack 
 of interesting physics extends to interactions with other cars. Collisions have essentially no 
 effect on either vehicle. Some missions require you to hop out of the Humvee and then either retrieve 
 or destroy a target inside a building. This is where the game goes from mediocre to dismal. The 
 buildings are stocked with a bunch of on-foot opponents. Inexplicably, these soldiers have absolutely 
 no AI whatsoever. They simply stand in place while shooting at you. It's almost as though the static 
 crowds that sit in the stands in racing and sports games have finally made their starring debut 
 in their own game... as a bunch of sitting ducks. You've only got two weapons -- a machine gun and 
 grenades -- so there isn't even any variety in your choice of how to dispatch these bullet-spewing 
 statues.  

  At least Humvee Assault's graphics aren't nearly as bad as the game that takes place inside them. 
 The game's custom rendering engine does a nice job of displaying big, open spaces. The jungle levels 
 are believably dense with foliage, and one mission takes place through the streets of a hilly, 
 detailed, and convincingly decrepit Colombian town. To compensate for this one positive feature, 
 the game's animations are uniformly bad. Enemy soldiers generally stand in one place, and they 
 have absolutely no reaction to being shot other than eventually tipping over.  

  The game's sound effects aren't so much bad as they are missing. The game has adequate gunfire 
 and explosion effects, as well as engine noises, but that's about it. Other than some music (which 
 we had to turn off because it stuttered on two different systems) , the game has no ambient sounds. 
 As you'd probably expect at this point, the immobile, unanimated soldiers are also completely mute. 

          For some reason, your enemies don't actually move.     

  We experienced hard lockups three or four times during the three or four hours it took to finish 
 the game. These crashes are especially aggravating since you can save the game only after you've 
 completed a mission goal. The developer has acknowledged the lockup problem and is evidently working 
 on a patch.  

  At 20 bucks, Humvee Assault is pretty expensive considering all the things you don't get, such 
 as enemy AI. For just 10 dollars more, you could buy Bandits: Phoenix Rising, a recently released 
 and much, much better third-person car combat game. No matter what it says on the box, Humvee Assault 
 is no bargain.

Review:  im not a bad gamer. but i still cant beat this game. it is incredibally hard and unrealistic. no 
 way the military would send 1 soldier and 1 humvee to go against 100 foot soldiers 15 technicals 
 and 5 tanks. the sound is so distorted on my computer. the graphics arent good either. missions 
 are long and hard and you cant save that much. good storyline though. you cant do any tricks and 
 often the car will glitch out when you try to. more work put into this game and i could have been 
 a good game. the "videos" are accually very cool drawings that are narrarated. if this game was 
 $2 i would buy it. it is a shame really.
