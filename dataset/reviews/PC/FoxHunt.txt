:::Review:::
In this comedy spy thriller from Capcom, you can teach a guy how to be a spy, but you can't make 
 him cover his mouth when he burps or teach him to speak towomen without making sexist or insulting 
 remarks. 

 Can a television trivia slacker dude prevent a crazed Soviet agent from blowing up Los Angeles with 
 a nuclear bomb? This question might not exactly beg for an answer, but in Fox Hunt, you'll have 
 a pretty good time trying to figure it out. In this comedy spy thriller from Capcom, you can teach 
 a guy how to be a spy, but you can't make him cover his mouth when he burps or teach him to speak 
 to women without making sexist or insulting remarks.   

 Luckily, the hero, Jack Fremont, doesn't need to be suave or debonair to make this interactive movie 
 entertaining. With 10 different solutions to the mission and a cast of wacky characters that even 
 includes Elvis, Fox Hunt has enough entertainment value to make up for the fact that the lead character 
 continually grates on your nerves.  

 If you like that famous comedian who starred as a pet detective in two movies, you're in for a treat, 
 because Fremont seems designed from the very start to bear an uncanny resemblance to him in both 
 looks and manners. Fortunately, even if you're not a fan, Fox Hunt has enough action to keep your 
 mind off Fremont's often inexplicable behavior.  

 Like a serious spy movie, Fox Hunt has beautiful women, double agents, and exotic locations (Las 
 Vegas and Colorado to name two) but outdoes even Sean Connery in some of its action scenes. 
 When was the last time you saw 007 take a jet-propelled wheelchair ride through a hospital, escape 
 from crossdressing Soviets, or shoot down anvil-wielding Rob Lowe clones while freefalling from 
 20,000 feet? Now, that's action.  

 Although Fox Hunt is not particularly violent, when Fremont meets with a fatal accident, you are 
 treated to the sound of his crushing bones or the graceful arc of his body as it flies out of a 
 multi-story building.  

 The spectacular clarity of the digitized video, due in part to the fact that the original piece 
 was shot in 16mm, and the rocking soundtrack give Fox Hunt the look and feel of an actual movie. 
 Although there are a few minor technical glitches (video frames sometimes lose synch) , none detracts 
 in any way from the gameplay. Other problems are also relatively minor, but become noticeable after 
 long-term play, like illogical game progressions (no matter which window you climb out of in Fremont's 
 apartment, you wind up on the same ledge outside) , and reused frames during action sequences.  
 

 Fox Hunt has one particularly annoying attribute. For most of the game you are able to save your 
 place after you successfully complete an action run, but in the hospital sequence there's nearly 
 three minutes from one save spot to the next. So, if you have trouble maneuvering the rocket-propelled 
 wheelchair (and you will) , be prepared to memorize all the dialogue from the self-running 
 clip until you master this particular obstacle.   

 Overlooking some of the childish antics of its hero, Capcom's Fox Hunt is an interactive movie that 
 merits more than a showing or two. It's silly and amusing but surprisingly well developed and fun 
 to play.

Review:  Jack Fremont! HYYYYYYYYYYYYA! Your butt is mine. This is one of the many crazy lines in the FMV 
 computer game Fox Hunt. This game is terrific. It has a great plot, superb acting, and excellent 
 game play. The game is about a TV trivia nerd named Jack Fremont (Andrew Bowen) , who cant even 
 pay off his bed room walls. The CIA find him and ask him to go on a mission for them. His mission 
 along with his partner Chauncey (George Lazenby) , who is a Q type character, is to find a mad man 
 who goes by the name The Fox because he is trying to nuke the city of LA, because no one liked 
 the crappy shows he made in the 70s. He has discs laying around all over the world with clues 
 leading to the nuke. The clues are about TV trivia, and luckily, Jack Fremonts there to save 
 the day. The story gets convoluted though and Jacks racing all around the world trying to find 
 these disks, though men are trying to stop him including, a gay assassin called Frank and two twin 
 brothers by the names of Allen and Alan. The game is really, really good.
  
  GAMEPLAY: The game play is similar to Myst. You click around the screen in First person, trying 
 to solve puzzles. The first person stuff blends really well with the FMV and the story. You really 
 feel like Jack. I dont think the game could have gotten as intense if it were played in another 
 perspective. Also, there are moments in the game were you have to shoot and fight to get your way 
 through things. The shooting is pretty easy because you just use the mouse, but on the PlayStation 
 version its much harder because you have to use the D-Pad. The fighting is a little tough because 
 you have to Block, Punch, and Kick at certain times (just like in Supreme Warrior) or you get hit 
 and eventually die. The game play is really great as well.
  
  GRAPHICS: FMV! Ohh Yahhh
  
  SOUND: Wow! The sound in this game is superb. It has really funny dialogue, great action sounds, 
 and a perfect soundtrack with artists like Sublime and Butt-Hole surfers. You can even buy the 
 Fox Hunt soundtrack (which I own) that has all the music on it.
  
  VALUE: Well for the two bucks I paid for it at KB Toys, it was definitely worth it. Ive seen it 
 as cheap as 15 bucks on eBay, new, and its worth every penny.
  
  THE BAD: This is the part I dread in every review. This game is HARD. It took me about 5 years 
 for me to eventually complete the game. I dont know why, but I can now beat the game in a day 
 and die like once and not even need a walkthrough. Also, there is one thing that Capcom has done 
 that will scar you for life. Just kidding, but what theyve done is bad. There are some items at 
 the beginning of the game and if you dont pick them up, you will go through the whole game and 
 get to like the last part and die because you dont have that one item. Ive had to restart the 
 game on many occasions because of this. I would recommend a walkthrough the first time you play 
 the game.
  
  OVERALL: This is a fantastic game with just a few minor falls. Even if you dont like FMV games, 
 you should give it a try because its really a fun and funny game. Do your self a favor and go 
 pick up Fox Hunt for the PC or the PSX and also get the soundtrack. You wont be displeased. This 
 is my most favorite game of all time!
