If you're in training for your next Vegas excursion or if casino games are a deep dark mystery, 
 Monopoly Casino Vegas Edition does supply a solid stomping ground. 

  Like 1999's Monopoly Casino, Monopoly Casino Vegas Edition attempts to bring the allure of the 
 casino to the PC. For this year's edition, developer/publisher Infogrames has thankfully toned 
 down the seemingly nonsensical Monopoly connection, added several new variations of casino games, 
 and generally spruced up the presentation to make things look and sound less cartoonlike. Nonetheless, 
 the series remains a lackluster substitute for the real thing and therefore is recommended only 
 to the seriously addicted or those who want to learn the rules of certain games before their next 
 trip to the desert.           You choose from a variety of casino games from this screen.    

 
  It's not that this iteration of Monopoly Casino is a bad game. In fact, it effectively translates 
 the workings of virtually every popular casino game in existence -- and then some. The coin-popping 
 crowd will satiate its urges through no less than three progressive jackpot slot machines, three 
 more animated video slot machines, six standard slots, four progressive jackpot video poker machines, 
 and a half-dozen standard video poker machines. Table fanatics can head on over to the roulette 
 wheel, the black jack or craps tables, the more complex pai gow poker and sic bo stations, or any 
 one of six variations of poker. Of course, no self-respecting casino would be complete without 
 a glowing keno board or spinning money wheel, and Monopoly Casino obliges on both these counts 
 as well. The old church favorite, bingo, rounds out what is a truly impressive array of games. 
   

  Yet, Monopoly Casino goes much further than that. If you don't like the rules and regulations as 
 they're handed out, you need only move and click the mouse a few times to change them. You may 
 opt to begin with a $1,000, $5,000 or $10,000 limit. You may opt to increase or reduce table and 
 machine limits or the number of participating players, or you can modify a battery of betting options. 
 In the end, you'll find most every gameplay variant available to a real player. But in spite of 
 all this, you won't find the most important ingredient of all -- the thrills and spills of a true 
 Vegas experience.   

  To begin with, the game offers no multiplayer support and therefore lacks the excitement that comes 
 only from playing with and against real people. Apparently, the Internet multiplayer element of 
 the original game simply wasn't popular enough to warrant another go, although why Infogrames couldn't 
 build a head-to-head single-computer option remains a mystery. Furthermore, none of the virtual 
 competitors have a face or voice and are instead represented merely by Monopoly tokens. Certainly, 
 some of the dynamics that come from trouncing your poker-playing peer are lost when that peer is 
 nothing but a tiny race car or thimble. By comparison, Microsoft Casino didn't support multiplayer 
 gaming either, but at least it had the common decency to put an animated head and voice to each 
 of its virtual players.   

  What's rather more problematic is the simple fact that Monopoly Casino -- or any PC casino game, 
 for that matter -- doesn't give players the opportunity to win and lose real money. Few would argue 
 that the most obvious allure of most casino games is the potentially big payoff that lies at the 
 end and the very real hoops you have to negotiate to get there, but you won't get any of that in 
 a computerized depiction. The hard truth is that games of pure chance, such as slot machines, video 
 poker, roulette, and keno, can become horribly dull very quickly when the entry fees and rewards 
 are merely imagined. Games that require more skill, like poker, do offer more substance and therefore 
 are more interesting, particularly if you've previously been too shy or too uninformed to step 
 up to a table in real life. But even then, the very digital nature of your opponents and Infogrames' 
 generally uninspired presentation hamper any potential excitement.   

  Essentially, Monopoly Casino's ambience is far removed from that of a real casino. You're initially 
 offered a third-person image of a casino floor, which, although substantially prettier and less 
 Monopoly-obsessed than it was in the 1999 original, remains motionless and very two-dimensional. 
 From this static viewpoint, you'll select and immediately be transported to your favorite game -- and 
 you won't be able to walk the floor, take in a show, order a libation, or foolishly hit upon a 
 cocktail waitress along the way.           There are plenty of game types, but the presentation 
 is rather flat.    

  Once "seated," you'll look on at your attractively designed table or machine from a pseudo-first-person 
 perspective. At the lower left of the screen is a multifaceted little icon-based menu that allows 
 you to modify gameplay options to your liking. You'll initiate actions through a button bar that 
 appears just across the bottom of the screen and adjust and place your bets through another icon-based 
 menu at the lower right of the screen. Certainly, this system lets you do practically anything 
 you want, although its layout does seem more confusing than it needs to be.   

  The only voice you'll hear is that of the dealer or table person. Otherwise, the game's soundscape 
 is dominated by low-volume casino clatter and an assortment of marginally enjoyable jazzy musical 
 selections. The realistic sounds of shuffling cards and your own noisy slot machine do serve to 
 make things less generic, although big wins and big losses do not, unfortunately, activate any 
 special effects. Even complete and total bankruptcy means nothing -- you then merely reenter your 
 name and bankroll and start again.   

  If you're in training for your next Vegas excursion or if casino games are a deep dark mystery, 
 Monopoly Casino Vegas Edition does supply a solid stomping ground. The mechanics of each game seem 
 believable, and the game's manual supplies a good introduction to a bevy of the most popular betting 
 pastimes. But for the thrills of a true casino experience and the ecstasy and terror that comes 
 only though gambling and losing and winning real money, computerized simulations have a long way 
 to go. Tumbling dice, spinning dials, and rotating roulette wheels are far less compelling when 
 the environment is this sanitized and this safe.
