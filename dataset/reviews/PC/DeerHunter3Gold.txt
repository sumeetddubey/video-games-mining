:::Review:::
Deer Hunter 3 Gold is easily the best choice for a realistic hunting experience on the PC. 

 
 You've got to hand it to WizardWorks for improving on its successful Deer Hunter series. When it 
 published the first Deer Hunter, the blocky 2D bitmap graphics and your inability to move once 
 you picked a spot on the map made it look like a joke to veteran gamers - but hunting enthusiasts 
 gladly settled on the mediocre production values for the chance to nail a prize buck. Yet instead 
 of cranking out a similar sequel under the assumption that you can't overestimate the tastes of 
 the American public, WizardWorks and developer Sunstorm Interactive completely revamped the game 
 engine in an effort to create a more realistic experience. And while Deer Hunter II's 3D graphics 
 weren't quite what you'd call cutting edge, the difference between that first game and its sequel 
 was substantial.  

 Not long thereafter, Deer Hunter 3 added a season mode that gave you the opportunity to plant corn 
 and wheat to attract deer, photograph the big bucks you'd like to bag but can't when the season 
 is closed, set up permanent tree stands, and more. Unsurprisingly, Deer Hunter 3 jumped to the 
 top of the charts, and fans uniformly praised the game's vastly improved 3D graphics, animations, 
 and realism. These good features have carried over to Deer Hunter 3 Gold, which further improves 
 on Deer Hunter 3 by adding a new hunting area, a map editor, a new weapon, and an enjoyable new 
 multiplayer mode. Though Deer Hunter 3 Gold does give you an extra state in which to hunt (Wisconsin, 
 in addition to Missouri and Utah) , it still falls short of the dozen locations in four states offered 
 in Deer Hunter II. Fortunately, a map editor is included for creating your own hunting site - and 
 the editor actually lets you import satellite U. S. Geological Survey terrain-elevation data to 
 ensure your re-creation is authentic, down to the last gully and hill. Converting that data can 
 be tricky, and the editor isn't the easiest thing to use even if you're building an area from scratch, 
 but you can bet there'll soon be plenty of user-created maps available for download.  

 Deer Hunter 3 Gold's graphics engine is the same as Deer Hunter 3's, which is just fine considering 
 how much better the game's visuals are to any other hunting sim on the market. Even at lower resolutions, 
 the trees and bushes in the game no longer look like 2D cutouts plopped into the hunting area, 
 and at higher resolutions the graphics are eerily realistic. Look closely, and you'll see smaller 
 flora sway in the breeze. Glance around as you wait in a blind, and you'll see dragonflies, rabbits, 
 squirrels, and even fish, if you're close enough to a lake. The deer themselves are the most impressive: 
 In high resolution, the animals look so lifelike that you might find yourself hesitating to shoot. 

 Sunstorm added only one weapon to the arsenal for Deer Hunter 3 Gold - a 7mm rifle - but that's 
 probably because it had covered all the bases in the preceding game. With seven rifles, three shotguns, 
 two bows, two pistols, and a black-powder rifle, about the only source left to turn to for additional 
 hunting weapons is the world of fantasy. All the usual hunting accoutrements are available in the 
 game, including scents, decoys, blinds, a compass, a GPS system, a journal for recording info, 
 and more - along with boats, trucks, snowmobiles, and ATVs to let you get around the huge maps 
 in a hurry. You also get to create as many hunters as you like, and you can choose from three male 
 and one female character model. However, even male players might end up choosing the woman, as 
 the three guys look like poster children for the evils of inbreeding.  

 But the best addition to Deer Hunter 3 Gold is undoubtedly the new "play the deer" multiplayer feature. 
 The usual competitive and co-op modes are still available, but they don't compare with the challenge 
 of donning hooves and fur, and sneaking to within 100 meters of a hunter (who knows you have to 
 get close to score points) and dropping a little deer doo-doo before running like hell to get to 
 the safety of cover. GameSpy support makes it easy to find games, and online gameplay is fairly 
 smooth.  

 Several publishers have tried to snatch the deer-hunting-simulation crown from Sunstorm and WizardWorks. 
 That's led to some innovations in the gameplay, such as the mission-based design of EA Sports' 
 Deer Hunt Challenge. But the bottom line is that when WizardWorks says that Deer Hunter 3 Gold 
 is "as real as it gets," it's not kidding. For deer-hunting fans, Deer Hunter 3 Gold is easily 
 the best choice for a realistic hunting experience on the PC.

Review:  Deer Hunter 3 Gold is a very fun game. I used to enjoy it on my PC. Long before Cabela's hunting 
 games was this, and yet it was so much fun. You can shoot any deer you come across in well done, 
 only this series and an unknown hunting game known as Whitetail Fever remain my favorite hunting 
 games ever.
  
  In Deer Hunter 3 Gold, the environments are nice for the PC, and yet much better and more complex 
 than the environments in the first game. Deer Hunter stands out as a good hunting game among imitators 
 and companies producing other types of hunting games. The wildlife designs are cool, and you get 
 to ride vehicles and other things. It was a favorite of mine.
  
  Deer Hunter 3 Gold in short is a fun hunting experience.

Review:  This is the only hunting game ive ever owned and is really addictive. In this game you can drive 
 trucks, quads and then shoot deer. It's not a very hard game but is very fun. There's a lot of 
 deer in the area that your in. The graphics aren't that great either is the sound but is still 
 fun. You can pick your camo and rifle and then go shoot. If you buy this game you'll play it for 
 about a week and then forget about it but it's still fun. I don't know if there's a difference 
 between deer hunter 3 and the gold edition but if there is it's probably not a big one. There's 
 not too many weapons but you can get a pistol if you want. When you go shoot you can target practice 
 to adjust your scope etc. When you do kill an animal you go up to it and then it go back to the 
 lodge and shows it on the mount and describes it to you.
