:::Review:::
Earthworm Jim 3D has something to discourage all types of people from playing it. 

 If you're a fan of the first two Earthworm Jim games, you'll be excited to learn that the spacesuit-powered 
 annelid is back for a third installment. Unfortunately, the excitement will end the moment you 
 actually play the tedious game.   

  Earthworm Jim 3D attempts to rethink the side-scrolling platform action of the two earlier games. 
 Whereas the original games boasted funny and truly inspired hand-drawn artwork and animation, everything 
 in Earthworm Jim 3D is rendered using low polygon models. Both the characters and the environments 
 are stiff, simple, and lifeless, especially when compared with the exuberant cartoon quality displayed 
 in the game's precursors. To the left of your health indicator is a hand-drawn sketch of Jim that 
 changes as he takes damage; it's one of the only images in the game that captures the visual spirit 
 of the first two games, and it acts as a constant reminder of Earthworm Jim 3D's better heritage. 
   

  Earthworm Jim 3D is like every generic 3D platform game made in the last five years. The story 
 is, Jim has gone insane. You must guide him through the different areas of his own mind and help 
 him regain his sanity by collecting his lost marbles and some cow udders. The structure of the 
 game will be instantly familiar to anyone who's played Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie, Croc, or Rayman 
 2 - all much better games than Earthworm Jim 3D.   

  All of Jim's standard equipment has made the transition to 3D. He can use his body as a whip, as 
 a hook for climbing across ropes, and as a propeller for limited gliding. Jim still has his standard 
 blaster, but he can now acquire new weapons from vending machines that are scattered around the 
 levels. One of these new weapons launches a happy, gibbering gnome, which explodes on impact. It's 
 funny, and it's one of the few original ideas in the game. For the most part, the developers seemed 
 content to rehash old favorites such as Professor Monkey-For-A-Head and Bob the Goldfish without 
 creating any memorable new characters or situations.   

  Even though it's not nearly as inspired as its predecessors, Earthworm Jim 3D might have coasted 
 by on the fact that it's just another mediocre yet painless platform game. But it's virtually unplayable 
 on account of what's possibly the worst camera system ever implemented in this type of game. The 
 camera tries to stay behind Jim, but it moves much, much slower than he turns. In the heat of battle, 
 you'll spin to face an enemy, and it will take several long moments for the pokey cameraman to 
 inch his way behind you so that you can finally see what you're now facing. This behavior is totally 
 unsuited to a fast action game such as Earthworm Jim. In addition, the camera never overrides the 
 default angle to fit the situation. For instance, at one point you're crawling across a rope as 
 enemies fire at you from your right side. The camera should be pointed toward the action happening 
 on your flank. Instead, it's still pointed at your back. Since you can only face forward or backward 
 on the rope, you can't get a clear view of the important part of the scene. You can stop and manually 
 adjust the camera to face the correct way, but you're an easy target as you do so, and as soon 
 as you move again, the camera slowly returns to its original orientation, meaning you have to readjust 
 it. A lock-on feature like the one in Rayman 2 would have eased some of the frustration generated 
 by the camera system, but there's no such feature in Earthworm Jim 3D.   

  Instead, Earthworm Jim 3D has something to discourage all types of people from playing it. Fans 
 of the series will be disappointed by the lackluster translation of the characters into three dimensions. 
 Everyone else will be frustrated by the horrible camera. The game's few pleasures are not worth 
 the laborious task of unearthing them.

Review:  this game is terrible. this is the worst earthworm jim game. this game has left me wanting death. 
 the boss battles, are absolutely horrible, it takes an hour or so to accomplish each one. the camera 
 angles, were awful. ruined the gameplay, ended up going back to the same places over and over again. 
 interplay has screwed the pooch on another good liscenced game, a la clayfighter. thanks for screwing 
 things up.
  
  even plugging a controller in for this game is abysmal. it is absolutely nerve racking. i seriously 
 wanted to find a gun quick. this game is half-assed, the sounds were horrible, the level design 
 sucked. the marble collecting, sucked. the action, sucked. this game is horrible. don't ever buy 
 it for over 10 dollars.
  
  This game is hard due to camera angles and boss battles.

Review:  This game is really fun! This game deserves a way higher rating than the N64 version, especially 
 if you have a PC Controller. The controls are great, the graphics are superb, and the game play 
 is some of the best game play ever to be in an Earthworm Jim game. Yes, the camera could've been 
 better. That I can admit, but still. This game is one of the best Earthworm Jim games I have ever 
 played, and I think it's way too under appreciated. Maybe you should get a PC controller and play 
 it before you go off and judge it because of it's controls. The game itself is different in every 
 way to the N64 version. Game play and graphics aren't the only thing standing in this versions 
 way of flawlessness. The game features Jim trapped in his brain, and he must recover his marbles 
 and the golden udders to escape. On his way to do so, Jim discovers that some of his arch rivals 
 managed to get inside as well. Jim must eliminate them as well. On this crazy adventure, Jim has 
 to do some weird stuff (including pig sliding and grandma wrangling) to complete his mission. This 
 game is amazing for an Earthworm Jim game. I would definitely recommend it if you are a fan of 
 the Earthworm Jim series.

Review:  Earthworm Jim 3D is a 3D jump and run game with great wacky backgrounds, designs and a whole lot 
 more. In this game Jim is hit by a luanching cow from the moon and is quickly sent to the hospital 
 by Peter Puppy. Jim finds himself in an unusual area but he then realizes that he is trapped in 
 his brain! Jim must encounter 4 groovy sections of his brain which are Fears, Agressions, Fantasy 
 and Happiness. But its not that easy in order to set Jims back mind back to normal he must collect 
 yellow weird looking bubbles and fight bosses along the way. In some levels you must ride your 
 Pocket Rocket or go Pig Sliding and collect items on the way. The pig sliding levels are the hardest 
 because you must beat a certain time record in order to proceed. And of course there are weapons 
 like the new funny Teeth Gun, Flamer (to roast headless chickens!) and a lot more. Overall Earthworm 
 Jim 3D for the PC is a very good game similar to the Crash Bandicoot series. This version is different 
 than the N64 version. This is a must buy for die hard Earthworm Jim fans.
