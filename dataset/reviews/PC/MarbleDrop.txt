Marble Drop may succeed as an interactive screen saver, but it fails to engage attention as a game. 
 

 Ten years after the success of SimCity, Maxis has introduced its first puzzle game, Marble Drop. 
 Against the backdrop of beautifully rendered Leonardo daVinci sketches, the player attempts to 
 navigate colored marbles through a Rube Goldberg-esque series of ramps and elevators, hoping that 
 the marble's final resting place will be in the correspondingly colored bin. Not as simple as it 
 sounds. Every marble released radically alters the path of the marbles that follow. There are teleporters, 
 buzzsaws, cannons, and crossbows that shoot your marble, and ramps may vanish off the playfield 
 or lead your marble into an infinite loop. But it's not as exciting as it sounds.  

 Marble Drop may succeed as an interactive screen saver, but it fails to engage attention as a game. 
 The only manner in which one participates is by selecting which color marble to drop into one of 
 two funnels; everything else is predetermined by the course. Basically, you must scan the entire 
 labyrinth before opting for the blue marble in lieu of the red one, dropping it, and waiting to 
 see what happens. Points are awarded when marbles pass over, or through, point areas. Get enough 
 points and you can "buy" replacement marbles for the ones you have lost. Or save up for the black 
 marble - it mimics whichever color is needed to complete the level. There are fifty courses to 
 choose from, ranging from the most basic introductory levels to the absolutely confounding invisible 
 puzzle, and you are able to select the level from a user-friendly pull-down menu. Levels may also 
 be approached linearly.   

 The graphics in Marble Drop are simple, yet effective and every screen is attractive to look at. 
 Occasional sound effects like "swoosh," "bang," and "zzzzzz" are about it in the audio department. 
 Marble Drop may help your concentration, but what you'll really need is help staying awake.

Review:  I got it a book fair in my school back in the december 2001
  and I really baged my mom for this game and So she let me get the game and I got it after a couple 
 of weeks so I rushed home and installed it on my father computer
  and I had hours and hours of fun with this great game that is indeed excllent
  I'm very disapointed 
 that it failed that to be a game
  But I think it is great I can't say anything bad about it
  acually i can
  when you get to a 
 higher level it get too hard and you're only hope is to use the black marbles which are any colour 
 until level 50 (the final level which is all invisible and you can use any colour marble and get 
 more black marbles)
  but it's still a fun game and I really still love this game that is so enjoyable
  but go download 
 it and play it
  it was worth the wait for it.

Review:  Marble Drop! features a series of puzzles where you must drop certain colored marbles and try to 
 get them into the right places. There are 50 total puzzles to test your skill and mind. It's fun 
 at first but gets quite repetitive after a while. The puzzles get tiring. They also become insanely 
 difficult, requiring even a couple hours hours to solve some puzzles because they get so confusing.
 
  
  The graphics are decent - they're smooth and colorful, but the sound is not. The SFX are too plain 
 and repetitive, and there's no music whatsoever. It's not really worth it. Only the first several 
 puzzles are fun, then it just turns into a waste of time and money. I wouldn't really recommend 
 this game to anyone. There are better puzzle games out there, and this one just doesn't make the 
 grade.
  
  While it may look appealing at first, it's really not what it seems to be. Skip this and look elsewhere 
 if you're looking for a fun puzzle and strategy game.
