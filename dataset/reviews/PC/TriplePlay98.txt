:::Review:::
Triple Play 98 feels and plays great. 

 Triple Play 98 is a fully realized baseball simulation that brings the sights, sounds, and feel 
 of the major league to life on the PC. You call the shots for all the players on all the teams 
 in every stadium. From the optional free-agent draft to the world series (with an all-star game 
 in between) , Triple Play 98 keeps track of all the statistics so you can get down to action.   
 

 With Triple Play 98, you control every aspect of the game: Throw the sinker to get the double play 
 and make highlight-reel dives, leaps, and stabs to keep the ball from getting past you into the 
 gap. The pitchers bring their personal bags of tricks to the game, and every pitch they have, you 
 have, and the same holds true for the other ball players' defensive abilities and offensive wallop. 
 Read the scouting report before game day to see how Colorado's sluggers average against Atlanta's 
 dead-eye pitching staff, and then shift the outfield to the left and bring the infield in when 
 the time is right. Total control.  

 In the past, baseball simulators have sacrificed gameplay for statistics, but Triple Play 98 feels 
 and plays great. When you crack a drive down the line and see the wind hook it just foul, wellit 
 breaks your heart. But time it right on a 100mph belt-high fastball, and chuckle when you watch 
 the instant replay from any of eight camera angles. Motion is incredibly fluid on the field, both 
 while batting and fielding, and timing is everything; before jumping into full season simulation, 
 utilize the practice feature and work on those ground balls and pop flies. Take your knocks in 
 the batting cages, and when you feel one with the strike zone, grab Barry Bonds and Mark Maguire 
 and go to Coors Field for a Home Run Derby.  

 Full season play is the most rewarding (but time-consuming) schedule in Triple Play 98. As the season 
 progresses, so do all the averages, and a winning streak on a tough road trip will do wonders for 
 the team's ERA. But you can enjoy single exhibition games if you need to sneak a quick fix. You 
 can adjust the number of innings in a game, so if you only have a few minutes, play a three inning 
 contest.  

 There are many strengths in Triple Play 98, but it's the subtle touches that really make this game 
 a winner: Beer vendors in the background, banal play-by-play announcers, and scrolling trivia all 
 add to the allure of this title. Triple Play 98 is definitely a candidate for the all-star game.
