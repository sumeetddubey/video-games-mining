:::Review:::
The first class audio and visuals simply cannot mask the fact that Power F1 contains a fundamental 
 flaw. 

 Power F1 is a good example of the old saying "too little, too late." Had it been released a year 
 ago, folks would have sung its praises as a revolutionary racer with outstanding graphics, sound, 
 and multiplayer options. Who cares if the controls are a little off, they would have said. After 
 all, most every other element is superbly crafted. Unfortunately for , beat it to the shelves by 
 six months, and that game has almost all of the same features - without any of the control problems. 

 This is not to say that Power F1 does not have its good points. First, Power F1's graphics are every 
 bit as good as those found in Grand Prix II - and even move at a slightly faster frame rate on 
 slower machines. From the lush green forests that line Hockenheim to the claustrophobic streets 
 of Monaco, each F1 track is faithfully recreated in both look and layout. To compliment the outstanding 
 visuals, Power F1 features some of the best sound effects found in a racing game. From the cheering 
 of the crowd to the distinctive wailing of the engines, Power F1 manages to reproduce all of the 
 sounds associated with the world's loudest sport. In fact, the illusion that you are watching a 
 real race is uncanny, and it's further enhanced by the inclusion of multiple camera angles, a VCR-style 
 replay feature, and even the famous "TAG HEUR" timing graphics. In fact, the only element missing 
 is an obnoxious color commentator - and the world has too many of them already.  

 Sadly however, the first class audio and visuals simply cannot mask the fact that Power F1 contains 
 a fundamental flaw - namely, it lacks the proper "feel" that is so important to racing simulators. 
 Specifically, Power F1 fails to accurately simulate the car's inertia through the many twists and 
 turns that litter a Formula 1 course. The resulting lack of over- and understeer gives Power F1 
 a distinct arcade edge that seems somehow out of place in this otherwise serious simulation. While 
 this simplified control scheme may appeal to arcade fans, it will undoubtedly alienate simulation 
 wonks from the moment the light turns green.   

 In all, Eidos Interactive's Power F1 makes a valiant attempt to dethrone Grand Prix II, the reigning 
 champion of F1 racing. Power F1's high-octane graphics, sound, and extensive multiplayer options 
 certainly make it a worthy competitor. Unfortunately, a fundamental flaw in the control scheme 
 prevents it from capturing the checkered flag.  

 SPECIAL NOTE - The American version of Power F1 also includes the full retail version of at no extra 
 charge.

  I still remember this classic from when I was young. Most of you will nevereven read this review 
 but if you want to, go ahead! This game was a revolution for the F1 racing genre. It didnt include 
 any flashy graphics or sound, but the gameplay was incredible! Tons of cars to choose from and 
 some great racers. The multiplayer is pretty fun too.
  
  If you find this one in a bargain bin, get it. you will enjoy it! And dont worry about its age, 
 its a classic that should never have been forgoteen like it was. So sad....
