It's an innovative strategy game with puzzle elements that puts the task of artificial-intelligence 
 programming in your hands. 

 What gamer hasn't complained about weak artificial intelligence? In fact, it's often the skill and 
 deviousness of computer opponents that make a good game. This is not so in MindRoverThe Europa 
 Project. It's an innovative strategy game with puzzle elements that puts the task of artificial-intelligence 
 programming in your hands - so you have no one to blame but yourself when things go poorly.  

 
 Available only from developer CogniToy at the company's web site, MindRover is essentially a robot-programming 
 tool kit. You must equip and program a vehicle, or rover, to go about accomplishing a series of 
 specific tasks. The concept may sound simple, but each task is a test of logical thinking and problem-solving 
 skills. You don't actually control the rovers when they set about their duties; instead, they rely 
 solely on the programming you give them. If you can imagine those robot-building contests typically 
 run by M. I. T. and other tech schools, you'll have a good idea what MindRover is like.  

 Some tasks are simple, such as winning a race around an oval track or locating and ramming another 
 rover. Others include a full capture-the-flag game, a hockey game between hovercrafts, and even 
 a high-speed chase between a police rover and a taxi. The tasks require complex solutions that 
 may challenge even the most seasoned gaming veterans.  

 For each scenario, you first select a rover chassis appropriate for the task. Rovers can be hovercrafts, 
 tanks, or cars. As you might expect, each works best in different situations. Similarly, each requires 
 different types of equipment to operate properly. With the scenario goal in mind, you must select 
 the proper equipment to load onto your rover without going over preset weight and point limitations 
 (each type of equipment has a point value) . These components include weapons, sensors, engines, 
 and some interesting options such as police lights and speakers. Once your equipment is in place, 
 you can wire it all together using a series of script commands that make up CogniToy's ICE programming 
 language.  

 The scripting is done on an intuitive work screen, where each component is displayed as an icon. 
 By dragging one component of your rover to another, you link them with an ICE script. For example, 
 you might connect the steering mechanism to a radar so that you can direct your rover toward an 
 object that appears on the scope. You can augment your scripts with variables and timers, or you 
 can try to rough it with brute-force programming techniques. That's one of the joys of the game: 
 You are free to tackle each puzzle in any way you choose. Though the scripting is far simpler than 
 most programming languages, it can still be rather intimidating. Many of the terms are a little 
 thick, and the tutorial material runs out all too quickly. Some items, such as the LootSensor, 
 are not covered by the tutorials at all. Still, if you have ever whipped up your own level for 
 a first-person shooter or customized a game using scripts, you will have little difficulty learning 
 how to use ICE. If you ever do get stuck on something, you can always get help at the CogniToy 
 web site, primarily from other MindRover players who actively post useful ideas, suggestions, and 
 solutions.  

 The game's OpenGL-based graphics engine is solid, and it features nicely rendered settings for most 
 scenarios. There is only a handful of settings that evoke images of Europa, but otherwise the rover 
 arenas are nicely done. The rovers themselves look like oversized, well-detailed Matchbox construction 
 vehicles, and each component added to them is completely animated in the 3D view. Although the 
 graphics aren't especially impressive, aside from a few collision-detection problems, they do look 
 pretty good.  

 There are problems scattered throughout MindRover, including an intermittent crash bug that occurs 
 while exiting the game, and that the camera clips through enclosed spaces when a rover gets too 
 close to a wall. The game may also prove too limited for players who don't enjoy tweaking and replaying 
 their scenario solutions for optimum results. The 23 scenarios are not linked, so if you just want 
 to complete them all without trying different solutions for each, you may be disappointed by the 
 game's relative brevity.  

 Finally, the game could have really benefited from a better tutorial mode. While the printed manual 
 is very thorough, a more complete audio-visual walkthrough of the game's basic elements would have 
 gone a long way toward making MindRover more appealing to a wider audience.  

 MindRover is an unusual game. It's interesting and addictive enough to deserve the notice of any 
 adventurous gamer, though it will appeal most of all to those who enjoy programming and logic puzzles.

Review:  Mind Rover is the best game I ever played.
  
  It required a little wisdom to play. Though it's very difficult to learn how to create, wire, run 
 a robot, but if you can, you will find endless enjoyment in this game.
  
  It's graphics is not good, and the sound isn't authentic, but it does't matter. If you can create 
 a robot which can defeat everyone, you won't to care how bad the graphics or the sound is.
  
  At last, if you are looking for a worthful game, you cannot miss Mind Rover!

 about some mistaken grammar, because I'm an Asian.)
