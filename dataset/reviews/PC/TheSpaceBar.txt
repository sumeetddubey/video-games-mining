If the higher production values and lower IQs of recent adventure titles have got you down, then 
 belly up to the Space Bar. 

 Hard-core adventurers take note: If the higher production values and lower IQs of recent adventure 
 titles have got you down, then belly up to the Space Bar, my friends, 'cause this game's for you. 
 While not as compelling or imaginative a journey as it could have been, Space Bar makes up for 
 it by recalling an earlier age of computer games with intricate, sophisticated gameplay that doesn't 
 take itself too seriously.   

 Veteran designer Steve Meretzky gives us a soft-boiled detective story set within a decidedly multiracial 
 alien bar. You are Alias Node, a gumshoe for a large alien corporation and the lone human on the 
 aptly named planet of Armpit VI. One night on a patrol with your partner, Maksh, a fellow investigator 
 slumps dying over your car hood, shot by a corporate spy who ducks into a notorious watering hole 
 and gambling joint called the Thirsty Tentacle. The murderous thief, you soon learn, is a shapeshifter 
 and capable of imitating the appearance of any alien form. Worse still, the killer has abducted 
 Maksh and throws taunts over your PDA's two-way radio. You will have to question almost 40 alien 
 characters, scour the bar's many entertainment rooms for items and clues, and decide whom to arrest. 
 All of this must be done before the allotted game world time has expired and the killer escapes 
 from a nearby spaceport.  

 The primary action all takes place within the bar itself, where you walk via point to point movement 
 (with animated transitions) through the numerous rooms, including the bathrooms, each with toilets 
 designed for the needs of various alien races. A 360-degree rotating view (a la Zork Nemesis) at 
 each stop point lends the game a greater sense of realism than the Myst-style slideshow. Alias' 
 pop-up PDA has numerous necessary tools, and an onscreen click calls up context-sensitive menus 
 for interacting with objects and people: take, examine, stash, greet, or "ask about" options that 
 can lead into numerous dialogue trees. Veteran adventurers will appreciate the breadth of options 
 here, which is so much wider than more contemporary autopilot interfaces. There are so many odd 
 characters to meet, so many leads, data, and objects to investigate, yet Space Bar refuses to offer 
 that familiar crutch of even the better contemporary adventures: an obvious next step to take. 
 It is wholly nonlinear, and there is very little time - which advances with each mouse click, a 
 device that creates a nice artificial sense of tension and punishes mere sightseeing.   

 Space Bar is "good old-fashioned gaming" only to a point, however: The central feature is innovative 
 and unique. Alias has the talent for mind-melding with some of the aliens in the bar, which takes 
 you on eight mini-quests, each within the memories and perspective of an alien body. In one vignette, 
 you are a rooted tree who must figure out how to bloom, while all you can do is swivel in place. 
 As a smart-talking blob in a jar, you have to manipulate your mentally challenged sidekick into 
 transporting both of you to a certain destination. The look and feel of the game's first-person 
 point of view changes accordingly; you will encounter the world from the segmented vision of an 
 insect in one vignette, or from a jar on the ground in another. While at times this feels like 
 a gimmick, it encourages you to immerse yourself in these worlds, and even think in the alien ways 
 that ultimately solve the puzzles.   

 Much to Meretzky's credit, the puzzles, while challenging, never suffer that contrived, stark feel 
 of most adventure obstacles. Sure, you will need to fix a town clock in one alien world by figuring 
 out which crystals go where and in what order. And you will need to transport an alien egg through 
 the right series of rooms, waterways, and tracks without breaking it. But these conundrums are 
 knit believably into the situations. While not actually played in real time, this design gives 
 you a sense of working within a living storyline with which you need to keep pace, a bit like the 
 recent Last Express.   

 But make no mistake, Space Bar seems designed mainly for experienced gamers. The solutions are intricate 
 and difficult. Most are reasonable (in hindsight, of course) , but they require a good deal of trial 
 and error that some gamers may find laborious. And you can make a lot of wrong moves, which either 
 get you bumped back to the beginning of an alien flashback episode or bumped off altogether. Meretzky 
 and Co. have provided numerous blind alleys as well, so you could be on the wrong path for a while 
 before something tips you off.   

 So much is just right about the gameplay and design of The Space Bar that the limitations, alas, 
 are all the more glaring and make the game altogether less entertaining than it could be. The SVGA 
 graphics are sharp and the animations serviceable, but the graphic design is generally uninspired 
 and bland. Ron Cobb of Star Wars cantina fame did the art direction, but don't expect that film's 
 rich atmosphere here. The writing is flat as well. There are no intriguing twists to the plot - 
 just a shallow whodunit plot that empties into a mildly clever final solution for your detective-hero. 
 Likewise, the character art and dialogue are sterile and underdone. Gluing a stock character type 
 on a cockroach or a fruit-bearing plant, pretty much the method here, is not exactly a creative 
 stretch. Meretzky has a reputation among some gamers for comic designs, but most of the dialogue 
 comes off more silly and strained than genuinely funny, the sort of geek humor that grows tedious 
 quickly. Figures like a dim-witted, obese lizard who is struggling to board a bus or a June Cleaver 
 plant-mom who waxes sentimental over her daughter's imminent "blooming" seem pitched to an arrested 
 adolescent.   

 While it is a disappointment that Rocket Science and Boffo Games fail to exploit that alien cantina 
 premise a bit more, the triumphant aspect of The Space Bar is that it is a true gamer's game. It 
 recalls the depth and general feel of the best text-based adventures of old. You are compelled 
 onward not so much by storyline and character as by a desire to crack a master designer's code, 
 to see how weird and devious the next obstacle will be.
