:::Review:::
The game, while earth-shatteringly simple, does require more than a little strategy and ends up 
 offering quite a challenge. 

 Remember Combat for the Atari 2600? Now think about it for a few seconds. There you have it. That's 
 all there is to Mass Destruction. You drive a tank. You blow up everything in sight. You get new 
 weapons. You run over screaming infantrymen. OK, so maybe it's a little more complex than Combat, 
 but not much. That's OK, though. The gameplay more than compensates for its simplicity. There's 
 only one problem: The troubled release of Mass Destruction has brought new meaning to the phrase, 
 "a long time coming." Originally slated for release in early 1996 by BMG Interactive, the game 
 has gone through some tweaks and adjustments to finally hit the stores just in time for Christmas 
 1997, this time released by ASC Games. The unfortunate result? Well, a lot has happened recently 
 and this old mare just doesn't have what it takes anymore - technically speaking.  

 For one thing, the game runs in DOS mode. Sure, you don't have to deal with that pesky DirectX or 
 try to configure your joystick within Windows 95, but it also makes for some relatively outdated 
 graphics. The 3D scrolling effects are well done, but otherwise, the choppy, pixelated sprites 
 of good old standard VGA just don't cut it anymore. To top it off, there is no support for 3D accelerator 
 cards - an inexcusable oversight for a game like this. This looks like a game that could have been 
 released in 1995 (perhaps because it really should have been) .  

 The sound is even more dated. The musical soundtrack in its entirety consists of maybe five or six 
 mediocre synth-pop tunes, and the sound effects are laughable at best. Explosions sound more like 
 a hyperactive popcorn machine, and you would swear they recorded a cat being dipped in boiling 
 water to simulate the anguished screams of a dying man.  

 That said, let me say this: The gameplay is great! Sure, it's repetitive, but what do you want from 
 a game called Mass Destruction? Each of its 24 levels, whether set in arctic tundra, the deserts 
 of the Middle East, a rural area, or an urban metropolis, has distinct tactical objectives. The 
 goal, however, always ends up being the demolition of every last man, building, and tree. Accomplishing 
 this may even open up secrets in the game. Of course, time is ticking away, so you must settle 
 on a comfortable balance between speed and devastation.  

 Speaking of balance, three different tanks are at your disposal, ranging from a quick, lightly armored 
 model to a slow, heavily armored one. Ammo is also plentiful. With the standard, inexhaustible 
 cannon and chain gun and pickup items like hi-ex (high explosive) shells, mortars, flamethrowers, 
 and guided missiles, you'll find so many delightful ways to annihilate your enemy. Each is as vital 
 as the next, as only certain weapons can destroy certain targets. The game, while earth-shatteringly 
 simple, does require more than a little strategy and ends up offering quite a challenge, especially 
 on the hard difficulty level. Maybe that's why this game just wouldn't die. The gameplay is too 
 good. The graphics are passable, and the sound is terrible, but the gameplay saves the mix and 
 makes Mass Destruction a worthy, if somewhat dated, addition to the pack.

Review:  YEAH! The name says it all. Destruction is the sole thing you do in every mission and you get to 
 do so in plenty. You ride a tank and destroy evarything that comes in your way enemy tanks, soldiers, 
 buildings, turrets and so on. Mass Destruction was developed by NMS Softwares and released by ASC 
 Games in 1997. The game was to be released by BMG interactive in 1996 but with several improvements (dunno 
 whatever they did) it was released in 1997 by ASC. There is nothing that makes it seem like a game 
 released in 1997 with the poor outdated 3D graphics and average sound quality it surely belongs 
 to the genre of 1995 games.
  
  The gameplay is exciting. You will have different aims in missions like destroying enemy targets, 
 rescuing an enemy agent, interrupting a convoy but all these ends up in the same-mass destruction 
 of the enemy till the last one standing . You get to play in different locations from deserts to 
 rural and urban areas. Basically you have 3 tanks to select -a fast, less armoured to a slow but 
 well armoured one. You have an infinite ammo cannon, and a chain gun at your disposal with lot 
 of weapons scattered all over the place like guided missiles, flamethrowers, high explosive shells 
 giving you different enjoyable ways for annihilation of the enemy. Each has different purposes 
 too as all may not be useful against the same target. With the hell broken loose, you have to rampage 
 through the enemies area and complete your missions. The gameplay is challenging as time plays 
 a huge role in some missions like interrupting convoys and the lot of enemies you have to deal 
 with in attaining the objectives .
  
  The controls are very simple and easy. The graphics is outdated and incongruous with no support 
 for 3D acceleration cards. The game runs well in Windows but to have a satisfactory feel it is 
 better to run it in DOSBOX. The sounds are more better than the graphics but that is the only main 
 accomplishment it has. The screams of the soldiers, and the sound of firing cannons all are only 
 of just average quality. Well the positive part of the game is mainly the good range of weapons 
 and locations. The exciting and challenging gameplay is a plus too.
  
  The negative points mainly the outdated graphics and average sound quality. Also the gameplay is 
 repetitive.
  
  The gameplay is certainly exciting and challenging but the negative side of the game casts a huge 
 shadow over it with the outdated 3D graphics, poor sounds and repetitiveness.
