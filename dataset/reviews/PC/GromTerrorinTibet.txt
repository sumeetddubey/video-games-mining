Grom has a number of frustrating elements, and it doesn't offer much of anything to make up for 
 them. 

  Grom is billed as an action role-playing game, but it's hardly either. Its only similarity to action 
 games is the fact that you have to repeatedly click on the enemy to attack, and its only connection 
 to role-playing games is its use of dialogue trees. In reality, Grom is more of a real-time strategy 
 game, albeit one with frustrating controls and terrible artificial intelligence.           You 
 can't leave an area until every enemy is dead.    

  Those who have studied the history of the world according to computer games already know that the 
 Nazis invested a great deal of time and manpower combing the globe for doomsday devices from the 
 ancient world. To these erudite game players, the plot of Grom will seem like one-upmanship. Or, 
 more precisely, "eleven-upmanship." According to Grom's story, there are not one, but  12  of these 
 Armageddon artifacts located in Tibet, which seems like little more than overzealous contingency 
 planning.   

  You control the thick-mustached Colonel Grom and his various cohorts as they try to put a stop 
 to the Nazi plan. Or rather, you try to control him in spite of the game's relentlessly frustrating 
 mechanics. The basic premise of Grom's gameplay -- which resembles the gameplay featured in the action 
 RPG Diablo, but with guns -- isn't a bad one, but you know a game is in trouble when you find yourself 
 forced to repeatedly play through your battles.   

  Most of the trouble seems to arise from the fact that the game's interface is totally inadequate. 
 For instance, you can pause and issue orders to your units, but you can only issue movement orders 
 or change their weapons, even though it'd be most useful if you could issue attack orders while 
 paused. In another example, you use the left mouse button to issue an attack order, but you also 
 use that button to move, which means that your units are often running around when you want them 
 to be firing. Enemies have the annoying habit of running around willy-nilly once they're hurt, 
 so when you try to click on them to target them you instead end up running in their footsteps all 
 over the map. This wouldn't have been a problem if your selected units did anything on their own. 
 Units that you have not selected have default behaviors and will attack or defend on their own, 
 but the instant you select a unit, it won't budge without your say-so. This may not sound like 
 much of a problem, but you'll probably find it ridiculous that selecting a moving unit causes him 
 to stop dead in his tracks or simply stand still while the enemy merrily pummels him into oblivion. 
   

  Luckily, it's pretty difficult to actually die in Grom. More often than not, when a member of your 
 team gets low on health, he simply falls unconscious, waking up after a short amount of time passes. 
 When your entire team falls unconscious, enemy units will just wander away, apparently satisfied 
 with the idea that the men they were just trying to kill are quietly napping. Not that they could 
 finish you off even if they wanted to, because in Grom, unconsciousness is the same as invulnerability. 
 A grenade can go off next to an unconscious unit and he won't even get a bruise.   

  Your units will fall unconscious fairly often, because the game's combat is difficult. Not only 
 must you struggle against the game's interface, but you are also usually outnumbered and outgunned. 
 And because there are no real tactics or strategy involved, the combat isn't very satisfying. You 
 can't use environmental objects to your advantage, so those gas tanks in the Nazi camps will just 
 sit there undisturbed throughout a heavy firefight. And while Grom has all the appearances of a 
 tactical game, including the ability to lie prone and crouch, you mostly just run around and exchange 
 fire with the enemy until one of you is dead.   

  One of the game's more frustrating elements is the fact that you cannot leave a map until the enemy 
 is eliminated. An early mission requires you to sneak into a Nazi camp and steal some documents, 
 but while you can sneak around to your heart's content, you can't actually leave the camp until 
 you've killed everyone. This is also frustrating when you enter a map, only to find yourself outnumbered 
 and without a means of escape. What's worse, you can't actually have your party stop and rest as 
 you would in a traditional role-playing game, so your units recover from damage only through the 
 use of healing items, which are costly and somewhat rare.           Stealth isn't an option, either. 
    

  Other than combat, the game consists of lengthy dialogue sequences that are poorly translated and 
 therefore largely nonsensical. Frequently, you'll be presented with a two-option response tree 
 where it's impossible to tell what the responses mean, let alone make a guess at what effect they'll 
 have. There is also a bargaining game that's entirely optional and equally frustrating. Your characters 
 have bargaining cards that represent reactions to the other participant's cards. You must choose 
 your cards, which represent attitudes like "angry" or "insulted," and then enter the bargaining 
 round, where you play cards in response to your opponent. It's a guessing game, because you don't 
 know what cards he'll play and, even if you did, it's unclear how each card affects the others. 
 Usually, it's best just to take the default price for whatever it is you're bargaining for and 
 move on.   

  Grom has a number of frustrating elements, and it doesn't offer much of anything to make up for 
 them. In the end, the game's problematic interface makes it too complicated to be mindless fun, 
 and the combat itself is too mindless to have any strategic depth.

Review:  I am going to have to agree with the gamespot review in so many respects. The controls could be 
 better. I find myself frustrated at times because of the difficulty, it definetely should have 
 been easier. Sometimes I have to redo something not because of the difficulty of the level but 
 b\c of the sometimes frustrating controls. The camera can be annoying as hell when your team is 
 seperated too. BUT... None of that changes the fact that the fun factor is through the roof. Although 
 I am annoyed at a lot of stuff I always find myself returning to it because of how fun it is. My 
 suggestion is play the demo and see if you can look past the annoyances to get to the game's fun 
 factor. I absoluetly love the game.
