While this game is certainly no Shogo or even Descent II, Gunmetal does have some good points and 
 a boatload of potential. 

 There are some games that you just know are bad as soon as you run them for the first time. When 
 I first ran Gunmetal from Mad Genius Software, I thought I had uncovered just such a title. A few 
 days (and two patches) later, however, my initial distaste for this first-person shooter mellowed 
 quite a bit. While this game is certainly no Shogo or even Descent II, Gunmetal does have some 
 good points and a boatload of potential.  

 Gunmetal is set in the 23rd century, a fairly typical futuristic setting where megacorporations 
 control everything. You begin the game as a new recruit in the service of the Nataka Corporation's 
 Imperial Armored Cavalry. In order to protect Nataka interests on a multitude of planets, you must 
 pilot a series of custom-built hover tanks - or RPVs - via remote control. You begin with a line 
 of credit and the ability to piece together a basic but formidable RPV. After some basic training, 
 your first mission - a routine patrol of a peaceful world - erupts into a nasty firefight as forces 
 of Nataka rival Argus Industrial launch an all-out assault on the planet.  

 The rest of the game unfolds around the ongoing campaign between Argus and Nataka, as the war rages 
 from planet to planet. As you make your way through the 26 missions, you'll uncover more information 
 about the Argus attacks and the reasons behind them. You earn money towards additional equipment 
 and better RPV chassis by accomplishing missions and recovering salvage from enemy units you destroy. 

 Gameplay is reminiscent of the Descent series, with the notable exceptions being that your tank 
 does not move up and down (at least, not of its own accord) , and most of the action takes place 
 outdoors. The enemy units in the game are heavily reminiscent of Descent, as are the tactics they 
 employ to make your life miserable. The AI in Gunmetal is impressive - enemy tanks, drones, and 
 gun droids will bob and weave all over the place, making it quite difficult to get a bead on them, 
 and quite necessary to keep moving. One of the cooler features in the game is the fact that computer-controlled 
 units will duke it out whether or not you're in the area. The only downside to this is that the 
 enemy units will all focus their attacks on you when and if you finally do hit the scene.  

 For the most part, the level design in Gunmetal is very good. The locations are varied, they include 
 plenty of neutral units and impressive scenery, and most of the maps are just the right size. Also, 
 on several of the maps, you'll run across some billboards and other scenery that's pretty amusing. 
 One of the game's biggest weaknesses, however, is the fact that too much rides on the ridiculous 
 placing of important items. These are typically your red, blue, or other-colored keys, and they 
 are often in the most bizarre, hard-to-reach spots on the map. Now, it's all fine and good to make 
 these items difficult to retrieve, but to put them in locations that simply don't make any sense 
 just doesn't... well... make any sense. For example, on one of the early levels, you must obtain 
 a blue key in order to refuel a blimp and send it on its way. In true Doom fashion, the Gunmetal 
 designers placed this item in the most difficult and unlikely of places - deep in a sewer system 
 behind some large crushing doors that serve no other legitimate purpose but to destroy your interloping 
 RPV. The key to strong level design is to maintain a sense of reality, as far as the context of 
 the game is concerned. As far as key puzzle items are concerned, Mad Genius seems to have tossed 
 this idea out the window.  

 The game has a few other flaws, with the graphics engine chief among them. While Gunmetal looks 
 pretty good in 3Dfx mode at 800x600, the interface graphics and even the HUD instrumentation during 
 gameplay are straight out of an old DOS VGA title. Graphics do not a great game make, but nowadays 
 there just doesn't seem to be much excuse for pixilated, low-res images in a first-person shooter. 
 The radar screen is particularly annoying, as blips leave trails on the screen when you rotate 
 your RPV - the resulting mess makes the radar more confusing than helpful.  

 Gunmetal's multiplayer support is also dubious. Though the game offers LAN support via IPX, it does 
 not include IP support of any kind (at least, not as of the 1.31 patch) . A split-screen mode enables 
 two players to battle on the same PC, but this well-intentioned idea fails miserably in practice 
 (particularly if both players prefer to use the mouse) .  

 One of the most annoying things about Gunmetal is that the mouse settings reset themselves every 
 time I loaded the game. This wouldn't have been such a big deal except for the fact that the default 
 mouse sensitivity settings were so low as to make the game unplayable.  

 As I mentioned in the opening, however, Gunmetal has some good in it, and it does have the potential 
 to improve substantially if its most glaring weaknesses are addressed. I don't look for a patch 
 to solve the level design and graphics problems, but if Mad Genius follows up this game with a 
 sequel, Gunmetal may be an action game franchise worth following.
