 At first glance, Need for Speed may seem like your typical arcade racer, but the moment you mash 
 down on the accelerator you'll notice something different: these cars drive like the real thing. 
 Not only are the basic attributes (top speed, acceleration, etc.) modeled realistically, but EA 
 has actually managed to reproduce each car's personality. For example, the Porsche 911 is tail 
 happy, the Viper is grossly over-powered, and the NSX is almost boring in its predictability. To 
 complete the fantasy, Electronic Arts has even reproduced each car's dashboard and engine noise. 
   

 While the physics may be worthy of serious simulation, the emphasis in Need for Speed is on pure 
 arcade-style fun. EA has wisely kept the interface and gameplay as simple as possible, allowing 
 gamers to simply hit start and drive from the moment they open the box. Be warned, 
 though: the computer opponents are quite capable, and it takes plenty of practice to win on a regular 
 basis. Even so, if the computerized opponents don't give you enough of a challenge, you can always 
 race a friend via modem.  

 The racing itself comes in two distinct forms: the traditional, closed circuit speedway, and a no-holds-barred 
 illegal road race! While the five speedway tracks are fairly run-of-the-mill (with the notable 
 exception of the Lost Vegas track) , the three rally courses are exceptional. Featuring 
 plenty of oncoming traffic and air time, these rally tracks tend to produce crashes 
 that will make you cringe. If you aren't careful, you may even find yourself getting arrested! 

 My only major gripe in Need for Speed is with its graphics engine, and then only in VGA mode. While 
 the SVGA visuals are stunning, they become blocky and cluttered in anything less than 640x480 
 so cluttered, in fact, that distant cars and other obstacles get lost in the background, making 
 it hard to avoid them. A P90 or faster is recommended to run this game in 640x480, so 486 owners 
 may want to think twice about this one.  

 With its marvelous attention to detail, exotic course design, and straightforward gameplay, this 
 game is a true winner. Simply put, The Need for Speed is the next best thing to owning a $200,000 
 sports car!

Review:  the physics, the engine sounds, the beautiful scenics (with correct palette, great work artists!) , 
 the winding narrow tracks, the traffic mode, the rhythm of music, the car showcase, the interface...... 
 every thing is nearly perfect. it is a piece of art.
  if it can produce sound on new PC (no DOS sound anymore) , i would play it forever. i wish it would 
 be transplanted into Windows system - i know i am dreaming.
  NFS: Porsche is the only one that comes close. the other NFSs are just arcades.
  i encountered 
 TNFS when i was around 15, then i fell in love with it and sim racing. now i am 28 and i still 
 love it.
  now EA is going the other way, what a pity. PIONEER forever!

Review:  8 cars, few tracks is all you need to have fun in racing a game. First time I played NFS was on 
 3DO system and later on I moved on to PC version (which was not much different) . I could not believe 
 how fun the game was. At the time it was released there was no simulators on the market. Skid marks, 
 real physics, collisions, cops, traffic, it was all new to gaming. Some would say that 8 cars is 
 nothing for racing game, at the time of 300+ of GT series. Believe me, it was more than enough, 
 considering each one had distinct personality. 911 was fast and agile, Viper was American muscle 
 car with crazy acceleration, Diablo and 512TR were examples of European ingenuity. You could not 
 mix up cars, not only you had inside view of each car , but also showcase with real video showing 
 off the car, history of the model and all the technical data. These days NFS series dont even 
 mention driver train of the cars. Anyway, attention to details pays off. Also, point to point racing 
 with real traffic is fun. You have your cops and mini-vans and sunset. . . Each track yet again 
 had distinct personality that suited particular car, be it max speed or handling. Starting with 
 the 2nd entry, NFS series started to get lost and with the introduction of NSF III: The Hot Pursuit 
 EA completely changed the series. So if you want to see how it all began, try out the original 
 and dont mind the dated graphics and slightly simplified physics engine, it was revolutionary 
 at the time it was introduced (around 1994) .

Review:  Need For Speed stands out as the biggest arcade-style racing game title of all times. All of this 
 started with the first PC version of the game released in 1995. When it was released, it drew the 
 instant attention of gamers of that time because of the use of really vivid colour in DOS mode. 
 It was so artistic that even by today's standard, you would admit that it is still colourful.
 
  The typical arcade-racing games are based on two things -- diverse and scenic race tracks and cool 
 wheels. NFS did both this job with highest sincerity. During that time you could not find a game 
 with so beautiful race tracks. With cool cars around, the racing opponents were designed to give 
 you such a hard time that you would get back to the game again and again till you win each track 
 by a second or two. I played this game first as a demo in early 1996 (back then a 5mb demo seemed 
 a really big file) and the full game in 1997. So I can't exactly recall the number of tracks or 
 the available cars. But my feelings for this game lingers on. This proves the success of this game. 
 Plus I have loyally picked all of the NFS /Underground games and eagerly wait for a new installment 
 each year.

Review:  The Need For Speed Its The First Of The Legendary Racing Games Of Electronic Arts. You Can Choose 
 By Many Exotic Cars Such Porsche, Lamborghini, Ferrari etc.. The Graphics its a little bit old for 
 the new gamers eye but if we past that fact we realize that this game its a masterpiece!
  The Fact That makes this Game A Truly Classic Its Definitely The Gameplay!
  The Movement, the 
 Animation, The Control of the cars, The angle of the camera plus the viewing of the dashboards make's 
 the difference! And According The Date Of The Release makes the point!
  Its Very Sad That We See That The Simulation Identity of "The Need For Speed"
  Overcomed by the 
 arcade experience For The Next sequels till the latest releases "need for Speed underground 2" 
 And "Most Wanted"... Electronic Arts Could Simply Make A New Racing Series and Focus at That Point 
 (the arcade) .. But She Prefer To Destroy The Simulation Character For Save Some 
  Extra Cash... Shame On You Ms EA!!
  
  The Need For Speed Its One Of The Greatest Racing Simulation 
 Of Our Time
  thats for sure!!! If Anyone Wanna Find Out The True Magic Of A True Race Sim 
  Just Try To Find It..... Its A Bit Hard to Do though... But Sure You Can Download The Demo Here 
 In gamespot!!! Enjoy!!!!!

Review:  Ok, Ill admit it- Need For Speed spawned the wannabe race-car driver in me. At the time, I had 
 a crummy, slow Pentium and couldnt play a whole lot of games. At 30 bucks the game wasnt exactly 
 a bargain, but what it did with my slow hardware was wonders. I actually enjoyed it so much I bit 
 the bullet and bought a ThrustMaster Driving Wheel and pedals for the game (which I still own for 
 some reason) .
  
  NFS had it all: Ease of use with cars that had physics but not overblown, super-realistic ones. 
 The AI was deceptively easy after a while but they didnt employ any cheats while racing. No phantom 
 speed bursts, no weird traffic issues. It was simple, great and ate up a good deal of my nights 
 when I was a kid.
  
  The music was pretty darn good with a nameless grunge sounding band providing backing music for 
 the game. I still like to rock out to it today although I wish it had some more options. This game 
 later had a re-release known as NFS: Special Edition which had a few more track and some cars. 
 I thought it was worth it at the time and enjoyed that version as well.
  
  Since its inception I have bought and played every single NFS game released on the PC or Xbox. 
 Crazy, huh? Start here where it all began. Youll need the DOS4GW program available on the Net 
 to get the ball rolling (unfortunately youll have to cobble some geek commands together) , but 
 other than that I think it is worth a look-see.
