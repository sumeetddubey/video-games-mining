:::Review:::
Primal Prey is a budget version of another budget-priced game, and it's exactly as undistinguished 
 as that makes it sound. 

  In an effort to find new, inventive ways to lower the bar of acceptable quality for an entire industry, 
 budget publisher ValuSoft has now started producing substandard retreads of games that were value-priced 
 budget titles to begin with. The anomalously excellent Serious Sam aside, budget products have 
 always been feature-poor, ugly, and simple when compared with their full-priced competition. But 
 at least they were less expensive. Primal Prey is a dinosaur-hunting game clearly inspired by Wizardworks' 
 Carnivores series. In the budget tradition, it's not as good as Carnivores. But in what amounts 
 to a transgression of the one sacred law of budget publishing, it's also no cheaper.           
 The object is to gun down various dinosaurs.    

  Following the structure put in place by Carnivores, Primal Prey sets you on a series of dinosaur-hunting 
 missions whose successful completion earns you money with which you can buy better weapons and 
 equipment. The 10 weapons are split between guns that stun, guns that kill, and guns that do a 
 little of both. There's also a shrink ray that will slowly reduce any dino to about the size and 
 ferocity of an airplane pillow. It turns Primal Prey into a kind of Dig Dug in reverse, and it's 
 the game's one original idea. In fact, earning enough money to afford the shrink ray is the main 
 incentive to keep playing for more than 10 minutes.   

  Nine prey species are included, from the standard raptor and T-rex to less typical dinosaurs such 
 as the flying quetzalcoatlus and the lambeosaurus. Each species is most susceptible to a particular 
 weapon. For instance, a shotgun blast will simply enrage a utahraptor, while a hit from the tranquilizer 
 pistol will send it running. The artificial intelligence of the dinosaurs results in some strange 
 behavior, however. It's not uncommon to see a styracosaurus -- a land-based herbivore -- submerged 
 and calmly walking along the bottom of a pond.   

  Each species has a unique call, set of footprints, and movement pattern, all of which should add 
 to the "tracking" part of hunting. Unfortunately, the game's maps are all pretty small; it takes 
 less than a minute and a half to walk from one side to another. While you could theoretically use 
 some environmental tactics to track your prey, the size of the maps makes it generally easier just 
 to wander around in a circle.   

  Worse yet, the word "maps" is being used euphemistically to mean "map." Primal Prey's 24 missions 
 all take place on  one  map. The time of day changes, but everything else remains the same. To 
 put things in perspective, Ice Age, the latest installment of the Carnivores series, includes five 
 different environments. If this trend continues, it won't be long until ValuSoft releases a game 
 with zero maps.           The inclusion of a shrink-ray weapon doesn't save Primal Prey.    

  Primal Prey doesn't live up to the graphical standard set by Carnivores, either. It uses what 
 might be the foggiest graphics engine ever attempted. A blanket of fog sits roughly 20 feet in 
 front of you at all times. Depending on when a mission takes place, the fog is purple, yellow, 
 or blue. At night, it's black. Sometimes, the fog actually gives the game a unique visual presence -- primary 
 colored backgrounds onto which the solid outline of foreground objects is superimposed. It's a 
 striking look, but better suited to Polish poster art than games about hunting dinosaurs.   

  The inability to see very far in front of you renders some of the equipment, like the sniper 
 scope, largely pointless. For instance, the night vision goggles don't actually let you see any 
 farther into the black soup -- they simply take everything in your tiny sphere of vision and make 
 it slightly greener.   

  Primal Prey doesn't look as good as the last iteration of Carnivores, nor does it feature as many 
 dinosaurs. It does have a shrink ray, but Carnivores: Ice Age included bigfoot as a hidden monster -- so 
 you can call that one a tie. At any rate, Primal Prey is a budget version of another budget-priced 
 game, and it's exactly as undistinguished as that makes it sound.

Review:  Basically this whole game is just about shooting dinosaurs and putting them in ur trophy room or 
 giving them to people who need them for certain reasons like research and food and thing like that. 
 The makers claim that the AI of the dinosaurs is great but really i find it very simple, the big 
 dinos try to rip u apart and the small ones run away, also the dinosaurs walk over quicksand without 
 sinking and underwater without drowning. Graphic are not that great, the sound of the dinosaurs 
 is the same all the time for each spiecies and it starts to get annoying. Weaponry includes tranquilizing 
 pistol and rifle, sniper rifle, electric gun, sonic blaster, rail gun and my favourite the shrink 
 ray. Dinos include t-rex, lambeosaurus (duck-bill) , quetcoatalatlus or something like that (terradactil) , 
 Utahraptor, troodon, gastonia, triceratops, styrachosaurus and iguanadon.
