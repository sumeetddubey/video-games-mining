:::Review:::
Silent Thunder is a wicked, clean, no-B. S. combat sim with enough options and realism to hold the 
 serious gamer's interest. It's puzzling that Sierra is known by so many for its cute quest/fantasy 
 titles filled with loads of swords, sorcery, and love stories. Well, put all of that completely 
 out of your head -- Silent Thunder is a wicked, clean, no-B. S. combat sim with enough options and 
 realism to hold the serious gamer's interest, minus all the mind-killing, rudder-twiddling minutiae 
 which is the bane of so many otherwise fine combat simulations. (Silent Thunder also has one of 
 the shortest, meanest cinematic intros you are likely to see in a Sierra title.) Employing Dynamix' 
 Terrain and 3DSpace technologies, Silent Thunder sports astoundingly smooth, photo-realistic, texture-mapped 
 terrain and structures which are among the finest I've seen outside of location-based flight sims. 
 The challenging continuity of campaign games can be found here as well, and the redbook audio soundtrack 
 is well worth the extra install space required. The brutish, lethal A-10 has captured the attention 
 of the computer war-gaming public in recent years, and if you're part of that public, Silent Thunder 
 is the game you want to check out.

Review:  A-10 Tank killer is one of my first bc games I purchased ever. At the time I was not a PC gamer 
 and did not have a good PC but it ran it just fine. I got this game mainly because I love A-10 
 Aircraft and this game was just the one to get. After all the years I think this is the best A-10 
 game out for the PC or overall. The game was visually stunning and the gameplay was very fun. I 
 was impressed overall I loved the views the action and the missions. The game is easy to setup 
 and install. Reminds me how PC games ware sweet when you just install and play. Well this game 
 was my entry to Pc gaming and it was a great one.
  
  The score I gave is based on the game of it's time not present.

Review:  firstly silent thunder is OLD! so dont expect anything too fancy by modern standards. but considering 
 its age it still stands out to me as the best flight game around. Silent thunder puts you as the 
 role of a pilot named "JACK" in the first gulf war. and your missions vary from blowing convoys 
 to wasting entire bunkers. the versitility of the A10 you pilot helps to keep the missions varied. 
 in game the mission you fly will change with your actions. if you attack a convoy without destroying 
 the air base near by then you will find yourself fighting off MIGS and ground launched missiles 
 pretty quickly. and vise versa. if you destroy a strategic target then a convoy might try to escape 
 before you can destroy them. things like this throughout the game keep it varied and intresting. 
 Aircraft wise the A10 can be customised payload of Maveric missiles, cluster bombs, sidewinders 
 or you could just play with the GIANT chain gun at the front. all the weapons are real as the power 
 of them and their problems and benafits. this helps to create an immersive gameplay. controls wise 
 you would want to play this with a joystick and keyboard. its a lot more fun and its more responsive. 
 overall the fun and thrills of silent thunder overcomes its age and is a game that should be looked 
 out for anywhere!
