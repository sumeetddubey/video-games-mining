:::Review:::
This compilation has an incredible number of games for a budget price, but the translations of some 
 of the better games unfortunately have some quirks. 

  Packed with 80 old games from the Atari canon and available at a budget price, Atari: 80 Classic 
 Games in One is a great way to relive some of the high points of classic gaming. However, poorly 
 implemented customization options and sometimes less-than-perfect emulation tarnish what would 
 otherwise be an incredible trip down memory lane.  

          Houston, we have a problem.     

  Of the 80 games available in the package, 62 were 
 previously released on the Atari 2600. Among many, many others, you'll find classics like Combat, 
 Missile Command, Asteroids, Adventure, and Yar's Revenge. Nearly every genre of the day is well 
 represented -- there are plenty of action, sports, driving, and puzzle games to choose from here, 
 as well as several games that seem thrown in just for the sake of rounding the collection off at 
 80 games total: Basic Programming and Fun With Numbers, to name a couple of such cases. In all, 
 though, the selection of Atari-produced games is fairly comprehensive, with the more familiar games 
 being the clear standouts. In addition, the emulation of these games is spot-on, with all of the 
 trademark lo-fi sounds, simple graphics, and flicker that gave these games their distinct feel. 
 Thanks to the accurate representation of the original hardware, the gameplay that so many gamers 
 grew up with is perfectly intact as well.  

  While the large number of Atari 2600 games is a great feature of this package, the real draws are 
 the 18 arcade classics that make up the remainder of the 80 games available. Featuring Pong, Super 
 Breakout, Centipede, Millipede, Crystal Castles, Warlords, Missile Command, and a host of vector-graphics 
 games such as Tempest, Battlezone, Major Havoc, Red Baron, and others, these games are arguably 
 the ones most worthy of your playing time. Unfortunately, these games are also the most unevenly 
 re-created, with spotty and unfaithful sounds and -- worst of all -- twitchy controls, regardless of 
 what input method you select. For the most part, the traditional raster-display games, such as 
 Centipede, are the most accurate representations of their original incarnations, and they feature 
 accurate graphics and sounds that are very close to those of the originals.  

  The vector games, on the other hand, seem to have the most trouble staying true to their arcade 
 originals. Since these games originally used special monitors that produced graphics with rays 
 of light rather than pixels, the versions of these games in Atari: 80 Classic Games in One are 
 more of a simulation than anything else. While Tempest, Battlezone, and Red Baron resemble what 
 you might see in an arcade, Gravitar produces graphics so small that they are nearly impossible 
 to see, regardless of what resolution you select. Across the board, the vector games also have 
 the most inaccurate sound, at times sounding nothing like the real thing. If you grew up playing 
 these games in arcades, you'll be pretty disappointed by these re-creations.  

          Budding programmers can cut their teeth on Basic Programming for the Atari 2600.     

 
  As previously mentioned, the controls for all of these games are very twitchy and overly sensitive. 
 This holds true if you're using a joypad, a mouse, or a keyboard. While the sensitivity can be 
 adjusted, even on the lowest setting, something still doesn't feel quite right. To compound this 
 problem, each and every game has its own individual settings, forcing you to adjust the controls 
 to your liking for every game you choose. Why some sort of universal control configuration wasn't 
 included is a mystery, and this ultimately detracts from this compilation.  

  Atari: 80 Classic Games in One does feature an incredible number of games for a budget price. Too 
 bad about the various inaccuracies and quirks found in the translations of many of the better games. 
 As such, this is a decent product, overall, but if you're looking to relive your gaming days of 
 old and demand nothing less than perfection, you'd be better off finding another way to get a classic-gaming 
 fix.

Review:  This was a dream come true for me. I played the Atari 2600 games on ColecoVision's expansion module 
 and quickly fell in love with Haunted House and Adventure, many consider to be one of Atari's first 
 adventure/RPG games. My brother and I loved playing Outlaw with its two player Western style gameplay, 
 and even with the blocky graphics and limited sound, they were (and still are) genuinely fun. Atari 
 has released several arcade compilations, focusing on their arcade versions, the last being their 
 Anniversary Edition. Although this release's box is not very visually appealing, it has much more 
 arcade classics, but all of the Atari 2600 original games. I can not only play perfect replicas 
 of Atari's arcade games, but I can also play my favorite 2600 games anytime I want on my PC. Digital 
 Eclipse again utilize their talents in this compilation, and does a fine job rendering the games 
 perfectly. Included are 18 arcade originals, and 67 Atari 2600 games; the package says '80' but 
 there are 5 games not mentioned but included in the PC collection ( (Blackjack, Desert Falcon, Off 
 the Wall, Sprintmaster and Steeplechase) which are also included in the Atari Anthology version 
 for PS2 and Xbox.
  
  I relished the chance of being able to play the faithfully reproduced arcade games which have existed 
 in previous Atari arcade compilations, like Missile Command, Centipede, Tempest, Battlezone and 
 Asteroids. New games for this collection, like Black Widow, Crystal Castles and Millipede are a 
 joy to play, even though some of the arcade originals are line vector graphics and not very detailed. 
 The gameplay alone make them enjoyable enough that the graphics aren't a big issue. I love Battlezone; 
 blowing up things is extremely satisfying, with great sound effects, and I fell in love with Crystal 
 Castles. Documentation includes interviews, box art, cartridge pics, manuals and photo galleries. 
 Nice touches!
  
  The only thing that would have made this compilation more enjoyable was if they had been able to 
 include the Atari licensed games, like Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the other arcade games that, 
 although weren't too great, but nice enough to be missed, like Berzerk (but NOT Pac Man!) Fun to 
 navigate menus, clever documentation and perfect emulation, make this one of the best arcade classic 
 compilations for the arcade lover's collection.

Review:  Get ready to step back into the gaming past, Atari: 80 Classic Games in One brings you back to 
 the good ole days of simple gaming.
  
  The graphics are exaclty the same as on the Atari 2600 model, which is the way it should be. None 
 of the games have been modified, updated, or tampered with in any way which makes it more enjoyable.
 
  
  The only downside to this game is the fact that there were other, more popular games they could 
 have put on this CD. Some of the games I had never heard of, while old favorites were left off 
 the list. However, my favorite "Adventure", was the entire reason for purchasing this game. It 
 seemed that some of the games were just thown on there to increase the number of games on it. A 
 lot of the indepth games were left off as well, and that was a disappointment.
  
  The game controls are different, but easy to get used to. It's no longer the single joystick and 
 single button anymore.
  
  Anyways, if you're an old school gamer looking for that moment of flashback this game is worth 
 the money.
