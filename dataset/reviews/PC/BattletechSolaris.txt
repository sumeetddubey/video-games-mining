:::Review:::
The game is a real blast. 

 Let's cut to the chase: This game rocks, and it rocks hard. It's got more than enough firepower 
 to satisfy the run-and-gun crowd, but at the same time it has tactical and strategic aspects that 
 appeal to sim fans, too.  

 One of the great features of Solaris (Solaris is the planet where battles take place) is that it's 
 lean and mean: Log on to a Solaris provider and choose a handle, and you can be in the thick of 
 combat a few minutes later. Just decide on whether you want to practice or fight sanctioned matches 
 (which determine your ranking) , then head to the appropriate arena, pick out a mech, and get ready 
 for some major league destruction.  

 Another great quality of Solaris is that you can play it on different levels, depending on your 
 personality. Some players really groove on the role-playing aspect of being a futuristic MechWarrior 
 - you'll see many players with Clan designations by their names, for instance, and some of these 
 guys take all aspects of the game pretty seriously. Others, more than happy with the white-knuckled 
 thrill of combat itself, don't even try to immerse themselves in the game world. Either way, the 
 game is a real blast.  

 The real beauty of MultiPlayer BattleTech: Solaris is that, like most great games, it's simple to 
 learn but difficult to master. Learning basic navigation and weapons controls takes all of about 
 five minutes, but if you think you'll be racking up kills with just that knowledge, you'd better 
 think again. Each of the 80-plus mechs available has distinct strengths and weaknesses: Choose 
 a mech that's speedy and can jump, for instance, and you'll have to settle for less armor and firepower. 

 Complicating matters is the issue of heat management. Everything you do - walking, firing, jumping 
 - causes the heat levels in your mech to rise, and if the heat becomes too great your mech will 
 shut down, leaving you defenseless and powerless (usually at the worst possible moment) . Knowing 
 which weapons to fire at particular ranges - and how often you can fire them without causing a 
 shutdown - keeps Solaris from degenerating into a trigger-finger workout.  

 Though practice matches against computer-controlled drones are always available, they don't provide 
 the pure adrenaline rush of competing against human opponents. The thrill of blasting an arm off 
 a drone mech may be satisfying, but doing it against a fellow MechWarrior is downright exhilarating 
 - it's the sort of adrenaline rush that will have you coming back time and again for more action. 
 Add in some crunchy sound effects and an atmospheric soundtrack that changes to reflect the action 
 onscreen, and you'll almost feel as if you really are inside one of these behemoths.  

 It's addictive, for sure, which brings up Solaris' single weak point: pricing. Depending on where 
 you play, prices can range from around $1.25 per hour to as much as $2.75 per hour. These prices 
 are offset somewhat by the fact that the game software is available via download free of charge 
 - you can almost write off the first 20 or 30 hours of online time against what you would have 
 spent for a retail game. And while most folks can deal with a buck and a quarter for gaming action 
 this intense, things can start getting expensive at $2.75 per hour, especially since there's no 
 option to practice offline.   

 But enough meandering. Download MPBT: Solaris and pick out a service to play it on. At worst, you'll 
 be out some download time and four or five bucks to try the game - and that's a pretty small price 
 to pay for a game that will probably get its hooks into you before your first battle is over.

Review:  Set on the planet Solaris, This game provides great mechanised combat action. One thing I especially 
 like about the game is that you have to be very careful. While one can take the option of just 
 running in and launching a full Blitzkreig style attack, For every action you perforem, your Mech 
 heats up a little bit, therefore if you sustain action for a prolonged period of time, your Mech 
 will shut down due to overheating. 
  
  This game has a practice mode, in which you may battle single opponents, or you can play full arena 
 matches, which contribute towards a rank either agianst AI or on; ine. 
  
  While its single player feature is great, it is even more fun to play online against human opponents, 
 with their own tactics and strategies. Once you play this, it will leave you wanting more Mech 
 action, maybe even more so then the Mech Warrior series. 
  
  Without a doubt, This is one of the most interesting Mech games out there and its very hard to 
 fand anythiong bad to say about it, which is why I gave it an 8-9 out of 10.
