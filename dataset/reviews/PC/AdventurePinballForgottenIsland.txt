While it has its faults, it is for the most part successful in adding first-person shooter flash 
 to a traditional kind of game. 

  Adventure Pinball: Forgotten Island takes a familiar style of game -- pinball -- and pushes it beyond 
 its ordinary limitations by incorporating colorful 3D graphics and innovative level design. The 
 game uses the powerful Unreal engine, which was originally developed for use in first-person shooters, 
 and the engine's roots shine through in Adventure Pinball's fast-paced action. The game's levels 
 make good use of the freedom provided by the engine, and they include a number of creative gameplay 
 elements. While the game at times relies too heavily on its frantic pace, and its graphics aren't 
 very interesting, it does provide a fun new perspective on the traditional pinball game.   

  The game includes both a story mode and a single-table mode. The story mode lets you progress 
 through the nine main levels featured in the game, while the single-table mode lets between one 
 and four players compete for the highest score on any one of the tables that have been unlocked 
 in the story mode. Each level has an objective that will unlock the next level in the story. These 
 objectives often require the player to progress through a specific series of areas in the level, 
 and occasionally they require a somewhat discouraging and difficult sequence of events in order 
 to access the next level. While the game does include three difficulty settings, these settings 
 only adjust the initial number of balls you have -- the logic being, if you have more chances to 
 accomplish a goal, the game is easier. This may work well for players that are familiar with pinball 
 games or other kinds of fast-paced games, but it could prove frustrating for novice players even 
 on the easiest setting.           Though sometimes convoluted, the game's level design is creative 
    

  The level design in the game is creative and often surprising. Most of the main levels include 
 a number of hidden areas and other secrets, and they are often made up of several "tables" between 
 which the ball can travel in a number of ways, including railways, blowholes, and even pterodactyls. 
 Sometimes the level sequences can be somewhat convoluted, but they are enjoyable on the whole. 
   

  The most noticeable feature of the game is the fast camera movement. The game's third-person view 
 is usually fixed in one direction (facing the table from behind the flippers) but keeps the ball 
 in the center of the screen by scrolling around to follow the ball. This movement gives a great 
 sense of action, but at times can be annoying, particularly when the ball hits a power-up that 
 accelerates its movement and the movement of the camera along with it.   

  The graphics in the game do a good job of distinguishing between the different levels and areas, 
 but they lack the crispness and smoothness you might expect from a high-end 3D game engine. Even 
 on a fairly powerful machine, the game seems to run faster than its legs can take it, especially 
 when the game deviates from the standard physics you'd expect from a pinball machine. At times 
 this sensation is intentional, such as when the ball hits certain power-ups, but at other times 
 it is just the result of the game's pacing and camera movement. Pinball purists may be disappointed 
 by the game's reinterpretation of conventional pinball mechanics and physics. But those who come 
 to terms with some of the game's quirks will find that the graphics and camera movement become 
 fairly minor issues.           The game features secrets and hidden areas    

  The sound effects and music do a nice job of setting the mood for a lighthearted and fast-paced 
 game. Most of the traditional pinball game elements, such as flippers and bumpers, have an appropriate 
 corresponding sound, while some of the more exotic elements like the tyrannosaurus rex let out 
 short arcadelike sound effects.   

  The secrets and hidden areas in each level are a worthwhile incentive. While sometimes these hidden 
 areas only give the opportunity to rack up more points and gain power-ups, at other times they 
 play a part in the objectives for the level. The game also supports add-on levels -- such as the 
 bonus level posted on the official Adventure Pinball  Web site --which add new challenges after 
 the novelty of the original nine levels has worn off.   

  While Adventure Pinball has its faults, it is for the most part successful in adding first-person 
 shooter flash to a traditional kind of game. Its fun level design and gameplay elements make up 
 for its occasional graphical shortcomings and its departures from Newtonian physics. The game includes 
 a good variety of levels that should keep most pinball fans entertained for hours, and its lighthearted 
 storyline and nonviolent nature make the game suitable both for children and adults.

Review:  Estaba buscando un juego Pinball para PC en GameSpot y andaba mirando la calificacin que tena 
 cada uno. Haba unos de
  8.0 otros de 7.5... en fin, me dicid por Adventure Pinball Forgotten Island, no por su calificacin 
 (6.6 Fair) sino
  por una gran razn, estaba construido bajo mi motor grafico favorito; el UNREAL ENGINE. Aunque 
 el juego es del 2001 no
  me import.
  
  Ahora si pasamos a calificarlo:
  
  1. Graficos: Como todo entra por los ojos, amalizamos primero sus graficos. Teniendo en cuenta 
 que es un juego del
  ao 2001, se puede decir que goza de unos graficos excelentes y que cumplen a la perfeccin su 
 cometido.
  
  2. Efectos: Los efectos estan maravillosamente logrados, las animaciones de los difentes elementos 
 que componen cada
  tablero, estan muy bien adaptados, hablamos de los dinosaurios, las hojas, OOGA, los efectos de 
 agua y fuego, etc.
  
  3. Sonido: En cuanto a el sonido puedo decir que los efectos sonoros son precisos en los lugares 
 apropiados. La
  ausencia de msica no es mayor problema ya que varios de los escenarios cuentan con su "parte musical", 
 por lo
  tanto no es mayor problema. Cabe resaltar el trabajo del Announcer del juego (caracteristica del 
 UNREAL ENGINE) .
  
  4. Jugabilidad: La jugabilidad es muy buena, aunque al comienzo la sent un poco extrao pero es 
 solo falta de costumbre.
  
  5. Comparacin: No haba jugado una versin anterior de este maravilloso titulo (de hecho creo 
 que es la primera) , pero
  puedo comparar con el nico Pinball de PC que haba jugado; Space Cadet de Win XP. Por lo tanto 
 mi visto bueno se va
  para el lado de Adventure Pinball Forgotten Island, por su diversidad y creatividad de escenarios, 
 tambien por las
  horas de diversion y reto que brindan al videojugador. Adems otra caracteristica del UNREAL ENGINE, 
 es la adicin
  del infaltable EDITOR para que crees tus propios escenarios en 3D.
  
  MAKOTO MIURA.
