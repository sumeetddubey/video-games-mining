:::Review:::
Randomly generated campaign missions, realistic settings that have you swearing at your crew, and 
 sounds that place you IN a submarine are the great strengths that set Silent Hunter apart from 
 its competition. 

 The Silent Service. The phrase conjures up several images: sleek submarines slipping beneath the 
 waves; torpedoes knifing through the water at unsuspecting targets; men silently praying that the 
 next depth charge doesn't find them. SSI manages to capture all of these elements in Silent Hunter, 
 their new World War II submarine simulator.  

 One item that immediately stands out is the variety of options available to the player. Do you want 
 to play a campaign or single mission? Do you want dud torpedoes enabled or disabled? Do you want 
 your crew to be green, veteran, or elite? Silent Hunter gives you a Realism Panel to select the 
 options that fit your abilities or desires. You can make things as simple or difficult as you like. 

 Once you've selected a mission, the game places you in the control roomthe nerve center 
 of the submarine. From here, you can use the mouse to jump from station to station. SSI cleverly 
 lets you access common controls (navigation, torpedoes) from several different stations to prevent 
 unnecessary navigation; when you do need to check out another station, you can use keyboard shortcuts 
 to jump around the ship quickly. I recommend sticking to easy missions when starting out so you 
 can get comfortable with the control interface.  

 A trip to the bridge or a look through the periscope, reveals some of the finest graphics I've ever 
 seen in a submarine simulator. The sun rises and sets, the moon goes through phases, and cloud 
 cover reduces visibility. Coastal cities even show distinct buildings, lights, and docks. Enemy 
 ships are rendered in great detail, but do pixellate even in a close-up view. Sinking ships burn 
 and smoke realistically.  

 Although Silent Hunter's graphics are excellent, its sound is even better. Sonar pings from enemy 
 ships vary based upon distance and depth. Depth charges can rattle your teeth. You can even tell 
 if a ship is close by listening to his propeller sounds. In addition, your crew offers digitized 
 responseswhich are always appropriate and professionalto many of your commands.  

 
 Silent Hunter offers great depth of play. Randomly generated campaign missions, realistic settings 
 that have you swearing at your crew, and sounds that place you IN a submarine are the great strengths 
 that set this product apart from its competition. While the enemy AI will make you scratch your 
 head in puzzlement at times, it offers an acceptable challenge for a wide variety of skill levels. 
 In the end, Silent Hunter is one part game, two parts simulator ... but entertaining through and 
 through.

Review:  I played this game in 1998 and loved it. I am a huge fan of naval sims especially submarine. I 
 played a game similar to this for nintendo in 1988/89 called silent service. Silent Hunter is simply 
 a huge improvement of silent service and both are great fun for their time. The sound and graphics 
 on this game are among the best of any naval sim of the 90s. You really get a feel for a sub sim 
 with the very solid and versatile campaign that lets you do a full sub commander career, giving 
 you plenty of options to do your own thing. You can decide where you patrol and the game is not 
 hard to play but is still very challenging.
  
  I highly recommend this game for anyone who collects classic games.
