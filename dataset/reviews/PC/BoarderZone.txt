:::Review:::
Boarder Zone has many good qualities, but you'll find yourself going through all the game has to 
 offer too quickly. 

 Boarder Zone is fun and entertaining, but only as a diversion. The single-player game lacks too 
 many of the options and features you expect to see in a snowboarding game. Boarder Zone has many 
 good qualities, but you'll find yourself going through all the game has to offer too quickly. It's 
 more enjoyable as an arcade game to play with your friends, since the single-player mode is too 
 dull otherwise. Boarder Zone's best features are its detailed graphics and its fluid 3D engine. 
 When you go down a slope, your board leaves an imprint in the snow according to the powder level. 
 When you turn, the board sprays snow as it cuts into the slope. When you fall, your hands and body 
 leave print trails. There is also a nice replay option, and the chase camera always finds the best 
 angles at which to follow your maneuvers. The lighting is realistic and provides atmosphere and 
 a good sense of movement.  

 With the exception of handplants, Boarder Zone lets you perform all widely known snowboarding maneuvers. 
 Boarder Zone has no tutorial, but the game uses such a simple interface that performing advanced 
 tricks like the 720 rotation, the roast beef, the melanchollie, or the stalefish is easy. You also 
 get to choose from four brand-name boards, each designed to accommodate different types of snowboarding. 
   

 Boarder Zone features four types of competitions: race, time, big air, and pipe. Once you've made 
 your selection, you choose from four types of weather and three types of courses: village, alpine, 
 or forest. You can also choose to compete in a championship or exhibition, but unfortunately you're 
 limited to the same courses in each. Nevertheless, the slopes are well designed and have many jumps 
 and great scenery. Not only can you speed past the rocks, trees, and canyons that you'd expect, 
 but you can also go through villages on ice-covered streets, weave between lampposts, and jump 
 over parked cars and construction equipment. In addition, you can go off-course and take shortcuts 
 by jumping over gorges or large rock formations.  

 However, Boarder Zone fails to offer enough of these enjoyable courses. Because a typical run takes 
 only a couple of minutes, you'll play through all of them quickly. Jumping over trailers and fences 
 is fun, but the game fails to take this feature to the next level. For example, Boarder Zone could 
 have had an all-out freestyle track in the style of the X-Games, complete with tables, ramps, garbage 
 cans, and rails. It also missed the opportunity to include Olympic or famous resort tracks, such 
 as those in Nagano or Vail.  

 Boarder Zone's music and sound effects are similarly well done but underdeveloped. The punk slasher 
 music is appropriate, but there are only three short songs. Boarder Zone also lacks crowd noises 
 and audience movement; not having cheers or applause dampens the excitement. Furthermore, the game's 
 commentator isn't talkative, observant, or dynamic enough to create much excitement. He won't identify 
 the trick you are going for, where you make your mistake, what it will cost you in terms of points, 
 or what trick you must do next to stay in the competition. He only identifies your maneuvers and 
 expresses disappointment when you fail.  

 Instead of professional snowboarders, Boarder Zone offers six predesigned characters to choose from, 
 and more fan-made skins and boards are available through the Boarder Zone web site. These extras 
 are a nice addition, but Boarder Zone fails to follow through on this feature, since the actual 
 personalities aren't manifested in the game. Characters don't interact with each other during or 
 after competitions, nor do they ever shout taunts or catchphrases when they win or successfully 
 execute a difficult trick.  

 Boarder Zone fails to hold much value. Though it may seem exciting at first, its lack of courses, 
 sound effects, commentary, and personalities wear that excitement thin after just a few hours. 
 Boarder Zone shows promise, but if you plan to buy it, you'd do well to wait a few weeks until 
 the price has come down.

Review:  Boarder Zone (known as Supreme Snowboarding in some parts) is a very competant snowboarding game 
 packed with some nice touches. It's a shame though that the game never reaches above the level 
 of medioricaty, and does nothing to give SSX fans reason for sleepless nights.
  
  Having said that, the game at hand is a good one, and does the underlying job very well. There's 
 three different environments on offer (with varying levels of difficulty) , a host of well-designed 
 characters, and several game modes on offer. While the gameplay never goes beyond Race, Big Air, 
 or Half Pipe, each of the events are relitavely fun to play.
  
  The graphics for their time are really good - in so much as they aren't really bad, which is just 
 as good. Each of the characters is nicely detailed, and the tracks are well desgined with some 
 really nice lighting mechanics thrown in for good measure.
  
  The game gives a good sense of speed for the race and time attack sections, and in this regard 
 the game works really well. The Big Air and Half Pipe are also fun, but are made harder by the 
 confusing trick system, which makes you "charge" a jump and match that with a button push and a 
 direction. It's far too easy to get it wrong, and one wonders why they couldn't at least look to 
 Tony Hawk for a hint on how to do a good trick system.
  
  The soundtrack is a mixed bag - some tracks are ultra-boring thrash sets or mind-numbing techno 
 tracks, but others are really good, like "Fast Song" and "I'm on TV", a pair of songs by an unnamed 
 (presumably European) band. It's a shame that nowhere in the manual or game is the band in question 
 is named. 
  
  It's worth noting that the title song also very good, but it's got a rude name and I might get 
 banned if I told you what it is. Even so, you may find yourself guiltily singing along to it if 
 you play long enough.
  
  Boarder Zone's main problems are two fold. Firstly, the game isn't all that stable. It will crash 
 without a second's warning and not explain why, and some tracks may even be missing from the disc, 
 which doesn't actually make sense, and indicated a certain level of laziness on the developer's 
 part. 
  
  Secondly, The game's overall lack of depth and simplicity will eventually get to you. The game 
 is nowhere near as flexible or forgiving than the SSX series, and the overcomplicated trick system 
 may convince you something else is worth playing.
  
  Is Boarder Zone worth getting? This is a difficult question, but not completely unanswerable. If 
 it's cut-price snowboarding you seek, your search is over. If you're looking for an alterative 
 to SSX, keep looking. This is not the snowboarding game you are looking for.
  
  By all means pick it up, just not for more than a ten-spot.
