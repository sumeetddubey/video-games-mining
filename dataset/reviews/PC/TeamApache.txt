It falls into a nether region between Comanche and Longbow for realism and playability, but offers 
 some unique elements that have not been seen before in a sim. 

 Team Apache is a different kind of sim. It falls into a nether region between Comanche and Longbow 
 for realism and playability, but offers some unique elements that have not been seen before in 
 a sim. The trade-off is downplaying realism of systems and flight modeling in order to focus on 
 realism of command and the battlefield situation. The result is a whoppingly entertaining game. 

 Team Apache was, along with Flying Nightmares 2, one of the titles jettisoned by Eidos after producer 
 and former Apache pilot Bryan Walker left for Jane's. SSI/Mindscape snapped up Team Apache and 
 saw its UK-based developer, SIMIS, through the final stretch. Knowing they were not going to be 
 able to compete with the rigorous modeling of Longbow 2, they decided to pitch it as an upper-mid-level 
 sim in terms of realism - a game that was more readily playable than Longbow, yet more accurate 
 than Comanche, but with its own twists. Those twists, and the sharp graphics engine, are what make 
 the game.  

 Visually, Team Apache is a real treat in almost every area. The hardware-accelerated graphics provide 
 some of the most fluid frame rates and interesting textures in any recent sim. Software acceleration 
 is not quite as effective, and the visuals are choppy and uninteresting without their hardware-essential 
 chrome. Compared with Longbow 2, there are some pluses and minuses. The cockpit and object modeling 
 in Longbow 2 is more detailed, but the textures, buildings, trees (yes, trees!) , and other terrain 
 elements are more interesting in Team Apache. Plus, even on a midrange system (like a P200) Team 
 Apache simply runs better.  

 The cockpits, however, are Team Apache's real weak point. The clear cockpit is the most effective, 
 yet it lacks sensor overlays. The rendered cockpit allows the widest range of view and clearest 
 image of the instruments, yet offers limited visibility. The floating cockpit is very difficult 
 to use, but allows the most fluid range of viewing motion. The problem with this virtual cockpit 
 is that instruments are not sharply defined, making them hard to use. Reflections on the canopy 
 provide a nice effect but also make that detailed terrain look drab and blurry. The final flaw 
 is the lack of a padlock view.  

 Despite claims to the contrary, realism of flight and systems modeling is not Team Apache's strong 
 suit. The cockpit and sensor modes are greatly simplified, and while this will come as a treat 
 to those who puzzled over Longbow 2, it will turn the hard-core crowd right off. Since instruments 
 are not clearly rendered, they would be hard to use if you needed to use them. As it turns out, 
 you usually don't. You can't turn lasers, jammers, or radar on or off, rendering EMCON a moot point. 
 You just select targets, and your gunner does the rest. As for the flight models, they are decent, 
 but not the most accurate. Hovering is too easy, and stupid moves aren't met with the appropriate 
 flaming wreck. You won't spend as much time finessing cyclic/rotor/collective controls, but this 
 will be considered a plus for non-hard-core simmers.  

 The real strength of Team Apache comes in its excellent sense of command. It is as much a team simulation 
 as an aircraft simulation. You are required to build and manage pilot/WSO teams, matching personalities 
 and skills to create a well-honed force. These men grow and change. Sometimes you need to "have 
 a talk" with them to boost morale, and the game even makes you choose between a "hardass" and "soft 
 touch" approach to talking to a man. You also manage maintenance and the maintenance teams, making 
 sure the right supplies are in stock and the Apaches are kept in working order. To keep things 
 running smoothly, people need sleep and an occasional "ice-cream run" to boost morale. Hard statistical 
 ratings for each man in various skill areas are missing, leaving management decisions up to a proper 
 read of their dossiers. A few more numbers would have made this element of the game easier to deal 
 with.  

 Missions come in many varieties, and Team Apache does not go wanting for gameplay. There is a custom 
 mission builder, single missions, a tutorial, and a campaign. The campaign is, disappointingly, 
 scripted, but the missions themselves are innovative and always interesting. They take place in 
 either Latvia or Colombia, and their structure and execution lie at the heart of Team Apache's 
 enjoyability. You need to approach each more as a commander than a pilot, building careful team 
 approaches and ordering your men around. The workload is such that the simplified avionics are 
 essential, making that element of the sim more forgivable. There is a wide array of interesting 
 and challenging missions, and this very real sense of command takes Team Apache into new territory. 
   

 Team Apache is a sim where the focus has shifted from the mechanics of flight to the mechanics of 
 fighting an air war. For people looking for something more realistic than Comanche and less daunting 
 than Longbow 2, but with a unique spin of its own, it is a worthy and worthwhile addition to the 
 simulation genre.

Review:  You either like helicopter flight sims, or you don't. This one is in the middle ground between 
 Commanche and Longbow realism (and so difficulty) wise. Flying itself is reasonably involved, but 
 extensive if time consuming training is provided and overall you get the hang of it eventually. 
 Weapons are easy to use, though since target selection is largely down to your AI co-pilot, who 
 ain't too bright on occasions, it can be frustrating. There are two separate campaigns each with 
 extensive back stories, the second vastly more difficult than the first. Set in Columbia, the first 
 is good fun as only smashing guerillas armed with pop guns from a state of the art chopper can 
 be. The second is set against the Russians and starts in the middle of an assault, from which you 
 must escape (losing vital choppers in the process usually) . You then fly for literally 15 minutes 
 with no action till you get to a new base, then in each subsequent mission you repeat this trip 
 to and from the combat zone, which is incredibly teadious. Throughout the course of the campaigns 
 you manage your team of 16 pilots and gunners, ensuring they are happy and not overworked, fun 
 to start with but whether or not your disipline options work appears to be random and keeping them 
 happy is impossible, not matter how many 'Ice-cream runs' you make.
  This game is good for the first half and missions are entertaining, but by the middle of the Russian 
 campaign I ceased to care, primarily because of the long in and out trips and the constant whining 
 of my pilots.
  Damage is modelled well, and systems can be damaged or destroyed, which you must repair back at 
 base, which works on a time based system. That's good, but it's a minor part of the game. Graphics 
 too are distinctly average by todays standards, though amazing in their day. Overall, the first 
 half is a good game, but it wears thin all too fast for my liking.
