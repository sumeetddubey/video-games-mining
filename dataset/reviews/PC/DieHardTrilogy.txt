:::Review:::
Like the movies, it will provide you with hours of edge-of-your-seat entertainment. 

 There's no doubt about it: Fox Interactive's Die Hard Trilogy is an awesome game concept. Based 
 on the trilogy of Bruce Willis films, the game's point-blank, lead-in-the-gut action has graced 
 the circuitry of both PlayStation and Saturn consoles. Now John McClane has his sights aimed at 
 the PC.   

 As in the console version, Die Hard Trilogy is a three game package, each game corresponding to 
 one of the do-or-die situations McClane encounters in the films. During part one, you follow McClane 
 in an over-the-shoulder shoot-out through the executive suites of the periled Nakatomi building. 
 As villains fire automatic weapons at you and shriek Deutsch-accented taunts ("Don't let him get 
 away!" "Die Yankee!") , you lob grenades at them and watch them blow up into bloody hamburger. And 
 it only gets bloodier.   

 Game two is a first-person rail-shooter (a la Virtua Cop) that leads you on a thug-crusade through 
 Dulles Airport. Again, hundreds of bad guys are felled by your handgun, rocket-launcher, or whichever 
 other anti-thug device you may pick up. Your aim is to eliminate bad guys, but anything else that 
 enters your line of fire - asbestos ceiling squares, TV monitors, large sheets of window glass 
 - can all be knocked down or demolished. Sickos be alerted: This also means police and civilians 
 alike can "accidentally" take a bullet. If McClane slips up like this, we hear his touching, albeit 
 brief, eulogy: "Sorry, pal."  

 Game three places you amidst more blood in a super-powered 3-D taxi cab careering through the streets 
 of Manhattan in search of bombs to detonate (that's right - you don't diffuse them, you blow them 
 up) . You activate high-octane turbo power-ups and execute sharp, tire-screeching "Rockford" turns, 
 searching for the next target to detonate while the clock ticks away. Of course, what would this 
 section of the game be without your ability to threaten peaceful bystanders? Any car that gets 
 in your way, even a police car coming to your aid, is in danger of being rammed. And if you "mistakenly" 
 take out a row of pedestrians, sending them flying out in front of your car, limping or in the 
 puddles of blood forming below them before finally collapsing, your navigator Zeus reminds you 
 with a sharp chiding: "Are you trying to kill those people?!" (To which I say, "Trying to kill 
 those people? I think I just DID kill those people!")  

 The games themselves are incredible concepts. But let's get to the real matter at hand: How does 
 the PC port of Die Hard Trilogy stand up to the excellent PlayStation version? Well, there's really 
 only one advantage: the almighty "save" feature. Other than that, it pales in comparison, mostly 
 when you consider the graphical differences. Even when running in the highest resolution, many 
 artistic subtleties are lost. The fluid, smooth edges of your polygonal villains, the mellifluous 
 geysers of blood, the gaseous explosions, are for the most part lost in the translation to PC. 
 Even the Direct3D version doesn't improve things much - though it offers better frame rates at 
 high resolutions.  

 This is not to say that Die Hard for the PC is not fun. Like the movies, it will provide you with 
 hours of edge-of-your-seat entertainment. One point should be stressed however. If you have a PlayStation 
 already, buy the PlayStation version of Die Hard Trilogy. If you can only see PCs in your future 
 and you want to get your tank top a little grimy with a decent action game, then this PC adaptation 
 is a good value.

Review:  Game based on trilogy of Die Hard movies. Sliced into three different games - one each for each 
 movie.
  
  For the time the graphics were not the best, but still it works. By today's standards, the graphics 
 would be considered sucky.
  
  Gameplay-wise, the games based on the first two movies are quite a lot of fun, the sound is good, 
 and action is quick and satisfying (although repetitive) .
  
  Beware of the dreaded 3rd game - a driving game that ends up being impossible to complete - literally, 
 a long drive that ends in failure every time. I actually suggest finding a trainer in order to 
 make this last game palatable - otherwise it isn't and it drags the other two decent games down 
 with it.
  
  Still, excluding the last game, I had fun and enjoyed the first two a lot.

Review:  Die Hard Trilogy was one of the first games I ever got for my PC many years ago. And it's still 
 fun to play thanks to the fast and furious gameplay, well of the first 2 games anyway. The third 
 was awful.
  
  Die Hard is a third-shooter set in the Nakatomi Plaza in LA's Century City. The set design is impressively 
 similar to that of the movie and John McClane's mission involves scouring each and every floor 
 for terrorist (actually just thieves) scum, hostages and bombs. The graphics are slightly dodgy 
 and can get a bit confusing but it's a bloody thrill ride for sure. This game was developed upon 
 more in the under-rated Die Hard: Nakatomi Plaza from 2001.
  
  Die Harder is a first person shooter much like Operation Wolf in which you go through Washington 
 DC's Dulles Airport blasting at everything you see. The best thing about this game is that everything 
 in it can be shot and destroyed. It was hectic carnage and there are some brilliant blood splatters.
 
  
  Die Hard with a Vengeance (my fave film of the trilogy) is a really crappy driving game much like 
 Crazy Taxi only with boring, near impossible mission, terrible graphics and no lasting appeal. 
 I never went back to this game more than twice. The others however, can be played again and again.
 
  
  And furthermore, the musical score on the first two games were brilliant! The third has pleasant 
 enough tunes but it never came near the action-packed cues that came before it. Nothing like Michael 
 Kamen's work on the movies, but cool anyway.
