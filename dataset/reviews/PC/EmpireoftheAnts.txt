Empire of the Ants just doesn't do justice to the really unusual and interesting premise. 

 If you think ants are just annoying, stupid pests that invade your cookie jar or bite your feet 
 in the backyard, think again. They're actually an enormously sophisticated group of creatures, 
 and they form the subject of Empire of the Ants, a real-time strategy game from developer Microds. 
 Empire of the Ants was inspired by the international best-selling novel of the same name, written 
 by French science journalist Bernard Werber. One of the novel's primary plot strands centers on 
 the russet ant empire of Bel-o-kan, which you'll lead to supremacy while gathering resources and 
 fighting enemy insects. If only the game were as interesting as its subject matter, it would have 
 a lot to offer. As it stands, it's generally dull, unfriendly, and buggy (no pun intended) .    
        It's a 3D real-time strategy game about ants...    

  As odd as it might sound to make a real-time strategy game about ants, the subject matter has intriguing 
 game design possibilities. Ant colonies have complex social structures with multiple castes working 
 in close cooperation, and their huge nests can serve as home to 10 million members. They can build 
 structures from leaves they shred and then bind together in new forms. They communicate with each 
 other by tapping, emitting squeaks or buzzes, or using chemical pheromone markers. Ants regularly 
 take other ants and insect species captive and use them as a specialized slave labor force. Other 
 than humans, ants are also the only species to regularly engage in highly organized mass warfare. 
 They even resort to chemical warfare, thanks to some species' ability to spray poison or acid. 
 Feuds between nearby colonies can go on for years and feature raids and vicious battles.   

  You'll experience a little -- but not enough -- of this strange, miniature world in the game. Your 
 overall goal is simple: build and manage your colony so that it can survive and grow in the face 
 of enemy ants, predator insects, food shortages, and other natural threats. While the game's subject 
 matter is really unusual (though it's been attempted before in Maxis' SimAnt from 1991) , a lot 
 of the basic gameplay concepts will be familiar to real-time strategy fans -- perhaps too familiar. 
 Your anthill is your base and is divided into specialized chambers, such as storage rooms and incubation 
 chambers. Your worker ants will seek out grass, mushrooms, and leaves for sustenance, and they'll 
 bring sand, twigs, spider webs, and other dead matter back to your anthill for construction material. 
 You'll also engage in combat with other ant species and individual predators.           ... but 
 it's not as engaging as it sounds.    

  Through a sometimes-confusing iconic interface, you control your ants both above and below ground. 
 To help you find your way around and track the status of your empire, a minimap is available, and 
 it really lives up to its name -- it's so small that it's rather difficult to use. An equally awkward 
 "maximap" option doesn't improve matters. There are two meager tutorials; parts of them are so 
 dull that watching dust settle would be an edge-of-your-seat experience by comparison. During the 
 egg-laying portion of the tutorial, you can go make a cup of coffee, run down to the store to buy 
 more, come back, and find the game still slowly grinding away. The tutorials are also easy to "break" -- you 
 can accidentally deviate ever so slightly from directions, which is easy to do since they're not 
 always clear, and then have to start over. These tutorials and the mediocre manual just don't explain 
 the details of the game as clearly as they should. The same shoddiness rears its ugly head in the 
 menus, where you can accidentally quit the game while navigating them because a quit confirmation 
 appears only sporadically.    

 A heavy reliance on old real-time strategy concepts helps clarify some of the game. Many of your 
 ants function a lot like classic RTS combat units. There are basic soldiers and jaw-busters, both 
 of which act as standard infantry. Gunners are your ranged units -- they spray formic acid at their 
 foes to eat away their exoskeletons. The "tank" consists of four basic soldiers carrying an oversized 
 janitor ant that can crush multiple enemies at once with its formidable mandibles. The queen's 
 guardians are your expensive elite warriors. Since ants enslave other insects, you can also use 
 midge spies or harness flying beetles to act as air transports for your soldiers.           The 
 action takes place above and below ground, during day and night.    

  Like a nature documentary come to life, the game features a panoply of independent, solitary insects 
 that act as predators or prey. Your ants will feast on crickets, snails, butterflies, and other 
 creatures, but they'll have to avoid ravenous hornets or dragonflies at the same time. Despite 
 all these colorful insects and ant varieties, combat is pretty much just a "tank rush" affair of 
 sending swarming ants after an enemy. Unit production is far more important than tactics, and it 
 can be quite a challenge simply to issue an attack order against rapidly moving enemies, thanks 
 to the clumsy combat interface.   

  In addition to the real-time strategy elements, Empire of the Ants shares concepts with god games, 
 like Black &amp; White. You control squads of warrior ants directly, grouping them or setting up 
 patrol routes as in most RTS games. However, you can influence your various types of worker ants 
 only indirectly by setting global preferences for your anthill. If you're low on food, you can 
 set food gathering highest on your priority list. If you want to speed up production of new ants, 
 you can attend to the queen and her eggs to help the reproductive cycle move along as efficiently 
 as possible.   

  Overall, the game's visuals are colorful and pleasant and do a decent job of re-creating the forest 
 floor and its insect inhabitants, though the animations for the insects are a bit jerky. Day-and-night 
 cycles produce variable sunlight, though the brief nighttime periods are so dark that you can hardly 
 see a thing. The effect may be realistic, but it isn't any fun. Thankfully, you can toggle the 
 night feature off. The camera is also a bit clumsy -- you can zoom in and out and rotate it, but 
 you can't change the isometric viewing angle. You'll also notice that the plant leaves highest 
 from the ground and closest to the camera often look extremely pixelated, with big jagged edges -- not 
 the kind that naturally exists on many leaves.           Empire of the Ants is mostly bland, despite 
 its interesting theme.    

  The game's above-average orchestral score features some catchy melodies. Ambient sounds of birds 
 and owls bring the game's forest world to life, but the bleep-and-bloop-style unit responses and 
 combat sounds would be more at home in old arcade games like Centipede. The designers had a blank 
 slate and should have given their imagination free reign to be able to come up with some really 
 clever sound effects.   

  In addition to the single-player campaign, Empire of the Ants offers skirmish and multiplayer modes, 
 though they're both limited, and the multiplayer mode lacks a server browser for finding opponents. 
 Regardless of the mode you choose, you'll likely find that neither the combat nor the nest building 
 is very interesting or entertaining. The former tends to be simplistic and boring, and the latter 
 is equally dull since it is hard to relate to and lacks the depth and vivacity you'd find in comparable 
 games. Ugly dirt chambers just don't have the color and interest of the castles or futuristic military 
 bases you'd find in other real-time strategy games. On top of that, some of the missions really 
 drag. The game has its moments, but not frequently enough to lift it out of mediocrity. Empire 
 of the Ants just doesn't do justice to the really unusual and interesting premise.

Review:  This is one of the the weirdest yet cute Strategy game where you have to run a Ant Hill.
  
  The gameplay can get a little confusing. Navigating through the anthill can be a bit of a challenge. 
 The minimap that represents the inside of the hill is completely confusing. The interaction buttons 
 are easy to use though.
  
  The graphics aren't bad but nothing to brag about. It is okay for the time.
  
  If you are a 
 big strategy gamer then I would not suggest getting this game, but if you ever wondered what goes 
 on in an anthill, this is the game for you!
