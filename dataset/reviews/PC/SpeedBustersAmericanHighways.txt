:::Review:::
The track design is inventive, the illusion of speed is great, and overall the control is good. 
 

 Ubi Soft's past efforts in the racing genre have sat on opposite sides of the spectrum. The sophisticated 
 F1 Racing Simulation is a far cry from POD, an arcade racer with a science fiction theme. Now comes 
 Speed Busters: American Highways, a game that falls closer to POD in terms of its simplistic nature 
 but still tries to incorporate some realistic handling and physics issues. The result is a game 
 that has all of the right moves but some design elements that make it an often-frustrating ride. 

 The premise behind Speed Busters takes inspiration from the golden age of Burt Reynolds films. Think 
 Smokey and the Bandit; think Cannonball Run. A police officer has won the lottery and lost his 
 marbles. He's hosting a series of races in various locales, and the winner gets lots of his money. 
 You also earn money and ranking based on how fast you drive past the radar detectors located on 
 each track.  

 Speed Busters features seven tracks (one of them hidden) and any number of cars and upgrades. It 
 follows a basic arcade racer formula. In championship mode, you begin with three available tracks 
 and unlock the rest as you proceed. You cannot race on tracks in arcade mode without unlocking 
 them in the championship (though you can access them in multiplayer) .   

 In championship mode, the game takes you through each track, and you use the money you win to buy 
 upgrades, repairs, nitro refills, and even new cars if you so desire. Upgrades include spoilers, 
 faster engines, bigger nitro tanks, and better tires. Other items for sale include road assistance 
 (little arrows will appear onscreen during races to indicate upcoming turns) and car insurance 
 (which makes all repairs free for the next race) . You can take these upgraded cars into arcade 
 mode, in which you must hit a series of checkpoints as you race around.  

 The game itself plays much like most arcade racers. You simply move forward as fast as you can. 
 You have brakes, a handbrake, and nitro to make you go faster and slower where appropriate. The 
 strategy of playing really relies on you mastering the handbrake, and learning where and when to 
 apply a nitro boost is also important. The illusion of speed is pretty impressive, and when you 
 hit the nitro, your car zooms ahead a bit, giving the impression of a massive speed burst.   

 
 The track design in Speed Busters is great. Each track is set in a different North American location, 
 ranging from Mexico to Canada. Each track is like a miniversion of its setting. For instance, the 
 California track will take you from the back lot of a movie studio to the winding streets of San 
 Francisco in a matter of moments. Each track has numerous shortcuts and ambient obstacles (such 
 as Mexico's trap-filled temples or the big apes that attack cars in California) . The tracks also 
 feature different environmental effects (each can be raced in daytime, dusk, and rain or snow) , 
 and you can also race each track in reverse or in mirror mode.  

 There is one major problem that makes Speed Busters often more frustrating than fun. The tracks 
 are filled with obstacles. Every turn is a potential hazard, as you can get stuck on a tree, house, 
 or what have you. This isn't the problem. The game tries to replicate some realistic handling issues. 
 It's easy to oversteer, spin out, and/or completely lose control of your vehicle. This still isn't 
 the problem. What is the problem is that it's difficult to recover from these situations. You can't 
 go in reverse, so getting around a tree you're caught on can make you lose several seconds of valuable 
 time. Get stuck off the main road, and you may be talking ten or more seconds to get yourself situated 
 again.  

 Despite this major shortcoming, though, Speed Busters is great fun. The track design is inventive, 
 the illusion of speed is great, and overall the control is good. And with a few tweaks to the controls 
 or some slightly less hazardous track designs, a sequel could provide to be stiff competition for 
 the Need for Speed series.

Review:  So I don't like really really hard games, so when I played this game when it came out and I just 
 kept falling behind every other car; I just kind of gave up and throw the game aside to collect 
 dust. A week later, I attemped this game again, and gave up. So one boring day, I decided to actually 
 play through the story mode and get 1st place for once. So I did. And maybe 2 years later racing 
 in the same 3 tracks that they gave you to begin with (yeah that's right, they only have 6 tracks 
 in the whole entire game with 1 unlockable track which is New York) , I unlocked the 3 extra new 
 tracks and some more cars. It was so satisfying when I finally get to race in new enviroments after 
 seeing the same thing for 2 years. Overall this game is kind of a crappy experience, but it's not 
 the worst.
