:::Review:::
The question you need to ask yourself is whether you enjoy Quake II enough to merit playing it again, 
 because The Reckoning is a supplement rather than an improvement. 

 The first official mission pack for Quake II is a cohesive, if conservative, extension of the original, 
 offering more weapons and opponents along with plenty of solid single-player and deathmatch levels. 
 The question you need to ask yourself is whether you enjoy Quake II enough to merit playing it 
 again, because The Reckoning is a supplement rather than an improvement. You're still just one 
 marine up against the evil biomechanical Strogg, and though you'll take up a few new guns and see 
 a few new sights, The Reckoning remains thematically identical to the original Quake II campaign. 

 Though there are plenty of new graphics in this add-on, you'd have trouble picking them out of a 
 lineup. The polished gunmetal walls, the crimson skies, the dimly lit corridors - all the sights 
 from Quake II are back, albeit slightly different than before. Though you'll pass through a few 
 all-new vistas, such as a canyon and a low-gravity moon base, they are not so different as to make 
 you think you're playing an all-new game. Likewise, while the mission pack features a sizeable 
 slew of new enemies just waiting to frag you dead, only a handful of these are original. The most 
 noteworthy of these new enemies is an amphibious ape-like creature with glowing, acidic blood. 
 Instead, most are stronger variants of the original Quake II menagerie: slightly different in appearance, 
 much tougher to kill, and far more potently equipped. Expect to face three new types of guards, 
 an enhanced Tank, an Iron Maiden equipped with guided missiles, and more. Meanwhile, there are 
 very few new audio effects worthy of note. The new weapons sound appropriate enough, the occasional 
 instances of voice-over are effective, and the soundtrack is naught but the original Quake II distortion 
 guitar mishmash.  

 The new weapons you'll discover are well designed, but nothing too far out of the ordinary. The 
 Phalynx Particle Cannon unloads two huge, explosive fireballs, but it's a little too slow to be 
 effective in a heated firefight, let alone against a skilled opponent in an open deathmatch. The 
 Ion Ripper, a design quickly becoming yet another first-person shooter cliche, fires powerful ricocheting 
 energy bolts (surprisingly, a sniper rifle is nowhere to be found) . Other new gadgets include the 
 simply named Trap, a device that absorbs and collapses everything in range reducing its unfortunate 
 victims to a bite-size, edible cube; and a quad damage variant that increases your rate of fire 
 fourfold.  

 Level design in The Reckoning is akin to that of Quake II at its most mediocre, meaning the majority 
 of the areas are suspenseful corridor crawls. The levels are hub-based like in the original, such 
 that you'll need to move back and forth between several areas killing the opposition, solving puzzles, 
 and unlocking new regions before you can move on. Though the backtracking is better implemented 
 than in Quake II (expect plenty of resistance even on your second pass through, rather than a bunch 
 of corpses) , the architecture itself isn't as striking as the original missions. You won't see 
 anything like Quake II's grisly processing plant or detention cell areas, for example. But these 
 new levels are certainly tougher than those of Quake II, in no small part because of the stronger 
 enemies. After all, those guards you used to scoff at are now armed with hyper blasters and laser 
 rifles, making even the weakest of your foes a formidable challenge. Fortunately, you'll find weapons 
 and ammo on a regular basis. The puzzles within the levels are much like those of Quake II, in 
 that they help make the game seem bigger than it really is without frustrating you excessively. 
 Overall, The Reckoning is roughly equivalent in physical size to Quake II's campaign, though its 
 difficulty means it will invariably take you longer to complete. Furthermore, there are enough 
 secret areas within each level to warrant playing it through more than once.  

 More than half a dozen new deathmatch levels mean The Reckoning has much to offer in terms of competitive 
 play. Its deathmatch levels are typically well designed and allow you to use the new weapons to 
 good effect. Internet servers running The Reckoning levels are already springing up, so rest assured 
 you'll find online competition anytime you're ready for it.  

 Those who found the original to be either entirely or gradually disappointing will want to pass 
 on The Reckoning for the same reasons. But this mission pack contains all the necessary ingredients 
 to satisfy the Quake II fan looking for more of the same.

Review:  Quake II (1997) , developed by id Software and published by Activision, is one of the best First-Person 
 Shooters in the gaming history, and still been played by a lot of hardcore fans. Xatrix decided 
 to release an expansion pack, called 'The Reckoning', to this instant classic. The new content 
 doesn't change too much the original Quake II gameplay, which means that if you liked the original 
 game, this add-on is a good option to extend its life. Basically, the player will again control 
 an unnamed marine and go through the Strogg facilities, killing a lot of ****ed aliens.
  
  There're now two new weapons to use against the Strogg: the Ionripper, a plasma gun that fires 
 bouncing projectiles; and the Phalanx, which fires two energized and explosive spheres. Both weapons 
 are fun to use, but you can finish the expansion without really using them. In addition to the 
 weapons, there're also a few new enemies, as well modified versions to the already existing ones 
 (making them stronger than before) . 
  
  'The Reckoning' comes with 18 new levels, and all of them are good and faithful to the original 
 Quake II. I found the final levels particularly great, and really add a lot of value to this add-on. 
 Unfortunately, the final boss isn't innovative, and it's very easy to beat. However, the levels 
 are harder than the ones in the original game, and provide good 7 or 8 hours of gameplay.
  
  The new seven deathmatch maps for multiplayer are OK, and allow the player to try the new weapons 
 against some opponents in the internet or via local area network. Honestly, I think they should 
 introduce more maps for the multiplayer mode, since it's one of the most important qualities in 
 Quake II.
  
  So, if you're looking for a way to improve Quake II, you'll be a little disappointed with 'The 
 Reckoning' expansion, since the new stuff isn't actually entirely new, but mostly a modified version 
 to the already existing content. Nevertheless, it's still worth playing because of the new great 
 levels to both single player and multiplayer modes.
