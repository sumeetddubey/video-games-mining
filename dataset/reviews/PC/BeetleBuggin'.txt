Its varied courses and vehicles enhance its replay value and will keep casual gamers coming back 
 for more. 

 Infogrames' Beetle Buggin' isn't exactly the answer to hard-core driving simulation fans' prayers. 
 It offers a variety of tracks, options, and licensed cars, but it makes no pretenses of being a 
 full-fledged racing simulator. Instead, Beetle Buggin' is content to be a lighthearted arcade-style 
 racing game with a liberal physics engine, fairly simple graphics, and plenty of gameplay modes. 

 Beetle Buggin' has a very intuitive menu screen from which you can choose one of three single-player 
 modes that make up the meat of the game: quick race, championship, and Beetle challenge. Each of 
 the three modes is composed of five unique ways to race that include monster-truck driving, supercross 
 races, off-road races, track races, and distance events. The supercross, off-road, and track events 
 let you choose from a handful of cars that you'll race against seven rivals across a number of 
 dirt, paved, and beach courses. The object of these racing events is simply to place first, and 
 the game keeps it interesting by varying the time of day, weather conditions, and location of each 
 race. Most of the racing modes have been designed simply to deliver the thrill of competitive racing 
 without the worries of real-life physics or car trouble.  

 However, the jumps and the monster-truck events aren't as well designed as the other three. To pass 
 a jumping event, you have to clear a certain number of yards by activating your car's nitrous booster 
 at precisely the right distance before the ramp at exactly the right speed. However, you have no 
 way of knowing what the required distance and speed are, short of attempting a series of trial-and-error 
 runs. What's more frustrating is that the win conditions change completely every time you progress 
 to a later jumping event.  

 While the monster-truck game of Beetle Buggin' is somewhat more forgiving, it's also a little agitating. 
 During the monster-truck events, you have a limited amount of time to maneuver a massive Volkswagen 
 truck around a course littered with cars and buses - the key word being, "maneuver." That's because 
 you'll also have to contend with going around a series of cones and pylons, and you're penalized 
 every time you run over one. It'd be perfectly acceptable if you were behind the wheel of a nimble 
 sports car, but there's no place for precision driving on a monster-truck track.  

 Aside from its two more-problematic play modes, Beetle Buggin's varying modes of racing keep it 
 fresh and enjoyable and push you to unlock more vehicles by successfully completing each of the 
 events. Fans of the classic VW Bug, the most recognizable and widely produced car in the world, 
 will also enjoy Beetle Buggin's wide selection of cars. Because of its licensing agreement with 
 Volkswagen, Infogrames has included 17 unique VW models in the game, including favorites like the 
 Baja Bug and the VW bus. Each of the models has several variants that boast unique paint jobs and 
 enhanced engines that effectively raise the total number of vehicles in Beetle Buggin' to over 
 50 - more than enough to please even the most discriminating fahrvergnugen zealot.  

 The cars themselves are modeled with a fair amount of detail and are skinned using adequate texture 
 sizes. However, the tracks are somewhat lacking by comparison: The textures used along most of 
 the courses are washed out, and sprite-based trees, crowds, and other outlying objects are typical 
 throughout the entire game. While the graphics won't win the game any awards, Beetle Buggin's 3D 
 engine does make use of certain rendering technologies, like environment mapping and 32-bit color, 
 that serve to keep the game's visuals on par with similar racing games.  

 For Volkswagen fans interested in nothing more than a few laps around the track in a classic '60s 
 Bug, or a cruise along the beach with a Baja racer, then Beetle Buggin' is definitely a bargain. 
 Its varied courses and vehicles enhance its replay value and will keep casual gamers coming back 
 for more.

Review:  I remember myself playing this game when i was 13 years old, but recently, i played this game in 
 my cousin's pc and i must say to all of you that this game is not for mature audiences or expert 
 simulation drivers, or you'll just end bored.
  
  Beetle Buggin' is a funny game, it features the world known Volkswagen cars with arcade physics 
 (i really recommend using a game pad) , the AI is challenging "because they drive perfect" and you 
 have lots of racing events to complete, such as: jump, cross, buggy, speed, and monster.
  
  Like most racing games you will start with the worst car, but as you win races you will have the 
 opportunity to acquire "better" cars with different characteristics: faster, lighter or even Bigger 
 monster cars, that's depending on the racing event you are playing. The problem with this is that 
 there is not a real difference between cars, you will feel you are driving the same with just little 
 more horse power.
  
  Graphically the game looks just right, the system requirements are very low by today standards; 
 so i bet you pc can run this game without problem.
  
  The difficulty level is well balanced; not hard, neither easy, just in the middle of both; so you 
 will have a lot fun, instead of suffering because you can't win. But i must say, that when you 
 have played like +15 Hours, the game feels really easy.
  
  Overall this game is very addictive for the money. But once you finish it, you will be looking 
 for more.
