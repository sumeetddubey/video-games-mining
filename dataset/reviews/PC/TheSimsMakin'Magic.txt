:::Review:::
While some of Makin' Magic's more-colorful additions seem a bit out of place, this final expansion 
 pack adds plenty of new things for you and your sims to do. 

  Maxis' world-renowned PC strategy game The Sims, which lets you create and control the lives of 
 a virtual family of little computer people called "sims," has been extremely popular since its 
 release in 2000. The game has also given rise to a total of seven expansion packs, and the latest 
 and final of these is The Sims: Makin' Magic, which lets your family of sims learn how to use magic 
 wands, potions, and spells to turn their unwanted neighbors into frogs, to shower themselves with 
 riches, and to create other wondrous effects. While some of Makin' Magic's more-colorful additions 
 seem a bit out of place, this final expansion pack adds plenty of new things for you and your sims 
 to do.  

          Makin' Magic makes plenty of new additions to The Sims.     

  Like the last few expansion packs for The Sims, Makin' Magic adds a great many new household objects 
 with which your sims can fill their houses. It also adds a new outdoor "lot" area, named Magic 
 Town, which you can visit at any time. Here you can also completely scrap and redesign yourself. 
 Like other expansion packs for The Sims, Makin' Magic also includes a few additional options that 
 work with previous expansions. For instance, if you have The Sims: Unleashed, you can temporarily 
 change one of your pets into a person. However, Makin' Magic also lets your sims use magic spells 
 (which emphasize the logic, cooking, and mechanical skills) to circumvent mundane problems, like 
 refilling personal needs (also known as "motives") such as hunger, fatigue, and social interfaction. 
 Additionally, your sims can actually perform magic shows, similarly to how they could put on various 
 types of shows in the previous expansion, Superstar. Many of these additions completely eliminate 
 the need for common chores, like continually chatting up other sims to keep your social needs satisfied. 
 For instance, in Makin' Magic, a child sim can magically create an imaginary best friend instead 
 of having to hunt down other sims for conversation. However, the expansion's dcor is much 
 more colorful than that of the previous expansions. Specifically, the expansion's sparkly magic 
 spells and brightly colored amusement parks seem like they might be more appealing to smaller children 
 than to the more-mature fans of the series who enjoy The Sims for its tongue-in-cheek social commentary 
 and risqu sexual innuendo.  

  Regardless, Makin' Magic gives you many new interesting things to do that will likely draw your 
 attention away from constant bathroom breaks and naps. You begin a new game of Makin' Magic at 
 home when a mystery man appears at your door to drop off new magical equipment, including a cauldron 
 to formulate new spells, a new magic wand, and a handful of spell components. From there you can 
 build a comfortable home business harvesting beeswax and elderberries. If you'd prefer, however, 
 you can use these components as spell ingredients, or you can use them to barter for other spell 
 components or magic items from various vendors in Magic Town.  

  Makin' Magic's new out-of-house lot area, Magic Town, gives you many more options than the lot 
 areas from the previous expansions. For instance, you can visit Magic Town to put on public magic 
 shows or to stage wizardly duels in a process that's reminiscent of the performances in The Sims: 
 Superstar, though these performances don't require as much guesswork. (In the previous expansion, 
 you had to choose a "correct" sequence for your performance or you'd fail.) These shows help you 
 earn "magicoins," a new currency that lets you buy pricier spell components and even lets you buy 
 your way into a new Magic Town house adorned with beanstalks and crystal gardens. Redecorating 
 a lot in Magic Town can actually be more than just an exercise in interior decorating. The expansion's 
 new theme objects, which include haunted house objects and carnival objects, let you build your 
 very own midway, complete with carnival games and roller coasters, which you can create by laying 
 out pieces of track. You can even fill out an entire lot with nothing but one big roller coaster, 
 if you care to.  

          Between new household objects and the new lots in Magic Town, Makin' Magic will definitely 
 keep you busy.     

  If you've been following The Sims and its many expansion packs, you should have already guessed 
 that Makin' Magic makes no real technical improvements to The Sims. While the expansion adds a 
 huge number of colorful new objects to interact with, they're all the same sort of 2D-rendered 
 scenery you've seen in the expansion packs, and the sims themselves are still the same blocky-looking 
 3D characters. Makin' Magic also sounds quite good. It adds appropriate new music and some new 
 sound samples to its gibberish "simlish" language, and these all fit well, though whether you find 
 them to be as clever and funny as the simlish in the original game will depend on how much you've 
 already played The Sims and its expansions since 2000. Just like every other expansion pack, Makin' 
 Magic doesn't bother to fix the sluggish camera or the occasionally deficient artificial intelligence 
 used for sims, which sometimes causes them to "forget" whatever instructions you had queued up 
 for them.  

  Maxis has announced that Makin' Magic will be the very last expansion pack for The Sims (the studio 
 will henceforth focus on development of the upcoming sequel, The Sims 2) . Like other expansion 
 packs that preceded it, Makin' Magic presents plenty of interesting additions to the original game, 
 but it also adds a whole lot more of them. If you're a fan of The Sims, you've probably already 
 ordered this expansion pack -- especially since it's the last one. If you're on the fence about it, 
 and you're not especially put off by the incongruous setting, Makin' Magic offers plenty of interesting 
 things to occupy you and your little computer people before The Sims 2 comes out.

Review:  The Good: (expansion) The final expansion to a great series that I will be playing for years to 
 come. When I first started playing this game I got addicted. I loved the graphics and how I could 
 control almost all aspects of my Sims life. The modding community is spectacular and you can find 
 just about everything you could imagine to add to the game. The characters actually talk so it is 
 fun to hear their conversations in simmish. There's a lot of stuff you can buy for your sims. You 
 can build a pool and a lot of other stuff. You can hire people and you can pick from many jobs 
 for your own Sim. The only limit is your imagination with this game.
  The Bad: A few glitches but all in all the game is smooth and you will have hours of enjoyment 
 if you enjoy games like this. The minor issues will not ruin your gameplay in anyway.
  
  Gameplay:8.5
  Graphics:8.0
  Sound:8.0
  Value:8.0
  Tilt:8.0
  Singleplayer:8.0 (much replayability)
 
  Multiplayer: N/A
  
  Conclusion: (expansion) Overall this game is highly addictive, and highly fun. If you have a PC, 
 (which you will have if you are reading this) buy this game. It's a great series with many hours 
 to let your imagination run wild in. Farewell The SiMs... hello The SiMs 2! This series is addicting.
 
  
  My Score:8.0 Great

Review:  The Sims Makin' Magic is the best sim game ever cuz the sounds, musics and the best thing of all 
 is that u can download objects, put musics and download houses and skins etc.
  
  All my friends really like this game so much, also my brothers.
  
  I like this game because 
 you can have a dragon pet, make spells, bake a cake, new objects and the best thing of all is wht 
 i really like is to make a performance and duel spells.
  
  You can have magic tokens that if u did the best performance ever then you would get alot of tokens 
 then u can win a dragon but sometimes it might get red dragon, which means if u have a red dragon 
 then he would burn your house.
  
  (do not download a program that makes full cooking etc. the game might crashes i hope no one is 
 downloading this program...)

Review:  The Sims Makin' Magic is the the last of the expansions in The Sims and it looks like they wanted 
 to go out with a bang. The graphics situation is pretty much the same as for any Sims expansion. 
 Your Sims themselves aren't fantastic although they are satisfactory but you will find nicely done 
 objects and some other small things in the game. I'd say the real down side to the graphics are 
 the effects (e. g dueling spells) but overall you should recognise this as a Sim game. When you 
 go back to your old Sim characters the Mystery Man will turn up at the door with a starter magic 
 set, you can choose to open the box and release the world of magic within or you can get rid of 
 it or you can brick it up in the bathroom wall to be opened at a later date. Of course with your 
 new expansion comes a new town, magic town which is divided up into a spooky haunted forest and 
 a weird carnival, here you can complete quests for items, stage magic shows, compete in duels and 
 buy items using either Simoleons or Magicoins. The new expansion also offers a wide range of spells 
 and charms which may go your way or under certain conditions backfire and of course this expansion 
 also introduces a fun +175 new objects. The Sims Makin' Magic brings with it a number of whooshes 
 and dings as sound effects and the soundtrack can only be described as strange and sometimes haunting 
 but very suiting to the unpredictable world of magic. If you've picked up all the other expansions 
 pick this one up and make your collection complete but if you are scared of your Sims never being 
 the same again, don't worry just leave that box bricked up behind the wall to rot forever and stay 
 well away from Magic Town.

Review:  This is the final expansion to the legendary gaming series that we know, The Sims. The new feature 
 is really to do and create magic. This is a really fun thing to do. Once again there is another 
 town which now focuses on magic. When you enter your house, you can get a magic box. If you open 
 that box then you can basically do magic. You can gradually get better and better at the magic 
 and you can do more things when you are better.
  
  The places you can go are fun not only in what you do but also the things you can buy are fun because 
 they bring a certain magical element into the area. Once again you can still do the classic Sims 
 living. You have choice which is what is so great about all of these Sims expansions. This is defiently 
 a good expansion and finishs of the whole thing really well.

Review:  In this sims add-on you can with your sims visit the magic world. They get a new sorts money that 
 only can be spended in the magic town, and can with the magic maker make own spells, with the help 
 of the magic book. You can move into the town, but it costs lots of magic money, but you can visit 
 it free with the rabbit hole item. You can earn more magic money, duel, do tasks, buy magical stuff 
 and have fun in the new magic town.
  When creating a new family, you get a magic box with different magic stuff, like the magic maker, 
 rabbit hole, wands to all family members, spell book, spell ingredients and 30 magic coins.
  The sounds are pretty good in magic town, but the graphics could be better (in all the sims games...)
 
  When you first time play this add-on, you'll get hooked!

Review:  
  The developers really had a great time developing this expansion. In this one you have the ability 
 to cast spells and brew up some wicked potions. This adds a whole new game to the Sims.
  
  You have to try and get all your ingredience in doing all kinds of funny tasks and trading stuff 
 you have with stuff you want from someone else. There are little games to play all over the new 
 community lots, like racing against one of the computers to touch the most mushrooms. This is great 
 fun and if you win you win some useful stuff you can put in your magic maker.
  
  When you have finished brewing up a spell, wind up your magic stick and blast your magic over your 
 friends. Well, turning someone into a frog is not something your friends will be impressed with 
 but it will give you a good laugh.
  
  There are loads of new object, from grape vines to honey combs. This is a really fun expansion 
 to finish off the Sims collection

Review:  The Sims Makin' Magic is the seventh and final expansion pack for the highest selling PC game of 
 all time, The Sims, and it doesn't disappoint. Sure, I was one of those who was opposed against 
 supernatural themes existing in my game, but when I gave the pack a try... wow! It got me addicted 
 all over again.
  
  With over 175 objects, tons of new NPCs, lots and other goodies to enjoy, The Sims Makin' Magic 
 will keep you busy for a while. However you won't have much to play with if you abandon all the 
 magical aspects of the game altogether.
  
  Gameplay - Great new gameplay options here as your Sims can learn spells, create charms, and play 
 with over 175 awesome new magical (and non-magical objects) .
  
  Graphics - Although dated, the objects look fantastic especially that clown sculpture. [Drools]
 
  
  Sound - As usual, the audio of the game is truly excellent, and there are plenty of memorable tunes 
 for you to Sim by.
  
  Value - Great value as this is the largest expansion pack by far, and there are plenty of things 
 for your Sims to see and do. If you're after a new adventure for your Sims to embark upon, you 
 can't go wrong with Superstar and Makin Magic expansion packs. Other expansions don't get more 
 in-depth than this. And you can pick this expansion up for quite a cheap price too.
  
  Tilt - It'll keep you busy for a while, particularly if you were waiting for The Sims 2 to be released, 
 or if you're busy saving up for it.
  
  Overall, The Sims Makin Magic is definately unlike all the other expansion packs that you may have 
 played, and is certainly one of the best.

Review:  If you have this Sims expansion pack, chances are you have a few more. THe question becomes: what 
 does this one offer that the others don't? 
  
  The main innovation in this edition is, you guessed it, magic. It works by the various people collecting 
 spell components (after getting a wand) . They can do this by buying them (mainly from Magic Town) , 
 earning them in quests (go cheer up SoAndSo, deliver this item, and so on) or making them yourself. 
 Once ingredients are prepared in the right order, the Sim can cast that spell a certain number 
 of times before needing to pick up more ingredients. There are also several Magic Town lots that 
 Sims can move into, though you can't preview the lots in advance. In addition, there's the usual 
 batch of new items to decorate your magic-laden houses with, as well as new social interactions 
 (most of them spell-related) . It's another facet of the Game That Never Ends that can suck up countless 
 hours. At least until The Sims 2 comes out...
