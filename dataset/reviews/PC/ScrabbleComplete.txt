:::Review:::
Scrabble Complete is basically just Scrabble, which, if you're a fan of the challenging board game 
 it's based on, is a good thing. 

 If a friend asked you to sum up Scrabble Complete in a few sentences, you could simply say, "It's 
 basically just Scrabble. It also comes with Boggle, but otherwise... it's Scrabble." That's because 
 although it's a no-frills computer-game translation of the classic Hasbro board game, and though 
 it has a few minigames as well as a completely free computer-game version of Boggle, Scrabble Complete 
 is basically just Scrabble, which, if you're a fan of the challenging board game it's based on, 
 is a good thing.           Scrabble Complete follows the rules of the board game closely.    

 
 The popular board game Scrabble lets up to four players randomly choose a number of letter tiles, 
 then attempt to make words on the board using their own letters and those in the words that other 
 players have already spelled out, much like a crossword puzzle. Different letters are worth different 
 point values (for instance, the letter "Q" can be relatively difficult to place, so it's worth 
 a whopping 10 points, as opposed to the letter "T," which is worth only one point) , and players 
 can use certain spaces on the board to multiply the score value for the words they place.   

  Scrabble Complete apparently supports multiplayer play over the Internet on a direct IP connection 
 or using a third-party application, but we weren't able to find any opponents online. Fortunately, 
 the game lets you play with up to three computer-controlled opponents with six levels of difficulty, 
 and the toughest difficulty, champion, is extremely smart and will give most Scrabble fans a run 
 for their money. Unfortunately, players aren't represented by avatars of any kind or with any speech 
 samples, so unless you can find someone to play a game with on the same computer, playing Scrabble 
 Complete will seem like a pretty solitary experience.   

  In addition to the main game, Scrabble Complete also comes with several minigames that are essentially 
 word puzzles; most are pretty simplistic, but a few are challenging enough to try out a few times. 
 In both the standard and minigame modes, Scrabble Complete has an in-game dictionary that lets 
 you look up the words you and your opponents have placed.           The game's graphics look dated, 
 but they work.    

 Scrabble Complete doesn't look like much. The game uses rather dated 2D graphics for its menus and 
 to depict the game board. However, the game's menus are intuitive and easy to use, and they're 
 certainly effective. You might say the same for Scrabble Complete's rather sparse sound; the game 
 has a few forgettable sound effects when you place tiles or occasionally get a huge score from 
 a good word, but otherwise, the game's audio largely consists of a series of bland muzak tracks 
 that might have been taken straight from an elevator, but they are largely inoffensive, too.   
 

  You might think that this review would now move on to discuss the included Boggle game that comes 
 with Scrabble Complete, but there isn't much to say in that regard. Scrabble Complete comes packaged 
 with the same version of Boggle that was released in 1997, and it even has the logos from the now-defunct 
 Hasbro Interactive written all over it. It's a decent play if you're a Boggle fan, but the game 
 clearly shows its age -- it defaults to playing in windowed mode, for instance.   

  Still, the game of Scrabble is probably the main reason why anyone would purchase Scrabble Complete. 
 And Scrabble Complete does a pretty competent job with the translation from board game to computer 
 game, even if it isn't spectacular.

Review:  Well, all you basically do is form up words and score points, the winner is determined by how many 
 points he or she collected. Well, to the reviewing, the graphics are ok, for a 2-d game but still has 
 that 3-d effect with awesome music which is soothing for a game like this. Gameplay in Scrabble 
 Complete is pretty much the same as the others, controls are simple, the game uses the mouse most 
 of the time! They have a lot of mini-games which can help you in your game but the only thing I 
 don't really like is the multiplayer. Yes, one is that they do not have a lot of players and second, finding 
 a room is just impossibble! They only let you type the i. p. address.. WHAT?! How the heck do I know 
 what's the room's I. P.?! If they do it like other games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield 1942, then 
 it might be ok.
  
  Still, Scrabble Complete is a very nice game not only for fanatics or players who are used to the 
 game, but also for first -time players to hook you up to this wonderful game.
