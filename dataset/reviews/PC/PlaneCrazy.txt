If not for the flawed controls, horrific course design, and extremely limited gameplay options, 
 it might just be a good game. 

 SegaSoft's Plane Crazy is a fairly unique racer that attempts to capture the thrill of aerobatic 
 flying in an arcade action style. In some ways, the game achieves that goal. In fact, if not for 
 Plane Crazy's flawed controls, horrific course design, and extremely limited gameplay options, 
 it might just be a good game.  

 In a nutshell, Plane Crazy is your typical racing game filled with twisting tracks and fast-paced 
 gameplay. The big difference, of course, is that your vehicle is a hot-rod aircraft modeled loosely 
 on the slick machines you see in the Reno Air Races if you watch ESPN 2 really late at night. You 
 have three planes to choose from, and you can customize the appearance of each by changing the 
 paint scheme on the fuselage, wings, tail, and engine. Sadly, most of these textures are rather 
 plain - or ugly - and if you mix and match the textures you generally end up with one sad-looking 
 plane. When you take part in a championship season, you can also earn prize money for upgrades 
 that will make your aircraft faster and more formidable.  

 Not that earning that prize money is an easy task. Thanks to the game's bizarre and aggravating 
 course design, you'll be hard-pressed even to complete some of these races, let alone win one or 
 two. You might expect a game like this to play upon its theme - flying - so that you could seriously 
 test your aerobatic skills on tracks designed to provide plenty of freedom of movement. Instead, 
 all of the tracks in Plane Crazy are tight, claustrophobic affairs in which the slightest amount 
 of oversteer results in a fiery crash. One course, Dockland Dive, is particularly evil as it thrusts 
 numerous pipes, walls, and other obstacles in your face at every turn. Combine this with some treacherous 
 updrafts, and you have one very annoying racing experience.  

 Another fault lies in the lack of directional guides. While some of the courses are well marked 
 and easy to navigate, most lack signs and warnings in key locations. This is especially troublesome 
 in subterranean areas (yes, there are subterranean areas in this airplane-racing game...) , where 
 you can rarely tell which way to turn before you slam into the scenery. Even trying to follow the 
 computer-piloted planes is not always helpful, as they attempt illegal turns from time to time 
 (it does little to boost my confidence in a game when even the computer-controlled vehicles can't 
 follow the track) .  

 The controls are another issue, though an admittedly minor one. Although the game encourages the 
 use of a joystick, it does not seem to support the throttle controls built into two of the most 
 popular joysticks on the market. Using first a Microsoft SideWinder Precision Pro and then a Logitech 
 Wingman Extreme Digital, I was unable to use the joystick's built-in throttle control to govern 
 my velocity. Instead, I either had to assign that function to two buttons or keys.  

 While games of this sort generally shine in multiplayer mode, even here I found Plane Crazy confusing 
 and unrefined. Starting a network game is a bizarre process that provides little feedback. I was 
 able to get the game working over a native IP link, but it took several tries for me to connect 
 to my opponent, as the game's 30-second linkup timer often ran out before we could sync up. Performance 
 is decent, but I did not like the fact that the host cannot set the race parameters. For example, 
 while I had disabled the checkpoint timer option on my end, my opponent had not, and he frequently 
 lost for that reason alone - even when he was ahead of me in the race.  

 Single-player options are straightforward, with quick race, championship season, and ghost race 
 modes available. The game includes only nine tracks, however, and only one of those is a multilap 
 circuit track. So unless you care to spend a great deal of time on HEAT playing this game, you 
 won't really get much bang for your buck here (and that's even considering the $30 price tag) . 
   

 Graphically, Plane Crazy is pretty solid, though it will probably not blow anybody away. The hardware-accelerated 
 lighting effects are good. The overall look of most courses is decent, but there are far too many 
 giant wall textures (such as trees) . Also, on the Sin City Run course, there were a bunch of areas 
 where obstacles were absolutely, completely pitch black against the night sky (having slammed into 
 most of these, I felt like Yosemite Sam when Bugs Bunny bricked up that long dark tunnel) .  

 I suppose that some hard-core arcade racing game fans will enjoy Plane Crazy as a lively diversion 
 from the "hot rubber on asphalt" formula, but even that enjoyment is likely to wear thin in a hurry. 
 It's a shame really, because if not for the bizarre course design, Plane Crazy could have been 
 a truly unique and enjoyable game.

Review:  Plane Crazy is a plane version of a car racing game. First thing you have to do in Plane Crazy 
 is make a plane. There are 3 types of planes and 10 skins. After you're done making a plane you 
 choose a race you want to do and a map you want to race in. There are a few race types like quick 
 race, tournament, etc. There is a cool race type (i forgot what it called) where you fly around 
 the course by yourself, then on the second race you race yourself, kinda hard to explain. Anyway, 
 gameplay is ok, graphics suck , sound.... i have no idea, i forgot how the sound was cause i didn't 
 play this game for over 3 years, value... get this game for $5 - $10
