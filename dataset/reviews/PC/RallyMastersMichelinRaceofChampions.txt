:::Review:::
On the surface, Rally Masters has everything needed to be a first-rate simulation, but you'll find 
 that it can become frustrating on several different levels. 

 Swedish developer Digital Illusions has earned a strong reputation for delivering true-to-life arcade 
 action, from its outstanding line of pinball sims to the bent-for-hell racing mayhem in Motorhead. 
 And that fast-paced arcade-action heritage shines just a bit too brightly in Rally Masters: Michelin 
 Race of Champions, which will undoubtedly be compared to the brilliant Mobil 1 British Rally Championship. 
   

  On the surface, Rally Masters has everything needed to be a first-rate simulation: a ton of real-life 
 drivers and cars, a highly detailed reproduction of the Michelin Race of Champions track, real-world 
 locations for other events, and breathtaking scenery and car graphics. But if you dig deeper into 
 the game, you'll find that Rally Masters can become frustrating on several different levels. The 
 problems aren't necessarily enough to keep the game from being fun to play and pleasing to look 
 at, but they are enough to keep it from seriously challenging Mobil 1 British Rally Championship 
 as the leader in rally sims.   

  The game's main event is a re-creation of the 1999 Race of Champions, held in the Canary Islands 
 on a looped figure-eight track where the top finishers during the World Rally Championship season 
 go head-to-head in identical cars. Whoever wins a best-of-three match advances to the next round, 
 and the loser earns points that determine final standings. It's mildly disappointing that the quarter-finals 
 feature the same seven drivers as in the other races (while several drivers who competed in 1999 
 were omitted) , but since these aren't exactly household names for most players, it's not a big 
 deal.   

  What might take more getting used to is just how difficult it is to control a rally car screaming 
 down a looped, walled circuit. Such a design is probably great for the fans who fill the stands, 
 but it's so cramped compared with road rallying that it's easy to get flustered as you slide into 
 walls while the computer opponents navigate the track with amazing ease. Your best bet is simply 
 not to tackle this track until you're adept in the other events.   

  If you're having trouble in the Race of Champions, you probably don't want to practice by starting 
 in the championship mode - it's identical to the ROC but comprises events in six countries (Italy, 
 Sweden, Indonesia, USA, Great Britain, and the Canary Islands) . Just as with the ROC, all drivers 
 are given identical cars chosen at random, but here you're initially limited to Formula 2 cars. 
 If you win in that class, and you step up to WRC and finally to the Legend category, the cars become 
 faster and the opponents get more challenging along the way.   

  Perhaps the game's most interesting mode is the challenge cup, which is held on circuits in five 
 of the six countries featured in the Championship - only the Canary Islands aren't included. Again, 
 you're limited to F2 cars when you start out, and the competition begins with a quarter-final round 
 divided into two races - but this time you share the road with the competition. Place first or 
 second in the quarter-finals, and you advance to the semifinals against the top two finishers from 
 the other race.   

  Unfortunately, your starting position in the semis isn't affected by how well you do in the first 
 round: After crushing the opposition in a quarter-finals cup race, I found myself on the second 
 row behind the guy who came in second to me in the previous race. On top of that, he ran a whole 
 lot better in the semis than he did in the previous race, probably because the circuit is inexplicably 
 reversed the second time around (a significant detail that isn't mentioned in the manual) . Then, 
 if you reach the finals, you've got to race yet again on parallel tracks.    

 Finally, there's the trophy mode, which puts you on the road all by yourself to see how fast you 
 can finish each stage of a long and hazardous course - the kind of rallying you're probably used 
 to. Apparently this is the only mode that models car damage, but don't get too worried, because 
 it seems to be just for show. Even a head-on into a brick wall has a nominal effect on performance. 
 You'd have to be a true Harvey Wallbanger to have trouble making all the necessary repairs in the 
 allotted time at the end of certain stages.   

  You've got to admire Rally Masters for offering so many ways to race, as well as for providing 
 such gorgeous scenery to view while doing it, not to mention impressive effects like dust, smoke, 
 rain, and working front and rear lights. All cars look highly realistic, and though the damage 
 physics model isn't accurate at all, it's still nice to see cracked windshields and crumpled fenders 
 as a result of your car getting hit. It's possible that the damage was downplayed because the computer 
 opponents are incredibly aggressive even on the medium difficulty setting: If this game accurately 
 portrays rally racing, then Neal Bates, Jesus Puras, and other rally drivers must be certifiable 
 lunatics in real life.   

  Rally Masters' heavy focus on parallel circuits, its unrealistic damage modeling, and a console-style 
 menu design will grate on the nerves of some rally fans. For instance, just about every mode in 
 Rally Masters puts you in a random car. Mastering the handling and gear shifting of each car is 
 tough enough without having someone switching rides on you, and some cars just aren't as much fun 
 to drive. The manual does point out that you can select your car of choice in a single rally, but 
 it only works in the "one race" mode, not the "one event" mode. Furthermore, the lack of mouse 
 support for the in-game menus is a pain, because players who have steering wheel peripherals must 
 keep reaching over their rig to make menu choices or to adjust the response curve in hopes of achieving 
 better control.   

  In addition, Rally Masters' force-feedback support is very weak even when the settings are raised 
 to maximum feedback in the Windows control panel, and no attempt has been made to use the force 
 feedback to simulate the loss of traction. In fact, Rally Masters' braking system is suspect: It 
 brakes the tires, but it also reduces your RPMs.   

  Rally Masters features TCP/IP support for LAN and Internet play, as well as a nifty address book 
 that lets you store the IP addresses of servers where you can compete. Without any official online 
 matching service such as Mplayer or GameSpy, it'll be up to fans to create sites containing server 
 lists to download into the address book.   

  If you can find Rally Masters at a low price, then it can be a good addition to your library of 
 rally games - provided you're a fan of head-to-head racing on parallel circuits. However, if you're 
 looking for a full-blown rally simulation, don't expect this one to replace Mobil 1 British Rally 
 Championship.
