:::Review:::
Ghost in the Sheet may be more traditional than it first appears, but this spooky adventure still 
 offers challenging puzzles amid a creepy atmosphere. 

  Rotting in the ground might be a better way to spend the afterlife than the alternative proposed 
 in Ghost in the Sheet. This point-and-click adventure from Czech developer Cardboard Box Entertainment 
 assumes that cheap Halloween costumes got it right, as you spend eternity as a spook dressed up 
 in a white sheet. Challenging puzzles, a quirky sense of humor, and an atmosphere that veers between 
 cheese and chills make this one of the more intriguing cut-rate adventures to fly coach out of 
 Europe in the past couple of years.  

           Cutscene artwork is distinctive due to its stark, graphic-novel chic.      

  What 
 most stands out here is the bizarre storyline. You take the role of an anonymous man who's found 
 himself in a decidedly strange hereafter after being run down by a truck. A gruff, judgelike character 
 calling himself your boss tosses a sheet over your disembodied soul to keep you from blowing apart 
 and hands out marching orders for the Ghost Catching Organization. It seems that you've been drafted 
 into this unearthly civil service assigned to track down wayward ghouls who haven't properly shuffled 
 off their mortal coils. At present, a lot of these laggardly spirits can be found in an apparently 
 abandoned factory called Sector Omega, so you're shipped off to get the inside skinny on this rusty 
 old dump and free up more spectral drones for the afterworld workforce.  

  Most of this tale is weirder than the gameplay. As the game goes along, you acquire paranormal 
 powers that let you pick up items, push buttons, light darkened rooms, fire off electrical surges, 
 and generate gusts of wind. In short, you can do just about anything stereotypically ghostly aside 
 from yelling "Boo!" at credulous yokels, but you can't physically touch anything (which makes sense 
 as you're supposed to be a ghost, although you've got to wonder what's holding up that sheet) . 
 Despite the unconventional premise, virtually all the puzzles in Ghost in the Sheet involve traditional 
 adventure problems like figuring out how to open locked doors via manipulating objects or scrounging 
 up the clues needed to figure out codes or manipulate various control panels. You may be intangible, 
 but you're generally able to interact with environments just like the average Joe with a pulse 
 in the usual adventure game.  

  Specific puzzles can be pretty challenging, though, even if the game doesn't take much advantage 
 of the supernatural theme. Deducing codes requires some serious calculations at times, not just 
 picking up the usual scraps of paper. You need to have at least a minor affinity for math to make 
 it to the conclusion of the game. Set-piece logic puzzles deal with everything from playing musical 
 notes on a flute to interacting with intricate machinery. Object-oriented conundrums are centered 
 on close observation of the scenery, which necessitates more than a few eye-squinting pixel hunts 
 because much of the Sector Omega factory is a dingy maze. And you have to take part in a handful 
 of arcade-style minigames that involve tasks like smashing scurrying rats with bricks and leading 
 a rival ghost on a merry chase. Expect a good eight hours of sleuthing here.  

  Only bottom-drawer production values get between you and a ghostly good time. Cardboard Box Entertainment 
 is apparently a two-man operation, and boy, does it ever show. Storytelling cutscenes rely on chalkboard-style 
 sketches that depict the action with stark white lines on dark backdrops. The art is actually fairly 
 effective if your tastes lean to the sparse and surreal. Rooms in the factory are viewed by one 
 or two static camera angles that often obscure vital objects. Many scenes are so dark that it's 
 tough to immediately spot some crucial items. Getting lost is another issue. While Sector Omega 
 isn't huge, you can easily lose your way because the game frequently turns you around when you 
 enter a room due to unfriendly camera angles.  

           Say hello to one of the other spooks you encounter in Sector Omega.      

  Surprisingly 
 enough, the audio effects are quite good. Voice acting is as stilted and strange as you'd expect 
 considering the dialogue has been translated from the original Czech, yet it's still appropriate 
 for a game like this, in which nobody -- not even the player -- is supposed to know what's really going 
 on. The music is even better, with shrill strings keeping the tension high and underscoring key 
 moments in the story.  

  Old-fashioned despite the offbeat plot, Ghost in the Sheet is a predictable yet mostly fulfilling 
 adventure. It's ideal for point-and-click traditionalists looking for some spooky stuff with a 
 sense of humor.
