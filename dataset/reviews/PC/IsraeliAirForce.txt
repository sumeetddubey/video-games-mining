:::Review:::
As a worthy successor to Navy Fighters and ATF, it provides a sweeping selection of planes and mission 
 types for gamers looking for quick fun instead of painstaking realism. 

 It's all well and good to keep flying modern fight combat sims from the side of the Americans, but 
 let's face it: The Yanks haven't had a good, old-fashioned hot war in a long time. The Gulf wasn't 
 as much a fighter pilot's war as it was a fighter pilot's shooting gallery. But the Israelis and 
 their plucky air force are on the front lines all the time. Since the Six Day War in the 1960s, 
 the IAF has been racking up hundreds of kills and putting some of the hottest combat planes through 
 their paces.  

 Jane's Israeli Air Force takes on this untapped source. Developed by Pixel, IAF is the latest entry 
 in Jane's "soft sim" line. Unlike the hyper-real and quite complex Longbow and F-15, which model 
 single planes in great detail, IAF models seven fighters with less depth, much like ATF and Navy 
 Fighters. The result is a good mix of planes and action, with better-than-average flight modeling 
 for the upper-midrange sim market.  

 The seven planes in the IAF arsenal are the F-15C/D Falcon (known as the "Baz" to the IAF) , the 
 F-16D (two-seater) , F4E Phantom II, F-4 2000 Phantom, Kfir C7 (a low-cost, Israeli-built fighter) , 
 Lavi ATF multirole fighter, and the Mirage III. The MiG-23 and MiG-29 are also available for flying 
 in multiplayer mode and custom missions. The planes have unique cockpits and handling properties, 
 but systems and functions work using the same basic key layout, much like the other games in this 
 series.   

 Flight and weapons modeling are distinct for each plane, so that you feel the agility of the F-16 
 and the sophisticated power of the Lavi. The more advanced avionics controls and modeling that 
 hard-core flight sim hacks expect are not to be found here, but this is not that type of simulation. 
 Modeling is definitely a step above ATF and Navy Fighters, but still far short of F-15-level complexity, 
 and that's just fine. This type of sim is intended for fun and playability, and it delivers both 
 with a minimum of learning time and fuss.  

 There are plenty of opportunities to fly all of the IAF planes in the familiar Jane's array of gameplay 
 options. Forty-two hard-scripted missions are offered individually or in six campaigns covering 
 the Six Day War, Yom Kippur War, Lebanon War, and three hypothetical conflicts against Syria, Lebanon, 
 and Iraq. A set of eleven training missions, a quick-combat scramble option, and the standard Jane's 
 mission creator round out the scenario offerings. Missions are heavy on dogfighting, but there 
 are plenty of ground-strike opportunities as well, and most missions involve multiple wings where 
 you can chose air dominance, ground attack, or both. Eight-person multiplayer is stable and smooth 
 via modem, TCP/IP, and LAN, with player matching on Jane's Combatnet.   

 The problem with missions is that they can be tough and unforgiving. Briefings aren't always clear, 
 and too often you're required to perform a precise series of tasks in order to succeed. Missions 
 are either recorded as utter success or utter failure, and too many times missing one target means 
 failure. This problem becomes more pronounced due to one of the game's most touted features: the 
 ability to hop between cockpits and flights. The AI isn't all that sharp, and even though you can 
 control wingmen, you can't rely upon them to successfully fulfill all the mission parameters. This 
 means some missions have you leaping from one role to another in multiple replays in order to juggle 
 all the requirements needed for complete success. In single-player mode, this simply becomes too 
 much at times.  

 The graphics engine is effective at high altitudes, with terrain and structures looking fairly sharp. 
 Elevation data has been used to create accurate terrain data, so that low-level flying enables 
 you to use hills and canyons for masking. Unfortunately, the terrain breakup at these low altitudes 
 is pretty pronounced, with a fair amount of pixelization. As usual in a Jane's product, however, 
 object modeling is tops.  

 Despite some missions that require a little too much cockpit hopping, IAF plays quite well and provides 
 the right mix of flying challenge and accessible gameplay. As a worthy successor to Navy Fighters 
 and ATF, it provides a sweeping selection of planes and mission types for gamers looking for quick 
 fun instead of painstaking realism.

Review:  At first I didn't understand the point of the game, just fly around a bomb civilians in Lebanon 
 and Palestine? It didn't sound like much fun but then after I thought about it for a while I guess 
 it's a pretty realistic game.
  
  As far as gameplay goes it's pretty easy, I mean all the targets are civilian so they don't shoot 
 back. In one mission you bomb the main civilian airport in Beirut and then you have to hunt down 
 a US SIGINT ship called the USS Liberty. It's a fairly easy mission, after you strafe the boat 
 you can even call in torpedo boats to finish it off!!

Review:  This review was writtten in 2006 but referring to 1999 graphics and gamplay
  
  Even today in 2006 real soldiers of the Israeli Air Force (IAF) practice in this game. The 3D Simulator 
 shows the real power of one of the braviest Airforce in the world. If you never fly in a simulator 
 the game has a quick training mode that will let you know how to fly in less than a hour and that's 
 the perfect time to say that because this game is so realistic it's very hard aswell. Now after 
 we know to fly and use all your Aircraft weapons it's the time you will start to destroy targets 
 in Syria and Egypt. This mode allowing to you to do small missions around the map that contain 
 the whole israel with east Egypt and South Lebanon and Syria and all the terrain is actually a 
 spaceship photo so you cansee every place exactly but unfortunately just the targets the Aircrafts 
 and the Airbases are 3D and the rest is a 2D. The Next mode is a War. you can refight the 6 days 
 war the Yom Kipur War and more where the IAF destroy all whole Airforce od Syria and Egypt without 
 any casualties!!! then we have the Multiplayer where you and more 15 friends can play as Israel 
 or other army and fight. The multiplayer is a very fun mod lots of Co-op must have for win in the 
 TDM battles. Last but not least is the Creating War mod. Simply just put the bad guys on the map 
 where ever you want put Some AA guns and create how do you want your war where the sky is the limit!
 
  
  For people who wants a very realistic simulator and not really care about graphic and fun and want 
 to feel how a real pilot feel i would recommend this game even today in 2006
