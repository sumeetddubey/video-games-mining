:::Review:::
This game will leave you with a strong sense of dja vu. 

 The Romance of the Three Kingdoms games were always a little rough-hewn, but managed to succeed 
 nonetheless because of their depth and content. They offered sweeping strategy gaming set in the 
 politically charged atmosphere of China's Warring Kingdoms epoch, with a rich cast of characters 
 and solid gameplay. In each, you played leader of a kingdom, responsible for raising and equipping 
 armies, capturing other cities, increasing the wealth and happiness of your citizens, and forging 
 alliances with other leaders, each with their own unique characters. The goal is to bend all of 
 China under your yoke.  

 The series pretty much hit its stride with the third release; Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV: 
 Wall of Fire pushes it a little further than it needs to go, for a number reasons. Frankly, the 
 interface was never great, and Koei has only made it more cumbersome and confusing by piling on 
 a heap of new details. This is exacerbated tenfold by the total lack of printed documentation or 
 even the most basic tutorials. The help functions are poorly written, and doping out the commands 
 is an exercise in futility, even for people familiar with the previous games.  

 The native Windows support is nice, but adds little more than slightly movable windows. Graphics 
 are better this time around, but still aren't up to contemporary standards. Castle sieges are really 
 the only positive element: Little armies place little ladders on your castle and attempt to scale 
 the walls as you fend them off. It's nifty, but hardly enough to carry the day.   

 In the end, this game will leave you with a strong sense of dja vu. You've played Romance of the 
 Three Kingdoms, in better incarnations, already; there's not much reason to play it again.

Review:  This game has quite a bit of depth and had some cool cutscenes (for the day... this was the mid 
 1990s) ... also, one COULD get immersed in the action.... sure, the AI wasn't too strong (again, the 
 mid 1990s) , but it was still cool being able to design your own character and put it in the game, 
 along with the general ancient Chinese flavor of the game... I also liked the relationship between 
 characters and the very 'ying-yang' idea of giving said characters (generals) a personality number 
 from 0 to 360... however, if you had a 2, this was very close to a 359, thus forming a circle relationship 
 as things often are in real life (I don't know of a game that has done this since) ... I still own 
 it and have fond memories....
