:::Review:::
The Gathering Storm adds a good deal of new content to play through: six massive single-player campaign 
 games and a whopping 30 additional scenarios. But not much else. 

 The Heroes of Might and Magic strategy series is famous for its colorful graphics, engaging turn-based 
 strategy, and, to a lesser extent, its continuous expansion packs and its repackaged compilations. 
 When Heroes of Might and Magic IV -- the latest chapter in the series -- was released earlier this 
 year, it caused a great deal of controversy among loyal Heroes fans, since it made many changes 
 to the series' basic formula and shipped to retail without multiplayer support, in spite of the 
 fact that it was still an enjoyable game on its own merits. And the latest expansion pack for Heroes 
 IV, The Gathering Storm, adds a good deal of new content to play through: six massive single-player 
 campaign games and a whopping 30 additional scenarios. But not much else.           The expansion 
 adds six massive new campaigns and lots of new scenarios...    

  If you're familiar with the series, you'll know that each of the Heroes games has been a colorful, 
 fantasy-themed, turn-based strategy game in which you explore huge maps with an army of monsters 
 in search of treasures and artifacts, as well as enemies to fight in order to make your hero characters 
 wealthier and more powerful. In this regard, The Gathering Storm offers more of the same in the 
 form of six single-player campaigns that should take most players many, many hours to complete. 
 Five of the game's campaigns are immediately available, and the sixth and final campaign may be 
 unlocked only when the previous five have been completed, but among themselves, they offer a good 
 mix of the series' traditional challenges: conquering maps with only a small starting army, exploring 
 a map with a lone hero, and engaging in explore-and-conquer missions in which you have an established 
 hero and must take over your enemies' strongholds. The expansion also has an impressive 30 new 
 single scenarios to play through, which should be enough to keep any Heroes fan busy for some time. 
   

  However, the game's box suggests that the expansion also has new creatures, new heroes, new items, 
 and a new editor, which is a bit misleading. Yes, The Gathering Storm has new items and new event 
 buildings you can find on the map. Yet the only new heroes you'll find in the game are those you 
 play as in the campaigns, and the only new creatures in the game are those that belong to the game's 
 main villain; they can't normally be recruited into your own ranks. And although The Gathering 
 Storm has an updated map editor that includes the new items, buildings, and creatures, as well 
 as all of the existing items from Heroes IV, your maps can be used only by players who also own 
 the expansion -- players who own only Heroes IV can't use them, so if you use the expansion's map 
 editor to make new maps, and you play Heroes IV regularly with a group of friends, everyone else 
 will have to buy and install the expansion too.   

  Otherwise, The Gathering Storm doesn't offer much in the way of audio or visual refinement over 
 Heroes IV. In fact, it doesn't offer any. At a glance, it's difficult to tell the difference between 
 The Gathering Storm and the original Heroes IV because the expansion has no truly significant, 
 different-looking additions, like a new playable faction. Instead, The Gathering Storm has the 
 same monsters, same interface, same special effects, and same animations from Heroes IV. The game's 
 battles still take place on isometric battlefields between prerendered enemies that move and fight 
 with an odd stop-motion camera-like blur effect. And even though the expansion is said to have 
 some new music, you'll rarely if ever hear it; most of the time, you'll be listening to the same 
 operatic and symphonic themes you've already heard in Heroes IV, which are as grandiose and as 
 overbearing as ever.           ... but not much more. Everything else is pretty much the same as 
 Heroes IV.    

  The Gathering Storm also features the Heroes IV multiplayer patch, which was released some time 
 ago. The patch lets players play online via a LAN, direct TCP/IP connection, or through a third-party 
 application. As you might expect from a turn-based game, playing a multiplayer game of Heroes IV 
 can be time-consuming, even though you can limit the amount of time each player is allowed per 
 turn.   

  If you had only a casual interest in the Heroes series, and you weren't especially enchanted by 
 Heroes IV to begin with, you may want to think twice about getting the expansion, since it's really 
 just more of the same -- though to be fair, it's quite a bit more. On the other hand, if you're a 
 serious fan of Heroes IV, you've probably already bought and installed The Gathering Storm because 
 of its new items and event buildings and updated map editor. And if you consider yourself to be 
 at least something of a fan of the series, you'll probably want to pick up the expansion to try 
 out the new campaigns and scenarios and also to be able to download and play the new custom-built 
 maps that other devoted fans will make with the expansion's editor.

Review:  When you read the back of its box cover, HoMM IV: The Gathering Storm sounds pretty unexciting 
 for an expansion due to its lack of any solid new features, but it actually packs one of the best 
 features of this trilogy set - the campaign layout.
  
  The first Heroes IV game had six maps where there's no inter-relationships, so basically it's six 
 mini campaigns. Thus the only kick comes from the graphics makeover and the hero unit feature, 
 whereas this first expansion did it right by uniting the six maps in a way that it gets a real 
 climatic gameplay experience at endgame. Yes, it's sort of an overdone and cliche thing where each 
 map had a main hero that levels up into an obscenely godly walking tank and collects artifact pieces 
 to beef themselves up even more and meet together at the final map for some serious butt-kicking. 
 Take a read again at my previous sentence. This is the reason why I enjoyed it so much. Heroes 
 IV presented us a new gameplay idea (heroes as participating units) and this expansion further 
 abused the formula, and I think it works.

Review:  Heroes of Might and Magic IV was okay, it definitely wasn't my favorite game in the series and 
 this expansion didn't change my mind as it didn't really add anything of any importance aside from 
 some campaigns.
  
  The campaigns in The Gathering Storm take on a similar approach as the ones found in the second 
 Heroes III expansion The Shadow of Death . In TGS' campaigns you take on the role of a particular 
 hero in each campaign, and they finally unite to defeat a common foe in the final campaign. That's 
 the extent of the story, I'm afraid.
  
  There's also some new scenarios to extend the life of the game, but there was still no random map 
 generator added which was disappointing. Still, the new scenarios weren't bad.
  
  There's a new structure type (and a version for each faction) in The Gathering Storm, but those 
 and the campaigns are all that's new in this expansion. If you didn't like Heroes IV, then stay 
 away there's nothing of note that'll save Heroes IV in your eyes here.
