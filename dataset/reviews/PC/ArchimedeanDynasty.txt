Archimedean Dynasty gives computer gaming a good name even when you don't know what the hell is 
 going on. 

 Archimedean Dynasty is the kind of game that automatically makes you long for the extended weekend, 
 the random holiday, the traffic-paralyzing blizzard, the three-day flu, or perhaps the odd death 
 in the family - anything to justify staying away from school, work, or other responsibilities long 
 enough for a serious immersion into an onscreen world.   

 Set in an ugly, nasty, dystopian future, Archimedean Dynasty can be seen as the aftermath of a high-speed 
 collision between Waterworld and SeaQuest, with a dash of the optimistic cheer found in Blade Runner: 
 The Big One has come and gone, and the endless exchanges of nukes have taken their toll, melting 
 a third of the icecaps and flooding horrifying portions of terra firma, just in time for the nuclear 
 winter to set in and render it all uninhabitable. Those determined to survive have fled beneath, 
 to the cold, dark oceans. No ray of light can penetrate the stratospheric debris of the Last War, 
 and even if it could, it wouldn't penetrate the "Biogenic" - the 40-meter-thick layer of dead organic 
 crud (!) sealing the oceans in their eternal night. Welcome to Aqua, the only world left on earth, 
 and have a nice freakin' day.  

 Part adventure game, part combat sim, and all ugly, Archimedean Dynasty gives computer gaming a 
 good name even when you don't know what the hell is going on. You take the role of a tough undersea 
 mercenary, recently rescued from a botched escort job during which your charge was hijacked. Lucky 
 to come out of the debacle with your butt intact, you turn up desperate for work at one of the 
 many undersea cities which form the world known as Aqua. Your name precedes you, sort of, but you 
 don't have a ship anymore, and have to start at the bottom - literally - taking garbage/salvage 
 duty or any other crap job that will let you accumulate enough money to buy a serious combat sub 
 and get back into the hired gun business.   

 The game sports a vast world in which the player's immediate goals are not always clear. With each 
 person you talk to - via a simple select-an-answer interface - there comes a careful choice of 
 how you present yourself. Be a big enough ass and you may alienate the wrong people... but be a 
 little too nice, a little too soft, and your "sea cred" may plummet. Eventually, you will be able 
 to work yourself up to a respectable combat craft.  

 Point-of-view combat and undersea action are the other half of Archimedean Dynasty, and they constitute 
 the links between the undersea cities and installations you will encounter; while the "cityside" 
 adventure-style dealings (with over 100 characters) is where you do all your talkin', the real-time 
 navigation/combat is where you do your walkin'. In other words, knowing that you need to get to 
 City X to talk to Contact Y about Benefit Z is one thing, but actually getting there alive is another. 
 The various types of craft you may eventually pilot can employ some 30 different types of customizable 
 weapons (torpedoes, turrets, bombs, etc.) , and if the pirates, governments, and competing mercenaries 
 don't mess up your plans, the considerations of currents, radioactive areas, and sonic countermeasures 
 (the properties of "noise" that draw torpedoes to targets) just might. Long stretches of serene, 
 unoccupied ocean will suddenly give way to pockets of warcraft lurking in the depths. The combat 
 scheme fully illustrates the way many have summed up, in many different words, the essence of oceanic 
 and/or space combat: "Six months of boredom followed by 60 seconds of stark, screaming terror." 

 In all honesty, the mind-boggling array of tactical options and general open-endedness of the game's 
 objectives will be very confusing to some players - not to mention the fact that the people who 
 were responsible for outlining the player's objectives should be lined up against a wall and cream-pied 
 - but it's this very open-endedness which makes Archimedean Dynasty so absorbing. From the opening 
 movie, you'll know that this game is deadly serious, a sort of undersea film noir with a cyberpunk 
 edge, and despite the respectable manuals (on weapon types, Aqua history, and combat tactics) , 
 it's tempting to believe that if you're not sure what's going on, it's your own fault. (Note to 
 Blue Byte: An interactive primer for undersea navigation and combat basics would have been nice, 
 guys.) If you're a Serious, Frowning Gamer who delights in conquering challenges just to prove 
 you can, coming across Archimedean Dynasty will be like finding a fat unclaimed wallet in the street. 
 On the other hand, if your idea of a challenge encompasses Street Fighter in any form whatsoever, 
 stay the hell away from Archimedean Dynasty; you'll only hurt yourself.

Review:  Space sim genre has many good games, from Freepace to Tie Fighter, Privateer to Freelancer. Though 
 Archimedian Dynasty's universe is set underwater, it plays most like space sims. The storyline 
 is not one of the strong aspects of the game. After an apocalyptic nuclear war, humans have to 
 live under the seas. The setting is a mixture of Mad Max and any pirate movie. This is may be the 
 billionth game I've played with the unknown race threat story, it's not so original. But Archimedean 
 Dynasty takes the best parts of the best games in the genre: A Tie Fighter-like mission design, 
 Wing Commander-like game design, Freespace like atmosphere (where you don't mind sacrificing yourself 
 for your friends) and a little commerce. The graphics were really good at that time, especially 
 after the 1.20 patch (which added transparent explosions) . If you had a 3dfx card, it was even 
 better. Also, the underwater setting gave the producers an advantage over the the games relatives 
 that are set in space: Underwater currents could really affect torpedoes so you had to think twice 
 and learn the environment before firing one (if you don't want to spend your torpedoes you bought 
 with hard earned cash that is) . Though its successors (Aquanox series) lacked the quality and atmosphere 
 of this one, Archimedean Dynasty is an absolute classic. If you value atmosphere over the technology, 
 it's worth playing even today.

Review:  I still remember the day when I got it. I was still a kid, back in that long gone 1997.
  Local game store had only one copy of it and apparently no one wanted to buy even that one. Since 
 I had little gaming experience than and was looking for any game to kill my time (and it was very 
 cheap) , I bought it... Best gaming move in my life!
  
  Came home, installed it and began playing. First impression: 'nice graphics!' (compared to sidescrollers 
 and top-down sport games I played most of the time) . One hour passed, two, three... The game got 
 me locked!
  
  Story is incredibly immersing, which has you on the edge all the time and wanting to play just 
 that one more minute to see what happens next. 5 different, pilotable submarines and hundreds of 
 weapons and upgrades for them make sure you never get bored with same old stuff. Large variety 
 of enemies and unique missions constantly test your submarine piloting skills. Great graphics and 
 music (dark, techno tunes) make for perfect apocalyptic atmosphere. And it all culminates with 
 a truly epic ending!
  
  10 years later, I still play it. In fact, I played it every year since I got, just to remind myself 
 of this truly unique masterpiece. And I will continue to do so.
