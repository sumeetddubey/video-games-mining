:::Review:::
The New York Times Crossword Puzzles is an electronic compilation of many of the hard-copy books 
 you can get of these famous crosswords. 

 Anyone who's worked in a large corporate office environment knows that the best way to start the 
 morning is to get the team together and solve the New York Times crossword puzzle over coffee. 
 Trouble is, it'd often take half the morning to complete, and you'd need to call on as many resources 
 as possible, both human and literary, to complete it.   

  The New York Times Crossword Puzzles for your PC is an electronic compilation of many of the hard-copy 
 books you can get of these famous crosswords. The game is very bare bones. It includes around 1,000 
 puzzles (about two and a half years' worth) , which are easily sortable. Anyone who's become hooked 
 on NY Times crosswords knows that the puzzles start out easy on Monday and get progressively harder, 
 until the nightmare, double-sized Sunday puzzle. The sorting engine lets you pick which day of 
 the week you want, solve puzzles in order, just try all the Monday puzzles, or whatever your brain 
 is in the mood for. You can also save your partially completed puzzles, which is especially handy 
 for those tricky Thursday-through-Sunday games.   

  Beyond that, the gameplay is exactly as you'd expect. Compared with other crossword puzzle games, 
 the developers have added several features to make playing easier. You can zoom in on a particular 
 section so you can see the words more easily. When you're typing in your letters, the game lets 
 you know right away if you've got the correct answer - letters are X'ed if they're incorrect. Unfortunately, 
 it's all too easy to get help with a letter or word. Two large, shiny buttons in the menu at the 
 top let you get a letter or word whenever you want. It's tough to stay away from those cheats when 
 they're so tempting to use.   

  The game lets you customize the color of your puzzle in several different ways. It can be difficult 
 to see your letters in the puzzle when they're just black on a grey background. However, when you 
 change the color of your letters, you also change the color of the numbers on the puzzle, which 
 really doesn't help you see what you're doing. After playing around with what I thought were some 
 helpful contrasting colors, I ended up just going back to the default colors and zooming in on 
 the areas I was working on.   

  The final feature of the game, if you can call it a feature in today's paperless world, is that 
 you can print out your puzzles to take on the road with you. Though why you haven't just loaded 
 the game on your laptop is beyond me - takeoff and landing, maybe? If you're desperate for the 
 printed version, you'd do better to buy a hard-copy compilation or two for half the price of this 
 already inexpensive game.   

  Don't get me wrong, if you love the New York Times crosswords, you'll like this game. It's easy 
 to use for the most part, and it has a wide range of puzzles. In fact, what with so much attention 
 being paid to massively multiplayer games, 3D graphics, and other mind-blowing PC game features, 
 you may well find this game simple and refreshing by comparison.
