:::Review:::
While the changes to Uprising 2 are notable and (for the most part) positive, the game still manages 
 to underwhelm because of some seemingly minor flaws. 

 The original Uprising was something new and unique. It melded first-person action with real-time 
 strategy to provide fast-paced, addictive gameplay that kept most of us locked in despite the game's 
 shortcomings. The sequel, Uprising 2: Lead and Destroy, is basically an enhanced version of the 
 original, with several gameplay and interface modifications that make the game more approachable 
 (and less frustrating) . While the changes to Uprising 2 are notable and (for the most part) positive, 
 the game still manages to underwhelm because of some seemingly minor flaws.  

 Once again, you pilot the powerful Wraith command tank. Instead of fighting other humans in a desperate 
 revolution, however, you're fighting against a ruthless horde of DNA-harvesting aliens called the 
 Trich. Fortunately, these guys are easier to identify on the battlefield than the human troops 
 in Uprising. The foot soldiers and the vehicles are very angular and dark, making them easy to 
 pick out from your own troops.  

 The game includes 36 missions, 28 of which are split into three minicampaigns. These campaigns can 
 be played separately or in one continuous string. The missions are not completely linear, but because 
 the game relies heavily on its plot, they are more structured than those in Uprising. The remaining 
 eight missions are designed to be played as single scenarios. Actually, you can play any one of 
 the 36 missions as a single scenario, which is a neat feature but one that can certainly spoil 
 some of the campaign plot points.  

 Gameplay is very much like the original Uprising. You drive around the battlefield, claiming citadel 
 locations and assembling bases to harvest energy and produce military units. When you encounter 
 enemy forces, you can go at them in your Wraith and call in your units for support. The landscapes 
 are nicely rendered and show a lot of variety, thanks in part to the planet-hopping theme of the 
 campaigns. In other words, each planet has a unique look and feel, so although most have the same 
 landscape features (hills, valleys, and lakes) they each at least have a different palette.  

 
 In fact, the graphics for the game are quite stunning. The sky effects deserve special mention 
 as they are some of the best I've seen this side of Unreal. Also, the game features some nice weather 
 effects and includes both day and night missions, which helps keep things interesting. Units and 
 buildings are well modeled and are generally easy to identify in the heat of combat. Still, the 
 graphics in Uprising get dinged for two significant reasons. First, they support 3Dfx Glide only 
 for 3D acceleration. That means no Direct3D, which means no Riva TNT or any other non-3Dfx board 
 for that matter. This is simply inexcusable. Second, even with dual Voodoo2 cards in a Pentium 
 II 450 system (with the rendering distance set to maximum) , the game still showed a lot of "gray 
 wall" distance rendering problems. For example, enemy aircraft circling a distant base would appear 
 out of gray haze for a second then vanish into thin air. Even right near my own base, if I turned 
 to look from one end of the base to the next, I couldn't always see my own citadel tower - even 
 though I could see the hills behind it. Now that's just plain wrong. One other minor gripe: I frequently 
 found myself hung up on invisible barriers, having to back up and strafe from side to side until 
 I could pull myself free.  

 On the positive side, Cyclone has streamlined the interface quite a bit, and a helpful, color-coded 
 targeting system helps you pick out the good guys from the bad. Also, you no longer have to manage 
 that cryptic power triangle. Some hard-core types may be miffed at this, but not having to worry 
 about my tank's power allocation sure did make things simpler.  

 Which leads us to the next negative point: Whereas the original Uprising was a bit too difficult 
 in some areas, this game is too easy. For starters, you can dumb down the difficulty to a point 
 where you can practically win the game with nothing but your Wraith. This will make the game more 
 approachable to newcomers and is a welcome change from the original, but it seems as if the developers 
 went too far when they added the AI suggestion feature. This option lets you rely on the computer 
 to perform the next recommended action - such as fortifying a new citadel - without your help. 
 The problem? This feature simply makes the game far too easy. It is optional, however, so you can 
 avoid it if you choose.  

 What you can't avoid are the contrived and predictable mission designs and the feeling that you've 
 been there and done that far too many times. Many of the missions are repetitive, and the task 
 of building base after base after base gets old in a hurry. Also, the artificial barriers that 
 block certain parts of certain maps got to be pretty annoying. If I'm stupid enough to venture 
 into a seriously dangerous part of the map too early in a mission, let me learn that on my own. 
 Often I found myself going through the motions to win a mission, rather than getting emotionally 
 charged as I faced new obstacles. In short, I just didn't care very much about what I was doing 
 in Uprising 2.  

 On a lighter note, the sound effects are quite good in Uprising 2, especially when you decide to 
 run down those infantry units foolish enough to stand in your way. The music is also quite good, 
 and the varying themes really set the mood before, during, and after a mission.  

 Multiplayer support has been beefed up, with a maximum of eight players now (as opposed to Uprising's 
 four) . The game will be available via Heat. net and mplayer. com and also provides support for native 
 IP, IPX, modem, and direct serial links.  

 If you simply compare the game with the original Uprising, it looks pretty damn good - and make 
 no mistake, Uprising 2 is a fun game. The problem is that Uprising 2 lacks the unique flavor of 
 the original and does very little that we haven't seen before. While some of the first game's flaws 
 have been addressed, Uprising 2 adds a few of its own to the mix. In the end, we're still talking 
 about a very good game but one that seems as if it could have so easily been a great one.
