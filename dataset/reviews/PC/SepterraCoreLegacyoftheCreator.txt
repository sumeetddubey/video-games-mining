:::Review:::
It's got some interesting characters, a user-friendly interface, and an intriguing magic system, 
 but it gets bogged down by both minor and major problems. 

 Septerra Core isn't enthralling or flashy, and for the most part, its reliance on Japanese console 
 role-playing conventions of games like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy doesn't allow it to be 
 particularly original. It's got some interesting characters, a user-friendly interface, and an 
 intriguing magic system, but it gets bogged down by both minor and major problems.  

 The game itself takes place in the anime-style sci-fi/fantasy hybrid world of Septerra; a world 
 not unlike that of Hayao Miyazaki's anime Nausicaa: Valley of the Wind or Square's Final Fantasy 
 VII. Septerra is a seven-layered planet across which magic spells and machine guns are equally 
 common. The main character Maya leads the relatively peaceful life of a junk scavenger on Shell 
 2 until she finds herself embroiled in a plot that endangers the entire world. Maya and her friends 
 must race down through the layers, or "shells," of the world in order to stop a power-hungry warlord 
 from seizing the ancient power of the core. Throughout her travels, she encounters space pirates, 
 cyborgs, magi, and giant insects and allies herself with swordsmen, gearheads, bounty hunters, 
 a mutant, and a robotic dog.  

 The story itself is fairly complex and involves a good deal of character interaction. Though the 
 game takes place on an alien world filled with exotic creatures, locations, and people, none of 
 it ever seems hopelessly arcane, since information is constantly laid out before you in the form 
 of not-so-subtle dialogue hints. Each of Maya's eight companions is also fairly interesting, and 
 in a few specific cases they'll actually attack each other, though you can eventually resolve their 
 differences by completing optional side quests. As with Chrono Trigger, you can have a maximum 
 of three characters in your party at a time; so at different points in the game, you'll have the 
 option to customize your party with different characters depending on the situation.  

 Septerra Core's visuals aren't nearly as good as its story. It runs at a maximum resolution of 640x480, 
 which is a shame because the low resolution doesn't do justice to the colorful and beautifully 
 crafted backgrounds. Though these flat 2D backdrops don't benefit from bump-mapping, lightsourcing, 
 or other fancy technical effects, they're varied, detailed, and generally look quite nice.  

 Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the poorly animated character and portrait graphics. 
 The rendered character models suffer from a sheer lack of frames of animation; as a result, they 
 walk, run, move, and fight with an unflatteringly jerky stiffness that clashes with the detailed 
 backgrounds. The rendered speech portraits are similarly jarring; speaking characters' faces are 
 fully animated in order to express emotion, and they're effective in some cases - but much of the 
 time, they resemble nothing more than second-rate claymation.  

 Fortunately, Septerra Core sounds better than it looks. For the most part, there are two instances 
 in which music plays: on the overland map and in combat. In either case, all of it is appropriate, 
 even if none of it is particularly memorable. However, the spoken dialogue and sound effects are 
 far more distinct, even if they aren't uniformly good. Septerra Core's voice acting is inconsistent; 
 at times, it's downright horrible, though much of it is passable, and some of it is truly superb. 
 Also, sound effects like the swinging of swords and staves and the spouting of toxic chemicals 
 from mutant monsters are subdued, while gunfire, explosions, and laser blast effects are all suitably 
 loud and clear. Septerra Core has a few other good points. One of these is the excellent exploration 
 interface. Moving your characters couldn't be easier: All you need to do is click once on the desired 
 destination to send them there, and you can even double-click to make them run. You can also hold 
 down the mouse button to lead them manually, which comes in handy for scouting unknown areas and 
 avoiding unwanted combat. In addition, while exploring a town, a dungeon, or the overland map, 
 all of your healing items and keys can be called up at any time simply by scrolling the mouse cursor 
 to the bottom of the screen. And the inventory screen, which houses every important game option, 
 like saving and loading games, examining and equipping your characters, and using items, is just 
 one click away.  

 Septerra Core's magic spell system is easily its most interesting feature. Many special abilities 
 and all magic spells expend "core power," Septerra Core's equivalent of spell points. Each party 
 member has a different amount of core points he contributes to the party's pool; the larger the 
 pool, the more special abilities and magical spells available to all. Spells themselves are cast 
 with magical "fate" cards, which can be found in treasure chests or after defeating key enemies. 
 Each of these 22 cards can be used individually or with other cards to produce powerful effects. 
 Most notable of these is the summon card, which when used with other cards conjures up gigantic 
 creatures and deities to attack your enemies in an obvious homage to Final Fantasy VII's spectacularly 
 absurd summon spells. Unfortunately, the stilted animation and low resolution of Septerra Core's 
 summon combinations still can't hold a candle to the blocky, bloated demons and dragons of Final 
 Fantasy VII's already-aged graphics engine.  

 But for all its apparent strengths, Septerra Core's almost completely linear structure makes for 
 a terrible weakness. Casting spells, talking to the locals, and admiring the scenery may seem fun, 
 but this enjoyment is nearly always short-lived, as you'll eventually find yourself at an impasse. 
 At this point, you'll be forced to wander about in search of the red key, the desert hermit, the 
 switch that will open the graveyard gate, or some other key item or encounter that will let you 
 progress. Even if you decide not to explore your surroundings, the structure of the story forces 
 you to backtrack to locations you've already visited - and this invariably means fighting monsters 
 along the way.  

 And fighting monsters is without a doubt the worst thing about Septerra Core. It's true that none 
 of the scripted encounters is especially tough to beat, and each is well paced with respect to 
 the level of your enemies and your party members. And most other encounters aren't that tough, 
 either; your party will rarely if ever be completely outclassed by standard monsters, and if it 
 is, you can usually hole up in the nearest town, rest in the inn, and try to gain a few levels 
 against easier foes before trying again. In the case of these regular encounters, it's actually 
 sometimes possible to avoid combat altogether by guiding your party around enemies, since most 
 enemies are clearly visible on the map.  

 Unfortunately, all encounters - scripted or not - use the same thoroughly tedious interface. The 
 actual combat uses a modified version of the Final Fantasy "timed turns" system: Each character 
 has three time segments in his turn, which fill up slowly in real time. Characters can perform 
 different actions depending on how many segments they decide to let fill. For the most part, only 
 weak attacks and minor abilities may be used if a single time segment is used, though a character 
 can use his most powerful attack if you wait long enough. The problem is that you have absolutely 
 no control over the flow of time in combat. Combat requires absolutely nothing in the way of reflexes 
 or hand-eye coordination and very little in the way of strategic anticipation. In addition, you 
 can't speed it up, nor do you have the option to switch to a completely turn-based system.  

 Instead, you sit and wait... and wait... and wait until your character gets his next turn. What's 
 worse is that every single attack takes an inordinate amount of time to execute. After sitting 
 and waiting for your character, you must then sit and wait while he makes a slow, poorly animated 
 leap toward his opponent, then performs his slow, poorly animated attack, then makes another slow, 
 poorly animated leap back to his place in the ranks. With the exception of projectile attacks such 
 as rifle shots or lasers, each of your characters and nearly all monsters in the game go through 
 this agonizingly wearisome process every single round of every single combat - and there isn't 
 a thing you can do to change it. Even retreating from battle is slow, as each character must individually 
 turn to flee (and must therefore wait at least one time segment in order to act) . And even then, 
 each of your enemies will be able to launch a slow, poorly animated attack as you try to run. Don't 
 be deceived by the ease of most of Septerra Core's fights or by the fact that you can sometimes 
 avoid your enemies on the map. You'll be doing plenty of fighting even if you aren't out for experience 
 points and money, since Septerra Core's linear structure inevitably forces you to return to the 
 monster-infested maps you thought you left behind.  

 Septerra Core has a number of things going for it: Some of it looks good, some of it sounds good, 
 and some of it plays well. Unfortunately, no matter how appealing any of it may seem at any point 
 in play, Septerra Core's rigidly linear structure and reprehensible combat system unequivocally 
 rear their ugly heads and weaken what could have been a better game.

Review:  This is an older game. But a classic.
  Graphics. 8.0
  I am judging these graphics by the time it was released. And for the time these graphics were well 
 done. It was like a proper mix between Final fantasy 7 and Diablo. I loved it and I'm sure you 
 will to if you were gaming during that time and still love that style. The world is well designed 
 giving you a feeling of exploration that many games now forget about. 
  My only complain is that only the main characters look good.. everyone else is DOG ugly.
  Sound 
 7.8
  The sound is good....... but there isn't much of it... besides battle themes and a few tracks the 
 game is pretty much silent minus effects.... but the effects are really well done so it makes up 
 for it. Plus the main Character's voice acting is very good as is most of the rest of the cast.
 
  Gameply. 9.0
  Innovative. Like I said its like a mix of ff7 and Diablo. The game flows nicely with most of the 
 adventure exploration of towns and ect unraveling like a point n click game but the battle system 
 is very ff7 with turn based battles and limit breaks with summons and more. Did I mention I loved 
 this game.
  Story 9.0
  This story is the basic cyber/steam punk spill but it feels very smooth. The world is something 
 that you would actually want to visit and would make an even better mmo today that half of what 
 we play. The story has a few twists and turns near the end but the characters and their interaction 
 is what really makes the story worth it. 
  Everyone should check this game out if you love rpg's and you can.... if you can find it..... sigh

Review:  The game is a bit buggy in some places, I'll admit had a bug that stopped me progressing towards 
 one of the final stages of the game. But ultimately I've found it a fun game. 
  
  The story and world which Septerra core is set in are both incredibly well written and portrayed 
 - a definite must for any Science Fiction fans. The characters are interesting with some good dialogue 
 between them. It's rare that a game of today took me into this world as quickly as Septerra Core 
 has. Its a classic.
  
  The magic/combat system is interesting and easy to understand if not quite challenging at times. 
 Sometimes rather infuriating but with the right amount of patience pretty much everything can be 
 overcame.
  
  The puzzles are rather straight forward but you will find you will need to think of who you bring 
 along to certain areas as they trigger different dialogue sequences or aspects of the game to advance. 
 
  
  Look out for patches, their bound to be online if you have any problems

Review:  I played this game long ago, my first RPG or close to it and got it almost for free, from a magazine 
 I bought. This game is incredible immersive. The atmosphere was unbeliaveble.
  
  I admit I never finished this game, but this was a game I wish I had, just for memory's sake. Its 
 a special game, in a special period, so its hard to criticise it, even tough it does might have 
 areas to be.
  
  There was hard times in the game where I remember getting stuck in the progress, not only one time, 
 because you often needed to have one certain character to pass trought. I don't mind now. So, its 
 a RPG with a little bit of good puzzle elements, something that would happen for any real adventure 
 at some momement, were you need to find/fix something, or manage to enter some place by another 
 method.
  
  First off, this game have Maya, your main character that is very charismatic, and so much, that 
 I could compare her to characters like Sonic for exemple. She have a good visual, nice cloths and 
 that amazingly always upgradable weapon of hers. By that time I didn't knew much english to understand 
 all in the the intro and story, but it have a good and atmopheric intro, eveything in this game 
 is very well done in terms of atmosphere. The intro was very misterious, with interesting characters 
 in it that you wouldn't know but sound powerfull, and they have some discussions. This game have 
 a unique style, really, very unique.
  
  I don't have exact memories of the game now, just instances. You begin in a city, where there are 
 stores to buy weapons and cores I think, I remember the stores interiors being pretty nice. Soon 
 you get to know a second character that is a good inventor, and have a huge robot dog. Now thinking 
 of it today, I think Valve copied the robot dog idea from this game when making Half Life2 if they 
 didn't had it on the first. But anyway, returning to a great game, after you leave the city to 
 head to the investors house that was your friend seems like you help him fix the dog or something. 
 The dog is a powerfull party member I remember. From the beggning has you advance a little, I record 
 going trough a desert place with lots of scorpions, they were hard for me at that time. Every ambient, 
 like crossing the scorpions in the desert, felt solid and balanced on the gameplay in a way you 
 should be carefull, but you was always free has you could get stronger if you want to, but at some 
 moments wasn't possible yet; maybe you should advance first to make you weapon better, maybe wait 
 some companion or find a better place. But you were free.
  
  The combat mechanics are just like final fantasy if you are wondering. These old school RPG games 
 were very enterteining, they for exemple, didn't put limits on you. Monsters could respawn, and 
 you had the choice keep leveling if you want to and even colect itens. I remember one time I kept 
 killing zombies till I filled my bag with the precious bread. I could do it all day if I had to, 
 I was immersed with the game, my party, the character and their cause, even without knowing exacly 
 what was ocurring. I could understand a bit, about the worlds and etc, but some things were confusing 
 (not like a bad thing) and very surreal. There were these huge ships and their world was almost 
 destroyed, many places were junky and desert. The worlds float separatelly arround the core or 
 something.
  
  I remember when more characters were comming, and they were great, but maybe wasn't very well introducted 
 because I don't remember like some of them came into play. They were great tough, and all very 
 balanced. They came with better power already than the first characters on the beggning, but the 
 first ones were already lvled, so you should make a choice because of the party size limit. I often 
 just couldn't leave some old conrads behind, even though some newer was more powerfull, because 
 of how attached I was with them. I liked them very much.
  
  **Minor Spoiler about some characters you encounter**
  
  All characters had some kind of special 
 ability, there was a thief guy (the one I had to use in the part I was stuck has I found later) , 
 a mechanic blond girl, the inventor (from the very beggning) with his punk hair, the dog, a blong 
 guy with blades and even more. There were many characters, I even didin't got to see them all.
 
  
  **End Spoiler**
  
  This is a very catchy game with an appealing story and appealing characters. I can't even read 
 what the people who gave it lower scores think of it. Its just magical really. I get very curious 
 with the people who acomplish a marvel game so Ill see if they made another gem. Mind you, this 
 an old school game not meant for anyone. It requers patience, and have foults from other times 
 but still lesser than many games today. Its very ejoyable if you have the time to apreciete it 
 and its dificulties. Its not a game to be harsh with on the things you consider has foults, it 
 is about immersive atmosphere, story, characters, challenges (and some were you really might get 
 stuck, like I was and left it for some days) and lots of battles. It is a game from 99 has you 
 can see.
  
  Hope some day I can get it again somehow and finish it, but sometimes is hard to go trought old 
 emotions, thats the only problem. Sometimes is the best to leave old thing sit still. But this 
 one I should have finish damn. If you are someone capable of really enjoy this masterpiece, buy 
 it and do it for me ok?
  
  I regard you with much love Septerra Core, it was a immeasurable pleasure to met you. Farewell 
 Maya and companions. *cry* lol.
  
  Thanks for reading, see ya :) . Ill let a trully interesting story below for you. Hope you like 
 it too as much as I do.
  
  -----------------------------------------------------
  
  A bit about one of the greatest thing in this game: Its story. The best most original and surreal 
 story I ever saw for a game. Its official brief I only added little info in the two [ ] 's. There 
 are no spoilers. Spoiler Free.
  
  "Enter a world where the laws of nature work in strange new ways allowing continents to orbit at 
 different elevations around the planet. [These masses of land that float arround the Core at different 
 levels, are called Shells and Layers by the inhabitants. All the world is very misterious, has 
 the different nations (including some different races) live separatelly from each other and not 
 much aware of eachother buzziness.] Living battleships float overhead and Junk Pirates roam the 
 darkness. This is a world who's very Core is a living computer, quietly watching over the fruits 
 of its master's creation.
  
  On the Outer Shell Layer above, the ancient society of the Chosen live an extravagant lifestyle, 
 consuming mass amounts of energy and dumping their waste onto the Layers below. [The ones from 
 below, long used to it, live from the technology trash always descending from the Outer Shell.] 
 Now the Chosen have discovered secrets about the world in which they live, and begin a descent 
 towards the inner Core, caring not who gets in their way.
  
  Into these events you are drawn. You take the role of Maya, a Junk Scavenger from World Shell 2, 
 directly below the Chosen's Layer. It is here that you make your living, sifting through the trash 
 to find useful items to sell, always wary of the giant ships that darken the skies above. As the 
 Chosen and their fleet of battleships begin their descent to the Core, war looms over the land. 
 The many nations of the Lower Levels, including your own, are threatened by the exodus and fear 
 the destruction to come.
  
  Leaving her home behind, Maya strikes out intending to warn the Lower nations of the coming Chosen, 
 and soon finds herself in the middle of the battle for freedom.
  
  Standing against Maya are the forces of Doskias, a Chosen Lord who sees himself as the savior of 
 Septerra, a man who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. In his desire to obtain the power 
 of the Core he upsets the delicate clockwork of the planet ... dooming the world to destruction.
 
  Maya must stand against him. Finding allies as well as enemies in the society of the Chosen, she 
 begins to unravel what Doskias has wrought, and starts down the path to obtaining the Gift of the 
 Creator, prophesied as the power that will save the world.
  
  In a world where the boundaries of good and evil are blurred, only the strong will survive to see 
 a new dawn ... and a new era, as you solve the Legacy ... and look upon the face of the Creator."

Review:  Septerra core was "born" in 1999. A good year, where the technology and investments in the game 
 industry. There was new games, and a new way to play games and create then. Septerra core tried 
 to fit in these new ways. Valkyrie studios tried the best possible to do this. But this is not 
 a easy task. You can confirm that in septerra core battle style. But, let's keep easy: the game 
 is good, you can have a lot of fun playing it.
  
  Now for the grades!
  
  Music: 10 Simply pwnsome.
  FX: 7 - Not that good.
  Story: 10 - Shells, cards, gods, Marduck 
 =P And the characters and wars. Everything pwns.
  Interactivity = 4 - 
  Fun playing: 10. No joking!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 For real, it is really funny!
  7,5 Overral no more, no less.
  
  Thanks God for this game o/
  
  Maybe a next game, a Septerra core 2. I still have faith on 
 this, specially cause there is fallout 3, why not septerra core 2?
  
  Cya guys. Play septerra.

Review:  Septerra Core was the best and nicest game i played on my first Pentium I computer, i had a lame 
 computer with 600mhz and 4MB video graphic adapter - and the amazing thing is that it worked....
 
  So i started playing and the story was simply amazing.... it involved ancient figures and a legend 
 and many interesting quests.... and battles...
  yes it is true that sometimes... bug occured.. but that didn`t spoil the beauty of the game.
  It 
 was a game - the best game i played in my childhood.
  Congratulations to the designers.

Review:  If you are a hardcore fan of the Final Fantasy series, you may be remotely interested in this game 
 with the same RPG style and even the same navigation and combat system. However, given that it 
 was developed shortly after FFVII in the late 90's, its dated graphics would have put you off by 
 now.
  
  Much of the game mainly puts your characters running around maze-like rooms and outdoor areas that 
 are quite uninspired and getting keys to reach the other side while contending with scripted enemy 
 encounters. The battle system is actually quite slow and boring even though all the 9 main characters 
 each has individually interesting combat skills. Not even halfway through the main game, I'm so 
 bored with it I applied cheats all the way cos I just wanna see the endgame and leave it permanently 
 on the shelf. Nevertheless, it does have a good save-the-world storyline to satisfy the casual 
 RPG gamers.
  
  It would be fun to play Septerra Core last century when not so many RPGs are made. Now, you can 
 just totally ignore it if you are not a serious RPG collector.

Review:  Role playing games for the PC are rare and so when Septerra Core came out, it was almost like a 
 delicious prize, ready to be unwrapped. Playing the game can be quite fun but some things aren't 
 right.
  
  Septerra Core is a very ambitious game for many reasons. First of all, the sound is amazing in 
 most areas. In battles, the music can be described as moody but it can get repetitive quickly but 
 all other sounds are fantastic. From the laser shots to the sword swings, the combat sounds fit 
 the tone and play quite well. On top of that, every word in the game is voice acted. This may very 
 well be the first game where that is the case and because of that, the game is so very memorable. 
 Each character as a unique personality that anyone can remember after playing and each distinct 
 voice pulls you more into the game than one would expect. While you're playing, you can't help 
 but feel that you know about them and you want them to succeed because they are people who have 
 extraordinary problems.
  
  On top of that, the story is so intriguing, you would have to be asleep not to get drawn in. The 
 tale begins with the main character named Maya. She is a junker from Shell 2. The story is unique 
 because the world is not a round planet but 7 flat shells around a rotating spine. I don't want 
 to ruin it all for you but suffice to say, those above Maya and her companions are on route for 
 something horrific and it is up to her to stymie their attempt.
  
  The graphics are basic looking and can only run at a 640x480 resolution. This is highly unfortunate 
 because the game doesn't look sharp at times but the sprites are colourful and it does run smoothly. 
 Though the game is quite good, the one major issue is the game has is pacing. The pacing of the 
 story is fine, but the battle's take much too long. Each character, including enemies, have a status 
 bar that can be used at 1,2, or 3 bars. 1 are weaker attacks, 2 are medium attacks and 3 are your 
 strongest attacks. The main problem is that when someone goes, the bar stops for everyone while 
 the animation goes ahead for the one sprite doing something. This is okay when there are two people 
 on the screen but when there are three group members and six enemies, well you can guess how long 
 it can take. Not only that, but the characters seem to have superhuman jumping ability as they 
 jump to the target to strike them. There should have been an option to make it real time.
  
  There were some stability issues and some major bugs but if you download the latest patch, 
 you probably won't have to worry about it.
  
  The game was a great buy at sixty dollars in 1999 and is a steal at four dollars from the internet. 
 If you wanna try an older RPG with an awesome story, spend a few bucks and get this gem.

Review:  This is one of my first and favorite RPG's ever.
  
  Let's look at the facts.
  
  By the end of the game, a few million people have died horrible painful deaths. I think that pretty 
 much beats every RPG ever made. Although Sin did kill a lot of people, those killings seemed random 
 and pointless and just to be used to convey suffering. In SC, people die because there were in 
 the way. The world of Septerra is a world where **** die and the strong rise up. Good thing Maya 
 is a bum whooping blue haired chick with a gun from the shell above and inadequate armor. Of course 
 we could look at Led who had no legs but was still dressed to please. On that note, this game screams 
 Japanese! Got to love Grubb though, I wish I had a hair cut like that. Once a friend saw me playing 
 it and thought it was some girly game, because he saw the characters I had. I was using, Maya, 
 Led, Corgan. Three people with long hair, and Corgan's hair does look like a girl's hair.
  
  But on to game play.
  This game has unfortunately, very little replay value, unless you're 
 like me and actually accidentally skipped a few levels and key conversations.
  
  How did I do that you might ask, read the end of the review.
  
  The story is very decent, but 
 I never realized how similar it is to Christian religion until a super religious friend of mine 
 pointed it out. The ancient city of Babylon, etc. Marduk, The creators only begotten son. The list 
 goes on and on. It's like straight out of the bible.
  
  But that doesn't make the story any less fun.
  
  And the levels are beautiful. Do as I did, 
 this game is really meant to be played without using the map feature. SO no matter what, don't 
 use it. Thats what I did (primarily because I didn't know of the map feature the first 10 times 
 I played the game) . There is a certain satisfaction to being anywhere in the level, and not being 
 lost. Or finding a secrete spot hidden under some trees. Or find the perfect route though the Mold 
 Forest (of which I know hehehehehehe) .
  
  If you haven't played this game, you should.
  
  It's too bad gamespot didn't really give this game a real good look, because it's also not 
 stable.
  
  Unpatched, you have the following issues.
  
  You can skip the core keys mission (which is what I did the first few times I played it, its odd 
 how you get the core keys and learn the prophecy without ever going to the core hahah. It really 
 made the game confusing for me the first few times through)
  
  When fighting the mining helgak. Every time he hits you with his special attack, you gain experience. 
 And the battle doesnt end right. To end the battle, and do some huge leveling up (assuming you 
 spent about an hour of your time letting the thing hit you) use an item like a soul stone or core 
 sphere and you should go up 3 or 4 levels per character. The next 2 shells will be super easy.
 
  
  Don't talk to the brown haired lady in Wind City with Corgan, it will lock the game.
  There was another one of those but I can't remember where (goes back and plays Septerra core)
 
  
  In the prison, stay away from the upper walls in some rooms, occasionally enemies will see you 
 through the walls and make you jump the walls. The problem here is it can take you to a place that 
 is locked, and guess what; the key isnt on that side!
  
  When you beat the game. Immediately make a new one. Don't close the game, just click new game and 
 save.
  Your characters (except for Maya, Grubb, and Runner) will all have the same equipment they had 
 when you beat the game. You just can't see it or unequip it in some cases. Not until you actually 
 get the item. You can consider this like a new game + like in CT and CC. And before Grubb and Runner 
 level up for the first time, they will have huge stats as well. But they disappear when they level 
 up, for the other characters they do not disappear. So the trick, get Maya to a very high level, 
 I usually stop when she has over 100 HP (I forget what level that is) . Do this by fighting the 
 Red wolf in the middle left side of the Bad Lands. Just keep killing the wolves it summons. You 
 will get 150 EXP every battle. You should be able to one hit kill the brown wolves on your weakest 
 attack before you get grub and runner in your team.
  
  To get through most of the mold forest without a battle, run along the bottom of the level, stay 
 hidden under trees. No enemies look down there.
  
  You can actually rob the armor store on shell 6 partially before the shop keep actually leaves. 
 Go behind him and check the shelf. You can get some pretty sweet boots. You cant get the magic 
 armor yet though.
  
  You can actually beat Lock, the guy with the key in the Ill Repute. I've done it, it is possible, 
 but it really makes the game funny. And no I didn't cheat; I just beat him with summons. Not sure 
 how I did it, I guess I was a good battler, just not a good RPG'er back then. Because I always 
 wondered what the explosives were for.
  
  Well thats all I'm going to tell you. Now go out, buy and enjoy this great game.

Review:  Tons of characters, tons of enemies with a tons of magic you can combine to send upon your furious 
 foes, tons of bosses with unique abiliies, tons of items to collect and stick to your weapons for 
 upgrade.
  This game's exceptional story takes you to the futuristic planet earth which was divided in several 
 parts; your task is to find a core key and reunite these parts.
  You'll have a lot of pleasure playng it, because of it's great storyline, all the dialogues are 
 in audio format, difficult quests with lots of riddles, few annoying labyrinths to get out of, 
 solvation of various mob wars in different cities of world layers, conspiration exposals.. And 
 after getting your own aerial transport it's up to you to explore every single spot of the earth 
 & find many hidden puzzles & quests to solve with a following success of discovering ancient artifacts 
 for disposal.
  Obviously i lost a track of time when started playing this great game, now it's your turn..

Review:  If you play this game you'll find to see that it is better than anyone implies. The story line 
 is amazing. You must save the world by stopping all of the layers of the world from aligning. If 
 they align something real bad will happen. This game is an RPG ahead of its time. Though created 
 in 1999 do not be fooled by that fact. The sound quality isn't bad and neither are the graphics. 
 Following these characters though the layers of the earth shows to be a real adventure. This game 
 is should have been made as a console style RPG but the creators obviously didn't do that. It would 
 have been better made for the playstation. The characters each have a different essence to them 
 and together they work quite well. The different cities that you'll see will range from slums to 
 royal kingdoms. Traveling in this world of the creator ranges from dangerous and unpredictable 
 to easy going and without a care. If you have not bought this game I suggest you do. If you're 
 not satisfied with the story line then you're crazy!

Review:  This game at first may seem a little bland and repetitive, but it has interesting characters and 
 a great story line. Which on my list are the most important things in an rpg.
  
  I find for its time it has very good graphics and I personally have not had any stability problems 
 like others, but that does not mean there are none.
  
  this was one of the first games where I thought they pulled of the voices quite well and it added 
 to the game instead fo taking away from it. This game is quite old now and you can possibly pick 
 it up for very cheap so there is no reason not to try and and give it a go.
  
  i recommend this game for anyone who likes rpgs and a good story.
