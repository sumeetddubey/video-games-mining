With addictive gameplay, numerous levels, and cute little rodents, 3D Lemmings is a must-buy.

 3D Lemmings is a unique puzzle game where you decide the ultimate fate of dozens of foolish, furry-footed 
 rodents. As lemmings tend to walk in a straight line, even if it means certain death, you must 
 assign them such positions as turners, blockers, and diggers as they traverse dangerous levels 
 containing trampolines, springs, and rope slides.  

 The graphics in 3D Lemmings are colorful and eye pleasing. The lemmings are adorable, even while 
 screaming in terror as they fall into the ocean and drown. And, as the name implies, 3D Lemmings 
 is a truly 3-D game where you can move and view the action on any axis.   

 The game sound is inconsistent. Although the classical soundtrack playing on some levels is very 
 soothing and adds to the overall atmosphere of the game, the hard-edged music in other stages can 
 be quite nerve-wracking. Fortunately, the sound effects, particularly the voices of the lemmings, 
 are humorous and cute, especially when all the lemmings shout "Armageddon" in their high-pitched, 
 Chipmunkesque voices. Controls can be a bit tricky and confusing in the beginning, but 3D Lemmings 
 provides a practice mode where you can try out all of the moves before jumping into the actual 
 game. In no time, you'll be directing those little critters with great speed and efficiency. Another 
 nice feature of 3D Lemmings is its "Auto Replay." This option will replay your last set of moves 
 until you wish to take control. This is particularly handy for tricky parts of a puzzle that require 
 quick mouse and keyboard combinations.  

 With addictive gameplay, numerous levels, and cute little rodents, 3D Lemmings is a must-buy for 
 anyone looking for a unique and incredibly fun gaming experience. Many hours of sleep will be lost 
 as you try to conquer just one more level. Now if only I can figure out how to get the lemmings 
 to mow my yard.

Review:  Lemmings in 3d was like a pipedream not very goo it basically sucked a lot, shouldn't of happened 
 and got discontiued. This game sucks in all aspects and i should not be saying this but this game 
 is the worst game ever and should not be played in any way, shape or form. This should not be bought. 
 Don't not not not not not not not not not nott not not not not not not not not not not not not 
 not not not not not not not not not not not play it. The graphics suck like hell and a black and 
 white tv show shuld do better. You should never go to sounds they suck they suck suck suck suck 
 suck suck suck suck suck suck suck suck suck suck suck suck suck suck suck suck. This is stupid 
 and never should be good. I know this is bad and i know this is awful. I know this is awful and 
 bad. You know what the bad thing is.

Review:  I recieved 3D Lemmings for my birthday (some years ago) from my mom, so it wasn't quite something 
 I asked for it, something I was curious to, or something I ever heard of.
  
  Anyways, I tried the game, and my first notice was that this game wasn't 3D at all. Even though 
 when you move the camera you'll see no other side than the left, right, back and front side of 
 the Lemming as if it's a animated piece of paper from every view.
  
  Even though the fake 3D and the (for me) long time of getting used to the controlls and way of 
 working (an hour maybe) it's quite addictive, not only the music takes care of that, but also seeing 
 the result how you managed to get those brainless ducks to the finish-point.
  
  Amusing to see how one falls off a cliff and the rest of the fools follow. :P Horrible actually, 
 they're so dumb.
  
  Even though it was not as I expected, I say it's a buy, but then again after a while playing I 
 never touched the game again. The fun is off it.

Review:  I did have some minor issues with my older graphics cards when testing this game but overall it 
 was enjoyable as per its previous counterparts.
  
  The background music is as pleasurable as "The Tribes" and still gives you some challenges in the 
 game-play to keep you and your lemmings from jumping off that cliff.
  
  I still feel the simplicity of the first three games is more commending since it can be run on 
 any old computer.
  
  The new graphics engine does give it some new twists and thought provoking tests to keep you interested. 
 If you were a fan of the originals or just like these little furry suicidal animals then you should 
 add this one to your collection.

Review:  The one classic that stood out as addictive AND teeth-grindingly impossible. It was one of the 
 golden oldies that left us with the overwhleming feeling of full-on gaming nourishment with it's 
 challenging and neverending fun. Yet the 3D touch seemed to break the mood of it being so classic. 
 It certainly will remain a favourite in my heart as it's puzzling ability to put me in a glucose-induced 
 coma.
  
  Many an hour was spent conceiving plans for the later and more difficult levels, as the gameplay 
 never seemed to let me down. It was a fast climber in the puzzle genre, and addictive. On it's 
 way down it grabbed a parasol and slowly declined saving it from a good old splat and the bottom. 
 Who on this planet cannot love this yummy mummy of a game?

Review:  Most of us have had lemmings experience at some to or another, either it be on the PC at first 
 release or playing Lemmings: the tribes on the Amiga or Atari ST, or even more recently playing 
 it on your Java enabled phone. 
  
  If your one of the above; then your probably interested in the Lemmings first move to the 3D world. 
 The premise is indeed interesting, taking the same idea's that havent changed much from the initial 
 concept and trying to update them.
  
  The level design is excellent, and even though the graphics are poor and non accelerated, the are 
 fine for the task of getting the (not so little, this time round) lemmings home.
  
  The problems arise, when trying to control the little guys. The control is fiddly and despite the 
 amount of time you spend with it, it never seems to do or be able to do what you are trying to 
 achieve. The thing with 3d games of this era is that the camera control was never very good and 
 it plagued many good games making them awful, this is no different. With many of the more intricate 
 levels being made extremely difficult by the inability to see what youre doing. 
  
  If your a collector, then this is probably one for your collection. If youre looking for a puzzle 
 game them this is done much, much better elsewhere.

Review:  Lemmings. We've all played it, in some form. Ant I'm sure you'll all agree, it's a game you either 
 love or hate. And 3D Lemmings is no exception.
  
  The game has fairly simple 3D graphics, with a moveable camera (the camera itself must be mastered 
 to complete some levels) , and tons of new tricks for the lemmings to do (and also tons of new ways 
 for them to be brutally squashed, grinded, eaten and otherwise destroyed) . It's a bit tricky to 
 get the hang of the 3D perspective, and the fact that your lemmings can now run around in more 
 directions than ever before makes it a lot trickier to keep them alive. Fortunately there's a huge 
 tutorial section which introduces you to the game and teaches you to use all the features.
  
  The graphics are 3D, and they do look a bit dated now, although they do their job. The game 
 is nice and colourful, and this adds to the appeal. 
  
  The sound is.. well.. if you've played the original Lemmings you'll know what to expect. The sounds, 
 while not the same, are very much the same style, and the same goes for the background music.
 
  
  The game can be found for next to nothing in most decent game shops over here (the UK) , I got my 
 copy for 5 a few years ago. Not much for hours of hilarious (and often very frustrating) entertainment.
 
  
  The frustration is what makes this a 'love it or hate it' game. You WILL get very frustrated at 
 times playing this game, for example spending 3 hours trying to work out how to do a puzzle unsuccessfully, 
 only to find the solution is completely obvious. But in my opinion, that is what makes this game 
 fun, and entertaining. 
  
  This isn't quite as great as the original Lemmings, but it is certainly a very interesting take 
 on the concept.
