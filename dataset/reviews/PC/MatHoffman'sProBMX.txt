:::Review:::
It's been said that if it ain't broke, don't fix it, and Activision took the adage to heart when 
 creating Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX. 

  It was only a little over two years ago that "extreme sports" was synonymous with "budget-priced 
 garbage" in computer gaming. The reason was simple: None of the major publishers considered it 
 a viable market. Hits like California Games, Skate or Die, and Ski or Die were distant memories, 
 and the few new extreme sports games that were being released had subpar graphics, lame music, 
 and forgettable gameplay. Of course, that all changed with Activision's release of Tony Hawk's 
 Pro Skater in 1999, a game that simultaneously fed off the increasing popularity of extreme sports 
 while introducing many video game fans to the frenetic world of skateboarding.           Mat Hoffman 
 plays a lot like the Tony Hawk series...    

  In a somewhat surprising move, Activision took Tony Hawk's Pro Skater to every platform but the 
 PC. It wasn't until the sequel that Tony Hawk made it to the PC, and then with little fanfare. 
 Activision hasn't made the same mistake with Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX, the newest addition to the 
 company's extreme sports lineup, as it's been a mere five months since the game debuted on the 
 PlayStation and Dreamcast. That's good news for PC gamers who like arcade-style action -- while Mat 
 Hoffman's Pro BMX is definitely worth waiting for, it's better that we don't have to.   

  It's been said that if it ain't broke, don't fix it, and Activision and developer Gray Matter took 
 the adage to heart when creating Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX. The gameplay modes here are pretty much 
 identical to what's found in the Tony Hawk games. Three single-player games are available -- career, 
 single session, and free ride -- but everything pretty much hinges on the career mode, because success 
 there determines which courses you can choose from in the other two modes.   

  Regardless of which of the eight pro BMX riders you choose to play as, you're limited to a single 
 bike and a single course at the start of your career. You can juice the default bike up a bit by 
 tweaking the forks, sprocket, tires, and so forth, but don't expect any big improvements in performance 
 until you unlock new bikes. To unlock new bikes, as well as the game's nine courses (including 
 a cool hidden one from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater) , you must collect magazine covers. Five are available 
 on each level, and you earn them by hitting objects, grabbing floating letters, posting high scores, 
 and locating a "secret" cover. You can also unlock a couple of hidden riders, one by doing well 
 (Tony Hawk) and another by repeated failure ("Granny," who carries a purse and whose bike features 
 a basket on the handlebars!) .   

  Though the graphics for the riders and terrain are a bit blocky when compared with the smooth textures 
 of Dave Mirra's Freestyle BMX, the level of detail is impressive, and there's practically no pop-up 
 on even the larger courses. Only nine courses are featured, but the variety of the venues is excellent, 
 ranging from the insane drops of the construction yard to the tight confines of the Hoffman Bike 
 Factory and a London subway station. There's a strange "shimmer" effect noticeable on courses where 
 the action takes place at night or where there are plenty of chain-link fences, which can lead 
 to a slight drop in the frame rate, but it would only have a serious effect on the low-end systems. 
   

  The controls are completely customizable, and after only a few trial runs, you'll be pulling off 
 impressive moves like backflips, tail whips, and the superman (and variations thereof) . But you 
 won't get far unless you keep in mind that repeating the same moves results in diminishing scores -- you'll 
 have to think hard about your line and remember to combo in and out of grinds to maximize your 
 points. Earning enough covers to advance to new courses and unlock new bikes is a bit difficult, 
 especially since some of the secret covers are devilishly hard to find, so it's crucial that you 
 focus on racking up big numbers on each run. Advance far enough and you'll access the BlueTorch 
 Competition and, later on, the CFB (Crazy Freakin' Bikers) Competition, where you can earn a medal 
 by placing in the top three after several heats -- not an easy task unless you live for this kind 
 of game.           ... which means it can be fun, challenging, and addictive.    

  Even if you unlock all bikes and courses, there's still more waiting for you. A park editor allows 
 you to create new courses, and to help you get started, there are five premade parks to tinker 
 with. The control system for placing ramps and obstacles is a bit touchy, but with a little practice, 
 you should be able to pump out some interesting sites for you and your friends to try out -- provided 
 they visit  you , that is, since unfortunately there's no way to save your creations as individual 
 files to be exported. The game's multiplayer modes add more replay value. "HORSE" works a bit like 
 the hoops game -- you have to pull off a trick that outscores your opponent's previous attempt -- while 
 "graffiti" works in similar fashion except you must "tag" an obstacle while tricking. Trick attack 
 is the least interesting of the multiplayer modes -- you must simply try to outscore each other. 
 It's disappointing that HORSE can only be played in hot-seat mode and graffiti and trick attack 
 require a LAN, but three limited multiplayer modes are better than only one or none.   

  Anyone who's even casually glanced at extreme sports like skateboarding and BMX biking on TV knows 
 that music is an integral component of the experience, and the collection of songs featured here 
 complements the action almost perfectly. The soundtrack runs the gamut of styles favored by X gamers -- you'll 
 hear everything from cool funk and hip-hop (Jurassic 5, Outkast, Newcleus) to old-school punk (Agent 
 Orange, Bad Brains) and present-day thrashfests (Pailhead, Racer X) . There's even a song by 20 
 Minute Crash called "The CFB Song" with lyrics written by none other than Mat Hoffman. The credits 
 reveal that the very cool "52 Girls" by the B-52s and the annoying "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer" 
 are also buried somewhere in the game. Still, the selection is so outstanding that you could probably 
 consider about $15 of the retail price as paying for an audio CD.   

  There's probably no single feature of Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX that could be considered exceptional, 
 but that isn't a prerequisite for a game to be fun or addicting -- and the PC version of Mat Hoffman's 
 Pro BMX is both.

Review:  Mat Hoffman on PC? No. And if you don't even have a gamepad-don't bother.
  
  Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX puts the player into the role of a BMX pro, and from there on it's the same 
 as every extreme sports game activision makes - Compete in competitions, clear different goals, 
 and unlock levels and gear. Been there, done that. The game uses the tony hawk gaming engine, turning 
 4 wheels into 2 - And fails miserably. The gaming experience is nothing compared to THPS and the 
 graphics also... suck. This is a game ment to be on PSone or a similiar console. But not on PC. 
 No.
  
  I don't know if it's I that suck on gaming, but I started having problems already after the second 
 level. The goals are a bit hard and thanks to the horrible graphics and horrible gameplay, It's 
 almost impossible to complete the game. But, some people propably think the opposite ( What the 
 heck is he talking about? My third-year old brother finished this game in 10 minutes! ) but I'm 
 not used to play sport games on PC. Leave that to PS2.
  
  The only Thumb-up in this game, was the sound. The sound effects are good, and the sound track 
 is also ok.
  
  So = MHPB is a good game on consoles but its not ment to be on PC. No.
