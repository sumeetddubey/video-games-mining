:::Review:::
PureSim Baseball 2004 shows that developer Shaun Sullivan is building an impressive, if somewhat 
 modest, new baseball management simulation franchise. 

  Arriving just in time for the heating up of the pennant races is PureSim Baseball 2004, a sports 
 management simulation with its own identity, although not much of a personality. Developer Shaun 
 Sullivan's third release in this series continues to combine some of the depth of Out of the Park 
 Baseball with the more straightforward play of Baseball Mogul, a design focus that somehow results 
 in a captivating game that you won't confuse with either of its main influences.  

          The new game simulation interface is flat-out gorgeous. It's also nicely utilitarian, with 
 graphics illustrating what happens with every crack of the bat.     

  From a glance, however, this is just another text-based baseball management sim. You take over 
 a big-league ball club and orchestrate all of the moves relating to how the team does on the field. 
 This means that you draft players, sign free agents to contracts, set up starting lineups, figure 
 out a pitching rotation, pull the trigger on trades, and so forth.  

  Where PureSim 2004 steps away from the pack is in the lack of a Major League feel. The game isn't 
 licensed by either MLB or the MLBPA, so there aren't any famous pinstripes or $250-million shortstops. 
 That's par for the course when it comes to sports management sims, which are generally developed 
 on a tight budget. However, in this case it really stands out because Sullivan doesn't even try 
 to mirror the Majors. When you first set up an association, there isn't a default league that mimics 
 the real-life show. Instead, you get options that allow you to set up the number of teams and leagues, 
 along with a listing of well over a hundred North American cities ranging in size from San Francisco 
 to Saskatoon. So you could be competing in big-league markets like New York and Chicago or in a 
 semipro circuit in small-town Canada.  

  Oddly enough, such simplicity is a big strength. Dumping the Yankees, Red Sox, and company for 
 the likes of the Ottawa-Gatineau Minutemen and the Omaha Sturgeon lets you focus solely on building 
 a baseball club. It's refreshing to play a pure fantasy baseball game without the static provided 
 by having to re-create real-world performances of players, stage bobblehead promotion days, or 
 deal with petulant outfielders. Gameplay is about developing a winning lineup, not wheeling and 
 dealing and struggling with arcane subjects like the Rule 5 draft. Even contract negotiations are 
 simplified, with players signing fixed-term deals for the most part.  

  Of course, you're covered if you want to reenact real pennant races, too, as PureSim 2004 allows 
 use of the acclaimed Sean Lahman database. This downloadable file features full pitching and batting 
 statistics for every single player in MLB history. Get it for free from the Baseball1. com Web site 
 and you can start an association with authentic pros from every season between 1871 and the present 
 day.  

  No matter whether you prefer fictional or real, or modern or historical, there are a wealth of 
 configuration options. The new ballpark designer lets you whip up your own stadium, and it even 
 lets you include a photograph of the park for use on the simulation screen. Almost everything about 
 the nuts and bolts of the game can be customized with the editable XML file. So if you want to 
 create a more realistic semipro league or go back in time to a pre-Curt Flood MLB, drop salaries. 
 Or you can drop cash entirely and swap dollars for the old PureSim system that used points to represent 
 player value. On-field results can also be tweaked. Want to re-create the Dead Ball era or live 
 through the run-happy 1990s? Play with the numbers governing hits, walks, and homers.  

  Gameplay is solid no matter how you adjust the settings. Much progress has been made over the past 
 two editions of the game, most notably in the area of sim speed. Previous editions were slowpokes, 
 requiring minutes to simulate a week of games. The new game is a roadrunner by comparison, zipping 
 through a week in under 30 seconds. Where PureSim was once the slowest kid on the baseball simulation 
 block, it's now leaving competitors like Out of the Park Baseball 6 in the dust. A new option, 
 which forgoes the minor leagues and cuts back to a single 35-man roster, makes the game run even 
 faster.  

  Lack of personality remains a problem, though. Sullivan has taken his "Pure baseball" slogan too 
 literally and left the game devoid of little touches. Negotiating with players is the biggest flaw. 
 Unless you're in the fall-winter free-agent period (when you have the added option of using a slider 
 bar to increase the money offered per year of contract) , all you can do is pick a fixed-term deal. 
 This doesn't leave any room for back-and-forth dealing, so there is no tension during the free-agency 
 period or when it comes to trying to re-sign stars. There isn't an e-mail system to communicate 
 with players and other general managers, either, which further depersonalizes the proceedings. 
 Only the PSPN magazine, which summarizes events across your association and even includes such 
 esoteric items as sabermetric numbers, provides signs of life beyond the stats.  

  This bland character is somewhat balanced by a new, more functional interface. Icons at the bottom 
 of the main screen lead directly to all of the primary menus, such as standings, the stat almanac, 
 highlights, and player transactions. The PSPN Game Cast game sim screen is now very attractive, 
 with a background shot of a big-league ballpark, graphics indicating every hit, and sidebars detailing 
 player stats. It even includes head-and-shoulder icons where player photos can be placed, giving 
 the game a TV-broadcast feel. Still, the interface is somewhat clunky. Player face packs have to 
 be downloaded separately, so you're stuck with silhouettes in the beginning, and the sans serif 
 fonts give most screens the character of a spreadsheet.  

          Keep up with all the news that's fit to print with PSPN magazine, a weekly guide to what's 
 happening around your association.     

  But at least stats aren't an issue. PureSim 2004 is dead-on the money when it comes to generating 
 numbers. At least, as dead-on as you want when playing a sports sim. There is some measure of unpredictability 
 to player performance. Although each player comes with over a dozen skill ratings, they aren't 
 the complete measure of a ballplayer. So you can get burned on big-money sluggers with incredible 
 scores in power and contact, and rookies who never live up to potentially high ratings. Generally, 
 though, players perform within acceptable margins. A second baseman with contact and eye scores 
 in the 70s will at least flirt with .300 every season; an outfielder with a power score above 80 
 will routinely count 30 to 40 dingers; and a starting pitcher with control in the 80s can be expected 
 to win close to 20 games with a good team backing him up.  

  All in all, PureSim Baseball 2004 shows that developer Shaun Sullivan is building an impressive, 
 if somewhat modest, baseball management simulation franchise. Some options will be missed by some 
 players -- especially those coming from a more intricate simulation like Out of the Park Baseball 
 6, which also offers the online league play that this game lacks -- but the strict focus on nothing 
 but baseball is a treat for those tired of sports sims filled with so many intricacies that it 
 becomes hard to see the sport.
