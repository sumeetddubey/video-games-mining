:::Review:::
The fact that Air Warrior III is built as an online game is apparent as soon as you jump into the 
 cockpit. 

 A long time ago, Kesmai introduced one of the very first fully graphical online games, a World War 
 II-based flight simulation called Air Warrior. After numerous revisions throughout the years, Air 
 Warrior II, the culmination of literally hundreds of thousands of dollars of research, was produced 
 by Interactive Magic in conjunction with Kesmai Studios. Air Warrior II not only let you fly online, 
 but offline as well, with over 300 missions and campaigns to accompany the smooth but still-dated 
 graphics and realistic flight models. You could now spend hundreds of hours practicing and flying 
 offline without ever having to spend a dime.  

 Now Interactive Magic has released Air Warrior III, which continues to add even more to the Air 
 Warrior series. In continuing with today's trend towards 3D acceleration, Air Warrior III features 
 Direct3D graphics and the ability to download new textures. Also included in the new version are 
 force-feedback support, several new aircraft, and new Pacific-area campaigns. All of the original 
 scenarios from Air Warrior II are here, plus an extra 150 or so, to make a total of over 450 independently 
 playable missions. And that's not including online play with hundreds of other players in free-for-all 
 arenas or historical scenarios with 49 different types of realistically modeled aircraft.  

 Unfortunately the feel of a full product is just not present. The problem is that Air Warrior 
 is an online game first and foremost (and a fairly decent one at that) , but the offline air combat 
 flight is a noticeably distant second. You still have the feeling that the offline scenarios were 
 merely tacked on as an afterthought. Over 450 afterthoughts, in fact, if you don't count the campaigns. 
 The fact that Air Warrior III is built as an online game is apparent as soon as you jump into the 
 cockpit; everything in the game engine is built around providing the pilot with information in 
 the most simplistic and understandable way.   

 Everything is built around the idea that you are going to fly online. Yet you have to deal with 
 some conventions offline as a result: funky aircraft IDs, the annoying "periscope" view (though 
 this can be changed easily) , hit bubbles, and the unmistakable feeling that you are alone despite 
 the fact that you may be flying in formation with an entire squadron. And the way the key commands 
 are set up makes you wonder if you're flying a flight simulation or playing an adventure game. 

 Of course if you go online everything seems to make some sense and you can actually talk to people 
 using a microphone-transmission system called Network Speech rather than just typing out messages. 
 You can talk with 16 different people on one channel, and it really works, though it does take 
 some finessing. Online Air Warrior III, like most other big multiplayer games, is a fun experience 
 - even more so if you know what you are doing.  

 Graphically, the Direct3D acceleration helps a bunch; the ground, sky, and aircraft textures are 
 wonderful. Less than ideal, however, are the rather dull-looking explosions. During combat, aircraft 
 take a few hits, stream smoke, then blow up in cheesy fireballs and puffs of black smoke. Explosions 
 on the ground from bomb hits are the same as explosions in the air, except they cycle through the 
 sequence over and over again.   

 If all you want to do is fly online, and you don't want to pay a single penny (for now anyway) , 
 you can just swing over to the Kesmai Air Warrior site, download the front end, and play for free 
 in the beta arenas. You don't even need the boxed game. So if you are really itching to find out 
 how Air Warrior III is, fly it for yourself, free of charge.

Review:  Although it's a very old game, I decided to make this review since I've started playing it . So 
 hang on, we're taking off...
  
  So, being a old game, it's graphics are total c**p for today's standards, yet, the good point of 
 the game is not there but in the play it self. Pick a red Baron's focker or a Russian Mig 15 and 
 go out there dog fight.
  
  Either in realistic or non-realistic mode, you can do some nice stunts like flying upside down 
 or making a 360&ordm; loop. And if you're flying a F86F Sabre, you can hit well over Mach 1 on 
 vertical flight (down of course) . Personally, I went as high as 1.36 Mach.
  
  About the sound, it totally rocks for 1997 and it totally sucks for 2006 but after all, it is a 
 9 year od game. Come on. I recommend playing when earing I believe I can fly .
  
  As for value, I can't say much. It's a old game. You'll be lucky if you get a copy from e-bay or 
 some where like that.
  
  In conclusion, it's a worth to play game if you like some nostalgia of the old time flight simulators 
 or if you really love to shoot down zeros. You got to love it or you got to hate it. Choose.
