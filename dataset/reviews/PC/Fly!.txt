:::Review:::
Fly has it where it counts: in the cockpit and, for the most part, in the flight model. 

 With Microsoft Flight Simulator, Looking Glass' Flight Unlimited, and Sierra Pro Pilot on the market, 
 do we really need another civilian aviation simulator? Terminal Reality thinks so and makes a largely 
 convincing argument with its premier flight sim, Fly.  

 The exclamatory title and the boast that this is "the ultimate flight simulator" make it clear that 
 Terminal Reality isn't interested in second place. It aims to take the Microsoft beast head-on, 
 unlike Flight Unlimited whose smaller and more intimate scale lets it avoid direct conflict with 
 Microsoft's sim, which offers unrestricted cross-country flight from airport to airport and fair 
 scenery detail along the way. Flight Simulator doesn't have any real stunt planes or fancy flying 
 maneuvers, but just nice, steady, realistic flight. And that's exactly what Fly does too, and despite 
 some flaws, it does a better job in many ways.  

 Fly's appeal hinges on two important and remarkable features: its cockpits and its flight model. 
 That pretty much covers everything of importance for the serious flight enthusiast, so the other 
 problems probably won't matter much. Five airplanes are included in the simulation: the Cessna 
 172R, the Piper Malibu Mirage, the Piper Navajo Chieftain, the Beechcraft King Air B200, and the 
 Raytheon Hawker 800XP jet. Performance on each feels on target, though I can only attest to the 
 accuracy of the humble 172. Stalls, speed bleeding, and the rest of the litany of sim hot points 
 are spot-on in the various aircraft. You'll find that the auto-correcting features of the 800XP 
 accurately limit stupid moves, while the 172 recovers easily. More detail has gone into engine 
 start-up and performance than in any other sim to date.  

 In fact, they could practically call this game Engine Start-Up Simulator. When set to full realism 
 (and thankfully you can turn this off) , you must go through every stage of engine start-up in sequence. 
 An automated start-up sequence can also be used to guide you through the process with little arrows. 
 Engine performance is variable according to aircraft model and is affected by mixture, altitude, 
 and other variables. Sound effects are so precise you can tell from listening when you need to 
 adjust mixture.  

 The one major problem with the flight model is that none of these planes can be crashed. They just 
 don't crash at all, ever. Run 'em into mountains, ground, water, and they just skip like a stone 
 or bounce and roll over like one of those crazy-wheel remote-control trucks. Not only do they not 
 break up: They take off again. This is just too much. I also found weather modeling inadequate, 
 despite cranking it up to the heaviest levels. I could not force an instrument malfunction either 
 and did not experience any in the course of my flying. Throwing some instrument failures at a pilot 
 is standard operating procedure. They may well be in here somewhere, but I couldn't find them. 
 You should also be able to configure a plane for certain failures to customize a situation, and 
 that option is not offered.  

 The other key selling point of Fly is the incredible cockpits. Every single button, dial, instrument, 
 and rivet is not only here, but also completely interactive (except for the rivets) . Instrumentation 
 is the most detailed seen to date, with very accurate nav-comm systems, complete simulation of 
 the GPS, backup instruments, and more. All the instruments can be used with the mouse, but many 
 do not have keyboard equivalents or the option to add them. This creates some awkward twisting 
 for people who use their right hand for both stick and mouse. Cockpit views are good, with accurate 
 blind spots. Transparent cockpits with small instrument overlays are also available. Different 
 windows with vital information can be overlaid and configured, so you can display the main view; 
 a second camera view; charts; the vector map; an axis window graphically representing ailerons, 
 rudder, elevators, and trim; and the GPS. The vector map lets you quickly call up frequencies and 
 runway layouts for different airports and navaids.  

 Since it has 9,500 airports, 13,500 runways, 200 countries, and 16,000 navaids, Fly seems highly 
 detailed. Indeed, runways are remarkably realistic, with lighting configurations, surfacing type, 
 markings, wind socks, and taxiways. Navaids and all nav-comm frequencies are based on the real 
 thing and are handled at a depth heretofore unseen. Despite this, airport buildings, towers, and 
 parked aircraft are extremely rare outside the major areas, which brings us to another major weakness 
 of Fly: The graphics and terrain modeling are very uneven. Five major areas are done in a slightly 
 higher level of detail: New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, and Chicago. These feature 
 buildings, bridges, and airport structures. The rest of the world is done with terrain textures 
 that are merely adequate and elevation models that are unconvincing. Major city airports rarely 
 even have towers. The graphics model seems ill equipped to handle abrupt changes in elevation, 
 rendering the landscape mostly rolling or flat. On the whole, the visuals are good but not great, 
 and frame rates are inconsistent. They soar to over 20fps but regularly crash to 10fps, a big no-no 
 for a flight sim.  

 Two modes of play are offered: quick flight "missions" and a very detailed flight planner. The missions 
 are a lackluster array of start-up situations (night in Chicago, heavy weather in Dallas) with 
 few twists or specific, focused challenges. The flight planner is far more interesting. Using a 
 simple map and the massive database, you can search for any airport in the world, select a runway, 
 select a destination, and create a route. The program malfunctions on occasion, refusing to plot 
 some short jumps for no specific reason, but it usually works pretty well. You can even set the 
 weight loadout and quantity of passengers on the plane for your flight.  

 In short, Fly has it where it counts: in the cockpit and, for the most part, in the flight model. 
 The terrain will be of less concern to serious simmers. More problematic are the regular frame 
 rate hits, which can adversely affect control. This is Terminal Reality's freshman effort in the 
 highly competitive world of flight sims, and as such, it heralds a talented group worth watching. 
 Will it topple Microsoft Flight as the top sim? Not a chance. Everyone else is just vying for second 
 place. And Fly is a worthy contender for that spot.

Review:  I have the really FLY game.
  It looks like you are in a real plan.
  you really need the time for it because its very hard to play.
  but you can go to auto pilot 
 and its easer.
  the navigation is also realistic and ad that point I don't now how to use it.
  I think I need 
 a reel lesson.
  bud I don't know how I can find it.
  I did look for it bud I didn't found it.
  but you will find a way to play it just the auto pilot.
 
  and don't look to de navigation that thing doesn't work like I want (easy) .
