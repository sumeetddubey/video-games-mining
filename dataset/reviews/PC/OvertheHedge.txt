:::Review:::
A few unique touches are overshadowed by crushingly dull gameplay in this perfunctory animated movie 
 tie-in. 

  For the small cluster of game creators that regard the form as art, there is a vastly larger group 
 that sees it as a line item on a spreadsheet -- pure commodity. And, for the rare, thoughtfully executed 
 video game movie tie-in that actually enhances the overall property (think  The Chronicles of Riddick 
 ) , there are a dozen games like Over the Hedge. You'll go numb from repetition before you finish 
 Over the Hedge, but you won't be able to shake the feeling that this game exists as a contractual 
 obligation between Activision and DreamWorks. It's a competent game to a degree, but it's also 
 rather cold and mechanical.  

          Woodland creatures are rocking the suburbs in Over the Hedge.     

  As a major motion 
 picture,  Over the Hedge  tells the story of a group of woodland creatures coping with the arrival 
 of Suburbia, presumably with hilarious and perhaps occasionally thought-provoking results. The 
 game hints at some of the conflict from the film, specifically with an overzealous exterminator 
 and a dark-hearted bear named Vincent. We have to assume that the film also paints the suburbs 
 as more aggressively antagonistic, because mostly what we got from the game is that woodland animals 
 are a bunch of jerks that sneak into your house, maliciously bust everything up, and then steal 
 your TV.  

  Movie-tie-in games like Over the Hedge usually lean heavily on the source material for substance, 
 which makes the use of homegrown CG story sequences, rather than short clips from the actual film, 
 a bit of a head-scratcher. The pinch-hitting crew of voice actors that gamely try on their best 
 Bruce Willis, Garry Shandling, Steve Carell, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, and Bill 
 Shatner impressions can be a touch inconsistent, but with a game of this quality, it would be foolish 
 to expect the A-listers (or even the B-listers) to make an appearance in the sound booth.  

  Playing as the crew of jerk woodland animals -- which includes a charismatic and usually self-serving 
 raccoon; a timid turtle who's brave when it counts; a twitchy, hyperactive squirrel; and a sassy 
 skunk -- you'll make your way through a series of suburban-inspired levels, trashing up the place, 
 throwing down with brainwashed rodents, collecting various sets of seemingly arbitrary items (what 
 possible use could a raccoon have for a DVD?) , and performing some shallow "puzzle" solving. We 
 say suburban-inspired levels because you never get a sense that these are actual places, partially 
 because of how small and linear each level is, but also because every backyard and basement is 
 action-packed with ridiculous gameplay contrivances such as fire-spewing laser-grid security systems, 
 beer kegs that generate rats, and hostile flying Weber barbeques.  

  These sorts of challenges might sound kind of rad on paper, but the mostly one-button combat and 
 the high-volume/low-variety ratio of enemies pretty much puts the kibosh on much of the game's 
 fun. There are a few mildly inspired moments in Over the Hedge where it veers away from mindless 
 beat-'em-up action, such as an early sequence where you run through the titular hedge while avoiding 
 cattle prods and bear claws, or a later sequence where you have to run down a suburban street while 
 dodging traffic like some kind of version of Frogger, rotated 90 degrees. These moments are few, 
 though, and never present a real challenge.  

          Somewhere, someone is talking about Over the Hedge and synergy.     

  One of the few 
 unique things about Over the Hedge is the fact that, even when you're playing by yourself, there's 
 always an artificial intelligence-controlled companion animal to back you up, and you can switch 
 between the two of them on the fly. It ends up being kind of a so-what feature, since there's little 
 appreciable performance difference between any of the characters, and you rarely even find obstacles 
 that require cooperation to overcome. We ended up playing as Verne the turtle most of the time, 
 just because we liked his double-jump animation better. The game encourages you to revisit levels 
 that you've already completed by including several secondary objectives that can eventually earn 
 you access to a series of minigames, which maintain the game's precedent of being easy and predictable 
 with such activities as wrecking up golf carts, racing RC cars, and swinging at golf balls to break 
 stuff.  

  We can't speak on the quality of the film  Over the Hedge , since it's not in theaters yet, but 
 the game Over the Hedge doesn't really inspire much interest in the property. The PlayStation 2, 
 Xbox, GameCube, and PC versions of Over the Hedge are mostly identical and are saddled with the 
 usual quirks of their respective platforms -- expect more jaggies on the PS2, awkward controls on 
 the PC, and so on -- though no one version is so different that we can really recommend it. This 
 isn't an aggressively bad game, it's mostly just boring.

Review:  I got this game, when I didnt see Over The Hedge Movie. I was enjoying it. Then when I completed 
 a few missions, I thought this game is getting bored. I stopped playing this game when I got stuck 
 in a level Connor Heist Escape. After sometime, I mean, after a month, I saw Over The Hedge Movie. 
 It was awesome. So this made me play the game again. I started playing the game from where I got 
 stuck. I was so interested in the game now that I completed the game. The game is different from 
 the movie. Really different. The movie is different, the game is different. The story is changed 
 immediately after a few levels. We can play as the 4 main characters in the game. RJ, the raccoon, 
 Verne, the tortoise, Hammy, the rabbit squirrel, and Stella, the skunk. The combat is really simple 
 in the game. Just bash them all. RJ has a golf stick. Verne has a hockey stick. Hammy has a wodden 
 stick like thing. They all can do some special attacks too. The game consists of 35 levels. The 
 common thing the level is collecting lots and lots of food. We have to steal food from many houses. 
 Gladys house. Martins house. From the Amusement Park for a cotton candy machine. From Smiths 
 house. From a cave. The animals steal food from a bears cave too. And from Conners House. The 
 main part of the game is outside the house, inside the house, and escape from the house. There 
 are lots of enemy animals in the game. Bears, many rats, many rabbits who are all brainwashed. 
 Its fun to beat them all. We can also smash many machine things in this game. When not on a mission 
 we can roam in The Woods. We can hear all the animal friends talking. We can have fun with the 
 animals hat collection, which they collected from the missions. The game also consists many mini 
 games. The mini games are of 3 types. R. C. Rally, Range Driver, And Bumper Cars. Above all, why 
 did GS give it 5.6? It should have gotten 7.0 up! Buy it if you loved the movie. I loved the movie. 
 The game is great to play too.

Review:  This game was awesome!!! There isn't any reason why you shouldn't buy this game. This game definitely 
 is in my Top 3 favourite computer games. It has thirty-five levels, so it takes you while to beat, 
 which is a good thing. Not the hardest, but it's not like it's so easy it's boring, but it's not 
 like you're never going to get past the first level. I love this game and you should definitely 
 buy it and. Loved it, loved it, loved it so very much!! Don't listen to anything that everyone 
 says, because this game is the best game ever!!
