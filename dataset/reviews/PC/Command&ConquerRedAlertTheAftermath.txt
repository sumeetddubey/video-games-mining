:::Review:::
The Aftermath is a heck of a deal that practically turns Red Alert into an entirely new game.

 The secret to making a good expansion set isn't a well kept one. After all, hordes of Command &amp; 
 Conquer fans frothed at the mouth as they filled newsgroups and chat channels with wish lists of 
 things they hoped would be provided in the previously disappointing C&amp; C mission discs. Seemingly, 
 Westwood was listening: Red Alert: Aftermath is the definitive expansion pack by which all others 
 in this genre will be judged.   

 At long last, Aftermath provides brand-new units to the Red Alert franchise in both the single-player 
 and multiplayer modes of the game (Counterstrike only had some new single-player units) . There 
 are seven new recruits in all. The new, Soviet-only units include Shock Troopers, Tesla tanks, 
 missile subs, and M. A. D. tanks. The Allies can now produce mechanics and missile-bearing Chronotanks. 
 Both sides can also build the suicidal and speedy demolition trucks that can easily level structures 
 upon collision.  

 These units dramatically change the strategy in the game, as they serve to strengthen both sides' 
 weaknesses. For example, the missile sub gives the Soviets some much-needed seafaring offensive 
 power by allowing the sub to fire onto land. On the other side, the Allies' mechanic repairs tanks 
 during combat, thus giving them the ability to stand up to the better-armored Soviet counterparts. 
 The M. A. D. tank and demolition truck make base defense all the more important as those units can 
 destroy buildings if allowed to get close enough. Also important to note is that Aftermath changes 
 (or rather, corrects) some structure attributes to balance the once lopsided factions. Allied turrets 
 now fire twice as fast, in addition to having stronger firepower. Also, building more than two 
 factories no longer speeds production (designed to stop multiplayer tank rushes) , and the Allied 
 Gap Generators aren't quite as strong (fewer hit points, and Soviet Spy Planes can see through 
 their black shroud for longer) .   

 In addition to improving gameplay through unit additions and alterations, Aftermath includes 100 
 multiplayer maps and 18 new single-player missions of varying difficulties. There is also the introduction 
 of "mega" sized maps, which can comfortably house an eight-player battle. Unfortunately, these 
 cannot be made in the map editor (though it's a safe bet that someone on the Internet will make 
 an editor that can) . Fans of Red Alert's excellent musical score will be happy to know that Aftermath 
 comes complete with eight new techno tracks to listen to during the carnage.  

 At a low price of around twenty bucks, the Aftermath expansion pack is a heck of a deal that practically 
 turns Red Alert into an entirely new game. If you're bored with Red Alert, or want to breathe some 
 new life into your multiplayer matches, this is an outstanding add-on that shouldn't be passed 
 up.

Review:  Command & Conquer Red Alert: The Aftermath is one many expansions that Westwood offered in the 
 aftermath of the Red Alert Game. This one brings about a few more units to both sides to help create 
 brand new strategies for the different players. Besides the addition of extra units into the fold, 
 this game also includes many new multiplayer maps and a brand new single player campaign mode for 
 players to play through. This is definately an expansion that I would recommend to any gamers who 
 had purchased the original Red Alert. Why settle for just the original when there is an expansion 
 that goes along with it that adds so many more units to the game to make it even better than it 
 was before.
