:::Review:::
SODA Off-Road Racing is a great title marred only by poor graphics and uninspired sound. 

 Although the name may not be familiar to many gamers, SODA (Short-course Off-road Drivers Association) 
 racing has been a long-standing favorite of late night ESPN viewers for years. A curious combination 
 of Monster Truck Rally and Motocross, a typical SODA race consists of 17 classes of overblown 4x4's 
 competing on short, twisting mud and dirt tracks (replete with giant leaps and other obstacles) . 
 Unlike a monster truck rally, however, the emphasis in SODA off-road is on the actual racing, not 
 mere showmanship. As a result, SODA may be the perfect license for an off-road racing simulation... 
 and who better to code it than the renowned design teams at Papyrus software?  

 Unfortunately, those looking for the next NASCAR- or IndyCar-style blockbuster may be a bit disappointed. 
 In fact, other than the box art, this title bears little resemblance to Papyrus's other works. 
 For example, there are no real SODA teams, drivers, or even actual tracks. While some may consider 
 this a minor gripe, a victory over nonexistent competitors on a nonexistent track seems a bit hollow. 
   

 Despite the lack of many Papyrus trademark design elements, SODA still manages to faithfully re-create 
 the feel of an actual SODA racing experience - and in that respect, Papyrus and Software Allies 
 have succeeded admirably. Vehicles slip and slide (and occasionally fly) much as one would expect 
 over a rugged mud and dirt track. In addition, accurate suspension modeling assures that vehicles 
 bounce and roll like a carnival thrill ride.  

 As if accurately simulating one off-road vehicle weren't enough, SODA racing actually includes three 
 SODA vehicle classes (2x4 pickup, Dune Buggy, and 4x4 pickup) . Each chassis has its own distinct 
 performance characteristics, which can be tweaked further from within the in-game garage to add 
 extra variety.  

 Speaking of variety, special mention should be made of the ingenious and intuitive course design 
 feature included free of charge. Don't like the included tracks? No problem! Simply create your 
 own in a few easy steps. In fact, you can become so absorbed designing your own tracks that it 
 is easy to forget about the racing element altogether!   

 Unfortunately, even a track editor cannot fully compensate for a lackluster presentation. The graphics 
 are lackluster at best - with grainy, repetitive texture maps and an uneven frame rate. (Note: 
 Although the game touts 3D acceleration support as one of its features, this support is limited 
 to Rendition-based cards only. Owners of non-Rendition accelerators will have to wait for a promised 
 Direct 3D patch sometime in the first quarter of '98) . To make matters worse, the sound effects 
 are merely adequate, and the in-game music sounds like it was performed by a high school garage 
 band.   

 SODA Off-Road Racing is a great title marred only by poor graphics and uninspired sound. While a 
 promised Direct 3D patch will supposedly address the display issues, it did not make its way into 
 the final package. As a result, owners of high-end accelerators may wish to wait until the patch 
 is actually released before purchasing this otherwise excellent title.
