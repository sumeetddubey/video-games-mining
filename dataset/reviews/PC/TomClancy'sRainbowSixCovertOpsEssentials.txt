:::Review:::
Essentials is a stand-alone Rainbow Six product that's half Rogue Spear mission pack and half civil 
 service test simulator. 

 As soon as Red Storm announced that it was working on a new entry in its Rainbow Six series, the 
 Internet was abuzz with speculation. Could the game's title possibly be longer than the one used 
 for Red Storm's last product, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear Mission Pack: Urban Operations? 
 Sadly, the answer is no. Compared to that game, Red Storm's newest product, Tom Clancy's Rainbow 
 Six: Covert Ops Essentials, is downright tongue-tied. Unfortunately, it has more serious problems 
 than its title. Essentials is a stand-alone Rainbow Six product that's half Rogue Spear mission 
 pack and half civil service test simulator.   

  In case you think you misread the last part of that last sentence, here it is again: one half of 
 Essentials is a simulation of taking a civil service test. If you're the type of person who wants 
 his Rainbow Six performance tests to take the form of shooting Tangos and not actually, say,  taking 
 a test , feel free to skip down a few paragraphs. For all the rest, it seems like kind of a waste 
 to review this part of the game. If you're aching for the heartbreak and triumph of participating 
 in a civil service exam but lack the courage to actually take one, you don't have a whole lot of 
 other choices. In fact, you don't have any other choices. You should run - in a snake pattern - 
 to your local software store and buy Covert Ops Essentials.   

  But read this first. Essentials includes a CD full of information about the history of counterterrorist 
 agencies, operations, and equipment. After studying it all, you can play the role of any of the 
 Rainbow Six agents and take a series of fictional multiple-choice Rainbow Six entry exams. In some 
 sense, it's not a horrible idea. There's a lot of information included, and most of it is well 
 written. The problem is that Red Storm decided to create its own interface for the project. What 
 it came up with looks like a "futuristic" interface as envisioned by a Hollywood special effects 
 person in 1980. It includes plenty of arcane, unlabeled icons, menus shaped like rotating spheres, 
 and lots and lots of scrolling green text on a black background - just the way people who have 
 never actually used a computer often imagine computer interfaces will someday look like. It's neither 
 attractive nor functional.   

  Interface enhancements that exist in the real world are simply ignored in the informational segment 
 of Covert Ops Essentials. For instance, even though there's a huge amount of information to wade 
 through, the developers neglected to include any kind of hyperlink feature. If you see a topic 
 that you'd like to read more about, or if you remember seeing something you want to get back to, 
 you'll have tough luck finding it. While there  is  a search feature, it's useless to the point 
 of being absurd. Every article appears to have only a handful of keywords associated with it, and 
 the multimedia clips don't have any. For example, the disc includes footage of a 1970 airline hijacking 
 in Amman, Jordan, but neither "Amman" nor "Jordan" will jog the program's memory enough to make 
 it cough up a link to the clip. It should also be mentioned that the escape key, kind of the cornerstone 
 of modern interface design, does absolutely nothing in Essentials. Add in some periodic crashes, 
 and you end up with some potentially interesting information organized and presented so poorly 
 that it's rendered useless.   

  That leaves the second disc, which, according to the box, includes nine new missions. This is only 
 technically true. What's actually included are three new single-player missions and six very small 
 training missions. The three single-player missions are all of high quality. The first one takes 
 place in a jungle. It is the hardest of the three and is made harder by the fact that camouflage 
 hides the terrorists but grants you no reciprocal benefit - they can pick you off as if you're 
 wearing neon-orange hunting gear. The next two missions take place in an Arctic research station 
 and a missile silo in North Dakota. Both are also well done, though much easier than the jungle 
 level.   

  No new weapons are included, the enemy artificial intelligence has not been improved, and the Rogue 
 Spear graphics engine has not been enhanced. The only feature carried over from the Urban Operations 
 mission pack is the excellent defend mode, but it's available on only three of the nine maps.  

  Red Storm announced recently that it would finally release the Rogue Spear map-making tools this 
 November. This means that in the coming months, the active Rogue Spear mod community will start 
 distributing custom maps free of charge, thereby significantly lessening the value of new, officially 
 released Rogue Spear levels. Red Storm's newest Rainbow Six game is a full-priced product, but 
 it contains little more than three decent maps and a mess of unusable information. Therefore, Essentials 
 is anything but.
