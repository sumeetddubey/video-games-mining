:::Review:::
While the core content itself is still plenty good, this port of an Xbox 360 game is weighed down 
 by stability and performance issues. 

  PAM Development delivered a high-quality game of tennis when it originally brought Top Spin 2 to 
 the Xbox 360 a year ago. It wasn't particularly revolutionary, but it offered a flexible character 
 creation system, a playful career mode, first-rate production values, and most importantly, some 
 of the sharpest, most nuanced tennis action to be found anywhere. Aspyr has now brought Top Spin 
 2 to the PC, and although most of what made the Xbox 360 version great remains applicable here, 
 the passing of time and some sloppiness in the translation make it a less impressive package all 
 around.  

         Those weaned on Virtua Tennis may have to adjust to Top Spin 2's more technical style.  
    

  First off, you should know that this is a game that simply  demands  you play it with a gamepad, 
 and unsurprisingly, the Xbox 360 controller proves to be ideal. This necessity is driven by the 
 fact that Top Spin has always offered a slightly more technical game of tennis than Sega's standard-bearing 
 Virtua Tennis franchise, though it's still quite easy to pick up. You've got four basic swings, 
 including the aptly named safe swing, which will never go out of bounds, though the other three 
 shot types require a bit more finesse to keep inside the lines. The slice shot flies low and fast 
 and is great for crossing up your opponent; the topspin shot flies straight and bounces high but 
 moves fast and can slip right past opponents who aren't on their toes; and the lob shot, which 
 should be used sparingly, can be very potent against aggressive opponents apt to ride the net. 

  While the four basic shot types can be used at any time, eight additional swings require some portion 
 of your momentum meter. Momentum is gained and lost naturally as you score points and are scored 
 on and can be used for either risk shots, which take up big chunks of your momentum, or advanced 
 shots, which eat up a more modest amount of momentum. The advanced shots are high-powered versions 
 of your standard swings. Risk shots are even more powerful, but as the name suggests, they're rather 
 risky, too. Holding down the assigned modifier button before you start a swing will bring up a 
 rising power meter, which you need to stop right at the top. If your timing is off, you'll botch 
 the shot and likely give your opponent the upper hand. If you nail it, the ball moves hard and 
 fast and can be difficult to return.  

  As potent as they can be, though, risk shots are usually worth taking only during your first serve, 
 when you have a free pass to hit the net. Otherwise, the stakes are too high, and it's prohibitively 
 difficult to keep an eye on the meter and your opponent while also keeping your player in motion 
 in the middle of the match. While the risk shots still don't have an optimal risk-to-reward ratio, 
 they've been refined a bit since the first Top Spin, and they don't have any ill effect on the 
 rest of the gameplay, which is consistently responsive and, thanks to some aggressive and skilled 
 artificial intelligence, regularly quite intense.  

  Digesting all of the tennis jargon in Top Spin 2 can be a bit much if you don't know the sport, 
 and hopping right into the game's exhibition or tournament modes may give you a bit of a rocky 
 start. It's best, then, that you go into the game's career mode, which does a fine job of casually 
 acclimating you to the nuances of the gameplay as you play. Before you start mastering your smokin'-fast 
 ace serves and humiliating dump shots, though, you'll have to create your own custom tennis pro. 

  In addition to offering basics like gender, age, and nationality, the character creation system 
 in Top Spin 2 gives you rather impressive control over the facial features and physical build of 
 your player and is almost comparable to the character creation system found in 2K Games' The Elder 
 Scrolls IV: Oblivion -- though, as far as we could tell, there's no option to create a crazy magic-adept 
 lizard-man tennis pro in Top Spin 2. Maybe next year! There's kind of an "uncanny valley" thing 
 going on with the facial features. The skin tones often have flat, mannequinlike sheens to them, 
 but the player models still feature a good amount of realistic detail. Despite the support of higher 
 screen resolutions, it can be tougher to make the tennis pro you want in the PC version, as the 
 work-in-progress model you're shown during the creation process is blurry and indistinct, making 
 some of the finer details hard to make out. It's odd, because once you're actually in the game 
 everything is crisp and clear. The animation has also suffered in the translation. There's still 
 some nice subtlety to the players' movements, but the smoothness of the Xbox 360 version has been 
 replaced by erratic choppiness. This isn't just a minor aesthetic problem, as it can affect the 
 timing of the gameplay as well.  

          The players themselves look good, but the animations can look choppy.     

  Once your 
 player is created and dolled up in some appropriately fresh gear from major tennis apparel companies 
 like Adidas, Nike, Wilson, and Lacoste, you'll start your career at the bottom of the barrel with 
 a rank of 200 and a low-level sponsorship. Your goals over the course of your career are to build 
 up your player's skills, rise in the ranks, and rake in an obscene amount of coin. The game progresses 
 a week at a time, and each week has room for one training event, one tournament event, and one 
 special event. The training events should be your primary concern when you first start off -- you 
 won't qualify for most of the tournaments when you first start anyways, and even if you did, the 
 competition will more than likely eat you alive.  

  Training is handled much the same as in the original Top Spin, and the Virtua Tennis games before 
 that, turning the tennis court into the stage for a series of skill-building minigames. Sometimes 
 your task is as simple as hitting specific spots on the court a number of times, but more often 
 than not, you'll be hitting balls into rows of giant dominoes, bowling balls, gigantic tennis balls, 
 and towering walls made out of translucent bricks. The variety of training games you'll encounter 
 over the course of your career has increased since the first Top Spin, and it's a change that helps 
 make the career mode here much more compelling -- while training has been a little tedious in the 
 past, the variety and the novelty of the minigames here makes training something to look forward 
 to. Successfully completing a training event nets you stars that you can apply to up to three of 
 the 11 different attributes, techniques, and skills that define your player's performance.     
 

  But training events cost money. Eventually you'll run out of money, and the only way to get back 
 into the black is to participate in and win tournaments. You'll start off competing in minor regional 
 tournaments, which are often held in extremely inauspicious locales such as community centers or 
 outdoor public courts, and go all the way up to centre court at Wimbledon. Aside from the distraction 
 of stands filled with thousands of tennis fans watching you during a grand slam event, you'll find 
 that the kind of surface you're playing on will affect the speed of the game. There are subtle 
 atmospheric differences between the courts, too, such as the casual poolside chatter you'll hear 
 when playing at a Mediterranean resort, the international announcers you'll hear at different venues, 
 the way tennis shoes will squeak across a hardwood floor, or the way a player's grunt will echo 
 in a large stadium (it's just too bad that there isn't a greater variety of grunt sounds) . Additionally, 
 no matter where you go, you'll be treated to the same generic rock and hip-hop Muzak over and over 
 again.  

          Despite some technical problems and unfortunate camera angles, Top Spin 2 is a good-looking 
 tennis game.     

  Winning or even placing well in a tournament will increase your rank, which will in turn open up 
 bigger and better tournaments to you and will also garner you invites to special events. Before 
 you know it, you'll be playing for your country in special international events, getting invitations 
 to play in private matches for the amusement of wealthy bon vivants, putting on exhibition matches 
 for your incredibly grateful sponsors, and trading barbs with rival players.  

  The career mode goes on for years and years, and if you chose to play every last match yourself, 
 it could take that long to finish it. Taking a cue from the lengthy career/dynasty/franchise modes 
 found in nearly any other serious professional-sport game, Top Spin 2 will regularly let you simulate 
 your matches, and it does it on a surprisingly granular level. You can choose to simulate an entire 
 tournament, all the way down to a single game. So, if you want to step onto the court only when 
 it looks like you might lose otherwise, Top Spin 2 makes it possible.  

  If you'd rather not invest yourself in the career mode, or you'd rather play against someone with 
 a pulse, Top Spin 2 has several options for you. Exhibition matches are available from the main 
 menu, and you can choose both your player and your opponent from dozens of today's hottest tennis 
 stars, including current top-ranked players like Roger Federer, Andy Roddick, Maria Sharapova, 
 and Lindsay Davenport. You can also build your own custom tournament, which lets you choose the 
 number of both real and AI players involved, the venue, and the name of the event.  

  Both the exhibition and tournament modes allow for multiplayer action, though Top Spin 2 also features 
 some multiplayer-only modes. The party games are somewhat similar to the training minigames in 
 that they put a wild spin on conventional tennis. Time bomb sees you trying to score points to 
 slow down your own countdown clock; wall breaker challenges you to knock down your opponent's wall 
 of boxes while protecting your own; and splash court covers portions of the court in paint whenever 
 a point is scored. Additionally, Top Spin 2 includes online support for up to four players, though 
 the match options are pretty bland and include only the most basic match types. Also, you can play 
 online ranked matches only with a custom tennis pro, which means you'll have to spend a lot of 
 time in the career mode if you intend to compete seriously online. The online play in Top Spin 
 2 could and should have been much more fleshed out.  

          Top Spin 2 all but requires a gamepad to play right.     

  While it didn't do a lot 
 of technical grandstanding, Top Spin 2 was a sharp-looking game when it appeared last year on the 
 Xbox 360, and all told it still holds up pretty nicely on the PC a year later, though we did experience 
 some strange texture dropout issues. Player portraits would disappear, player clothing would appear 
 as black, and in the strangest occurrence, entire player models would lack any texture at all, 
 making them look as if they just fell out of an iPod ad. The most egregious problem with the presentation 
 also happens to be one of the most basic, and is carried over from the Xbox 360 version. When you're 
 playing solo, rather than being able to keep your player on the side of the court closest to the 
 camera, you'll regularly find yourself on the far side of the court, which presents some frustrating 
 perspective issues. Your only option is to switch to the zoom camera, which is lower and closer 
 to the player. It can take some getting used to, but it's definitely preferable to playing on the 
 back side of the court.  

  Technical hiccups aside, Top Spin 2 for the PC is still a good game of tennis, and its $19.99 price 
 tag makes it that much more attractive. But it definitely has its flaws, the majority of which 
 are so head-shakingly clear-cut it's hard to understand how they made it into a product that is 
 otherwise pretty well thought out. If you haven't cared for tennis games in the past, Top Spin 
 2 won't change your mind, but if you enjoy the genre, you'll be hard-pressed to find much better 
 on the PC.

Review:  There is no need for an indepth analysis: top spin 2 is great just not on PC. Crashes, lags and 
 has horrible controls.

Review:  If you like tennis or even play tennis , you will be impress with the hitting motion of the players 
 , it is amazing. 
  Starting a career is fun since you have to struggle your way to the top and this ain't easy. The 
 first years of your career you will play minor tournaments with no crowd almost.
  
  At the start, you can't play the big tournaments since your rankings is so low. So you slowly win 
 minor tournaments and improve on your ranking.
  
  You also pick a coach (all of them have different specialities) and get better with training.
 
  The reality in the backhands and forehands spins are just amazing. Even the movements of the player's 
 body goes with it.
  
  The controls are good BUT it is tuff to do advanced shots during the game against good players. 
 
  
  All game have weaknesses though and this one is kinda funny.
  Computer players almost never miss a first serve, we know that ain't the case in real life.
  
 If you are beating a good player suddenly out of the blue she starts serving over 100mph when she 
 has never done it in the entire match once.
  
  Overall , it is an amazing game. Have fun

Review:  Top spin 2
  
  Top spin is awesome tennis simulation. It is continue of Top spin which was good, but had some 
 mistakes. Here you find about 200 tennis players, but only the first 10-15 are licensed (real) . 
 If you play career, on beginning you play for greenhorn, whose abilities in the process improve, 
 what is doesnt mean that you beat Roddick with one hand beside backbone when you finished first 
 season. On begining game is slow little bit, you are not very good player you are on the end of 
 200 rank, so you always must train and go on tournament which are not so famous as for example 
 Grand Slams etc. Your character you can improve helpfully some mini games (shooting to the wall, 
 snipering some things ) . As time goes you stabilise your player on more types of court (clay, 
 grass etc.) .
  
  Instead of others tennis simulation you can play tournament in doubles. On begining is tennis surprisingly 
 hard, although you win some worse tournament but when you go on better you lose very easily. Lately 
 as you will be better and your tennis character improve himself you got some sponsors adverts or 
 things like that.
  
  You have four types of shots (top spin, lob, slice, spin) , but last two are very hard for beginner, 
 they demanded good stand of you character etc. In this way you the useful for beginner is the first 
 two but later you learn all. AI of your opponents is very good, your opponent know when he want 
 lob you or something else. The difficulty is as time goes harder and harder. The biggest mistake 
 is insane, stupid controlling, without game pad you cannot win any match. So if you have not gamepad 
 and dont want buy new one this game isnt for you.
  
  The good/bad:
  Good:1. sponsors, trainers
  2. rank of tennis players (more players than is it usually in others 
 tennis sim. etc.) .
  3. lots of tournaments
  4. improving of players
  5. freedom
  6. realistics
  
  Bad:1. STUPID controlling your players
  2. your standing when you want to hit 
 some harder type of shot
  
  This tennis is probably the best of all tennis simulation now on market. If you enjoy sports sim 
 this game is for you. Mistake is only that you need to have a gamepad. I enjoyed this game very 
 well with my friends in multi-player, and multi-player is next good thing, if you wouldnt like 
 single-player, multi-player is maybe for you (is great and funny, too) . This game comprises about 
 whopping 200 tennis players what is obviously the biggest number in tennis sim. I consider this 
 game one of the best sim this year and I emphasize if continue of this game will have better controlling 
 it will be great game. Simply this tennis is the best tennis simulation released and has almost 
 all great. And now it is bargain, isnt it?

Review:  Ah, tennis games. There's something strangely satisfying in the simple pure act of running from 
 one side of a screen to the other while hopelessly trying to hit back a ball. Such simplicity appeals 
 to most gamers sensibilities, requiring the use of the most basic of a gamer's senses: reflexes. 
 The makers of Pong understood this (well that and their hardware was a LITTLE limited) . Yes, Tennis 
 games are just glorified Pong but I mean this in the best possible way. Top Spin 2 is no exception 
 though it is, naturally, rather a little more sophisticated in it's execution and approach. I've 
 never played the first one so you'll forgive me if I don't draw any comparisons to it (in fact 
 the last tennis game I remember significantly playing was Chris Evert and Ivan Lendl Top Players' 
 Tennis... if you know anything about tennis you'll remember when was the last time these tennis 
 players were top players, which then gets you to ponder, where have all these years gone? That's 
 assuming you were even born back then....) from what I've heard the first was significantly better 
 but since ignorance is bliss, I think this game's pretty dope. If I can use such an early 90's 
 term to describe a game that isn't Chris Evert and Ivan Lendl Top Players Tennis. Which I probably 
 can't..
  
  A very good character creation system to start with, though because I was failing so hard at recreating 
 myself I decided to recreate the kind of girl I wish I was dating. To complete your look, throughout 
 the career mode you can buy many different clothes, rackets (though the difference is purely cosmetic, 
 they all handle the same) , accessories and such to outfit your tennis star to suit your fashion 
 sensibilities. Well.... limited to tennis court fashion, naturally (if you're anything like me tennis 
 fashion sensibilites means the shorter the skirt, the better) . Then off to the court you go. Or 
 to the training court...
  
  A season is represented by 52 weeks (if you know anything about years, that's how many weeks there 
 are in any given one) and you chose what tournaments (minor, major or grand slam) you want to participate 
 in (well if you're ranked good enough to participate in them in the first place, unless you're 
 ranked well enough, you'll have to take parts in qualification rounds for the grand slam tournaments) . 
 Or if you'd rather train. Training involves taking part in different sort of challenges which are 
 basically mini-games, each of them focusing on different attributes and shots. Successfully completing 
 these will gain you points in those specific attributes. Some of these challenges are rather hard 
 but it is also possible to gain skill points just by winning matches so failing the training challenges 
 doesn't mean you're not gonna get any better though it will slow down your climb to the higher 
 ranks. Training costs money though which is where winning tournaments comes in handy. Throughout 
 the seasons you can also get to participate in special events, charity matches, mixed doubles, 
 etc. Winning those matches is a good and quick way to better your skills. Or to sometimes make 
 a lot of money. The game will assign you a rival from the start of your career, a computer created 
 character, a fellow countryman whose identity will as such depend on what country you hail from, 
 and who will constantly follow you in the rankings and in it's attributes (if you suck, they'll 
 suck, if you're the bee's knees, they'll be the bee's like, thighs, just to have one up on you) . 
 My take on this? A little contrived, ridiculous and annoying. You'll face this rival often. You 
 will come to hate him/her. You will come to wish there was a way to behead your opponent with some 
 special shot. You will painfully come to the realisation that there isn't..
  
  The on-court action is realistic enough. You don't have to press the button in a too timely fashion 
 to hit the ball, as soon as your opponent hits it, just hitting the button corresponding to the 
 kind of swing you want to make will cause your character to run towards the ball and hit it with 
 the best of it's ability. You still have to very much mind your positioning on the court because 
 even if your character is doing the running for you, if it's too far from the ball, it won't make 
 it (well unless your speed is maxed out then it might have a chance) . It's maybe less visceral 
 this way but no less satisfying, and probably a lot less frustrating. Which isn't to say the game 
 doesn't require good reflexes and concentration and isn't a challenge. It is, very much. And unless 
 you develop your skills and learn which specific move to use and when, well you'll be stuck like 
 me, boosting your speed and strength as fast as you can so that you can beat your opponents based 
 on pure physicality rather than skill and fancy moves. It's a lot harder this way. After three 
 seasons I finally cracked the top ten only to find out two seasons later that the game forces you 
 to retire after 5 years. I was a little mad. And disappointed. I'd have went for at least 5 more. 
 But that is basically the only gripe I have with the game. Some swings you can use are called risk 
 shots and to use these you need to have your momentum meter filled up some. Naturally you gain 
 momentum by winning points or sets. Still even with the momentum meter filled up these risk shots 
 ARE indeed risky and require good timing and a good understanding of the shots and when it's best 
 to use them. Here's Milk's tip of the day: You can very well get by without ever using them. But 
 don't tell the developers that. It would probably annoy them..
  
  Graphics and sound get the job done, the character models are detailed, crisp and clean, the animations 
 are pretty good though I hear this version (PC) has less fluid transitions than in it's 360 version. 
 The sound is exactly what you'd expect from a real tennis match, that is really all there is to 
 say about it. Oh wait... the songs in the menus. Well, all i can say is, I'm sympathetic to your 
 plight if you pick this game up. Yes, they will grate your ears, invade your brain and nearly ruin 
 your sanity. You will wake up singing the chorus one morning and will want to die for it (and hope 
 no one heard you) . But there is hope. It's been a few months since I last played it and I can only 
 faintly remember how the song goes. You'll heal, in time. The damage will not be irreversible...
 
  
  In any case, Top Spin 2 offers a solid and realistic tennis experience. It basically comes down 
 to, do you like tennis or not? Even if you don't, like stated earlier, you might very well like 
 this game because tennis games simplicity appeals to most gamers sensibilites.

Review:  I like the first top spin alot, really a true 3d tennis comes that is very additive, but this sequence 
 was a big big dissapoting in everyway i can think of, i don't think pc take all the blames, faults 
 from gameplay, to simple pc setup, i had a very powerful gamerig i experience extreme lag when 
 i put 1600x1200 this is real issue, i had no lag when i put max setting in bioshock, who design 
 this game in pc? what is going on, and graphic isn't t that great look, i think firs to spin in 
 xbox looks better. Gameplay was extreme letdown, they change too much in the gameplay engine, the 
 AI is insane, even at easy level. I mean the player are pro right, and alot fo time they had issue 
 sinoke surfing and hit the ball back first time, what a shame.

Review:  I've always liked the sport of Tennis, and played games such as Virtua Tennis, and while I was 
 playing trash I did not know until I played Top Spin 1 on the PC. It blew me away, with a player 
 creator unseen, and graphics that were high on standard. Top Spin 1 truly has it all. And therefore 
 it seemed to me that a sequel would be even better... But I was wrong
  
  Top Spin 2 has more pro players, bigger levels, a deeper carrier mode and lots of other stuff, 
 but man it really lacks in gameplay and originality. Lets be straight here my system is not a bad 
 one. Athlon 3500+ 2 Gigz og Ram, ASUS EN7300GE with 256 MB dedicated, running on XP .
  
  I have played games such as Oblivion with almost full tilt video configuration, but Oblivion is 
 a full blooded PC game. Top Spin 2 on the other hand isn't!
  
  It runs like hell, with graphics that look silly, it is the worst port I have ever played. Compared 
 to Top Spin 1 which is a 10 times better XboX port on the PC. Not even the new player creator can 
 save this band port from just being BAD!
  
  As for the game it recycles old elements from the original game, which I think sucks, and is a 
 sign of bad production... Hmm when is Top Spin 3 coming out?? I might buy an XboX 360 and try the 
 original, but this pile of crappy porting will stay out of my PC.

Review:  i think the only bad point that affects the game quality THE MOST is the graphic quality it offers, 
 comparing to the xbox version of this game. the gameplay is good, the game is fun, but the horrible 
 graphical issues are unforgivable. the game pushes ur computer even though it shouldn't, considering 
 its bad graphic quality. this is very annoying as the only solution is to have the lowest graphic 
 setting, which sometimes doesnt even help. the sound is horrible. but the worst part is STILL the 
 graphic... look at the ball when it flies, it looks more like a green egg to me! the characters 
 are badly shown.... i must say this game is a total let down for everyone who's been waiting for 
 the PC version of this game instead i recommend virtua tennis 3, which is way more enjoyable than 
 this game

Review:  Trust me, I have been playing computer games for a looooong time; from way back in the Commodore 
 64 days... I have played just about every tennis game there is for the computer and even some on 
 the consoles. The ones on the consoles were always much better by miles. I like tennis games; they 
 can be fun and addicting if done right... This is by far the only one to get it right for the PC. 
 The graphics are pretty good when they are close up and of the courts. The camera angles though 
 really kinda suck... I do not know why the camera won't rotate to whatever side you are on; it is 
 fine when you are playing on the bottom, but then stays there while u go up top to the other side. 
 You can do the zoom camera so it switches sides with u, but it is almost impossible to always play 
 in zoom since the shots are at such angles that u won't see the ball and the camera doesn't seem 
 to keep up as well on zoomed mode. The game is fun and really tough a great challenge; all the 
 ones in the past for the PC had been so ez it was ridiculous; once u figured out the controls then 
 the game was over... u could always get the computer out of wack for ez shots, but not in ths game; 
 u really have to EARN your points and it feels good when you actually win a point like you really 
 earned it... the carrer mode is where the game is at... with training and lotso of matches... this 
 game will take you a very long time to climb the ladder and to get all your skills up. Lots of 
 replay value here. I have not played the multiplayer yet, but I can see that could be some good 
 fun. In carrer mode your guy will relaly feel fluggish in the begging before you build up his speed... 
 Finally a good tennis game for the pc,, I hope they make more good tennis games for the PC like 
 this one... If you have been waiting for a really good tennis game for the PC then get this one 
 for sure..

Review:  Nothing to say. That's my say: I WONT FORGIVE BAD PORTED X360 GAMES TO PC. What does the company 
 of a poorly ported game like this think, when they realize the game ? I know the answer:
  
  Well, the game runs very badly in the PC, but since there will be great gpus like 8800 gtx and 
 great cpus like intel quad, we will launch it anyway. **** performance. **** Optimization. We will 
 launch it because we want it avaliable for PCs. And you, PC lover, I'm sorry, but many games will 
 behave like that. Great examples are DIRT and SPLINTER CELL DA. Now is Top Spin 2.

Review:  effects off, but it still looks great anyway. I tried the game with the mouse and keyboard and 
 couldn't make it work for me. The game pad changes all that and is very similar in feel to the 
 Tennis Masters series except there are more choices to pick from. I took the tutorial and like 
 others have said it is pretty weak. For me the exhibition matches were good training on the easy 
 setting, and then I moved back to the normal setting, which is really pretty hard, but fun. I'm 
 losing sets in the normal difficulty, but ther'e getting closer. Once I started mixing up the shots, 
 I started winning some points. I dont know if I'm always making the best decisions, but the stiff 
 learning curve has me coming back for more. Sometimes I'll pick a shot that justs kicks butt as 
 a winner, and I will have trouble repeating the same shot until many points down the road. There 
 are a couple minor gripes, like the far court view for example. It seems to require you to mentally 
 think the controls against what you were doing with the near court perspective. The momemtum meter 
 is cool, but whats it doing? Is it making your a. i. opponent more tired and slower or is just helping 
 on your own control inputs to be faster and more precise? Neither of these gripes that big a deal 
 though.
  
  I've started the carreer mode and it looks promising but once again it also looks like its going 
 to take some work to move up the ranks, but that's ok.
  The difficulty keeps it interesting. But its not just difficulty, it's the simulated tennis game-play 
 tactics that also make it fun, and a little frustrating. I usually play shooters, but once in while 
 a good sports game grabs me and this one has. Kudos to the Aspire team and its been well worth 
 my 20 dollars.

Review:  With all the previous tennis titles that graced the PC, this is a winner so far. The graphics are 
 an overall improvement and pleasing to the eye. The sounds are very good on court, but annoying 
 and distracting as a spectator continues to talk during match play. With a series of patches to 
 fix the minor bugs this game could be a sleeper hit. Graphics are choppy with the shadows and special 
 effects enabled, but smooth out very well with them disabled. Controls are not that responsive, 
 but that is unfair since I a Recoil gamepad which is one of the worst ever. I plan to buy an X-Box 
 360 controller to solve that problem. Load times are fairly quick. If your PC is up to date with 
 SLI your should have very little problem running this title. I highly recommend this title for 
 serious Tennis fans. Top Spin 2 will test your true tennis skills as your learn a good amount of 
 shots like the slice, drop shot, lob, and a variant of high risk shots of all 3. This games will 
 require the use of more than one or two buttons to gain the victory.

Review:  I have played tennis for 9 years now and I love it. However, this is the first tennis game I have 
 ever bought. Why? There are very few tennis games released compared to other sports, and the quality 
 of most of these games is mediocre at best. However, I was impressed by what I saw of Top Spin 
 2 after factoring in the 20 dollar price tag I figured I may as well try it out.
  
  Top Spin 2 is a very well made game and well worth 20 bucks. It is very addictive - the sort of 
 game that you play for hours, then get an urge to start up again 20 minutes after you turn it off. 
 Not only is it an accurate tennis simulation, it is a lot of fun to play, and career mode provides 
 a fair bit of replay value to boot.
  
  This game is an excellent tennis simulation. The physics model is very good - players move as quickly 
 as you would expect professional tennis players to run. Shot selection is intuitive and not overly 
 complicated - you can hit a safe, slice, topspin, and lob shot along with advanced shots which 
 you need momentum for and risk shots for which you have to line up a rising meter much like for 
 a serve. The longer you hold the button the more powerful the shot will be, and the harder you 
 press on your joystick to aim the more angle (or depth) the shot will have. Of course, if you press 
 or push too hard the shot will go out. Playing through a fair amount of matches at this point, 
 I feel like the shots are well balanced. That is, it isn't prohibitively difficult to aim shots 
 without them going out once you get a feel for the controls, but making an unforced error is always 
 a possibility. Admittedly, the game is pretty tricky to master. Proper timing is very important, 
 and it actually helps to know real tennis strategy when playing matches at higher AI settings. 
 The learning curve certainly isn't impossible, but it is steep enough that a friend playing the 
 game for the first time won't be able to provide much challenge to an experienced player.
  
  The two main modes that you will find yourself playing are either exhibition or career mode. 
 Exhibition is just what it sounds like. You can play a singles or doubles match using either the 
 24 licensed professional male and female tennis players and/or your own custom made players loaded 
 from career mode. You can choose to play best of 1, 3 or 5 sets and between 1 and 6 games per set, 
 and of course you have a pretty broad range of stadiums in which to play. These include the Court 
 1s of all four Grand Slams as well as courts from several Tennis Masters Series events, courts 
 for major and minor tournaments (which you can actually play in career mode) and playground courts 
 that don't even have chair umps or linesmen. In career mode, you create a player who begins as 
 the 200th ranked player in the world, and attempt to achieve the #1 ranking, winning Grand Slams, 
 getting better and better endorsement deals, and earning money along the way. Endorsements are 
 actually pretty cool, because they managed to include a mind-boggling amount of real tennis merchandise 
 from famous brands in the game. For instance, you can buy your character a Babolat racquet of a 
 Lacoste shirt or Prince shoes and you will actually see accurate depictions of real products. The 
 level of competition rises as you play higher level tournaments. I can win minor league tournaments 
 without dropping a set, but the first time I played Roger Federer, he took me out 0, 1 and 1 at 
 the Australian Open. It's also worth mentioning that the character creation options are pretty 
 impressive. You can design a completely unique face for your character, and the models I've made 
 have come out looking almost like real players.
  
  Another plus to the game are the graphics. All of the player animations are smooth and the player 
 models in the game are really pretty amazing. The stadiums are rendered quite accurately, and there 
 are even little touches like players throwing their racquets and pumping their fists after points.
 
  
  This is not to say that the game is without issues. The graphics are very nice, but they require 
 some serious processing power. I literally have to have the game on the lowest possible setting 
 to play on my 2 year old machine. If you read some of the other reviews on here, you'll find that 
 even people with relatively new machines have difficulty playing the game on high graphics settings. 
 Meanwhile, the sound is arguably the weakest part of the game. As the Gamespot reviewer notes, 
 the menu music is pretty crappy, generic rock, and although there are neat touches like chair umps 
 speaking in the language of the country in which a tournament is located, I feel like there is 
 otherwise a fairly small amount of on-court sound effects. If you play a match on the playground 
 courts the crappy rock music plays in the background. This is really annoying and you can't turn 
 it off. Also, the game does suffer from stability issues and has crashed occasionally on my computer. 
 These crashes are fairly infrequent, but they are pretty annoying as they tend to happen in the 
 middle of matches. I'm hoping that a patch will address this problem. Also, the manual is pretty 
 sparse. The learning curve might not have been as bad, but the manual doesn't tell you much other 
 than which button does which shot. It took me a while to figure out how to aim a non-safe serve, 
 and when you can hit which special shots (the manual made it sound as though you need momentum 
 for both advanced and risk shots when in fact you only need them for advanced shots.) The last 
 major issue in my opinion is the licensing in the game. As I mentioned, there are 24 actual pros 
 whose names and likenesses appear in the game - 12 men and 12 women. Not only do I kinda wish that 
 there were more, the decisions as to which pros should be included are a bit bizarre. For example, 
 while Maria Sharapova, Amelie Mauresmo and Venus Williams are (obviously) included, Serena Williams 
 and Justine Henin are missing. On the men's side, you have guys like Sebastien Grosjean, Carlos 
 Moya and Tim Henman who, while stars in their prime, are pretty washed up at this point, yet players 
 like Rafael Nadal, David Nalbandian and Andy Murray are curiously omitted.
  
  All in all, though, this is a great tennis game. Its shortcomings are honestly few and far between, 
 and the bottom line is that it delivers a solid, realistic, and fun game of tennis. The sort of 
 experience that can substitute for a real game of tennis on a day when you can't find anyone to 
 play against. The medium and hard AIs provide a decent challenge, and you can also play against 
 humans online or with multiple controllers in one computer for maximum replayability. And, for 
 20 bucks, it's a pretty good deal. It's a bit of a shame that it doesn't seem to be selling very 
 well at the moment, and I would highly encourage this game if you have at least a passing interest 
 in tennis - or even if you don't. You won't be disappointed.

Review:  First of all i want to begin this review by saying that the game is not optimised very well and 
 that if you computer is out of date then be sure it is going to lag. I have an core2duo E6400 with 
 and ati radeon X1900XT with 2 gigs ddr2 ram running under vista ultimate and let me tell you that 
 the game is going slow by times. Now this game looks fantastic, i mean it looks really nextgen 
 even if it doesnt look like the 360 version but it is pretty close. The game doesnt support widescreen 
 some if that is a matter with you dont get it but even in normal resolution it still looks good (my 
 screen resolution is widescreen) .
  The sound is pretty good and the gameplay is one of the best i ever played, and you need a gamepad 
 if you want to play this game the way it is meant to be played ( with vibration) . All and all this 
 is a pretty good game and average port and i will recommand to anybody that love tennis and want 
 to play it on there pc and for 19.99 it is almost a bargain so just get it and be happy.

Review:  I was a huge fan of the Original Top Spin. I dont have a 360 yet so I have not played Top Spin 
 2 until this PC version. I do not have a 360 controller but am using a Saitek Rumble pad that works 
 pretty well even though I dont like this controller very much for any game. So far I agree with 
 the review but want to hit on the graphics issue in a little more depth. My setup is a 3800+ single 
 OCed to 2.54 GHz, 1 GIG RAM, and a 6800GT. I know this system is getting out of date but still 
 plays games like Oblivion etc. quite well with the right balance of settings. Well this game is 
 unplayable in 1280x1024 which is the res I have played every game in for the past 3 years. It is 
 just very choppy. So I am playing it in 1024x768 and it just does not look very good on my 1280x1024 
 native LCD. The main problem I have with this is there are VERY few graphics options to be able 
 to tweak it to look better in 1280x1024. About the only thing you can adjust are shadows and 3 
 levels of crowd detail, and special effects being on or off. None of these seem to affect the game 
 very much and so you are left having to lower the res. I dont know it this game is using bloom 
 or HDR, it kind of looks like its bloom but they give you no way to turn that off if so. That right 
 there would make the game much smoother on older video cards.
  
  Like the GS review and one other users review hinted at this game will still get choppy and hiccup 
 on pretty good cards like a 7950GT etc. This game just chugs on all but top systems. I really hope 
 they come out with a patch to fix this or add more graphics options you can turn off / down to 
 make it run better. Because for the price of an 8800GTS I could almost buy a 360 where the game 
 would look and run better anyway! So why would I buy an expensive new GPU just to play the PC version 
 of this game? I guess I wouldnt.
  
  Bottom line, unless you have a very good system, I would say at least a 7950GT or better GPU, you 
 will be frustrated with this games performance and choppiness in any res larger than 1024x768. 
 If you have a lesser GPU than a 6800GT I would not even try this game as it would be choppy even 
 in 1024x786!

Review:  Well finally got this game loaded up, 360 controller for windows works without a hitch. My first 
 impression of the game is similiar to when I played it on the 360, not bad but not quite as fun 
 as the first top spin. Surprising this game appears to be putting as much strain on my system as 
 oblivion?! Yeah if you dont have a top graphics card and processor this game will be unplayable. 
 I notice a few hitches here and there but not bad on my 8800 gts-core 2 duo e6600. I'm guessing 
 this game needs a serious patch in the near future cause this game is not graphically superior 
 to other pc titiles. Thankfully the game comes on a DVD and not 10 cds!!!!! Game cost only $20 
 but may look out for virtua tennis next and see how well it does....

Review:  Es un buen juego, incluye muchas cosas que no hacen otros juegos de tennis y la dificultad es adecuada. 
 Le falta tener mas elementos de un juego de manager, ahi estaria completo. Le falta para ser el 
 mejor juego de tennis.
  Lo positivo, buena grafica y la dificultad es adecuada al tennista con el que se juega, es decir, 
 es dificil ganarle a Federer si aun eres 60 del mundo, hay posibilidades, pero es dificil.
  Lo que eche de menos, es el cansansio de los jugadores, es dificil llegar a la final de Australia 
 y luego estar 100% para el partido siguiente, son cosas no altamente importantes, pero si un detalle 
 a considerar.
  Un buen juego, altamente recomendable.
