:::Review:::
The game is far too short, and the puzzles would be easy for even the most novice gamers. 

 Timeline is based on the Michael Crichton novel of the same name and was developed by Timeline 
 Computer Entertainment. This cozy relationship doesn't bode well for the game. In fact, it's hard 
 to understand what Timeline is supposed to be. It borrows good ideas from many different action 
 games, but it isn't very fun. It's based on a lengthy page-turner; yet, it manages to include very 
 little story of its own. And it is so short and easy that it seems like little more than a tutorial 
 for a better game.   

  As Timeline begins, you are being trained in the protocols and procedures for time travel. You 
 are Chris Hughes, a graduate student who must travel to 14th-century France to rescue his professor. 
 The game skips much of the buildup in the book, including the pseudoscience that explains the theory 
 of time travel, the suspense that leads up to the disappearance of the professor, and any explanation 
 of just who these characters are. You are simply thrust into a world where time travel is possible, 
 and you are about to do it.   

  Once you reach 14th-century France, a major setback threatens to cause problems with your mission 
 plan. In any other game, this would be the event that triggers a whole series of events. But in 
 Timeline, it seems to have little impact at all on your mission. Much of the game is like this: 
 Some significant event occurs, which would seem to be the start of a clever new twist, only to 
 be resolved within a few moments. For instance, at one point in the game, your character is shrunk 
 down in size to a mere three inches tall. It's an interesting development, but it's over within 
 minutes of occurring.   

  Timeline's structure doesn't lend itself to player involvement. It plays like a first-person shooter, 
 though the actual action is more reminiscent of platform games like Rayman 2. The game is broken 
 into chapters: Each chapter is short, and each consists of one easily accomplished task. When you 
 first get to France, you'll need to slide down a hill, all the while avoiding rocks. Later, you'll 
 need to joust in a tournament. Still later, you'll need to climb across rafters to a window. There 
 aren't many chapters, and the whole game actually won't take more than an hour or two to finish. 
 Each task is short and easy, and it's hard to imagine anyone needing more than a couple of attempts 
 at any of them. The fact that the chapters are so distinct is somewhat jarring, so that at times 
 it seems as if Timeline is just a collection of scenes from different action games.   

  The combat sequences in Timeline are poor. Timeline borrows a bit from Looking Glass Studios' Thief: 
 The Dark Project; you are warned early in the game that you aren't allowed to kill anyone. You 
 are given weapons that are meant to stun, not kill. But you'll learn quickly that avoiding fatal 
 conflict isn't really an issue. Instead of having to sneak past potentially violent encounters, 
 you'll find that it's simply impossible to kill anyone. Even in swordplay against the main villains 
 (who, again, are never really introduced or established) , your opponent simply surrenders if you 
 win the fight. And why there are "stun arrows" lying around in 14th-century France is never explained. 
   

  Yet perhaps the most disheartening thing about Timeline is its almost complete lack of story. There's 
 a bit of setup and a few small twists along the way - but unless you've read the novel, which is 
 included with the game, it's doubtful you'll have any idea why anything is happening, who any of 
 these people are, or, most importantly, why you should care. The game does have a tour mode, which 
 doesn't develop the story, but it does reveal a little about the time period. Crichton himself 
 narrates and explains the customs of 14th-century France as you walk around the game's locales. 
 It's an interesting history lesson, but it adds little to the game.   

  The graphics in Timeline are fairly good though somewhat bland, and the engine renders outdoor 
 environments particularly well. The voice acting is good, though your sidekick's habit of explaining 
 exactly what you should be doing makes the game even easier than it already is.   

  Even if it's meant to be an action game for nongamers, Timeline isn't very successful. The game 
 is far too short, and the puzzles would be easy for even the most novice gamers. There are some 
 interesting ideas that crop up occasionally, but they, like everything in Timeline, aren't given 
 enough time to develop. When the game is over, which is very quickly, you'll hardly remember a 
 thing about it.

Review:  Yes, it is old. And has old clumsy graphics. But i feel it good balanced, it has the right and 
 time-correct puzzles and a great and taking music. Also the quests are not too long (that's a plus 
 here! it drives the game-action quite good) and the give you a good medieval feeling. Great to 
 mount a horse and fight a real tournament :) And it has other time-typical features and feelings. 
 Not at least that you are not supposed to kill your enemy if he surrenders! I like that a lot!
 
  The whole plot is unusual, diving into history, sneaking around a castle in the original time... 
 The whole thought is chilling. Yes, it could be great of course to have a modern game with up to 
 date graphics of that kind! But until then this is a top-favorite for me (and could last as this 
 for it's cult-status :) 
  As i said: Great unusual plot, all right with background information, good enough speed of the 
 race for me and really great music!
  It really IS plain fun again and again :)

Review:  First thing about gameplay is that the games keys are simple. Most of the time you just walk around 
 sometimes pick up things (you even get to fire a bow) and you solve easy puzzles. 
  
  Graphics are rather good, actually they are the best thing in the game. Terrain looks good and 
 they brought the medieval times to life.
  
  Sound is well, it fits in the game. If the game is boring the sound will be 2 right?
  
  Value 
 is really bad... i spent 4 hours completing the game and i never played it again. So from that 
 point of wiew it sucks.
  
  Overall, i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone but given the fact it sells for maybe 5 dollars 
 these days you might as well buy it if you see it. I believe that you are going to have a good 
 time for at least a few hours.

Review:  Viewed in a vacuum, as many gamers obviously do, this game is short and simplistic. If you would 
 invest the time to read the back-story (yes, this would involve actual reading of something that's 
 not a game review) by reading Michael Crichton's novel of the same name, the game is a lot of fun.
 
  
  The novel is a great deal more exciting than about half of all the computer games reviewed on this 
 site, so that's really not such a bad proposition.
  
  I found one jumping puzzle to be a boring waste of time, just because the control is imprecise, 
 but you can save anywhere so you don't have to start at the beginning of some long sequence to 
 take another shot at it. There are also several tour sequences that actually are very educational, 
 but in the guise of game background they aren't offensive.
  
  I know some gamers will be playing Madden 2024 before they will actually read a novel, but you 
 have no idea what you're missing. Buy this game, check the book out from a library. You will be 
 glad you did.
