Will Carrier Strike Fighter, like Falcon and Tank Platoon II, rise above its initial shoddy release 
 to become a classic? 

 "At least they tried" will be Interactive Magic's epitaph. At least they tried to compete against 
 the major sim companies. At least they tried to create a new 3D graphics engine in-house, starting 
 from scratch and with limited internal development capability at the beginning. At least they tried 
 to create realistic sims for the hard-core market, building a knowledgeable design team and proceeding 
 with the best intentions.  

 Now that its second-and-a-half title is out, it's clear that Interactive Magic has failed. But it 
 failed grandly and accomplished some major feats of design. It failed because the designers were 
 let down by the programmers and testers. And it's a shame, because it didn't need to happen.  

 
 iF/A-18 is, in many ways, an excellent and superlative sim, from a purely modeling standpoint. 
 If you just put the Super Hornet through its paces, it feels incredible, from the systems to the 
 physics. This is a hard-core flight model that will please even the most jaded of sim fans, because 
 its realistic elements not only create a sense that you're flying the real thing, but also directly 
 affect the way you approach the missions and play the game. Its agility and speed are re-created 
 in detail, as well as its degraded performance with heavy loads. The sensors and MFDs feel just 
 right in full realism mode, with performance limitations and environmental variables. It feels 
 good, like a flight model should.  

 There are also plenty of gameplay options and features, enough to keep you flying for a long time 
 and with a wide array of missions. Interactive Magic's excellent dynamic campaign system is back 
 and improved, with mid-East and Aegean theaters of operation. Each campaign generates new mission 
 sets based on the current battlefield situation, creating an experience that is never the same 
 twice. Training, single missions, instant action, custom missions, and multiplayer round out the 
 gameplay options as fully as anyone could want. I tested two-person multiplayer and found it stable 
 and acceptable.  

 The main interface is greatly improved, as it should be considering that its military-base graphics 
 are almost identical to Longbow's. There are numerous setting and realism options, full keyboard 
 remapping, and plenty of background material, all laid out in an easy and attractive format. The 
 strong visuals of the menu do not, however, extend to the game itself. Object modeling is good, 
 but not great. Terrain modeling is a matter of taste. Some find the DEMON engine's satellite-based 
 terrain mapping realistic and attractive. I think it looks like a lumpy tweed bedspread thrown 
 over the cat. It just looks weird sometimes, as if a thin layer of snow is covering everything, 
 even the desert. At least it performs better than iF-22. Most of the really serious CD-reads and 
 choppy frames have been smoothed, though long load and unload times still predominate. Hardware 
 and software modes are available, though software-only graphics are a waste. Visually, it earns 
 a C.  

 So far, so good. We have a sim that isn't the best looking thing on the block, but which does have 
 it where it counts: in missions and modeling. So what's the problem? Well, there are the bugs. 
 And then there are the bugs. And a few more bugs. Did I mention the bugs? How about an infinite 
 "compiling" screen, random and frequent crashes, wingman that act more like Thunderbirds than fighter 
 pilots, and the complete inability to successfully finish most missions due to a bug that blows 
 up your plane if you sit on the carrier for more than four seconds.   

 Yeah, these can and probably will be fixed, though even that is not assured, since Interactive Magic 
 has a shaky record on product support. But so what? Why are they there in the first place? Did 
 no one notice them? How could you miss them? Interactive Magic has repeated all the mistakes of 
 iF-22. It seems as though they learned nothing. Are we going to see iF/A-18 5.0, a whole new version 
 whose major appeal is that it works as the initial version should have?  

 The question remaining is: If it's fixed, will it be worthwhile? Will it, like Falcon and Tank Platoon 
 II, rise above its initial shoddy release to become a classic? Certainly its features and modeling 
 are strong enough, even if visually it's a disappointment. But that misses the point. The game 
 on my hard drive right now shows potential that can't really be tapped, because I'm unwilling to 
 invest time in a mission that I will probably not be able to finish or not get credit for. As it 
 stands now, the game is a failure because it cannot be played, and there is no excuse for that.
