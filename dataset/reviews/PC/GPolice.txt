:::Review:::
We recommend using the tutorial mode to get used to the, er, touchy controls for, oh let's say, 
 eight to ten hours before attempting even the first level. That should do the trick. 

 Ever meet that big movie star - the one you've been waiting your whole life to meet - only to find 
 out that, even though they're even better looking in person, they're not that fun to be around? 
 No? Well, that's the only convoluted analogy I could think of to describe G Police. It is quite 
 possibly the best looking game to hit the scene since the advent of 3D-accelerator cards. The sound 
 is remarkable. The SGI-rendered cutscenes are unprecedented. Unfortunately, the gameplay has some 
 relatively major flaws.  

 The storyline's not to blame. It's actually quite intriguing, considering this is a purebred action 
 game. In the years following the late 22nd century's great war for the solar system's resources, 
 the governments of Earth are overthrown, and the entire planet is demilitarized by the megacorporations. 
 It soon becomes apparent that some sort of independent law enforcement agency will be needed to 
 keep the corporate moguls' greed and lust for power in check. Hence, the Government Police are 
 created, and you, as Jeff Slater, war veteran and crack hovership pilot, are their newest recruit. 
 This complex story, along with some bad blood between Slater and his new Commanding Officer, and 
 a "searching for clues about his sister's mysterious death" subplot, is a welcome change from the 
 usual unimaginative drivel that plagues this genre. Unfortunately, that's about all that's welcome. 
   

 First of all, this is not one for the light of wallet. The game's priced about right, but anyone 
 but the most well-equipped gamers will have to take out a second mortgage to experience everything 
 the game has to offer. The minimum system requirements call for a Pentium 133 with 16MB RAM, but 
 without an ultrafast CD-ROM drive and, most importantly, a 3D accelerator card, you'll be playing 
 an entirely different game.   

 With hardware 3D acceleration, most would consider G Police a joy to play. Watching the incomparably 
 rendered graphics zoom by makes the pitiful control setup and confusingly cluttered scenery worthwhile. 
 So what if you can never keep your hovership going in a straight line. The buildings you keep crashing 
 into (causing no apparent damage, of course) are simply bee-yoo-tee-ful! The lighting effects - 
 the blasts from your jets, the lens flares, and the brilliant explosions - are what 3D cards were 
 made for.   

 The missions, 35 in all (that we know of) , are well executed enough to keep the action moving along. 
 The enemies come in all shapes and sizes - aircraft, ground targets, people - and the cops-and-robbers 
 feel of the missions adds an intriguing twist. You're never at a loss for weapons, either. As the 
 level difficulty progresses from frustrating to downright ludicrous, your DASA-Kamov AG60 HAVOC 
 (Got all that?) can be outfitted with more and more powerful weapons. Of course, seeing any of 
 this stuff in action requires that you actually make it past Level 2. We recommend using the tutorial 
 mode to get used to the, er, touchy controls for, oh let's say, eight to ten hours before attempting 
 even the first level. That should do the trick.   

 Bear in mind, too, that this is in 3D-accelerated mode. If you don't have a 3D card and a rippin' 
 processor, just scratch G Police right off your letter to Santa. While the graphics in software-accelerated 
 mode are still absolutely amazing as unaccelerated graphics go, the reprehensibly loose controls 
 make the scenery unnavigable. What is merely confusing with a 3D card is, without one, just a fast-moving 
 jumble of underlit chaos. Forget negotiating your path from waypoint to waypoint, and don't even 
 think about being able to win in a dogfight past Mission 10 or so. To put it simply, I consider 
 playing this game without 3D acceleration one of the most exasperating experiences of my life. 
 Whatever you do, don't attempt it!  

 All things considered, G Police puts too much emphasis on the graphics. The gameplay is there, but 
 you can't get to it. If you're sportin' an ultrafast PC with a 3D accelerator card, G Police is 
 a worthy buy, if only for the visuals. If you have anything less, save yourself the frustration.
