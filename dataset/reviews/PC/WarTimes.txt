:::Review:::
War Times is a very conventional real-time strategy game that suffers from slow pacing and poor 
 pathfinding. 

  The Second World War appears to be undergoing a renaissance of sorts in Europe, judging by the 
 number of World War II games that have been coming across the Atlantic recently. The latest of 
 these is War Times, a 3D real-time strategy game from Spanish developer Legend Studios. Considering 
 that Spain was one of the few European nations to sit out that epic conflict, the potential was 
 certainly there for War Times to approach World War II from a different perspective. The game gets 
 off to a good start, with a cool musical introduction and cinematic, but it quickly becomes clear 
 that this World War II game has more than its fair share of problems.  

          A wall of Panther tanks will make short work of any enemy unit thrown at them.     

 
  War Times has two single-player campaigns that let you play as either the Allies or the Axis, 
 and you can control the four major European-theater combatants, Germany, the Soviets, the British, 
 and the US. Each side has unique units and capabilities that lend them some distinct playing styles; 
 the Soviets and Germans are very tank heavy, while the Americans rely on air power to compensate 
 for their weaker armor. Most of the battles, such as the invasion of France and Operation Market 
 Garden, require you to generally follow the traditional real-time strategy method of building up 
 a base, gathering resources, and cranking out a bunch of tanks to rush your opponent. In War Times, 
 this is a tedious process because of the slow-paced nature of the game. In order to establish your 
 base, you must build a headquarters, which takes about two to three minutes. You can't build anything 
 else until it's complete, so you're practically sitting on your hands until then. Once the headquarters 
 is complete, you have to build support structures, such as oil rigs. Each of these is required 
 to unlock critical buildings, such as power plants, which unlock additional buildings, such as 
 vehicle factories, so once again you have to wait around even longer. Establishing a decent-sized 
 base then becomes a dull, repetitive exercise each time you begin a new mission.  

  You are also limited by the amounts of resources you've gathered. There are only two resources 
 in the game: ore and oil. Depending on the side you're playing, you may harvest oil automatically 
 just by building a rig over a deposit. However, you're still going to have to dispatch workers 
 to collect ore, and workers are a perfect example of another big flaw in the game, pathfinding. 
 In order to ensure a maximum harvest rate, you often need to dispatch at least six workers to each 
 resource. As they travel between the headquarters and the resource deposit, they'll often run into 
 each other and come to a stop. This causes a traffic jam as other workers are caught in it, and 
 it takes a second or two for everything to get sorted out. This behavior is mimicked by tanks and 
 infantry units to a frustrating degree. If you lasso a bunch of tanks with your mouse and have 
 them move to a certain location, you'll watch as several of them jam against each other and then 
 slide across the ground. Others will bump into the tank in front of them, causing a bumper-to-bumper 
 chain reaction. Other tanks will go off in wild directions because they can't maneuver around buildings 
 or terrain properly. And instead of arriving at the destination as a powerful armored fist, tanks 
 will arrive piecemeal, becoming easy pickings for the enemy. Units also don't move in concert together; 
 smaller, lighter tanks will dart ahead and get chewed up, while heavier units plod behind and arrive 
 too late to be of any use.  

  Enemy AI is generally no better. The computer will throw troops at you ineffectively, and it won't 
 adapt to any tactics you adopt. But a nice trick is that it will also hold forces in reserve and 
 then rush you when you venture out from beyond the safe confines of your base. However, in certain 
 missions, AI reactions are mostly scripted. For example, in one level you have to traverse the 
 map with a small handful of units, and in a couple of locations there is a large horde of tanks 
 with no purpose other than to wait until you get close enough, which then triggers their attack. 
 War Times does have a few interesting, unconventional levels. For example, in the Battle of Britain, 
 you're tasked with destroying British airfields without losing too many aircraft. In that mission, 
 you don't even have a base to manage, as your aircraft appear on scene as if they're flying from 
 a base off the map. In that situation, you have to carefully manage fuel and make sure you have 
 enough fighters massed to keep the bombers unhindered.  

  War Times has a dated graphical look to it. Infantry are very blocky, and you can almost count 
 the low number of polygons in each of them. Meanwhile, buildings and structures are very boxlike 
 in appearance, with little detail. There are a few nice water effects, but those are ruined by 
 the bland, repetitive textures and the poorly drawn and rendered vegetation. The camera controls 
 are also limited -- there's barely any range to the zoom levels, and you can't tilt the camera angle 
 that much.  

          Base building is a long and drawn-out process, so get something to read while you wait. 
     

  Multiplay offers skirmish between human and AI opponents. The multiplayer maps tend to be very 
 symmetrical in design, so each side has the same resources and terrain. Against the AI, these battles 
 can be frustrating, because the computer can build and manage multiple bases much more efficiently 
 than a human. The result is that it can swamp you with superior numbers and superior vehicles. 
 Against either the computer or a human, you'll still be frustrated by the pathfinding problems 
 in the game. War Times also suffers from some minor translation gaffes, something that seems to 
 occur more and more often as game development moves overseas. Publishers need to invest a little 
 more time and effort in making sure that their games are translated correctly. In the end, War 
 Times is a fairly conventional real-time strategy game that covers a lot of ground that we've seen 
 in better World War II-based games.
