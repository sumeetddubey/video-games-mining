:::Review:::
When you slam the pedal to the floor and kick one of these high-priced monstersinto first gear, 
 you will feel like you're out on the track bumping andscraping with the big boys. 

 Remember Chuck Yeager's Air Combat? All right, maybe not - and even if you do you're probably wondering 
 what on God's green earth a dated WWII air-combat game has to do with an auto-racing sim. So I'll 
 clear things up for you with a little homespun aphorism that more game developers should take to 
 heart: If it feels real, it is real. Chuck Yeager's flat polygons might look bland today, but when 
 I saw them from a virtual cockpit eight years ago I felt as if I really were in the skies above 
 war-torn Europe - a lot like the way I feel when I start a race of Sports Car GT and am nearly 
 as excited, tense, and focused as if I were on the start line at Laguna Seca in an exquisite road 
 racer.  

 Admittedly, Sports Car GT doesn't dish up the most jaw-dropping graphics you've ever seen (though 
 they are good) , and its modeling of car and engine damage will leave a lot of sports-car fans wishing 
 that real life were as forgiving. But make no mistake: When you slam the pedal to the floor and 
 kick one of these high-priced monsters into first gear, you will feel like you're out on the track 
 bumping and scraping with the big boys. The 3D modeling here is so good, so convincing, that you'll 
 find yourself in a severe fit of road rage when a driver cuts you off at a curve or some idiot 
 spins out and blocks that perfect line you'd been following for the last three laps.  

 Fans of high-dollar sports cars will find that the menu in Sports Car GT is enough to set their 
 mouths watering, with cars from BMW, McLaren, Porsche, Panoz, Vector, Mosler, Callaway, Lister, 
 and Ford (the Saloon Mustang) . And the settings are more than good enough for these fancy entrees 
 - the game boasts world-famous courses such as MoSport Park, Road Atlanta, Laguna Seca, Donnington, 
 Hockenheim, and Lime Park, along with a trio of fictional tracks that stand up pretty well on their 
 own merits. Perhaps the reproductions of the real-life tracks aren't 100 percent genuine, but not 
 a lot of folks are going to spot the discrepancies - and even if they did, they couldn't deny that 
 this sim delivers the spirit, if not the letter, of what it's like to scream down these legendary 
 circuits. And if you stick with it long enough, you'll start seeing famous names like Brabham, 
 Pilgrim, O'Connell, and Bernard in the field.  

 I could rave about graphical effects like accurate mirrors, roiling smoke from spinouts, the way 
 computer-controlled drivers have an uncanny tendency to make mistakes at crucial moments (just 
 like we lowly humans do) , or how the multitude of car setup options are both easy to understand 
 and actually affect how fast your rig makes a lap. I could rattle on about how a replay reveals 
 that your car's chassis shifts to reflect "inertial forces" (that means that you can see it rise 
 up as you crest a hill or see it sway to the left or right when you're making a powerslide through 
 a tight turn) . But none of that means squat if the game doesn't deliver that precious adrenaline 
 rush when you're out on the track - and if you don't get that feeling when you're driving in this 
 game, you'll probably never get it.  

 Hold on a minute. I forgot to tell you how this beast that's been sucking up all my spare time actually 
 works. Sports Car GT lets you hop into those fancy cars for quick races (a mere two cars and four 
 tracks at the start of the game) , enter a career mode (win money and add better equipment for handling, 
 braking, suspension, etc.) , or race against other people in a multiplayer game (but unfortunately 
 there's no support for a matching service like the Internet Gaming Zone or even a chat area to 
 exchange IP addresses) .  

 Perfect as it seems, though, Sports Car GT doesn't get everything right. The bulk of the gripes 
 stem from the fact that this game was made for both consoles and PCs (with different developers, 
 however) , and EA was apparently striving to make the two versions as similar as possible. You'll 
 find many console-style quirks in Sports Car GT, some more annoying than others depending on your 
 idiosyncrasies. There aren't global settings for generic stuff like graphics, sound, realism, replay 
 settings, and so on (you have to adjust them for each driver you create) ; a huge majority of the 
 tracks and cars are locked out until you log enough winning performances in career mode (unless 
 you hack or cheat) ; and the lack of a true save-game feature means you can easily wreck a career 
 unless you make careful choices when buying cars and equipment. The biggest disappointment is that 
 unless Sports Car GT develops a dedicated fan base, the only official way to find opponents is 
 by posting your name on EA's lame and relatively ineffective Multiplayer Matchup (I put my name 
 up a year ago for Madden '99 and NHL Hockey '99 and have received only one response) .  

 The good news is that Sports Car GT is so downright addictive that you can easily overlook these 
 shortcomings. The game demands a lot in PC horsepower - my guess is something around a 333MHz with 
 a ton of RAM and a really good 3D card - but if you've got it then you haven't got any reason not 
 to give this game a spin unless you hate racing games. And if that's the case, then there's this 
 old WWII flight sim called Chuck Yeager's Air Combat that you might want to check out.

Review:  Perusing the reviews for Simbin games, I couldn't help but notice that I never bothered to write 
 a review for the original, Sports Car GT!
  
  Okay, so actually, this isn't a Simbin game. Simbin simply took the engine and used it to release 
 half a dozen "games" which use it. Apparently Simbin couldn't be bothered to go to the trouble 
 of writing a whole game engine.
  
  Anyway, if you've played GTR/GT Legends/GTR2/RACE/RACE 07, you've played this game. No kidding: 
 other than some different cars, some different tracks, and maybe a few *slight* graphical tweaks, 
 they are all the same game, and all are based on Sports Car GT.
  
  This game was actually pretty cool back in 1999, when the graphics were GORGEOUS, but now they 
 kind of suck, and given that Simbin hasn't really improved the engine they've been milking for 
 the last ten years, it's really starting to show its age. Just like current Simbin games, there's 
 no damage modeling in this game. Also like the current Simbin games, the physics in this game suck. 
 They always have. A lot of PC gamers don't seem to realize this. I cannot state enough how much 
 the physics in this game suck. Probably because there's a HUGE amount of noise about how great 
 GTR is and blah blah blah, from a bunch of people who are either completely ignorant about actual 
 racing or are trying to fool themselves into thinking it's a good game.
  
  Seriously, this game, and all the Simbin games that have followed it, DOES NOT HANDLE REALISTICALLY. 
 Period. There were games with better physics YEARS before this game was released (any Papyrus game, 
 TOCA 1&2, etc) . If you think this game has good physics, then you're ignorant. If you like crappy 
 physics, that's fine with me, but at least be real and own up to the fact that they do suck.
  
  Since this game WAS released in 1999, I'll give it a little more credit than most of the Simbin 
 rehashes... at least this one was original, at the time. It was still a mediocre game back then 
 though, not worth buying or even playing, and I'd have to say that if you're itching to throw your 
 money towards Simbin, buy GT Legends. But if you really need to prove it to yourself how much the 
 GTR series sucks and hasn't significantly improved in almost ten years, fire up Sports Car GT and 
 prepared to get some deja vu.
  
  I had a force feedback wheel back when I originally bought this game, and even that couldn't help 
 save it from the trash can. This game, like the Simbin versions, had absolutely no character and 
 was not only boring but a CHORE to play.

Review:  Man... this game is so well done... It is just so realistic, that you can actually learn driving 
 skills. The graphics are good, but not best, the sound is also well done. I have played this game 
 for about 6 years now, and it still is a blast. I think the best feature about this game is the 
 ability to create your own cars and tracks, them play them! This game almost feels like a predecessor 
 from Forza Motorsport. So, DAMN realistic! Gotta Love It! 
  
  Now, the worst part about this game is NO REAL MULTIPLAYER!!! You can only play with other people 
 by LAN / Wireless Networks. And that really sucks!! Now, THAT takes some of the fun out of the 
 game. Blaw!

Review:  This game is so much fun i have been playing for 2 years i think now and i am still not bored of 
 it. The carrer is good and you can get a bunch of tracks and cars for the game to make it even 
 more fun you can also edit the carrer to put your favourite tracks in. The graphics are pretty 
 god but not awesome. The sound is good and the engines and spins sound really good. The only thing 
 that i don't like is how you cant control a car when its spinning its really stupid, and it pisses 
 you off at times, but over all it is a very fun game that you should buy!

Review:  When I first bought this game, I thought it would be a great game!
  But I was wrong, the sound and graphics was horrible! It was hard too steer without the ''Auto-Pilot'' 
 as I call it. (Don't remember what it was called in the game)
  And when I looked at the main-site for this game on gamespot, there are not many who got it, and 
 only (!!!) 7 users play's it, and only (!!!) 3 users want's it.
  And I know why, because it's a bad game. Even though it may look's cool, it's not.
  The whole 
 game is not realistic at all, the cars. I wonder if the cars there where Authorised or not?
  Off, I wonder why I would waste my time on writting this Review on such a poor game.
