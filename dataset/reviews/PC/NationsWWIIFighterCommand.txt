:::Review:::
Nations' flight model will instantly turn off those looking for a realistic flight sim, while the 
 box description might turn away those looking for a more accessible game. 

 There's been an explosion in the number of World War II flight sims in the past 12 months. After 
 several quiet years, the prop-and-goggle crowd has been virtually snowed under by the likes of 
 European Air War, Jane's WWII Fighters, Screamin' Demons Over Europe, and more. Psygnosis appeared 
 somewhat late in the game with Nations: WWII Fighter Command. Unfortunately, in a market filled 
 with worthy competition, Nations doesn't have much hope of catching flight sim fans' attention. 
 The fact is that Nations' flight model will instantly turn off those looking for a realistic flight 
 sim, while the box description might turn away those looking for a more accessible game.  

 The game gives you the opportunity to fly a variety of British, American, and German aircraft and 
 models another 22 aircraft flown only by the computer, including the Italian Macchis and Savoias. 
 The flyable aircraft include the usual suspects, such as the Thunderbolt, Mustang, Spitfire, Focke-Wulf 
 190, and Messerschmitt 109 and 262. A couple of interesting inclusions are the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk 
 and the Messerschmitt 163 "Komet," a rocket-powered aircraft designed as a high-altitude bomber 
 interceptor. In short, Nations has more than enough aircraft to keep you busy.  

 Nations requires a 3D accelerator of some sort and recommends an AGP card with at least 8MB of RAM. 
 However, the game's 3D setup program did not let me specify my Nvidia TNT2. The only Nvidia chips 
 supported by the program appeared to be the original TNT and the Riva 128. In fact, there was no 
 Voodoo3 support listed, nor support for the Matrox G400. The game worked acceptably after I specified 
 the TNT2 chip as a Riva 128, although there were several odd graphical glitches (especially after 
 plane crashes) that didn't occur with a Voodoo2. It's strange to say the least that a game shipped 
 in late 1999 wouldn't support the latest 3D chipsets.  

 Once you find an adequate video configuration, the game graphics turn out to be inconsistent. Some 
 things, like the aircraft models, clouds, and lighting, look quite good. Other things like the 
 terrain don't look as good, especially when viewed in flyby mode where the perspective changes 
 rapidly and the screen is subject to bizarre bleeding of sky into land. While the game tries to 
 model light reflecting off distant aircraft, the effect is more like the flashing beacon of a plane's 
 running lights.  

 Nations: WWII Fighter Command comes with a manual that has some interesting but irrelevant background 
 information on World War II, a decent discussion of aerial maneuvers, some background on the aircraft, 
 and an adequate description of the game controls. The controls are configurable, though oddly enough, 
 you need to hit the "J" key to enable the joystick at the beginning of every mission. Wingman commands 
 are also sparse.  

 The game's flight model has three settings: relaxed, realistic, and ultrarealistic. Based on these 
 descriptions, it would seem that Psygnosis is shooting straight at the hard-core simulation market, 
 where success depends on the accuracy of the flight model. However, the flight physics are decidedly 
 peculiar even in ultrarealistic mode: To say that the aircraft felt robust would be an understatement. 
 Planes climbed at rates that seemed far out of step with other sims that boast realistic physics. The 
 most curious aspect of the flight model is the stall modeling, or rather the complete lack thereof. 
 Planes could climb to a point at which they reached zero airspeed, only to slowly right themselves 
 like gigantic paper airplanes - there is no loss of controlled flight whatsoever. In fact, planes 
 can balance at the edge of a stall as though they were malformed helicopters. The game prominently 
 displays the fact that the flight model has been approved by former RAF squadron leader and senior 
 Eurofighter test pilot Craig Penrice, but the difference between this and other so-called realistic 
 sims is so great that it's obvious something is wrong with Nations.  

 Damage modeling is equally lax. When attacking bombers, a few wing hits are often sufficient to 
 send these giant planes spiraling to the ground. Explosions occur for no apparent reason. While 
 the game boasts that "planes will react to damage across 12 different aircraft systems," the effects 
 of damage to your aircraft are marginal until the plane is actually destroyed.  

 Despite the decidedly watered-down flight physics, Nations does have some things going for it. There 
 are a variety of missions that can be flown in the instant-action mode for those just wanting to 
 get in the air and shoot down some bad guys. The range of aircraft and missions (bomber interceptions, 
 strikes against land and sea targets, and more) ensures that those who are simply looking for an 
 airborne diversion won't tire too quickly. In addition, there is a scripted campaign available 
 for each nationality. Aircraft can be switched before starting a stand-alone mission, so if you're 
 inclined to fly a P-51 Mustang as part of the Luftwaffe and chase an incoming B-24 raid, go right 
 ahead.  

 Whatever problem you might have with the realism of the flight and damage models are certain to 
 be exacerbated by the multiplayer game, where you have the option of playing with various "power-ups," 
 such as invincibility, faster speed, 2x damage, and so on. Fly through the spinning graphics and 
 presto! You can even land at an airfield and pick up "crates," which are combinations of the rocket, 
 ammo, fuel, and health power-ups. It's unclear why a game that touts "historical accuracy" and 
 "incredibly realistic and detailed fighters" would include something of this sort, and it's hard 
 to imagine someone in search of an accurate model of a Hawker Typhoon being interested in flying 
 through a "health" power-up. Conversely, someone looking for a casual airborne deathmatch might 
 expect that something with "true flight physics" would be accompanied by a manual the size of an 
 encyclopedia. What we have here is a failure to communicate.  

 Nations: WWII Fighter Command is a schizophrenic game. It seems targeted at the hard-core simulation 
 audience, while the actual gameplay is simplistic and action-oriented. In fact, the only thing 
 that might appeal to the hard-core sim player is the wording "ultra-realistic" on the box. This 
 is sure to lead to disappointment, frustration, and many more returned games than would have been 
 the case had Psygnosis been more straightforward. There could be an enjoyable game lurking in the 
 box, but that depends very much on the buyer. Some might actually enjoy the arcade-action aspect 
 of the multiplayer mode. But it's likely that most will find themselves the victims of a case of 
 mistaken identity with a game that advertises itself so confusingly.
