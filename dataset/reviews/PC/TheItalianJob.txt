Despite some rough edges, The Italian Job makes for a fun ride that justifies the budget price. 
 

 You don't see games like The Italian Job every day. The game itself isn't particularly extraordinary -- it's 
 a lighthearted mission-based driving game that takes you through the streets of London, to Turin, 
 and finally to the Swiss Alps. Of further note, it's brought to you by the makers of the notoriously 
 gory Carmageddon series (no signs of any gore here, though) , it's based on a 1969 heist film starring 
 Michael Caine and the late Benny Hill, and it was originally released some months ago for the Sony 
 PlayStation. Actually, the PC version of The Italian Job shows its roots in all these respects, 
 and despite some rough edges, it makes for a fun ride that justifies the budget price.         
   Help Charlie Croker steal a cool 4 mil from under the Mob's nose.    

  The Italian Job stars cockney wise guy Charlie Croker, who is fresh out of prison and is already 
 looking to get into more trouble -- trouble, in the form of $4 million that the Mafia already has 
 its eyes on. The plan is to cause a major pileup in the streets of Turin and make off with the 
 loot while the authorities and the Mob are scrambling to figure out what happened. In the game, 
 you'll take on 16 different missions, first gearing up for the heist, then pulling it off, and 
 then getting away scot-free. Along the way, you'll get to drive eight different vehicles, including 
 everything from a nimble Mini Cooper to a bus filled with explosives. The missions are all short, 
 but they'll often require you to try them a number of times before you get them right. This isn't 
 really frustrating, because the missions are quite fun, requiring you to pull off some outrageous 
 driving moves in densely packed urban settings, and failing a mission never sets you back more 
 than a few minutes.   

  The controls are a cinch. Even if you've never played a driving game before, you'll be able to 
 pick up and play The Italian Job easily. You can accelerate, brake, and turn left and right. The 
 hand brake lets you execute sharper turns, and you can sound the horn of your vehicle to no real 
 effect, and that's it. A damage meter indicates how close you are to totaling your car, though 
 no incremental damage to the vehicle can be seen as you bang it up. The game's physics aren't particularly 
 realistic, but they're good enough, and the various vehicles you'll drive are satisfyingly different 
 in how they handle. Between the open-ended environments and the relaxed driving mechanics, The 
 Italian Job is most reminiscent of the Midtown Madness series, though it's also comparable (though 
 not favorably) to Driver or even the driving portions of Grand Theft Auto III.   

  It won't take you long to finish The Italian Job. There are only 16 missions in total, so you'll 
 get through the main storyline in short order, even if you have to retry most of the missions several 
 times. Some additional modes of play, including a free ride option through London and Turin, a 
 multiplayer party mode, and the "challenge," "destructor," and "checkpoint" missions, add to the 
 game's replay value somewhat, but the story mode is definitely the main attraction. The game's 
 simple physics and minimal detail just aren't enough to carry it through these other modes of play, 
 though the context of the story mode and the diversity of its missions will keep you involved. 
   

  The Italian Job doesn't look like much, but considering that it was originally a PlayStation game, 
 it looks surprisingly decent in some ways. In particular, the vehicles you'll drive look quite 
 good and feature a nice metallic sheen. There's also no shortage of vehicular and pedestrian traffic 
 on the streets you'll be racing through, so The Italian Job certainly isn't boring to look at. 
 On the other hand, everything else about the game's appearance, from the blurry textures seen on 
 buildings to the simplistic geometry of the environments, leaves a lot to be desired and is hardly 
 up to par with the high graphical standards for the driving genre these days.           The Italian 
 Job is fun while it lasts.    

  The game sounds considerably better. Though you'll hear some repetitive complaints from pedestrians, 
 and the sound of crunching your car into another isn't all that impressive, the noisy engines of 
 your vehicles and the catchy, upbeat musical score are quite good. Best of all, the voice actor 
 who portrays Charlie Croker does an excellent job of sounding like the brash, fast-talking scoundrel 
 he's supposed to be. You'll enjoy listening to his mission briefings and watching some of the game's 
 admittedly simple but nonetheless amusing in-engine cutscenes.   

  The Italian Job maybe isn't quite as out-of-the-blue as it might seem. Between the resurgence of 
 the Mini Cooper's popularity and the ongoing production of a  Hollywood remake of the 1969 film 
  starring Mark Wahlberg and Ed Norton, The Italian Job's appearance on the PC isn't pointless. 
 The game is simple and in some ways even a bit crude, and the entertainment it offers is relatively 
 short-lived, but it's not a bad deal at $20, and it's got a lot more personality than you'd find 
 in your average PC game.

Review:  "The Italian Job", cult classic film of 1969, in game format. This would be the epitome of greatness.
 
  In 2002, Edios released their tribute to the classic film. And it is surprisingly good, even to 
 this day.
  
  The storyline consists thusly; using 3 Mini Coopers, Charlie Croker and his gang of rough and tumble 
 lads follow the plan of the late Roger Beckerman (cause of death: Traffic Collision with The Mafia) , 
 which involves stealing $4 Million in gold bullion right from underneath the noses of The Mafia 
 and the Turin Police. In order to do this, they must cause the traffic jam from hell.
  
  The game follows closely to the story, with brand new additions to it mostly in the London chapter 
 of the game, a location in the film seen very briefly compared to the Italian city. The London 
 Chapter consists mostly of driving to point A, picking up someone who must help you for the Job, 
 and drive back to base while avoiding the rozzers. Other missions in the chapter include nicking 
 a vehicle and delivering two ladies to Prof. Peach's abode. While this chapter may get boring, 
 you'll soon be outrunning the Mafia and the Police with a couple of Mill in the boot while other 
 poor people are sat in their vehicles. However, I must warn you, watch out for the Turin Mission 
 "Interference", probably the most diabolical mission in a driving game yet. Locating the traffic 
 cameras all over the city in the time limit, with absolutely no indication of where they are until 
 you get near them proves to be almost as easy as trying to hammer a nail into a board with a flimsy 
 sponge.
  
  Owning both versions of the game (the PS1 and PC versions) , I can confidently say that the PC graphics 
 far outshine the blocky, pixelated PS1 graphics. The cars give off a nice shine, and the cars deteriorate 
 with damage strikingly well. However, the blurred textures for shop fronts and the occasionaly 
 shoddy skybox texture may detract visually from the experience.
  
  The gameplay is your basic racing controls, using the arrow keys to maneuvre your car to victory. 
 However, handbrake turns usually result in you spinning out of control over the streets of London 
 or Turin.
  
  The sound is great. The music is either ripped straight from Quincy Jones' original score, or a 
 very close approximation to it. The cars' engines all sound unique. Though why every female pedestrian 
 sounds American in London and Turin is beyond me. But then I'm just splitting hairs.
  
  Overall, the game is great, save for a few graphical and control errors, and the odd obscenely 
 difficult mission. Remake, anyone?
