:::Review:::
Fortress Europe is a wretched underdone mess that has no business being sold in its current state. 
 

  Fortress Europe might make you think that Matrix Games is trying to kill wargaming. The company 
 recommends it for novice wargamers, which is a surefire way to send someone screaming to another 
 genre, never to look back. This sadly disorganized, poorly documented, hideously ugly, surprisingly 
 overpriced, and downright inscrutable jumble is one of the worst things to happen to wargaming 
 since Hasbro butchered Avalon Hill's Squad Leader.  

          Fortress Europe lacks a lot of vital information.     

  Fortress Europe is an operational-level 
 wargame covering the Allied invasion of Normandy and the eventual liberation of France. It runs 
 in real time at a rate of about a half hour of game time for each day, but you can pause to give 
 orders to your troops. The game's units are generic representations of infantry, armor, or artillery, 
 each with limited amounts of fuel and ammo. Weather kicks up from time to time in the form of thunderstorms. 
 In addition to moving units and giving them targets, you can call in air strikes, drop paratroopers, 
 place minefields, or float barrage balloons. As units take over territory, they earn victory points 
 for their side based on the type of territory. A color-coded display shows how much of the map 
 each side controls.  

  Beyond this, it's hard to explain Fortress Europe because it's so poorly documented that you'll 
 just have to guess what's going on. If you hunt around on the CD, you'll find a woefully inadequate 
 10-page PDF file that serves as a manual. There are a handful of salient details here, but mainly 
 a lot of unanswered questions. OK, so you can order concentrated attacks and synchronized attacks. 
 Why? What do they do? How do they work? OK, so you can call in air strikes. Why does this only 
 occasionally work? What good are barrage balloons at preventing them? Are there any active antiair 
 defenses? OK, so units are organized into the historical hierarchies of the divisions that actually 
 landed at Normandy and defended it. Is there some sort of command and control scheme at work? Is 
 there any way to bring in replacements to depleted units? How do you resupply a unit with fuel 
 and ammo?  

  Fortress Europe is a wargame without numbers, which might be good in theory. In practice, it just 
 means there's no way to tell the relative value of things. How good are different units at attacking 
 and defending? Does terrain have any effect on combat? What does the weather do? Do my units ever 
 need to rest? Is morale ever an issue? All of these factors, if they're even present, are completely 
 hidden, and Matrix Games apparently couldn't be bothered to mention any of this in the manual. 
 It hardly feels interactive to just move units with no sense for what they're doing. This might 
 as well be the wargaming equivalent of that electric tabletop football game you had as a kid in 
 which a vibrating table made metal players scoot around the board and jostle each other to minimal 
 effect.  

  Then there are the issues that aren't even mentioned in the manual. Are those little units running 
 around with a French flag and an "RES" on their counter French resistance fighters? What are they 
 doing? What good are they? Are you supposed to keep that ugly teletype display constantly open 
 if you want to be alerted to new developments? How do the four smaller scenarios work? What difference 
 does it make if I change the starting date?  

  It's hard to tell where the bugs in Fortress Europe begin, because it's impossible to see where 
 the gameplay ends. For instance, are you supposed to be able to pause the game at any time and 
 ring every single enemy unit with your unlimited supply of minefields? The manual mentions a way 
 to bring up detailed information on a unit, but it doesn't work. Is this a bug or was this feature 
 cut? Are there victory conditions or even a way to display the score? Is there a way to end the 
 game? Can the Germans ever lose? As a test, we started a game as the Germans, with the computer 
 AI controlling the Allies. We came back 13 hours later and the game was still going, but the date 
 had lapsed into some strange negative numbers. So we ended the game, having never given the Germans 
 a single order, and were greeted with the screen for a German victory. Apparently, your participation 
 in Fortress Europe is optional, which is bad news for those who get duped into shelling out $40 
 to play a game that doesn't even need you.  

          Both novice and expert wargamers should stay away from Fortress Europe.     

  The graphics 
 are ugly, cluttered, and slow. With such blatantly cartoony 2D sprites, it's hard to tell why the 
 game is so choppy and the system requirements are so high. Even on a higher-end computer, it takes 
 several seconds to change screens. The interface is a collection of buttons and a laughable cursor 
 that shows a commanding officer throwing out a hearty "Sieg Heil," regardless of his actual nationality. 
 The only information available on a unit is its health bar. For some reason, you can manually change 
 unit and turret facing. Not only is this a nightmare of micromanagement considering the hundreds 
 of units involved, but it's completely inconsistent with the scale being modeled.  

  The publisher of Fortress Europe is Matrix Games, one of the few havens for small developers who 
 want to write games for niche audiences. We have Matrix Games to thank for making available updates 
 of SSI's Steel Panthers and Gary Grigsby's classics, War in Russia and Pacific War. Matrix Games 
 is also publishing Vicious Byte's Titans of Steel mech game, Andrew Ewanchyna's Starships Unlimited, 
 and the first title from Grigsby's new company, 2by3 Games. But this makes it all the more distressing 
 to see the company selling something as obviously sloppy as Fortress Europe, a wretched underdone 
 mess that has no business being sold in its current state.
