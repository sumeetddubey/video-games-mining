:::Review:::
The Da Vinci Code is a middling adventure game take on Dan Brown's mega-selling novel, but it does 
 do at least a few things reasonably well. 

  It may sound like a terrible idea, but Dan Brown's ubiquitous novel  The Da Vinci Code  has been 
 successfully translated and adapted to a video game. And, believe it or not, the results are not 
 all that bad. In fact, The Da Vinci Code game offers a challenging and varied gameplay experience 
 that will satisfy the amateur cryptographer in everyone. However, the game is brought down by supbar 
 production values and a dialogue-heavy story that has a tendency to drag at times.  

          Tom Hanks doesn't make an appearance, but this lifelike mannequin is here to fill in for 
 him.     

  The Da Vinci Code is essentially a murder mystery that gets blown way out of proportion with complex 
 conspiracy theories and ridiculously elaborate clues and leaps of logic that lead to a shocking 
 discovery that could rewrite history and bring the Catholic church to its knees. It sounds interesting 
 enough, but in the game the story ends up being about as unexciting as it could possibly be. This 
 is mostly because the two main characters -- symbologist and suspected murderer Robert Langdon and 
 cryptographer Sophie Neveu -- are so unbelievably dull. The two characters are completely expressionless 
 in manner and in tone, and both are entirely devoid of personality or humanity. They might as well 
 be robots programmed to crack numeric codes, unscramble anagrams, and spout off lengthy monologues 
 about the detailed history of every single thing they see. However, despite the lack of character, 
 the story does follow the book and film fairly closely, so if you're a fan of those, you might 
 enjoy taking a more active role in the story by playing the game. Some new content has been added 
 to pad out the game, and while it doesn't bring anything new or interesting to the familiar story, 
 it fits fairly well with the rest of the narrative.  

  This game has you investigating crime scenes and deciphering puzzles. The game does a good job 
 of keeping the gameplay interesting by mixing it up often. All of your skills will be challenged, 
 from puzzle-solving to stealth and even combat. You'll even get to play as both of the characters 
 from the book and movie, although they might as well be exactly the same because they play that 
 way.  

  Most of the game is devoted to puzzle-solving. There's plenty of variety to the puzzles, which 
 keeps them interesting and challenging. You'll have to solve riddles, unscramble anagrams, decipher 
 symbolic codes, and much more. It seems that the man who was murdered was something of a lunatic, 
 so he left tons of elaborate clues that only a symbologist and a cryptographer could possibly solve. 
 Even then, it's a major stretch to believe that all of these puzzles and clues could possibly come 
 together as they do in the game. Regardless, the puzzles are still the best part of The Da Vinci 
 Code. As you move around in each of the various stages, you'll encounter objects that you can interact 
 with. More often than not, these areas provide some clues that keep the story moving along. You'll 
 have to use a black light to read hidden symbols on the  Mona Lisa , collect parts of a ballista 
 to shoot a deranged monk, mix chemicals to clean a painting and reveal a message, and so on. Some 
 of the puzzles are quite difficult, and you'll probably find yourself getting stumped more than 
 a couple of times throughout the game. That said, it's usually clear what you have to do or where 
 you have to go next.  

  When you aren't looking at cryptic messages and collecting artifacts, you'll have to keep an eye 
 out for your own safety. Robert Langdon is wanted for murder, so the police are after him. However, 
 he's also attempting to uncover an ancient conspiracy involving the Catholic church, so lots of 
 fanatic monks are after him as well. The only thing to do in such a situation is to pummel your 
 troubles away with some fancy fist work. When an enemy approaches, you can hit a button to swing 
 at him, and if you hit him, you'll clinch up as the two of you struggle to overpower each other. 
 If you have the upper hand in the clinch, you can hit a button to attack, throw, or shove your 
 enemy. Depending on which move you choose to perform, you'll see button icons at the bottom of 
 the screen that you have to mimic. For example, if you choose to attack, you'll see a sequence 
 of buttons, and you have to press those buttons in the correct order to attack. If you miss a button 
 or take too long, your attack fails, and you're put at a disadvantage in the fight.  

  When on defense, your enemy will take swings at you, and buttons will appear onscreen. You have 
 to hit the right buttons as they appear to dodge each attack. It's all quite simple, but it's more 
 fun than the average button-mashing style of combat. The problem is that these extended fights 
 tend to make the combat sequences drag on a bit too long. It also seems out of place to be kidney-punching 
 security guards and clubbing monks with crow bars as a couple of mild-mannered code crackers.  
 

  The biggest fault of The Da Vinci Code is the overall presentation. The voice actors sound completely 
 flat and disinterested in the dialogue, the character animations are all jerky and unnatural looking, 
 and there are even a few frustrating bugs that make the game feel unfinished. As you move through 
 the environment, you'll often get snagged on inanimate objects, and at one point we got stuck on 
 a railing and had to restart the level because we couldn't move. Conversely, sometimes you'll simply 
 clip right through objects in the environment.  

          If you like riddles and anagrams, you'll find some good ones in this game.     

  The 
 Da Vinci Code will take you about 10 hours to finish, depending on how well you handle all of the 
 puzzles. There are secret items in each level that you can collect to unlock things like artwork 
 and bonus missions. It's a respectably lengthy game, but the problem is that once you solve all 
 the puzzles, there's really no challenge to be had in playing the game again, which makes the price 
 a bit hard to swallow. If that doesn't deter you, then you'll be glad to know that the Xbox and 
 PlayStation 2 versions of the game are just about identical, so the version for you is entirely 
 a matter of preference. The PC version is slightly better than the console versions just because 
 the load times between levels are shorter and because some of the puzzles are easier to manipulate 
 with the mouse and keyboard control scheme.  

  If you're a fan of adventure games, you'll find something to like about The Da Vinci Code. If you've 
 read the book and seen the movie and still can't get enough of the story, you'll have fun jumping 
 in and solving the mystery for yourself. Just don't expect the production values to be on par with 
 those of the blockbuster film.

Review:  The only good part from The Da Vinci Code Game is the puzzles but even those get very stressful... 
 as for the gameplay i have no words to describe it... horrible... the soudtrack is kinda good, 
 but it still doesn't deserve to be bought.... only geeks may like it :) ) So i'm very serious about 
 this: don't buy it or download it unless you are a geek, nerd, loser and if you like watching some 
 lifeless characters solving some stupid puzzles.... very serious now i'm sorry i stood so much 
 time downloading it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR BUY THIS CRAP THAT I CAN'T EVEN CALL VIDEO GAME ~X (

Review:  I loved the book, I enjoyed the film aswell and there were some parts In this game that I really 
 loved aswell. I decided to give this game a try since I've played the game Black Dahlia some years 
 ago and that was a very entertaining game... at first. This is much the same altough the graphics 
 are better and its a much better story, to the plus side they even introduced some combat controls (!) 
 which arent that bad.
  The puzzels are difficult and unless you arent very skilled in is maybe its not your type of game, 
 we all have our special skills and interests.
  Playing detective is a very fun and entertaining way of gaming it seemes, however, the games drawbacks 
 soon put an end to it.
  The bugs.... the f***ing bugs...., you can hardly go anywhere until you get caught and have to restart. 
 And whats worse, still no patches....
  The voice animators are... boring like hell and you clearly sense that this game isnt as grand as 
 it could since they didnt managed to get the official actors to lend their voices.
  
  If you wanna give an overall view... im disappointed, the game proved to be very exiting with good 
 challenges at first, but the bugs ruined most of the game that could have been made so much better.

Review:  what can i say about the film and the book the book i coudldent put down the film i loved so i 
 thought i would go ut and buy the game put it in a thought here we go started to play it and within 
 20 mins i thought rubbish u dont get a full screen its a wide screen format the angle of the camra 
 makes it hard for you to walk around u cant zoom in or out with the person you are playing and 
 what did it for me was when u had to fight the controlls that you use is totaly rubbish could they 
 make it any harder to use u have to use a combo of buttons and mouse why dident they just use the 
 mouse for the actack god knows.
  i no 1 thing tho this is the orse game i have ever played period in my life and ive been playing 
 games for over 20 years and i think that this is the worse game that i have ever played period 
 if some 1 said give it a score i would have to give it a -10 that simple avoid this game .

Review:  C`mon it`s not that bad!!!!!!!
  
  
  i don`t know if you guys have played "indigo" or not? if not close this page go buy it (i mean indigo 
 not this game!!!) and start having fun but if you have, playing da vinci makes you feel that your 
 playing "indigo" '1.5". the gameplay is so close to indigo and the story rocks. personaly i care 
 much about these parameters and i don`t mind about graphics much but yes it`s not graphicaly great 
 but it`s acceptable (you know.... I just finished metal gear for the third time - I mean mgs1- 
 and I felt nothing wrong with the graphics `cause the gameplay and story of mgs1 are the best i 
 have ever seen) so if you care about story and gameplay go and play it ,it`s good!!
  and if you are one of those guys who like detailed games and want to feel their high end pcs go 
 and play prey or doom or quack (i don`t know just go!!!!!)
  
  this game is not much detailed but it`s a good game so don`t forget that we are just playing !! 
 graphics are not that important but there is something really disappointing in it :HTIS GAME IS 
 FULL OF BUGS if you can stand it go and play it like i did. As the other guys have noticed you 
 really need a walkthrough to finish the da vinci code `cause it has very very hard puzzles. (I mean 
 harder than any adventure games you ever have played i have played all silent hills, resident evils, 
 both syberias ,post mortem, still life, the final cut, obscure, cold fear-wich was so easy-and this 
 game is much harder than all these titles!! believe me it`s hard)
  
  THANX FOR YOUR TIME!!!!
  
  i don`t get it, is this game action? so why it`s written action 
 up there in my address bar??!!!!: d
  
  and there is something wrong about rating system you... know by default all are on 7 but for example 
 when you put gameplay on 9 (and the others are still on 7) your score becomes less (like 6.4) did 
 you notice that or i`ve got to visit a doctor?????
  
  sorry if i can`t write good `cause i`m not english (i already know that i`m bad in english so don`t 
 send me messages)

Review:  What a boring and frustrating game this is a waste of time and money 
  ($30.00 ) a very uninspiring game.
  
  I did not read the book or seen the movie but I don't 
 think this will change my view about this game I know a good game and I know a bad game I
  know what I like in a game and I know what I don't like in a game.
  
  Now what I don't like 
 in this game everything in this game is poorly made 
  the graphics are not that good and uninspiring a annoying combat system
  using the mouse clicking 
 the mouse to attack and defend the fights in this game are not rewarding annoying save system solving 
 puzzles in this game can get very frustrating same of the puzzles are very hard you have 
  search and find and combine to solve the puzzle the dialogue in this game is boring and uninspiring.
 
  
  Buying this game was a big mistake.
  
  I am playing this game with a walkthrough to finish it after I finish this game I am useing the 
 cds to put my coffee mug on.
  
  Now what I like about this game I like the music and the cutsens

Review:  DaVinci Code really blurs the lines between movie and video game. Being a dedicated adventure gamer, 
 I played through with a fairly critical eye for both the good and the bad aspects. I would rate 
 it overall on a par with Godfather. Kudos to Dan Brown for penning a brilliantly controversial 
 and sacred cow tipping, page turner. Game was very faithful to the book. 
  
  Got to say a big yeah! for the gorgeous and photo realistic graphics (esp. for 3D) . What a looker, 
 Sophie is. Appropriate movements and gestures, voice inflections, etc. from all characters. I have 
 visited most all of the game locations (Louvre, Westminster, etc.) and the game captures their 
 atmospheres well. The puzzles were perfectly integrated into the story. Puzzle difficulty was about 
 perfectly spot on........ Very unusual for the adventure genre. Most games are a hunt and peck, 
 pixel hunting hell, at times. Or they have ridiculously cryptic, obscure solutions with no clearly 
 defined process for completion. Some would probably say they are too easy in this game, but I say 
 that pacing shouldn't suffer just so you can go to bed at 3am with a migraine (!) 
  
  The bad stuff revolves around the inevitable outcome of good intentions minus poor quality control. 
 Walking through doors, turning invisible, spending half the game just trying to push your partner 
 the heck out of the way, loading bugs, and a bit too much reliance on a couple puzzle types, kind 
 of put a damper on gameplay for me. I imagine this game was fairly rushed. It is polished, but 
 not without flaws.
  
  Dan Brown has really cashed in on the "Passion of the Christ" movie phenomenom. This is the kind 
 of subject material that makes just about anyone with even a passing interest in religeousity, 
 really stand up and take notice. The premise he is putting forth (or passing off) , is plausible, 
 rooted in documented history, and kind of passes the smell test. The supernatural is kept to a 
 bare minimum in the video game, and it is easy to believe these are honest to goodness, living 
 and breathing people. 
  
  This game is a biblical tutorial with a skeptical twist. Again, Dan Brown and all those who brought 
 his work to fruition should be applauded for breathing fresh air into the staleness that was the 
 Holy Bible. Play the game for the art, medieval history, Jesus fable, or Indiana Jonesey stuff. 
 
  
  Gonna play it through one more time!

Review:  I read the book. I saw the movie. Loved them both - the book was better than the movie. I wasted 
 $19 on this disaster of a game. Reminds me of that old TITANIC game out about 7 years ago. And 
 I'm a Reverse Mouse & Arrows keyboard guy - you can't even customize the controls. Graphics are 
 barely past Duke Nukem. Fight sequence controls are incomprehensible. And the BUGS - I kept clipping 
 throught the walls and landing down in some water level somewhere with no way to get out except 
 to Quit - and since there's no quick-saves, had to play the same sequence over and over and over. 
 I really tried to like this game but failed. Nothing worked right. Couldn't even get the Cheats 
 to work - there's no "Codes" section in the "Options".

Review:  Da vinci code is a very entertaining game with quite nice graphics ,great pazzles with normal difficulty 
 and great story. I played the game with my wife and we enjoyed all the parts of the game till the 
 end. The puzzles are sometimes easy to find and other times normal to find. the story its like the 
 film it only has some mods to make the game more enjoyable and give some more action. Its one of 
 the best puzzles-action games i ever played congrats 2k for this great release! Try it out it worths 
 your money trust me. If you like puzzle-action games then this is your first choise if you stuck 
 anywhere dont give up there is always a simple solution ,so dont get a wrong oppinion about the 
 game when you stuck somewhere like some people did with this game! This game is just perfect for 
 davinci story lovers !

Review:  When Dan Brown's controversial novel The Da Vinci Code first hit, it quickly landed on the New 
 York Times bestseller list... a place it's found pretty comfortable for more than three years. 
 The book then made its way to the big screen, where it opened at number one with the highest box 
 office receipts for the year to date. So it should come as no surprise that the franchise has now 
 made its way to game consoles as well. For fans though, the real mystery to solve is whether or 
 not this game can live up to the material from which it's based. 
  
  In case you're one of the three people on the planet who hasn't been exposed to the Da Vinci Code 
 phenomenon yet, here's a quick spoiler-free rundown of the plot. When the curator of the Louvre 
 in France is found murdered, with strange symbols covering his body, the French police call in 
 Robert Langdon for assistance. Langdon, a specialist in the field of religious symbology, immediately 
 gets pulled into an intricate conspiracy involving the Catholic Church, the Holy Grail, and a secret 
 that could shake the foundation of the religious faithful around the world. 
  
  
  
  In The Da Vinci Code game, players take on the role of Langdon as they are drawn deeper and deeper 
 into the grand cover up. Along the way, they will have to use their sharp wit and keen eye to evade 
 agents from both the police and the church, while surviving long enough to gain clues leading to 
 the discovery of the conspiracy's final truth. 
  
  The first thing most people will notice about the game is its presentation. It seems that the developers 
 couldn't get the cast from the movie together for the game, so none of the characters look or sound 
 at all like their big-screen counterparts. Making matters worse, the only thing stiffer than the 
 acting is the character animations. The characters move with all the grace of a three-toed sloth. 
 Adding to the problems, there are a number of glitches in the game's collision detection. More 
 than once, the characters walked through or reached into solid objects in the environment.

Review:  Well, I'd have to admit that the puzzles in the game were pretty challenging and they can be fun, 
 but the rest of the game just doesn't exactly work out. The movie was decent and it was relatively 
 interesting and the book was probably one of the best books that were ever written, but the game 
 just doesn't continue the reputation of the Da Vinci Code. In general, the gameplay was average 
 and the graphics were okay, as well as the sounds in the game. The book and the movie were excellent, 
 but the game just doesn't live up to the Da Vinci Code name.

Review:  Well, after the hype around the movie we know one thing. Its not because the big people say something 
 sucks that the every day people dont like it.
  
  its a bit the same here, some big vritici said this game is really bad but i cant totally agree.
 
  
  the good: some good puzzles, brain testing but fun, the index and encyclopedia
  
  the bad: it sounds a bit weak, the combat system
  
  ----
  the graphics: they arent that good 
 but theya re ok. the cutscenes look good but in game its a bit less. 
  
  the sound: thats the big minus. The game sounds a bit flat, the voices doesnt change a bit when 
 talking.
  
  gameplay: solving puzzles is fun with the mouse interaction and the use of the encyclopedia wich 
 contains a LOT of information. the combat is a bit weak. When combat starts u have to make some 
 mouse clicking combos to attack or defend. but it is an adventure game, so...
  
  tilt: it has some bugs, even a really big one in the louvre, dont walk the wrong way after u've 
 seen teh dead body or ull fall in some hole and u cant go back...
  
  conclusion: if u like the book or movie u should buy it, the puzzles are fun. the combat and sound 
 make it lose a lot points but if u can ignore that during ur game u might have a good time. Some 
 puzzles may be ahrd so be patient.

Review:  I played the game yesterday and i have to say that the gameplay is disappointing. The way you have 
 to do certain things makes you feel you have no control what so ever. Just hit the mouse button 
 a couple times and your ad the next anagram. That's most rewarding part of the game. I read the 
 book and saw the movie but those anagrams still keep you busy for a while. The fights (if you can 
 call them that) are not rewarding. The simon says based gameplay is not wat is needed in this game 
 if furthers the feeling that you have no control over the game. Also they aren't like in fahrenheit 
 where they serve a purpose. Besides the gameplay the game seems somehow unstable before you know 
 it your back in windows witch leaves you more shocked than the game ever could. If you really like 
 anagrams and you're bored with sudoku than you could buy this game when the price lowers a bit.

Review:  If you have read the book or seen the movie your better of reading or watching it again. From the 
 main menu to configuring some ingame settings to starting a new game, you'll get a bad feeling 
 that theres something wrong. Then it hits you it becomes clear that this game is a very rushed 
 out console port of the game that the developers didnt even bother polishing up for the pc. The 
 game is so bad the only satisfying thing to it is using its CD as a cup holder for your coffee 
 as an insult to those that made this game. Even a die hard fan should avoid this game at all cost.
 
  
  Here are just some ot the reasons why you should NOT BUY this game:
  - Unoikished
  - CRASHES TOO OFTEN
  - A very awkward combat system that shouldnt even be there in the first 
 place 
  - An overly frustrating save system will leave you pulling out your hair in f rustration. 
  - 
 A $20.00 cup holder is way to expensive.
  
  Reasons why you should buy this game:
  - Sorry cant think of one

Review:  Firstly, this is an adventure game, and therefore slow like an adventure game. If you're after 
 a FPS, look elsewhere. Contrary to what others say, there is an automatic checkpoint system *and* 
 a manual save system.
  
  The puzzles in this game are designed to test your brain. They are hard, but not impossible if 
 you just think and/or experiment. You have all the clues at your disposal in the History (Tab key) 
 menu.
  
  The combat is where it falls short, it's pretty lame, but it's not the main part of the game and 
 I suspect is just in there because it could be. It becomes more of an annoyance after a while, 
 stopping the flow of the adventure. The graphics are nice, and the voice acting seems adequate. 
 There are a *lot* of cutscense! Practically everything you do triggers one. You have the option 
 of skipping them, but I would not recommend you do so the first time because of the clues and/or 
 story advancement.
  
  All in all, if you are a fan of the movie and adventure games, you will probably like this. Although 
 I think $19.99 would be a more suitable price (esp. after the included movie ticket expires!) . 
 Note, this game is based on the movie, not the book.

Review:  It is hard to believe that they are still making bad games like this today.
  This game has all the bad attributes that adventure players will not want to find in a game.
 
  First ,is has a bad save system. Game will not be saved unless you reached a checkpoint which can 
 be very annoying.
  Second, it has a clumsy combat system. [Who ever wanted combat in an adventure game] ?
  You can 
 not escape the feeling that the game was done with a rush that is because if you want to restart 
 the level after being killed ,the game crashes.
  Save yourself the effort. Stay away.

Review:  It's finally here, The Da Vinci Code, as a game...
  
  As a big fan of the book, I bought the game immediately and I couldn't get of it. I loved the puzzles 
 you needed to solve and the graphs we're pretty good, and for those of you who havent read the 
 book, I can tell you this: the puzzles aren't hard at all; you just have to think logically and 
 go from one place to another.
  
  I recognized all the place since it's based on the book, but I had forgotten almost everything 
 when it comes to how the solved different puzzles, so some things we're quite surprising, but as 
 I said before the puzzles aren't hard at all, just think logically and don't get pissed off if 
 you don't solve it right away.
  
  Now for the game play (Which quite disappointed me) , the camera angle sucks, the character covers 
 almost 1/3 of the viewing space, and you cant zoom in or out, the controls pissed me off in the 
 begging. They werent those that I we're used to play with and I couldn't find a way to change 
 them. Another thing that made me thing "Oh good..." was the combat, the combat is based on clicking 
 with the mouse and hope that you get the right combination since you have to click in a certain 
 order. (Some combats may get quite frustrating because there will be enemy rushing to you, but 
 it isn't hard to defeat them because you can change the difficulty on the fights) .
  
  A thing that was quite poor but also a bit funny, was that sometimes you can stand right next to 
 an enemy and he won't see you, but sometime this won't work.
  
  Now for the puzzles, I like the puzzles very very very very very very very very much. Not too easy 
 and not too hard, just perfect. Since I almost had forgotten everything they did it wasn't hard 
 to solve the puzzles some of them are ridiculously easy when and some takes some minuets to figure 
 out. The only annoying thing about some puzzles is that you need to find things to complete them, 
 like statues etc., it can get boring to search for them.
  
  The game overall is great, puzzles that keep you up for hours and it's really worth the money for 
 those of you who read the book!

Review:  Ok - first of all: This game is NOT worth $30.00, even if you factor in the movie pass (included 
 in some games.)
  
  The first thing you will notice in the game is the odd camera positioning and, almost right after 
 that, the difficulty. Even if you consider yourself smart, this game is EXTREMELY hard. And if 
 you're not smart. Repeat after me:
  
  "I am not going to buy this game."
  
  The graphics are OK.
  
  But the difficulty can get really, really, annoying, and the game doesn't 
 even feel that exciting.
  
  Unless you're a die-hard Da Vinci Code fan, I would not recommend this game.
  
  There are many 
 games that are priced at $30 that are much better than this one.
