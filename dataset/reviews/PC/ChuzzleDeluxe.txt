:::Review:::
Chuzzle is an adorable match-three game with a great variety of options. 

  Chuzzle is an interesting blend of a simple match-three game like Bejeweled and a brain-busting 
 puzzle game like Cogito. Instead of swapping individual rows of jewels or the like, you've got 
 to grab and move an entire row or column to form groups of three like-colored chuzzles. Since the 
 end of the board wraps around to the other side, this mechanic has almost a conveyor-belt feel 
 to it -- except when the game starts to throw curveballs at you, like exploding chuzzles, obese chuzzles 
 that can't wrap around the side of the screen, and locked chuzzles that freeze the lines they fall 
 on. In addition to sequential levels, the game also features a time trial mode, a very comprehensive 
 puzzle mode, and a relaxed Zen mode that gives you all the hints you need. Presentationwise, the 
 chuzzles, which are silly little poof-balls with animated, googly eyes, add some personality to 
 the game's clean look. Chuzzle's excellent neo-disco soundtrack also deserves special mention. 
 On the other hand, the free online version of the game (which lacks the soundtrack and other options) 
 may be a better value, if you're interested only in short play sessions.

Review:  This game is good in every way. It is colorful and even has a colorblind mode for people who can't 
 tell the colours. The cute chuzzles pop up around the screen and you have to match 3 in a row. 
 The most addictive game of all time, and a must have for anyone who wants plain old fashioned fun. 
 It has almost no flaws, except the fact you probably won't ever get a turn because the other person 
 won't leave the game! It has classic, timed and puzzle mode and has many types of chuzzles. Coloured, 
 rainbow, locked and even fattie chuzzles. Can get hard as you go on, but if you won't play this 
 then you won't play anything. If this gamne isn't hte most addicting game ever, thrn something 
 wrong is going on on this world. Good dosen't even desribe this game. Good graphics, good gameplay, 
 good fun. I recommend having it.

Review:  I have to say I downloaded every demo for these short puzzle/tetris clones and I found this one 
 to be right up my alley.. It was the only one that addicted me. Sure the others had better graphics 
 and sounds.. but you can't hold a candle to the others like you can this one. The game is pretty 
 simple and offers a great deal of replay value since you want to get every badge or trophy there 
 is in the game.. this requires you do do certain things in order to achieve the trophy... Gameplay: 
 Simply fantastic.. very simple and easy to master
  Graphics: I have to say the chuzzles and fat chuzzles got a few laughs from me.. so I have to say 
 the game has great graphics :)
  
  Sound: Just as it should be cutesy and uplifting.. definite choice if your feeling at all depressed, 
 it will sure to send a smile to ya!
  
  Value: Great replay value.. and since its a mindless game as it is like Tetris.. it is addictive 
 fun!
  
  I recommend this game to anyone who loves Tetris type games.. you won't be disappointed :)

Review:  I Cant Believe im Writing a Review on this game, But i seen it needed Reviews So Here it is... 
 I Got this for My Mom for a Christmas gift . It is Highly Addictine, I mean you will be like ok 
 just one more game And then by the time you get done you actually played 12 more times. I have 
 spent maybe 5 hours on it, But my mom has Spent Jeez like 45 hours or so.. I mean on Christma day 
 she spent 10 hours at least, and its a game she plays everyday for about an hour or 2...
  
  Its A Colorful Game, With Cute Furry Balls you Pop ( that sounded Soooo Wrong) there is a few diffrent 
 options, there is classic chuzzle, there is speed which is theres this time bar and if you dont 
 pop chuzzles very fast it puts a lock on a chuzzle and eventually you run out of moves, but it 
 gives you 2 or 3 trys. there is zen chuzzle which means its never ending , and then their is puzzle 
 chuzzle, which is you figure the puzzles and drag your chuzzles around intil u make a layout thing 
 match.
  
  The Music in it Sounds all 70s, But it is Sooo Rad though...
  
  The game is Great, And one of the Best Puzzle games ever
  
  Chuzzle and Collapse are the Best 
 Puzzle Games To EVER Be Created
  
  This is Also a game you caan get and Just bam its sooo easy to figure out how to play it, LOL

Review:  Chuzzle is a fun and highly addictive game. Trophies are given for various game play achievements 
 making it somewhat more of a challenge than Bejewelled where the only goal is racking up points 
 and levels. 
  
  A cute interface also makes this addictive game very entertaining. By interacting with the Chuzzles 
 you can make them burp, lose their hair and wiggle their eyes, among other things. A game that 
 makes you forget the time.
  
  Good for all ages too! My younger niece and nephew love the game. Even Grandma plays Chuzzle! In 
 fact we all compete to see who can get the most trophies. Highly recommended!

Review:  I've always liked old school puzzle games; and chuzzle, nearly belonging to the same category is 
 packed with hours of addictive play. The graphics are very robust and beautifuly done, packed with 
 the gameplay, chuzzle is any puzzle fan's choice. Its just ripped to the basics, forgetting complex 
 gameplay, and truly it worth every single thing it comes with. You just have to match the chuzzles 
 of the same colour and make your way through. Lucily, you can get combination for some extra points. 
 The sound is also very well done and, done with perfect co-ordination to the gameplay and graphics. 
 It is truly recommended to any puzzle genre fan.
