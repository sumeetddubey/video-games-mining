:::Review:::
Anyone who's still playing Total Annihilation presumably knows the ropes by now. While Battle Tactics 
 is certainly a strong product by typical standards, it is disappointing in light of Total Annihilation's 
 ambitious history. 

 The success of Total Annihilation, Cavedog's 3D real-time strategy game, must be attributed in part 
 to its sheer size. With well over 100 units and two long single-player campaigns, Total Annihilation 
 offered so much more than its competition that it compelled gamers to take a closer look, where 
 they found a game whose quality matched its scope. But even in the face of a major hit, Cavedog 
 didn't rest on its laurels: It offered new units for download on a weekly basis, more multiplayer 
 maps, and an editor, all to help fans maintain interest. Meanwhile, the first official Total Annihilation 
 add-on, The Core Contingency, offered a whopping 75 new units, and much more single- and multiplayer 
 action, and was heralded as being among the all-time best supplements for a real-time strategy 
 game. Unfortunately, the second add-on isn't much of an encore. Its problem isn't as specific as 
 it is fundamental. Between its late arrival and its proclaimed purpose as an instructional tool, 
 Battle Tactics won't appeal or impress. Anyone who's still playing Total Annihilation presumably 
 knows the ropes by now. While Battle Tactics is certainly a strong product by typical standards, 
 it is disappointing in light of Total Annihilation's ambitious history.  

 Like the original half-hearted add-ons for Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert, Battle Tactics is 
 primarily composed of a series of disconnected single-player missions. The difference, in true 
 Cavedog fashion, is that while the old Command &amp; Conquer add-ons offered a little over a dozen 
 missions, Battle Tactics presents a hundred. These missions are categorized by length from very 
 short to long and divided in half between the warring Arm and Core factions. Many of these missions 
 are purely tactical and are designed to force you to make do with what you're given and not worry 
 so much about building your base and managing resources as in a typical game of Total Annihilation. 
 Mission briefings, meanwhile, are chock-full of useful tips and strategies. The idea, apparently, 
 was that these various tactical situations would be perfectly suited for the novice looking to 
 become a real pro; otherwise, they'd satisfy the veteran's fix for instant action. But Battle Tactics 
 only marginally succeeds at these intentions.  

 The key to Total Annihilation is learning to balance construction and resource management with maintaining 
 an ever-growing military. Battle Tactics essentially eliminates the construction and often the 
 resource management aspects, leaving you in charge of the military elements exclusively. Sure, 
 it's fun to start off with around a hundred tanks of all shape and form, or a hundred ships or 
 planes, and to send these massive armies forward to decimate the enemy. It's not often feasible 
 to build forces of that size in a typical game of Total Annihilation, so Battle Tactics certainly 
 presents an opportunity to coordinate battles on a much larger scale, which can be fun for a while. 
 However, in consequence of this design model, Battle Tactics falls short of its goal as a teaching 
 device. It may coach you on how best to command and defend a fleet of Warlord-class battleships, 
 but it doesn't tell you how to maintain a supply of metal and energy to create an armada like that 
 in the first place. Like some useless two-week self-defense course, Battle Tactics teaches you 
 how to handle any number of too-specific situations, none of which you would ever actually encounter. 

 Another side effect of Battle Tactics is that, in trying to make the game feel faster and more action-packed, 
 it ends up feeling emptier and less fulfilling - and at its worst, boring. The fact is, Total Annihilation 
 is not a tactical game. This add-on attempts to turn it into one by stripping away the start-up 
 process on most missions, but in doing so it merely eliminates half the reason why Total Annihilation 
 is fun in the first place.  

 Battle Tactics includes all the downloadable units previously made available from Cavedog, some 
 of the units and new map types from The Core Contingency, and a mere handful of its own unique 
 additions. Furthermore, it's hard to deny that the game's graphics are starting to look a little 
 old, and even the spectacular soundtrack is starting to wear thin. Battle Tactics doesn't change 
 any aesthetic elements; its only real asset is its abundance of single-player missions. And while 
 most of them are both cleverly designed and well-balanced across all three difficulty settings, 
 after you win a few you'll quickly realize that they're no replacement for a good multiplayer battle. 
 After all, if you remain a hard-core Total Annihilation player, it's more than likely that you've 
 moved on from the single-player game altogether, in which case Battle Tactics has little to offer. 
 Total Annihilation's strength never has been in its single-player game, and with the reduction 
 of the thinking and planning stage, Battle Tactics reveals that shortcoming in an all-new light.

Review:  Battle Tactics is an add-on to the 1997 game Total Annihilation. It contains a slew of single player 
 campaign missions for both factions. There is a very short campaign for each and then a short campaign, 
 then a medium campaign all the way up to a very long campaign for each side. So it does pack in 
 a lot of single player gameplay, but TA has never really been about single player gameplay. It 
 also contains a few maps for you to play on, but these are now freely downloadable online. So if 
 you really like to play single player campaign missions then I suppose you might enjoy Battle Tactics, 
 but compared to TA's other expansion Core Contingency, Battle Tactics is very very weak.

Review:  Another expansion with more things to use to blow your enemy apart, although I love using a nuke, 
 500 peewees shall do.
  This expansion comes with a few more details than the others and is a must have if you have the 
 original. New maps more missions more enemies and some minor improvements to game play but its 
 still your classical master piece RTS game that everyone loved. Depending on if you like the more 
 options you have or not atleast its a kickass game anyone can enjoy.
  
  Just remember that any game can be good or bad its just how you like things, and this game is just 
 perfect for just you alone.

Review:  Battle Tactics, second data disc for the famous "Total Annihilation" was released in 1998 and it 
 wasnt as successful as the previous "Core Contingency" title. But it still has got the power to 
 impress.
  
  It brings about one hundred and fifty new units, a few new structures and some new locations to 
 play in. And thats it. Sure, there are four brand new campaigns, but its just a bunch of new 
 battlefields with orders like "search&destroy."
  
  The main reason why this data disc was released is, that you can use these new features in multiplayer 
 battles. A lots of new maps, new units and some minor fixes. Thats why this game is needed if 
 you want to play online (even these days, you can find servers!) .
  
  Final score: If you are the fan of an original game, then find this expansion in your nearby CD 
 store.

Review:  This is an add-on for the Total Annihilation game for PC. It is well worth picking up as you get 
 a lot of new maps and toys to play with.
  
  I love this game; I have loved this game since I cracked it out of its shrink-wrap!!! With the 
 addition of the expansion packs and the downloadable extras it just adds to the overall great experience 
 of this classic game. I love single player mode as multi player is some times very long and drawn 
 out! Single player allows you to speed up time to ease the wait of mining and collecting ore metal 
 and energy. This game is not mindless; there is a definite strategy to gaining the right offences 
 and defenses and putting them in the right place. The computer (sometimes) learns what works and 
 what does not and will attack and defend accordingly. Check the discount shelf!!!
