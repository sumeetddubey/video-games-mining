:::Review:::
It has two tragic flaws, and these problems are so overwhelming that the good parts seem wasted. 
 

 If everything about Prince of Persia 3D were bad, it wouldn't be nearly as frustrating as it is. 
 If the game were terrible or even mediocre, it would be easy to file away with all other such games 
 that come out month after month. But there is much to like about Prince of Persia 3D, and certain 
 aspects of it are especially excellent. Yet this third outing for Jordan Mechner's swashbuckling 
 hero has two tragic flaws, and these problems are so overwhelming that the good parts seem wasted. 

 The previous two Prince of Persia games, the first from 1989 and its sequel The Shadow and the Flame 
 from 1993, were both side-scrolling action games. In them, you controlled the prince as he climbed 
 ledges, fought guards, and jumped over and crawled under traps, all in search of his beloved and 
 imprisoned fiance. Prince of Persia 3D follows this formula exactly, only this time the game is 
 in 3D, and the prince and his princess are married. But once again, the prince has been imprisoned 
 and left for dead, and he must escape the clutches of the villain and rescue his fair maiden.  
 

 That Prince of Persia 3D is essentially a three-dimensional version of its predecessors is no criticism. 
 In fact, the trap-jumping, guard-fighting gameplay of the original translates nicely to 3D, and 
 the best part of the game is how effectively it utilizes these elements. Only a handful of games 
 have so successfully created the feeling that you are capable of such daring feats. During the 
 course of the game, you'll find yourself swinging from ropes across wide chasms, leaping off high 
 ledges to slide down rising drawbridges, and other exciting stunts.  

 The excellent level design in Prince of Persia 3D makes such stunts commonplace. The game is well 
 paced; it has just enough enemies so combat doesn't get tedious, enough exciting moments to make 
 you want to keep playing, and enough puzzles to keep things interesting in between. The levels 
 also look quite stunning and are filled with big, exotic architecture and wondrous gadgets and 
 machinery.  

 But while the levels themselves look great, the characters that populate them don't. That's not 
 to say they look bad (except in the cutscenes, in which the disproportional bodies and strange 
 faces of the characters can look downright ugly) , but they don't look particularly special either. 
 The motion-captured animation looks great, except when the prince runs up stairs or ramps, at which 
 point he looks like an old man who just doesn't have it in him anymore. Then again, it's been ten 
 years since he first took to adventuring, so perhaps we should give him a break.  

 The inconsistent visuals would be easier to ignore if the game didn't have more serious problems. 
 The game's worst flaw is its sluggish and unresponsive control. Turning the prince while running 
 feels like trying to steer an 18-wheeler. He turns wide, which makes running around corners a chore. 
 And the game often won't respond to two commands at once, so that actions such as drawing your 
 weapon or simply jumping while running are far more difficult than they should be.  

 The perspective is almost as problematic. The camera stays at a fixed point behind the prince, and 
 only occasionally adjusts itself to clear objects and obstructions. You can control the camera 
 Tomb Raider-style if you stand still and manipulate it manually. But that doesn't help when your 
 back is against a wall and you're trying to make a difficult jump while the camera is showing you 
 in close-up profile. Such situations are all too common in Prince of Persia 3D.  

 During combat, the camera angle is less of an issue because the perspective switches to a side view 
 when your weapon is drawn, and while this feature is helpful, it too produces its share of annoyances. 
 You can't turn while your weapon is drawn, which makes lining up with an enemy difficult. Thankfully, 
 enemies will run up and get in position for a fight, but often you'll just start swinging wildly 
 while they bash away at you. Then again, this problem goes both ways; your enemies will just as 
 often not be able to hit you while you whack away at them with impunity.  

 Prince of Persia 3D would have been amazing had it been more refined in certain specific areas. 
 The quality of the levels will more than likely make you want to keep playing despite its flaws, 
 but these flaws will be a constant source of dismay for anyone who just wants to enjoy jumping 
 and slashing around in the otherwise well designed world.

Review:  Prince of Persia 3D marks the entrance of the Prince of Persia franchise into the realm of 3D, 
 hence the gimmicky title. It's a platforming game with combat mixed in, and is divided into various 
 distinct linear levels. The game has many good points, but at the same time there are some rather 
 large flaws. Overall, it's of mild interest to those who like the action adventure genre, especially 
 those who like other Prince of Persia games.
  
  The combat is amusing for a while although buggy. Since there is no turning in combat, you and 
 your enemy often won't be facing each other. This means that you can cut your opponent apart with 
 impunity, although the same is sometimes true. If you run up to an enemy and take out your weapon 
 right in his face, he won't even detect you and you can cut him apart. In fact, this was usable 
 against one of the game's two bosses. Through these easily found exploits you can easily win any 
 fight, so it's up to you to decide whether to actually fight. This makes these bugs actually quite 
 welcome at times; by the end of the game I was sick of the combat and was glitching through every 
 fight.
  
  This seems like the type of game to have a well-developed plot, but it doesn't. The story is told 
 through a few cut scenes spread through the game and doesn't always make sense. For example, the 
 entire plot is based on the Sultan forgetting that he betrothed his already-married daughter to 
 a monster. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't do that in the first place, much less forget 
 about it.
  
  The level design is the redeeming quality of this game. The levels are very cleverly made and varied. 
 They do seem contrived at times, but that's almost expected from a game in this genre. They are 
 colorful and make full use of the Prince's abilities. The biggest problem is that the levels include 
 moving platforms that the game doesn't always place in the correct spots. Sometimes the platforms 
 will be floating off in the middle of nowhere and you simply won't be able to cross the required 
 gap. I had to play through levels multiple times until the platforms were all in passable conditions.
 
  
  The graphics aren't very impressive at all. Most everything is blocky, but the textures are at 
 least half decent. Admittedly I didn't play this at the time of the release, but it looks significantly 
 worse than other games of that time. For example, Half-Life looks significantly better and was 
 released a year before. The sound however is fine and some of the music was quite catchy.
  
  The biggest problem is how clunky the controls are. You turn slowly and don't always jump when 
 you press the key. You can easily make it through the game despite this, but it definitely leeches 
 some of the enjoyment.
  
  The game took 11 hours to complete, and although I may have missed a secret or two, there is little 
 replay value. Despite the flaws, it was definitely fun. In short, if you see this game in a bargain 
 bin, go for it, but don't bother searching it out; there are plenty of better games.

Review:  Gameplay: The previous two Prince of Persia games, the first from 1989 and its sequel The Shadow 
 and the Flame from 1993, were both side-scrolling action games. In them, you controlled the prince 
 as he climbed ledges, fought guards, and jumped over and crawled under traps, all in search of 
 his beloved and imprisoned fianc&eacute; e. Prince of Persia 3D follows this formula exactly, only 
 this time the game is in 3D, and the prince and his princess are married. But once again, the prince 
 has been imprisoned and left for dead, and he must escape the clutches of the villain and rescue 
 his fair maiden. So pretty much there is the same gameplay elements from the orginainal, you'll 
 find yourself swinging from ropes across wide chasms, leaping off high ledges to slide down rising 
 drawbridges, and other exciting stunts accept they are in 3-D plus the company added a few mores 
 movies to the prince from the original. The Levels are well done and you can do many of thoughs 
 cool acrobatic stunts. There is just enough enemies so that the game does not get to annoying and 
 you get The bow, A magic stuff, A sword and Dual Swords that you get to fight your enemies with. 
 The game's worst flaw is its sluggish and unresponsive control. Turning the prince while running 
 feels like trying to steer an 18-wheeler. He turns wide, which makes running around corners a chore. 
 The Camera view is kinda like the old Tomb Radier style and when Graphics: Puzzles keep things 
 interesting in between. The diffrent levels also look quite amazing to look at and are filled with 
 big, exotic architecture and wondrous gadgets and machinery. Though the character designs don't 
 look as good and sometimes the designs of the other characters look bad.
  
  Sound: The sound is allright everything should sound like it should. Sound track is not bad either 
 it has a middle eastern flare to it.
  
  Value: Well the replay value is ok if you can forgive the flaws in the game it's great to play 
 again.
  
  So this is a good game to add to you game collection even though there are some major flaws in 
 this game, but over all this is a good game. I would recommend this game if you can forgive the 
 mistakes in the game.
  I give this game 8.5 out of 10

Review:  THE NEW PRINCE OF PERSIA GAMES ARE EXCELLENT AND I WOULNT SAY THAT THIS GAME IS BETTER THAN THEM, 
 BUT STILL I WOULDNT SAY THAT THESE GAMES IS BETTER THAN THIS GAME.
  THE NEW PRINCE OF PERSIA GAMES MISSES SOMETHING, NAMELY THE GOOD OLD PRINCE OF PERSIA FEEL, THE 
 FEEL YOU HAD WHEN PLAYING THE 1 SIDESCROLLING PRINCE OF PERSIA.
  THIS GAME PRINCE OF PERSIA HAS THIS FEEL AND DELIVERS IT WELL.
  THE GRAPHICS ARE OUTDATED, BUT 
 STILL VERY BEATIFULL FOR BEING SO OLD.
  THE MUSIC IS OUTSTANDING AND REALLY IMPROVES THE FEEL TO THE ATMOSPHERE.
  THE GAME IS HARD AND 
 LONGLASTING.
  THE GAME HAS REALLY COOL FIMSEQUENCES WITH GREAT VOICEACTORS AND SCRIPT.
  IT IS FUNNY DOING THE SWORD FIGHTS, IT IS THE SAME AS THE SIDESCROLLING GAME ONLY IN 3D, YOU HAVE 
 TO BLOCK THE ENEMYS ATTACKS AND AFTERWARDS ATTACK THE ENEMY YOURSELF.
  I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT SOME PEOPLE DISLIKE THIS GAME, BUT THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE THEY DONT LIKE THE 
 GENRE OF THIS GAME.
  THIS IS NO FAST PACED GAME, BUT A GAME WHERE YOU MUST BE CAREFUL, AND SOLVE THE PUZZLES IN THE 
 AREAS MORE SLOWLY.
  STILL IT IS ACROBATIC, DURING THE GAME, YOU WILL USE VINES AND POLES TO GET OVER A LARGE HOLE.
 
  YOU WILL HAVE TO CLIMB UP TOWERS OR SWIM UNDER WATER.
  SOMETHING ELSE THAT NEEDS TO BE MENTIONED IS THE FINE SELECTION OF WEAPONS, WHICH SADDENLY THE 
 NEW PRINCE OF PERSIA DIDNT HAVE.
  THE BOW, THE MAGIC STAFF, THE SWORD, THE DUAL SWORD.
  AND PROBABLY MORE. I HAVENT FINISHED THE WHOLE GAME YET.
  THIS IS A REALLY UNDERRATED OLD-SCHOOL 
 GAME THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE GREATLY REWARDED, AND THE CAMERA THAT EVERYONE SAYS IS SO 
 TERRIBLE IS ONLY TERRIBLE THE FIRST 15 MINUTES OF PROBABLY 20 HOURS, BECAUSE YOU GET USED TO THE 
 CAMERA, THE CAMERA IS NEVER BLOCKING THE VIEW OF YOUR DESTINATION, BUT IT IS THE WAY IT FOLLOWS 
 YOUR CHARACTER, WHICH STRIKES AS ODD THE FIRST 15 MINUTES.
  I THINK THIS GAME IS VERY RARE THESE TIMES THOUGH.
  
  THOUGH.... ONCE FINISHED, DONT EXPECT 
 THAT IT WILL LEAVE YOU WANTING TO REPLAY IT FOR A LONG LONG TIME, BECAUSE IT IS A ONE TIME THROUGH 
 GAME.

Review:  Another installment in the prince of persia series... now in the 3-Dimensional version....
  
  Its got great features incorporated in the previous titles.... still has some flaws. It starts 
 with the prince trapped and condemned to die... while his beloved is taken captive to marry her 
 cousin... Trapped in the dark dungeons, how does our hero save her???
  
  It all begins with the prison and then on to the palace.. from where the princess is taken onto 
 a dirigible and then to some funny land on a spooky hill....
  
  But the game stands on the prince's quest for his wife... barely a few months married they are again 
 separated.... He braves his way out all the way through the artistic 14levels and finally takes 
 her back...
  
  The level designs are impressive but the sounds are just average... but the combat is not upto the 
 mark.... ( seems like a childs play!) ... but has other weapons like bow and arrow which is worth 
 noting
  
  Still it gives the player a new platform in rediscovering ancient persia.... but due to some flaws 
 in the combat section and the narration it still doesnt match the success story of the previous 
 titles..
