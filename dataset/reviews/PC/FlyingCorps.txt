:::Review:::
When it comes down to it, the simplicity is what makes Flying Corps so fun. 

 Flight-models in WWI flight-sims have advantages and disadvantages. Fortunately the advantages - 
 being able to effortlessly take to the air, perform death-defying aerials, loops, and swoops and 
 then glide in for a ten-point landing - outweigh the disadvantage of being easily picked off by 
 an opposing plane's machine gun. It's the evasive, gymnastic maneuvers you have to pull off in 
 biplane sims (such as the classic Red Baron) that add a new, visceral dimension to an otherwise 
 dull simulation. Empire Interactive's latest WWI flying game, Flying Corps, treats you to all the 
 gut-wrenching, dizzying excitement of participating in an air-battle over France circa the 1910s, 
 putting you behind the controls of a variety of historical aircraft that made their mark in WWI. 
   

 The designers at Rowan have been hitting their history books. For players who are sticklers for 
 accuracy, most of the physical idiosyncrasies of the original planes have been included in Flying 
 Corps' flight models. For example, the infamous Sopwith Camel was said to have a tendency to tilt 
 slightly to the right while performing certain maneuvers. Subtle details like this, as well as 
 others particular to some of the other flight models, were not overlooked by the game's designers. 
   

 Everything from elemental physics to flight-model realism is included. But what is really exciting 
 about the game is the fact that your CPU comrades and foes are autonomous. Many times you will 
 fly up to a battle that is already in progress, cheering your far-off compatriots who successfully 
 gun down or bomb the enemy, lamenting those who are struck down right before your eyes. You don't 
 want to go turning just anybody's plane to splinters in this game: If you're not close enough to 
 identify an aircraft, you may be attacking one of your friends.   

 Graphically, Flying Corps is topnotch. Every element, from the colorful aircraft fuselages to the 
 rolling French countryside below, is texture-mapped to achieve the highest realism. And when you 
 run the game under DOS, the frame rate is more than satisfactory.   

 Though Empire Interactive took the time to painstakingly outline the specs for each plane, because 
 of the nature of the flight-models you're dealing with, this game has more of an arcade feel than 
 most sims out there. But when it comes down to it, the simplicity is what makes Flying Corps so 
 fun. There's nothing like the feeling of performing a daredevil roll to escape a trailing attacker 
 only to swing around and begin taking his wings off. It's that kind of absorbing action that makes 
 Flying Corps a satisfying gaming experience. If you enjoy the simplicity of WWI flight-sims such 
 as Red Baron, you will certainly find Flying Corps satisfying - every stomach-turning, death-defying 
 minute of it.

Review:  I first recieved Flying Corps as a Christmas present when I was nine. It is true to say this really 
 sparked my love of flight sims. You are given different campaigns to choose from and in each you 
 play the ace from that nation. ie: Von Richthofen, Knickerbacker
  Within minutes of taking off your thrown into a pitched dogfight. These dogfights however are more 
 simple than the compicity of Il2 Sturmovik or MC FS, however despite its simplicity it still makes 
 the fight challenging. You have to evade fighters when they get on your tail and maneuver yourself 
 so you can get a shot off and destroy your foe. Aswell as that you can also personalise your aeroplane 
 making whatever you want. Naturally mine was all black with skull and crossbones on the side. 
 
  If you haven't been satisfied yet by the campaign content Flying Corps also has certain scenarios 
 which ask you to destroy a certain opponent or evade an enemy. 
  Many people today won't be able to play the game due to the awful graphics and sound effects, me 
 included, but it remains in my heart as one of the greatest flight sims of all time!
