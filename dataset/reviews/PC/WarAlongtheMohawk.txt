:::Review:::
War Along the Mohawk consists of a lot of good and ambitious ideas thrown into a melting pot and 
 mixed haphazardly. 

 It's always interesting when a company produces a game based on a historical era that is rarely 
 if ever visited by gamers. So when War Along the Mohawk (known in Europe as Fields of Fire) was 
 announced, it was treated with some enthusiasm because of its time period, the French and Indian 
 War (or the Seven Years War in Europe) . When it finally came out in the US, it was immediately 
 met with skepticism. The price point was low - $20 - which was not a good sign from the quality 
 perspective; it apparently was yet another real-time strategy game during a deluge of RTS games; 
 and it was conceived by Edward Grabowski. Grabowski has produced some interesting games in the 
 past, such as a variety of microminiature wargames for Impressions and more recently the Grand 
 Prix Manager series, but these games have often failed in execution. So is War Along the Mohawk 
 more of the same?  

 The premise behind the game is actually very ambitious. War Along the Mohawk claims to mix role-playing 
 with real-time strategy, while set in a very historical and somewhat dynamic backdrop - war in 
 America around 1757. You can choose one of two sides, the French or the British, and one of a total 
 of 40 player characters, each with differing characteristics and special abilities as well as their 
 own unique voices, similar to Jagged Alliance. Of course, the voices run the gamut between believable 
 and farcical - one in particular has a voice reminiscent of Ringo Starr. You are then thrust into 
 the first mission of the campaign with orders to report to the commanding officer at the local 
 fort.   

 Besides the tutorial, each campaign (one for the British and the French) consists of 18 missions 
 that must be completed in succession; failure will result in having to play the mission over until 
 finished. After a briefing by the local commander, you are then given a list of other player characters 
 to fill out the makeup of the party, the size of which is dependent on the mission (about four 
 or five characters is average) . Success in a mission typically revolves around the characters available 
 and which you pick, so pay close attention to their abilities in regard to the mission at hand. 
   

 Missions usually involve traversing the main map around the fort to a designated flag where the 
 party is then transported to a new map where the main mission is to transpire. This is all where 
 the real-time engine takes form. The game's controls are similar to other real-time strategy games, 
 as are the situations. While the main characters are out traversing the camp map (which is rather 
 large although the fort is not) the fort can come under attack, and you are forced to defend against 
 enemy incursions. All sorts of wild animals inhabit the woods and can cause problems for the characters. 
 The missions themselves are very objective oriented, and sometimes the exact way of figuring them 
 out is not always intuitive. Thankfully the game manual has a nice hints and tips section for each 
 of the missions.  

 When one thinks of a game based on a historical situation, like War Along the Mohawk, one would 
 tend to think that it has some form of historical realism about it. Well, War Along the Mohawk 
 has almost nothing of the sort, except for the period feel, characters, and weapons involved. It 
 can take four of five hits with a musket to kill a man, and pitched one-on-one battles are often 
 nail-biting musket slug fests to see who shoots whom first the most times while standing ten feet 
 away from each other. If attacked by Indians, a British soldier might get a useless shot off before 
 becoming easy meat to an Indian's tomahawk, since many are inept at close combat. While this is 
 not a call for realistically modeled combat in essentially a typically real-time strategy game, 
 combat in War Along the Mohawk needs some serious work.  

 So many bears and other nasty creatures inhabit the world that one wonders how anybody ever survived 
 without getting mauled a dozen times. Character artificial intelligence is weak and lacking in 
 quite a few areas, although the pathfinding is actually quite decent. The game's graphics are functional 
 at best, and frequently units can become lost in the graphics, such as being masked by a fort tower 
 or another building, which is very annoying. Characters also have some pretty strange abilities 
 that hark back to fantasy RPGs - abilities like "wolf control." Sounds of battle (or just some 
 poor trader getting accosted by furry animals in the woods) can be heard from anywhere on the map, 
 but you may have no idea where from.   

 War Along the Mohawk has some interesting facets to it, but as a whole it falls flat. Unlike other 
 real-time strategy games, each of the characters has a particular facing, so if a group of characters 
 is looking in one direction, the area behind them is obscured with a fog of war. Unit formations 
 and formation manipulation commands are also supplied, which can become important in certain situations 
 but is sure easy to disrupt. The role-playing elements are at the very least an interesting addition, 
 as the character can acquire items during the course of a mission (dead forest creatures for instance 
 may be skinned for useful furs) , sell them, and buy new pieces of equipment from the fort's store. 
 Hiding from the enemy, use of elevated terrain, and ambushes are also incorporated into the game, 
 as well as multiplayer support.  

 War Along the Mohawk consists of a lot of good and ambitious ideas thrown into a melting pot and 
 mixed haphazardly. It has potential, but it is lost in the bland graphics, odd combat resolution, 
 and dreariness of moving from one map to the other at a snail's pace. With an initial price of 
 only $20 one cannot expect too much out of a game, but War Along the Mohawk could have been worth 
 so much more.
