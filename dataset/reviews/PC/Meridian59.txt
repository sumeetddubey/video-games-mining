:::Review:::
Meridian 59 is only as good as its population. 

 Meridian 59 is a tremendous value for any role-playing gamer looking to engage in a vast and ever-changing 
 3-D fantasy world populated almost exclusively by real human players. A small monthly fee allows 
 for unlimited play within the nearly boundless land that is Meridian, and it's a land that becomes 
 increasingly attractive with time as the role-playing gamer grows to appreciate its subtleties 
 and to know its citizens.  

 Meridian 59 looks and sounds awful by the mighty standards of today. Yet while the high-resolution 
 3-D engine is rudely basic, it is effective: You can clearly distinguish a player character from 
 a monster at 50 meters, and Internet latency will never hinder your movement. You can stare a fellow 
 citizen closely in the eye, distinguishing his facial features and expression easily. Sound is 
 scarce and repetitive but interesting enough, while the soundtrack is a mixed bag of MIDI tunes 
 that sound slightly better from the CD.  

 Its gameplay and lasting value make Meridian 59 shine. Once past the painless registration, you 
 must determine a handful of ability scores that will shape the course of your character's existence 
 thereafter. A helpful tutorial then reveals many of features of the game system while helping earn 
 you some much-needed experience at the same time. Fighting is as simple as pressing and holding 
 the Control key and watching the on-screen text and graphics reveal the course of the battle, while 
 more advanced features such as trading goods, setting hot keys, and changing facial expression 
 at whim become second nature in time. When in doubt about a game feature, simply ask one of your 
 fellow players, who will provide a cordial response more often than not.  

 Like most role-playing games, Meridian 59 is in large part all about beefing up your character both 
 with enhanced abilities and fancy equipment. Advancement both in physical ability and magical prowess 
 prove luxuriously slow - do not expect to become a master swordsman in two days' time, or even 
 after several weeks' worth of monster mashing. Meridian 59 demands patience and commitment in order 
 to be truly appreciated.  

 Meridian 59 is only as good as its population - and that population will assuredly prove an interesting 
 one. Most veterans are very friendly to newcomers and will readily offer some useful goods at the 
 newcomer's humble request. Others will be kind enough to protect your equipment should you be slain, 
 waiting patiently for you to return to the site of the killing. Yet some will not prove as amicable: 
 Though Meridian 59 takes many precautions against online crime, players who thrive on killing other 
 player characters run amok occasionally. And while these individuals may seem terribly irritating 
 at the time, in the long run they serve to enrich the experience even further - for they will come 
 to justice more often than not.  

 Chances are you haven't played anything quite like Meridian 59 before. If you can swallow your pride 
 and accept its meager aesthetics for what they are, and if you're willing to use your imagination 
 with your games just like you did in the heyday of computer RPGs, then you will find the world 
 of Meridian to be a most enriching place. The smart, sophisticated audience of this game makes 
 for intriguing company, and in light of the small fee required to play, you can take all the time 
 you wish to get to know it.

Review:  This game brings back so many memories. This was the first of its kind I played. Even though the 
 graphics were mundane and the sounds were nothing really special there was an aspect that made 
 it addictive. There were so many missing elements like knowing when you would level up, class restrictions 
 for equipment and unfinished quests. But like games like this paved the way for more detailed, 
 larger maps and better game dynamics. One of the main attractions to me was the interaction between 
 players. Player killers and Player hunters alike, the fun was there. I guess half the great memories 
 were the friends I made and the hunts we shared. Thanks 3DO for the memories!
