I just felt taken for a ride. And a bumpy one at that. 

 The M1A2 Abrams is America's main battle tank. It is a 60-ton monster with a 1,500 horsepower engine 
 that drives it at speeds up to 65 miles an hour. It can roll over a car like you roll over in bed. 
 Its 120mm cannon can spit a shell of penetrating high-explosive shot 3000 meters, instantly destroying 
 any piece of armor that any nation could field. The modern tank battles it was designed to fight 
 are characterized by fast speeds and long distances. An enemy doesn't even know the Abrams is there 
 until that round of HEAT comes through his turret. In the Gulf War it was not unusual to read of 
 four M1A2s destroying three dozen Iraqi tanks in about twenty minutes, with the Abrams not suffering 
 a scratch. The Iraqis couldn't count a single destroyed Abrams on their butcher's bill during the 
 war.  

 All these things were in my mind as I loaded up Armored Fist 2 and set about exploring the world 
 that NovaLogic had prepared for my entertainment. I began by attempting to drive my tank around 
 and see the sites. There was a nice tutorial with an authoritative-sounding commander shouting 
 orders in order to help me understand navigation, weapons handling, and combined-arms warfare. 
 There were four speed settings I could use: stop, 1/4, 1/2, and full. Engaging any one of them 
 immediately sent the tank on its proscribed course without any steering or input from me. When 
 I did want to steer - say, to avoid a boulder that we were about to drive over - the speed setting 
 disengaged and the tank stopped. My first lesson: Tank drivers can't steer and move ahead at half 
 power at the same time. (They need to use a manual throttle control.)  

 But at least we were under way! I wanted to see what my new hi-tech M1 could do to the slightly 
 chunky and woefully choppy scenery that NovaLogic had provided for me, so I started to drive over 
 things. Well, that was the plan. Nothing, however, could be crushed, or even budged, by my 60-ton 
 truck running at full speed. Not other tanks, not fuel storage, not trucks, not water towers, not 
 even tents and netting. Only supply depots would blow up when I hit them. I wasn't thinking too 
 highly of my new tank. Aren't large explosions supposed to ensue when a tank runs into, for instance, 
 a tanker full of fuel? It was my first hint that all the hype about this M1A2 Abrams had been just 
 that: hype.  

 A modern tank commander has state-of-the-art technology at his fingertips to survey the situation, 
 communicate with the other tanks in his platoon, and deliver ordinance on target. A crew of four 
 drives the tank, loads shot, fires the cannon, and monitors the hi-tech instruments. I didn't see 
 any hi-tech instruments in my particular tank, and while I found that the crew handled themselves 
 pretty well, the other tanks in my platoon were a positive disgrace: missing their targets and 
 exposing themselves to fire. Maybe it was because I just didn't have the ability to give them proper 
 orders: All I could do was set a formation and tell them to move, stop, fire, and don't fire. Heck, 
 I couldn't even move a waypoint without replotting my entire course. Maybe it was my leadership 
 that was poor, and not them... I began to feel a bit better about the Abrams when I opened fire 
 with my machine gun. To my amazement, this rather humble device was so powerful that a short burst 
 from it would level a three-story building! I hadn't realized that bullets could do that. Nor had 
 I realized that a tracked vehicle could climb a 60-degree incline at well-nigh full speed. I was 
 feeling good. My tank could do things no other tank could. This good feeling persisted right up 
 until I got into some action.  

 That's right: There were foes to crush in Africa, The Soviet Union (I thought that didn't exist 
 any more) , Belarus, and someplace else. It doesn't matter. All the locations had the same washed 
 out, chunky look to them, and all the missions (something like 50 of 'em) seemed to take place 
 within a few hundred square yards. For a tank that's supposed to engage enemies from over a mile 
 away, I found these close quarters cramping. It was also pretty disconcerting to have weaker enemies 
 kill my tanks - tanks that have never suffered a battlefield loss - while my sabot and HEAT rounds 
 bounced harmlessly off their shells. I soon grew bored with missions in faraway areas, because 
 no matter what the goal or location or time of day, they all felt exactly the same and all took 
 place in a small, confining areas.  

 It was a sore disappointment to me. I had been led to believe that Yankee know-how was the best 
 in the world, yet here was a hi-tech armored vehicle that was half white elephant and half super 
 machine, and not in the right halves. I didn't feel like I'd had fun with my tank. I just felt 
 taken for a ride. And a bumpy one at that.
