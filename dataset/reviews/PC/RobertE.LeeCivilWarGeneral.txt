:::Review:::
If you like Civil War games, this one deserves a place by your computer. 

 Robert E. Lee was one of the most respected figures of the Civil War. Admired by both friend and 
 foe, he demonstrated his tactical brilliance on numerous occasions. Frequently outnumbered by the 
 Union forces, he managed to confuse, confound, and frustrate the Union generals that faced him 
 on the battlefield. Robert E. Lee: Civil War General gives you the opportunity to duplicate his 
 accomplishments. Can you do as wellor perhaps even do him one better?  

 Robert E. Lee: Civil War General is one of the better Civil War strategy games released this year. 
 While it shares an uncanny resemblance to Talonsoft's Battleground: Gettysburg, it does offer a 
 number of impressive features. The game allows you to re-create several critical battles from Lee's 
 career as the leader of the Army of Northern Virginia. A campaign mode strings the battles together 
 while adding resource management to the list of challenges.  

 Visually, Robert E. Lee: Civil War General is an impressive game. Small groups of infantry, cavalry, 
 artillery, and specialists move across graphically detailed terrain. When units move into combat, 
 you see a pall of smoke over the skirmish before the results are revealed. Video clips add an authentic 
 feel to the action on the battlefield. In addition, the sound effects are good, but not awe-inspiring. 
 Battle sounds include charging horses, marching troops, and firing guns. The period music does 
 give you something to listen to as you watch your troops flee from their positions.  

 The game itself includes a functional tutorial to get you started. You simply load the saved game, 
 read the manual, and follow the instructions. Once you're familiar with the point-and-click-and-press 
 interface, it's time to start the war. The game allows you to choose from three different levels 
 of difficulty. On the hardest level, the typical charge the guns, boys! approach will 
 lead to horrendous casualties among your troops. Defensive tactics are more effective, because 
 the computer opponent will charge (and die) a few times before trying to encircle your defenses. 
 Overall, the computer does give you a run for your money on certain battles.  

 The campaign mode, which is only available to the Confederacy, is one of this game's premiere features. 
 You must pay attention to which forces are good, which ones need new weapons, and which ones could 
 benefit from a change of command. Each success (or failure) on the battlefield leads to new opportunities 
 to overhaul your forces. If you want to take a break during gameplay, Sierra has included a history 
 supplement to give you additional information on the conflict. If you like Civil War games, this 
 one deserves a place by your computer.

Review:  So... since I just purchased my membership 30 minutes ago.... and I followed all the download procedures... and 
 when I tried to open it up and play Robert E. Lee, Civil War I get a notice saying it won't start 
 because Smack32. dll whatever that is... cannot be found. Found where I would like to ask the people 
 at GameSpot except I have spent 29 of the so far 30 minutes of my membership trying to actually 
 send them an email requesting help... and guess what??
  
  You can't get there from here!! I keep being directed to help letters or some sort of online bulletin 
 board where other poor souls send their cries for help... and I guess, some other nerd who knows 
 more about computer games helps them.
  
  GameSpot?? couldn't find them. anywhere. at least not in the help section. And the blurb that says 
 ... this is the best place to contact us dosen't allow you to send an email/inquiry for help to 
 anyone... so you just go back and forth... reading other poor souls sad email rants about the problems 
 they are having.
  
  So... if someone reads this... either email me... or, GameSpot officials, send my money back or cancel 
 my subscription. Thanks. The score is for GameSpot... not for old Bobby Lee... and their score so 
 far is... ABYSMAL!!

Review:  This game pretty plays out like a sort of chess game strategy game. I bought this game nearly ten 
 years ago but I think this game had some of the best graphics of its time. The game is really tough 
 at times. The game requires you to really use your head before you make a move. The game provides 
 differnet armies on your team such as: cavalry, sharpshooters, , artillery, and basic rifled army. 
 Having these different groupings of soldiers becomes a sort of ro-sham-bo type of a game. For example 
 if you order your cavalry unit to attack an enemy's aritillery unit be prepared to lose plenty 
 of casualties. The game adds some visuals just like the early Command and Conquer games be showing 
 actual reinactments of the Civil War. The game also features a campaign mode which you can equip 
 your armies with weapons you can purchase. I'm not sure this game would be worth picking up today, 
 but back then this game was worth the playing time.

Review:  This was my first computer game and it was a good one at the time. Its a good game where you have 
 to think before moving a regiment or brigade. The music will get stuck in your head. There were 
 only a couple things I didn't like about it such as it is turn based and not real time and every 
 battle I beat the computer by digging in and going on the defense. So for the battle of Gettysburg 
 I ended the battle right where it started... McPhersons farm. one thing that didnt bother me 
 was the fact that the union would face one direction and the confederates would face the other 
 way the whole time and there is no way to rotate the units on the map and there were times when 
 both forces would appear that they are retreating from each other when in fact they are just positioned 
 across from each other ready to attack or defend each other. It was a fun pre-Sid Meier's Gettysburg 
 Civil War game.
