:::Review:::
With the glaring omissions fixed and a graphics overhaul, Pro Pilot could be contender. 

 Sierra touts Pro Pilot as the best program of its kind, a lofty claim for any program to make. But 
 when that claim is made against Microsoft's Flight Simulator - the longest-running and best-selling 
 simulation of all time - the claimant has a lot to prove. And while Pro Pilot bests the civilian 
 sim classic in a number of specific areas, overall the program has an unfinished feel that ensures 
 Flight Simulator won't be toppled from the top of the charts anytime soon.  

 Pro Pilot simulates five general aviation aircraft: the Cessna 172 Skyhawk and Beechcraft Bonanza 
 V35 singles; the Beechcraft Baron and King Air twins; and the Cessna CitationJet 525 jet. The systems 
 simulation here is superb, with unprecedented instrument panel detail. Before starting the engine, 
 you'll need to set various power switches and select a fuel tank, functionality not present in 
 competitors like Flight Unlimited II. All the requisite instruments - two COMM and NAV radios, 
 ADF, etc. - are modeled. There's even a top-notch pop-up GPS (Global Positioning System) ; this 
 is the first consumer sim with the now-popular navigation instrument built-in. VOR and NDB navigation 
 beacons are present across the continental United States, which will make budding cross-country 
 IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) pilots happy. Radios allow you to listen to air traffic control, 
 airport information, and other aircraft, but communication isn't fully interactive as it is in 
 Flight Unlimited II.  

 Unfortunately, while the cockpit simulation is arguably the best out there, aircraft handling is 
 poor at best. Prior to the first patch, the planes felt like they were flying on rails, and basic 
 operations like descending didn't feel right. The patch helps quite a bit, and handling is acceptable 
 if you're just flying cross-country trips and don't try to push the plane's performance envelope. 
 But just try doing a loop and watch things go awry. It's true that you wouldn't normally do aerobatics 
 in these planes, but Sierra should also realize that sim pilots love to take risks you'd never 
 dare try in real aircraft.  

 With over 3,000 airports included, virtual pilots who live in the continental US (or even parts 
 of Canada) will likely be able to fly from their local airports, using the proper communication 
 frequencies. Unfortunately, the airports lack taxiways and even runway numbers, making ground navigation 
 problematic. (Not to mention the silliness of seeing a 747 sitting on the grass.) Ground terrain 
 is properly height-modeled across the country, with hills and mountains that look much better than 
 the giant pyramids of Flight Simulator.  

 Where Pro Pilot really falls down is in the graphics department - a vital area for virtual pilots 
 who want to use the program for more than learning instrument navigation. The sim sports only a 
 single graphics resolution (640x480, 256 colors) and has no support for 3D cards. The ground textures 
 swim with a shimmering effect at high altitudes and degenerate into giant blocky pixels down low. 
 There are some nice effects, such as vibration upon starting the engine, but the visuals are far 
 behind the state of the art. On a related note, performance problems exist with some system configurations 
 - without the patch installed, the sim is actually slower on a Pentium II/266 than on a Pentium 
 166.  

 A top-notch paper manual does a great job of explaining basic flight and instrument navigation, 
 and 30 AVI videos provide good introductory material for beginning pilots. Unfortunately, only 
 very skimpy online help is included for actual program operation and for flying the individual 
 aircraft.  

 Pro Pilot shows definite signs of having been rushed to market for the holidays. With over 30 bugs 
 fixed in the first patch, it's obvious that not enough time was spent in testing. Even post-patch, 
 glaring problems remain: External views sometimes show stopped propellers even at full throttle, 
 turbulence settings in the weather dialogue seem to have no effect, and the flight model goes haywire 
 if you pull the nose up past 90 degrees. The sim's developers have committed to releasing patches 
 every month or two to fix problems and add missing features, but is it fair of software companies 
 to assume they can ship half-baked programs and finish them months later with patches?  

 With the glaring omissions fixed and a graphics overhaul, Pro Pilot could be contender. As it stands 
 now, it's primarily of interest to potential student pilots looking for a good instrument flying 
 simulator.
