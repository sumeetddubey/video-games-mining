You listen to a command, then click the appropriate button. Repeat this about 200 times, and you've 
 got an idea of how thrilling things can get. 

 Anybody who grew up watching the Apollo space missions on TV must have at least a little desire 
 to be an astronaut. The fiery magnificence of the early morning launches, the tension-filled minutes 
 leading up to lunar landings, the bizarre image of the Lunar Rover crawling across the barren landscape 
 of the moon - these events were on the edge of both science fact and fiction, and the sheer drama 
 surrounding them has never been rivaled. Apollo 18 tries to re-create the exhilaration of those 
 Apollo missions by letting you take on the duties of a NASA astronaut, but about the only thing 
 it truly succeeds at is proving there's a whole lot of tedious work that goes on behind the scenes 
 of a moon shot.   

 Part of the reason for this tedium is the game's extremely heavy emphasis on procedure - you must 
 activate systems at the proper time and in the correct sequence - but sloppy coding and sparse, 
 uninspired graphics are to blame too. The first puzzler is why the game says you must run the training 
 missions at 640x480x256, while the actual missions can apparently be played at the resolution of 
 your choosing. It's bad enough that a product being released in the US in 1999 runs at such a low 
 resolution, but what's more annoying is that the instructions are wrong: The training missions 
 ran just fine even when I didn't change from my usual 800x600x16-bit resolution.  

 The training consists of numerous true/false tests and simulations, and it was during the first 
 test that I realized that astronauts must log countless hours memorizing all the operations they 
 have to perform - and that performing them after they've been committed to memory can be fairly 
 monotonous. You're well advised to study the training videos provided on the Johnson Space Center 
 disc (for some reason, all the people training you have patches for the Kennedy Space Center) , 
 but be ready with pen and paper before you view: None of this info is available elsewhere in the 
 game or the manual, and the smallest tidbit that's mentioned in a video might pop up on your next 
 test. Of course, the fact that the guy who's droning on about gimbal angles looks like a model 
 from Men's Health and has a delivery as dry as moon dust means you might miss an important fact 
 no matter how studious you are.   

 After finally passing the first written test, you move on to the launch simulator - which once again 
 drives home how difficult commanding a space mission must be. The manual has entire sections devoted 
 to assisting you in following the oral commands from flight control. The challenge here is knowing 
 when to push buttons on the various control panels; it sounds boring, but the sound effects and 
 voices from mission control as they go through the prelaunch sequence actually do charge the whole 
 proceeding with an air of realism. As the engines make a dull roar and mission control asks you 
 if you copy, you finally start to get the sensation of being there. The second simulation involves 
 reentry, and while much of it's rather sterile - you mainly click buttons when you're told to - 
 I've got to admit that I had a severe twinge of anxiety when mission control advised me of a loss-of-signal 
 period, and I knew I'd be out of contact with them.  

 But just when things start to get a little interesting, problems crop up that constantly hamper 
 your enjoyment. Although your progress is supposed to be saved when you exit, I found that I had 
 to take a true/false test again (ouch!) even though I'd already passed one and had moved on to 
 the simulator. To be fair, it only happened once, but it was troubling nonetheless. Then there's 
 the online glossary that only scrolls seven entries per mouse click: Getting to the description 
 of "PGNS button" takes about 20 mouse clicks, and before long you'll wind up flipping through the 
 glossary in the manual - real space-age technology, eh? And when I hit the Esc key to end a video 
 sequence, I was kicked out to the desktop on several occasions.  

 The overriding problem with Apollo 18, though, is its static nature: You listen to a command, then 
 click the appropriate button. Repeat this about 200 times, and you've got an idea of how thrilling 
 things can get. Now, there are points during actual missions where unexpected events occur, and 
 there's a palpable sense of tension and danger when you have to react on your own. But even these 
 moments aren't nearly exciting enough to make up for the boring procedures that precede them.  
 

 Apollo 18 might have nailed all the procedures involved in launching a man into space, but it never 
 really conveys the spirit of the thing - and isn't that what it's all about?
