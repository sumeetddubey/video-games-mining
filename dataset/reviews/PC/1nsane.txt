:::Review:::
1nsane is the only 4x4 racing game to date that truly offers a sense of the freedom -- and the chaos -- found 
 in real-life off-road racing. 

  Thanks to games such as the Monster Truck Madness series and 4x4 Evolution, driving games focusing 
 on powerful 4x4 vehicles are steadily gaining popularity. However, these games haven't yet managed 
 to deliver a complete off-road racing experience, because they tend to confine you into fairly 
 restrictive environments. That's not the case with Codemasters' 1nsane. Along with good graphics, 
 a wide array of gameplay modes, and realistic control, Codemasters' 1nsane is the only 4x4 racing 
 game to date that truly offers a sense of the freedom -- and the chaos -- found in real-life off-road 
 racing. 

          You can view the action from inside or outside of your car    

 1nsane gives you the option to select from numerous single-player and multiplayer modes right from 
 the start. In addition to standard quick-race options against the computer, the single-player mode 
 features lots of unusual racing modes, such as jamboree, return-the-flag, gate hunt, pathfinder, 
 capture-the-flag, and destruction zone. There's also a championship mode that lets you unlock additional 
 vehicles and tracks based on your performance. In the jamboree mode, you must drive through a series 
 of checkpoints scattered around each track, so it's possible to take any route that you want; however, 
 you have to keep an eye on the topographic map at the bottom of the screen so that your vehicle 
 doesn't encounter any impassable obstacles. Capture-the-flag is similar to jamboree, except you 
 must be carrying the flag when you go through each checkpoint. And the only way to secure the flag 
 is to crash into the opposing vehicle that's carrying it. Instead of using checkpoints, the return-the-flag 
 mode places flags at random points on each track so that you must race toward the flag, capture 
 it, and then race back to your base before any opposing vehicles steal it away from you. These 
 modes are all equally fun, but the most entertaining is probably destruction zone. Like the old 
 king-of-the-hill game, in destruction zone you must race to a series of designated points found 
 on top of hills and mountains on the map. Once you're in the correct area, you have to stay there 
 to gain as many points as possible while other cars attempt to knock you off your perch -- it's not 
 easy, and when your vehicle is knocked off, it's often difficult to get back because of the damage 
 you've sustained. 

  The championship mode is set up in a manner that prevents you from moving on to new tracks or events 
 if you can't perform well in the initial events. For example, the first event starts off easily 
 enough: A jamboree in Ireland takes place during the daytime, so all you have to do is follow an 
 arrow pointer to new checkpoints and make sure that you don't make any huge mistakes, like tumbling 
 down a hillside. After the race is over, you receive a point total based on how many checkpoints 
 you crossed first -- but if your score's too low, you can't advance. It's a little annoying, especially 
 considering that the game has a rather steep learning curve to begin with. 

  The controls in 1nsane can be extremely frustrating at first, and that's not because they're sluggish 
 or unresponsive -- it's because you need to learn how to compensate for the many bumps and jolts 
 that your car receives from driving over rough terrain and colliding with other vehicles. The rough 
 terrain means it can be very easy to flip over if you're not careful. In addition, you must also 
 experiment with your vehicles -- for instance, the baja bug tends to perform well in flat areas that 
 don't have substantial drops. Likewise, the massive trucks in the later levels are perfect for 
 navigating up hills and steep terrain, but their loose handling tends to make them less suitable 
 for racing against other vehicles in open areas. 1nsane doesn't have any real-world licensed vehicles 
 as in 4x4 Evolution or even Monster Truck Madness, but the game offers much more variety in terms 
 of the types of 4x4 vehicles you can choose from. There are sport utility vehicles, as well as 
 dune buggies and even big rigs. 

          Some of the modes of play encourage you to lay into the competition    

 All of your 
 car's spinouts and tumbles aren't completely gratuitous -- they give you an opportunity to see 1nsane's 
 great-looking car models and massive environments. The game's vehicle models are detailed right 
 down to the treads on the tires, and each vehicle has a driver that bounces around inside whenever 
 you run over or into an object on the landscape. Each vehicle also shows realistic damage depending 
 on how it's hit -- if you crash into a tree head-on, then the dashboard gets pushed up into the driver's 
 seat. If you roll over, the roof of your car caves in. The game does suffer from some slowdown 
 on lower-end and mid-range machines (particularly when there are more than a few cars on the screen) . 
 There's also some draw-in on the horizon as objects spontaneously pop into view, but it never becomes 
 so bad that it affects gameplay. Otherwise, the sound effects in 1nsane aren't spectacular, but 
 everything from rumbling engine noises -- which can actually get annoying after a while -- to the crushing 
 of metal during a crash are clearly audible. 1nsane's music is very good, and complements the fast 
 pacing of the game well. 

  Overall, though it has a few problems and takes some getting used to, 1nsane can be a very enjoyable 
 off-road racing experience. Because of its expansive environments, 1nsane is the first off-road 
 racing game to actually give you a real sense of being off the beaten path. It also has plenty 
 of entertaining modes of play, which keep it from getting repetitive too quickly. Unfortunately, 
 while 1nsane does support multiplayer play, there are very few players currently using Codemasters' 
 gaming service, so finding more than one opponent to race against at a time can be difficult. Still, 
 1nsane's single-player modes provide more than enough entertainment by themselves.

Review:  THE GOOD:
  #A huge variety of vehicles on offer, from Quad Bikes to 8-wheeler trucks!
  #All of the game modes are fun and easy to pick up on
  
  THE BAD:
  #The cars are very easy 
 to roll over, which can get very annoying
  
  RECOMMENDED FOR: Arcade lovers
  
  Wow! This has got to be my favourite PC game. Not only does it offer an immense variety of vehicles 
 (including flatbed trucks and a star wars style speeder!) , but also a variety of very fun games 
 to race them in. They range from a simple off-road race to 'capture the flag' and even 'destruction 
 zone' events.
  Not only that but there are tons of locations to race in, ranging from a very mountainous Arizona 
 to a very flat ATV track. Each location has its own special attributes that make it stand out from 
 the others and although, let's face it, they look nothing like the real places, they are all still 
 great. And even if you don't like any of them there is always the Map Generator to make your very 
 own location!
  And then we move onto the camera views. There are NINE of them, even the ultra-realistic driver 
 view (like in GT5 prologue) which is not bad going for a game from the year 2000.
  I can safely say the only bad thing about this game is the amount of times you are likely to roll 
 your car over, especially in pickup trucks. This can be very infuriating and makes it nigh-on impossible 
 to complete the pickup truck championship, leaving you stuck halfway through the game.
  All in all, however, this is an excellent game, and is lots of fun no matter what you do. I would 
 sincerely recommend you buy 1nsane and see for yourself just how fun it can be.

Review:  1nsane is a off-road racing game that is different than most other racing games, there are no circuits. 
 Instead there are different types of events, for example 'capture the flag', 'destruction zone' 
 and jamboree. The cars you race in divided in 5 different classes, which include pick-up trucks, 
 jeeps and a beetle cross car.
  
  These different events and cars alone aren't varied enough to keep you interested long enough. 
 The variation in landscapes and the way you need to drive in these different lands make that after 
 3 events in one land you'll be challenged to get to know the next land.
  
  The graphics are pretty good, the car models look good and the damage model really destroys the 
 cars (wheels flying through the air!) . The landscape is not that detailed but looks good enough, 
 except that there is a bit too much pop-up.
  
  The sound is does its job, but nothing more. The car sounds are ok, but not that varied, the same 
 can be said about the music. 1nsane is a game which is surprisingly good and will manage to keep 
 you entertained for quite a while when you don't feel like playing a deep or difficult game.

Review:  Its the best off road racing game ever made. Insane gives you the freedom with the different game 
 modes like capture the flag, return the flag, jamboree, off road race and many more. I play insane 
 with 7 opponents on the difficulty insane which makes me insane but its fun and enjoyable. I also 
 completed the championship about a dozen times. Its not easy the championship because it gets harder 
 especially the trucks but its fun.
  
  I used to play insane on-line but I don, t think that works anymore because they got rid of it. 
 I still play the game today at some times even though its a bit old. I like alot of old games and 
 also new games. The landscapes in insane are fun to play on. The hardest one I would say is Arizona 
 because of all the mountains, Colorado is also hard. One game took me 2 hours to complete but it 
 was in the landscape colarado.
  
  Great mutiplayer is well how could I have forgot about that.

Review:  When I bought 1nsane in early 2001, I was completely blown away by the nicely detailed environments, 
 great selection of vehicles, but most of all, the freedom the game allowed. Now, nearly 5 years 
 later, I'm still blown away by the fact that this is still the best off-road racing game ever and 
 one of the best racing games ever. Incredible physics coupled with some of the most insane (for 
 lack of a better word) free-for-all racing ever seen, 1nsane will provide any racing freak with 
 hours upon hours of addictive game play. This title may be getting old in age, but it will still 
 entertain the pants off anyone who still has it! 9.4 out of 10!

Review:  1nsane is a cool arcade racer for cool enjoyments after your PC!
  
  I bought 1nsane a long time after it was released. I doubt if I paid the full price for it.
  
 
  I like cross-roads-action-racing games at a high level. 1nsane is a cool and fun game for a little 
 wile but after a couple of weeks it will bother you.
  Youll be able to take it on-line and race against other gamers. This feature is cool and will 
 hold you longer busy. But after a month or 3-4 it is boring.
  After all I had a lot of fun racing over mountains, snow, gravel, ice and other things like that. 
 The game is a really basic concept but it is much better than games like Monster Truck Madness 
 (2) or Monster Jam.
  
  Cool game, It is worth it! - You`ll have fun. 
  ( Maybe you should download it from Kazaa for free! )

Review:  1nsane is the game that i play on my dinner hour with my work collegues its great fun. We play 
 the destruction level were you have to race to points but ram your opponants aswell. We spend many 
 a hour on this game. We also found a site that allows add-ons like cars that people have made for 
 instance a subaru imprezas. We have around 8 people playing in one session and we just get a good 
 distance then put the pedal to the metal or the finger to the keyboard and try to ram your oppneants 
 vehicle for more points the more damage you cause the more points you get. The controls are easy 
 and the gameplay is brillant. Its like destruction derby but with a twist

Review:  While I don't usually like driving games, this game is awesome. I bought it for my kid and while 
 showing him how to play I got hooked. This is the way driving games should be. Wide open environemnts, 
 great looking graphics, numerous gameplay options and several mod sites to boot. Get this game 
 if you can still find it, you will get many hours of enjoyment from it and it will remain in your 
 collection for many years to come. I hope these guys come out with an 1nsane 2 but hope they spell 
 the name correctly this time. I think that spelling actually hurt the game sales. Great game, probably 
 at a great price by now. Buy it if you can find it.
