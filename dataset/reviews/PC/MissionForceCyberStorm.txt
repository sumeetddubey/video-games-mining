:::Review:::
Sierra has taken a basic, turn-based strategy game, added some beautiful graphics, fantastic sound, 
 and great network play, and set it into their expansive Earthsiege universe. 

 MissionForce CyberStorm is a truly pleasant surprise. Sierra has taken a basic, turn-based strategy 
 game, added some beautiful graphics, fantastic sound, and great network play, and set it into their 
 expansive Earthsiege universe. The result is amazingly addictive. Even bogged down by a stomach 
 flu and no sleep, I found myself crawling back to my desk day after day to continue my war against 
 the evil Cybrids.  

 Unlike many other strategy games, which contain only enough plot to explain to gamers why they're 
 trying to kill everyone else, MissionForce CyberStorm uses its storyline to hypnotize you into 
 playing just one more mission. You start the game as an Ensign in Unitech, a corporation 
 that achieves power and profit through planetary mining. As a Unitech soldier, you must fight off 
 the mysterious Cybrids using giant mechanical warriors called Hercs and their genetically engineered 
 pilots, the Bioderms. As the game continues, your successes will earn you higher rank, which in 
 turn will give you the right to command more Hercs and Bioderms and more advanced technology. Several 
 subplots, involving an almost religious rebellion by the Bioderms and the discovery of some extremely 
 unusual Cybrid experiments, will keep you glued to your screen hoping to glean just a little more 
 of the story from each successive victory.  

 The game itself is just as entertaining. You choose from a list of nine missions, ranging from simple 
 mining operations to assaults on enemy headquarters, earning extra cash for each Cybrid you destroy 
 and each unit of ore you mine. You can tackle missions in any order you choose, and are never forced 
 to move on to the next system until you feel ready. As you increase your rank and cashflow, you'll 
 be able to design custom Hercs that incorporate futuristic technology ranging from armor-crushing 
 particle beams to shield-lifting EM blasts. Every piece of technology you add has to be carefully 
 considered for its weight, energy use, and price if you want to survive to see the next battle. 

 CyberStorm is great as a standalone package, but Sierra has also included a flexible multi-player 
 option as well. You can take on your friends in a head-to-head competition over the modem or through 
 a direct link, or up to eight can play in a network. The network mode includes team play that lets 
 two or more groups compete with or without Cybrid interference, a free-for-all that lets up to 
 eight play individually (once again, with or without Cybrid activity) , and a cooperative mode that 
 lets everyone play as a team against the computer. If all of this isn't enough, Sierra has also 
 had the decency to include two copies of the software in each box to allow friends to compete with 
 just one purchase. It's too bad every company can't pick up on customer dedication at that level. 

 In the end, CyberStorm won't appeal to everyone. Its turn-based style will seem a little dry to 
 action and real-time strategy fans, and military fanatics probably won't go for its futuristic 
 setting or lack of statistics. But if you're wanting a solid title that will give you both long-term 
 individual play and a chance to compete with your friends, I highly recommend this excellent game.

Review:  Much like the original Earthsiege Mech combat simulator you are in charge of a building a contingent 
 of HERCs (the Earthsiege term for Mech) , only this time the action has shifted from action to turn 
 based strategy. Provided you have the funding, you can build and modify HERCs and their pilots 
 to your hearts content, and there are lots of tactical and strategic concerns to consider. The 
 actual battles are rather quick affairs and the campaign lets you choose the level of difficulty, 
 as you can pick one from a number of various missions at hand, which helps ease you into the game 
 at your own pace.
  
  Apart from a competent game design, CyberStorm's most valuable asset is its inclusion into the 
 Earthsiege/Starsiege universe. The back story breathes life into what might otherwise have been 
 a mundane Sci-Fi war of little interest (Fallen Haven comes to mind) . The artwork is excellent 
 and the missions and orders from your superiors capture the desperation of the conflict well. Fans 
 of the Starsiege Universe should consider picking this one up, other players may want to give it 
 a pass.

Review:  This was a game that had me glued to the computer for hours. This mission-based game forces you 
 to develop a strategy based on the upgrades you have available and the type of mission you are 
 going into.
  
  The game features mech on mech action, where you go on missions for multiple reason: recon, protection, 
 assault, mining, or domination. Each mission has its own rewards and they range from some monetary 
 help to the ability to make some really heavy upgrades. What I really enjoy about his game is that 
 you can complete certain missions and still replay them for just as much fun the next time through.
 
  
  This game forces you to really think about the strategy and movement of your team on the maps, 
 but is well worth the frustration once you complete a mission. Enjoy!
