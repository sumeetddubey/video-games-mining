:::Review:::
Dark Conspiracy fundamentally remains the same great strategy game as its predecessor. 

 Ground Control: Dark Conspiracy is the official expansion to Swedish developer Massive Entertainment's 
 graphically stunning real-time tactical combat game, which was released about six months earlier. 
 Created by American studio High Voltage Software, Dark Conspiracy is a fully featured expansion 
 that introduces an all-new faction of futuristic units for you to command, as well as a new campaign 
 containing 15 successive single-player scenarios. The game also has several new multiplayer maps 
 designed by the original Ground Control team. Yet despite all its additions, Dark Conspiracy makes 
 no significant changes to the way the original game plays. Therefore, it may remind you of some 
 of the frustrations you encountered with the original, even though Ground Control: Dark Conspiracy 
 fundamentally remains the same great strategy game as its predecessor. Nevertheless, since the 
 expansion is available for just a nominal shipping cost to players who already own Ground Control, 
 its problems will seem mostly trivial.   

  Ground Control boasted some of the best graphics of any PC game released in 2000. As in many fully 
 3D real-time strategy games, Ground Control gives you the ability to freely adjust the camera perspective 
 so that you can pan, rotate, and zoom your view to suit the situation. The game's incredibly detailed 
 combat units, realistic terrain, and impressive special effects look great regardless of how close 
 or how far away you prefer to view them. Dark Conspiracy looks as good as Ground Control did, for 
 the most part. The new playable faction, the Phoenix Mercenaries, comprises a fairly interesting 
 set of units that seem like a cross between Ground Control's original factions, the imposing forces 
 of the Crayven Corporation and the sleek technology of the Order of the New Dawn. Dark Conspiracy 
 also features some new environments in which you'll battle. Unfortunately these are unremarkable 
 compared with those in the original game. Their topography consists mostly of the same sort of 
 rolling hills as in Ground Control, only the environments themselves don't look as good because 
 of the lower-quality textures that are used to depict the ground and the sky.   

  Dark Conspiracy also recycles most of the sounds from Ground Control, which were effective in the 
 original game and remain so in the expansion. As in the original, in Dark Conspiracy it's impressive 
 how the sound effects realistically grow much louder and more distinct as you zoom in closer to 
 the action. And the new Phoenix mercenary units sound quite good, although their spoken lines do 
 get repetitive. Also, because the expansion is story-driven and picks up soon after the original 
 campaign's conclusion, there tends to be a lot of dialogue during, before, and after the single-player 
 missions. This speech is generally convincing and helps the story along.   

  Since Dark Conspiracy's campaign assumes that you've finished the 30 missions in Ground Control, 
 it also assumes that you're quite experienced with how the game plays. Most of the missions in 
 Dark Conspiracy give you access to around a dozen squads of units, which you'll have to command 
 simultaneously against superior enemy odds. As in Ground Control, in Dark Conspiracy you'll generally 
 be stuck with whichever units you initially deploy into battle. As in Ground Control, in Dark Conspiracy 
 you can't save your progress during a mission, nor can you adjust the speed of the action. And 
 so, as in Ground Control, since the Dark Conspiracy missions are fairly long and specifically scripted, 
 you'll find yourself having to retry them multiple times. This can be quite frustrating, but fortunately 
 the game itself still plays well and equally rewards quick reaction times and tactical shrewdness 
 on your part. Besides the inability to save during missions, you might also be frustrated that 
 many of the missions demand the use of squads of flying units. While these flying units look great 
 as they spiral through the air, they're difficult to control as precisely as the ground units, 
 and they're extremely vulnerable to antiair fire, so they're much more of a liability than most 
 of your other forces. In addition, although the expansion campaign does have a new story and lets 
 you control the new faction, the Phoenix units are mostly quite similar to those of the other two 
 sides. But you'll still be interested in learning their nuances, just as you'll want to experiment 
 with the handful of new units granted to the original Ground Control factions.   

  Ground Control: Dark Conspiracy still makes a fast-paced, exciting, yet often chaotic multiplayer 
 game. It's easy to get started over a network or the Internet, and the several new multiplayer 
 maps give the multiplayer mode still more variety. Unfortunately there's still no dedicated skirmish 
 mode available that lets you play against the computer, though there is one single-player-focused 
 skirmish map that lets you take on an endless drove of enemies.   

  Dedicated Ground Control players will appreciate Dark Conspiracy the most, since they're already 
 used to the controls, the quick pacing, and the problems of the original game, all of which carry 
 over into the expansion. Experienced Ground Control players will be entertained with many of the 
 new units, such as the Phoenix flamethrowing hover tank and foot soldiers. They'll also like being 
 able to get the expansion at a very low price (though all they get is the game CD, which contains 
 an online version of the Dark Conspiracy manual) . Otherwise, if you're new to Ground Control, Dark 
 Conspiracy is a great additional value if you haven't yet decided to try out what was one of the 
 most intense strategy games released last year.
