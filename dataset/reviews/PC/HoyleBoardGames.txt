:::Review:::
It proves just how enduring and intriguing some classic strategy and board games can be, though 
 it most probably won't be as satisfying to old hands. 

 If you're the sort of person who prefers games that let you blast your enemies to smithereens with 
 a rocket launcher, you probably wouldn't be too interested in a rousing game of Chinese checkers. 
 And that's too bad, because the latest edition of Hoyle Board Games proves just how enduring and 
 intriguing some classic strategy and board games can be. One of four new Hoyle titles -- and quite 
 probably the most addictive -- Hoyle Board Games offers a wide range of familiar and not-so-familiar 
 pastimes, and each of these comes with a number of engaging visual and audio perks that could only 
 exist in a computer game. The unfortunate but very evident downside to this otherwise pleasant 
 package is that Hoyle Board Games is so similar to Hoyle Board Games 2002 -- which itself was almost 
 a dead ringer for Hoyle Board Games 2001 -- that it may only appeal to players who are unfamiliar 
 with any of the previous editions.           This adaptation of Battleship offers more fire and 
 brimstone than the pen-and-paper version you might have played in elementary school.    

 Like all Sierra games bearing the Hoyle name, Hoyle Board Games runs nearly as well on an old beater 
 desktop or laptop as it does on a graphically accelerated top-of-the-line computer. In fact, when 
 you consider its undemanding system requirements and its subject matter, the game is ideally suited 
 to those quick breaks during the day when you don't have the time or the computing horsepower to 
 embark upon a long episode with a more complex game.   

  And Hoyle Board Games has plenty of games to play. Sierra has added two more games to last year's 
 list for a grand total of 18, including age-old favorites such as chess, checkers, backgammon, 
 and dominoes; more recent games such as battling ships (Sierra's virtual adaptation of Battleship) 
 and mahjong tiles; and electronic-only affairs such as gravity tiles. Although everyone will inevitably 
 find certain favorites, the game works so well because very few of its games are anything but solid. 
 Chinese checkers, for example, translates very well to the computer screen, as do chess and checkers. 
 Battling ships, wherein animated cannons fire volleys over a wall and tiny ships explode and burn, 
 is far more fun on the PC than it ever was with a pen and paper. Gravity tiles, a hybrid of mahjong 
 tiles and Tetris, is always good for a quick cranial workout.   

  Four Sierra-devised games also make their Hoyle Board Games debut in the version. Two of them, 
 wordox and double cross, are variations on the old standby Scrabble. Word yacht is a compelling 
 word-based derivative of Yahtzee that asks you to assemble words from individual letters, place 
 them into categories, and deal with a constantly ticking timer. The racing car board game bump 
 'em seems more geared to children than adults and is generally dull and uninspired.   

  Each unique game is accessed through a single, no-frills main menu, where you'll also select from 
 a very limited collection of user options. Indeed, apart from deciding upon beginner, intermediate, 
 and expert difficulty levels, the only real decisions you'll have to make are cosmetic. If you 
 don't like the default orchestral soundtrack, you can choose from an impressive variety of alternative 
 styles. If you want to alter the appearance of your virtual persona, you'll head to the "facemaker" 
 utility and build a new look. A Sierra staple, facemaker lets you construct a customized mug completely 
 from scratch, selecting features such as eyes, lips, and even eyebrows from its massive collection 
 of bits and pieces, then sticking them all together into a recognizable shape.           Checkers 
 is just one of 16 different board games available.    

 Although games such as battling ships, chess, and checkers offer an illusion of 3D, the Hoyle Board 
 Games world is strictly two-dimensional. Each game sits in the center of the screen, surrounded 
 by animated headshots of the artificially intelligent or human players. Sierra provides 10 AI opponents 
 for your playing pleasure, all of which are capable of restricted animated movements and scores 
 of spoken phrases. Unfortunately, the AI crew often seems uninteresting and bland. Furthermore, 
 because the game does not install animations and speech to the hard drive, it slows noticeably 
 to access its CD whenever such situations arise. Thankfully, you can deactivate both speech and 
 animations to increase the pace to more desirable levels. You may also want to go online to play 
 against real human foes or upload the bonus PDA versions of mahjong tiles or backgammon to your 
 Palm or Windows handheld.   

  With four new games, an equal number of new AI characters, and two PDA games, Sierra has made some 
 effort to differentiate Hoyle Board Games from prior iterations. It has not, however, altered the 
 general presentation or changed the appearance or operation of its returning games. So Hoyle veterans 
 will find the vast majority of the new game to be strikingly similar to what they have seen before. 
 Although the package is a great choice for newcomers, it probably won't be as satisfying to old 
 hands.

Review:  Hoyle is a corp known for the great games it releases, which have to do with board, card or casino 
 games. So they introduce us their all-new game which is maybe the best collection of board games 
 ever, though facing some problems.
  
  After installing and running the game, you will find yourself making an image for your profile. 
 This can be done, thanks to the Facemaker, an application which gives you an empty face and lots 
 of customizations to fill it. After that, you will see the main screen of the game, filled with 
 amazing classic games, like chess and yacht, and new ones such as Wordox and Double Cross. Every 
 game is designed to match perfectly-well its original version, though some positive changes can 
 be noticed ( eg in battleships there are virtual rockets striking into the enemy field) .
  
  And who do you play against? Sierra introduces AI opponents which are smart and funny Hoyle players 
 from all around the world, each one with his own bio and style of play which differs from game 
 to game. They are able to talk, saying things relevant with the game or joking sometimes. The bad 
 thing about this is that if you turn the game to beginner level, an intelligent foe will act stupidly 
 and if you turn it to expert level you will see dumby opponents playing too well and very seriously.
 
  
  There is also an Internet play feature which allows you top face other real players from all over 
 the world. All these make the game very interesting, except its minor cons.
