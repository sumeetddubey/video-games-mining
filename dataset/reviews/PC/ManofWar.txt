The developers were headed in the right direction, but in the end they fail on both fronts. 

 
 Fans of the great age of fighting sail have been treated to several games of varying quality in 
 the recent past. Wooden Ships &amp; Iron Men was a disappointing conversion of the classic board 
 game. Age of Sail provided the best gaming experience but was burdened with a rather cumbersome 
 Win 3.1 interface. SSI canceled Ship of the Line, and Buccaneer was less than expected. Now a newcomer 
 called Strategy First is trying to offer the ultimate age of sail experience by combing the depth 
 of a strategy game with the immediacy of a first-person game. The developers were headed in the 
 right direction, but in the end they fail on both fronts.  

 Man of War covers the classic era of fighting wooden ships: roughly from the American Revolution 
 to the Napoleonic Wars. Those of us who are sail buffs and fans of the novels of O'Brian and Forester 
 are drawn to the image of lines of ships, each two-hundred feet long and bristling with a hundred 
 guns, pounding each other to splinters. It's a fascinating period with many nuances that make for 
 great gaming.   

 Man of War takes a two-pronged approach to this milieu. In the first phase of each turn, you use 
 a handsome map to set orders for your ships. Each mission involves a set victory requirement and 
 begins at sea with the opposing forces closing in on each other. While the points needed for victory 
 are listed, I could never determine the length of each battle, and so I had trouble pacing my strategies. 
 In the strategic portion, you give a set of orders to each ship (or to the whole division) that 
 will then be executed in that turn. Orders are related to bearing, speed, position in the line, 
 rally/surrender, engagement distance, and targeting.   

 Rather cleverly, the commands are done with little semaphore flags. Rather uncleverly, they are 
 all lumped into a single window, so that it's hard to tell what orders each ship has been given. 
 Worse, only twelve orders are available per turn. If I have twenty ships, and need to tell each 
 to turn, speed up, and fire, how am I going to do this with twelve commands? Orders are also very 
 limited. Only two sail settings are available: full and partial. There is no order for type of 
 shot (double, chain, etc.) and no boarding command. Boardings are apparently possible - I've taken 
 over ships - but the manual is mum on how they are done. It seems you just need to run into the 
 other ship.   

 Once these orders are given, you are dropped into a mandatory 3D resolution phase in which you sort 
 of watch the orders carried out in real time from the deck of your ship. Nice idea. Terrible implementation. 
 You can only wander around the empty deck of your flagship and try to puzzle out what's going on. 
 There is no map in this phase, so you cannot give orders or even track the developing situation. 
 Being unable to leave the deck of the flagship means the view is very limited, and in the end these 
 sequences are completely pointless. The game offers a dozen scenarios covering classic battles 
 like Trafalgar and Camperdown, as well as a single campaign in the British navy in which you rise 
 rather rapidly through the ranks. There's a decent scenario editor, which is always welcome, so 
 there're plenty of replay possibilities. But production values are uneven, with average 3D graphics 
 and sparse sound but a good strategic map. The game simply would not run in Windows 95 at all and 
 shut down my system every time I tried.  

 The ideas in Man of War were quite good, but their integration was fluffed badly. A game in which 
 you have continuous strategic control over a line of ships and which enables you to watch the orders 
 carried out in first person would be a great game. Unfortunately, Man of War is not that game.
