Inspector Parker's logic puzzle will have you stuck in front of your computer for hours at a time. 
 

  Inspector Parker is a logic puzzle that asks you to use a series of clues to figure out which rooms 
 in a house contain a variety of items and people. Items or people that a room could potentially 
 contain are shown in each room, which is presented as a large onscreen matrix. Clues point you 
 to the placement of certain items, but you're pointed in a very indirect way because most clues 
 only tell you about the relationship between two objects. So a clue will tell you that the knife 
 is directly above the room that contains the axe. But since you don't know exactly where the axe 
 is yet, you can only narrow it down. As you narrow down all of your clues, you eventually start 
 getting down to business and figuring out, by process of elimination, where each piece must be. 

  The game has a sort of story mode that has you working through puzzles of increasing complexity, 
 but there's also a mode that lets you choose the difficulty and go on from there. The more difficult 
 levels give you larger houses and more confusing clues to work with. The larger houses essentially 
 force you to play in full-screen mode, as the various icons for each room get a bit too small when 
 you're playing in a fixed-size window. The interface is easy to understand, and the logic puzzles 
 are fun to decipher. Ultimately, this is a nice-looking and extremely addictive game that puzzle 
 fans should have a great time with.

Review:  This logic puzzle is simple and repetitive but I can't stop playing. I must find the murderer, 
 his weapon of choice and evidence against him/her. It's like Minesweeper and Clue had a baby named 
 Inspector Parker.
  
  You receive clues in your notebook such as Joe was upstairs from Jane during the murder. So logically 
 you can remove the possibility of Joe being downstairs and Jane from upstairs. In this way, you 
 continue to remove items from the house until you find all the evidence needed to solve the murder.
 
  
  At higher levels the icons shrink to make room for more items which can sometimes cause you to 
 accidentally remove the wrong item and score a miss (too many and the game is over) . However, clicking 
 on a clue in the notebook will enlarge and highlight the corresponding items on the board to make 
 it easier to see.
  
  I have a few issues with timer mode in that the people who QA'ed it should be fired. The clock 
 and timer are underneath the clue descriptions... yeah, you can't see either of them while a clue 
 is selected. Brilliant. Also in timer mode you can make as many wrong guesses as you want with 
 no penalty. This allows you to randomly click on objects until you hit on the right one, defeating 
 the entire purpose of the game.
  
  Despite those big nuisances to my obsessive compulsive soul, I enjoy playing this game. I used 
 to play it as a Java application until the game website removed it so I'm glad to have it for PC 
 which adds more levels and a much larger window.
