:::Review:::
If you're a fan of playing cards, Hoyle Card Games will inevitably keep you occupied for hours on 
 end. 

 Hoyle wrote the book on card games, so it should come as no surprise that it's also the authority 
 for card games on the PC. Sierra's latest Hoyle card game is as well executed as its predecessors, 
 but it isn't much different from them. Fans of the series won't be let down by the gameplay, but 
 they may be disappointed by the lack of anything new in this installment besides the games of canasta 
 and pitch. Still, card sharks and novices alike will find hours of the same addictive gameplay 
 inside.   

  Hoyle Card Games includes 16 card games of varying degrees of difficulty. Many popular games are 
 included, from complex bidding games like bridge to fun favorites like gin rummy and crazy eights 
 to simple no-brainers such as war and concentration. If you're new to some of these games, you 
 can set the difficulty to accommodate your learning curve. Since it's a Hoyle product, the box 
 comes with an exhaustive manual that not only includes rules and strategies, but also the background 
 history of each game. An in-game manual is also included.   

  The assorted games are played entirely with the mouse. The interface is kept as simple as possible, 
 so the pace of the game goes about as quickly as you can make decisions. Games can be saved at 
 any point, which makes it easier to pause during more involved games like bridge. The only problem 
 is that the cards themselves could stand to be a little larger. Because it's a mouse-intensive 
 game, you'll sometimes find that clicking on the card you're aiming for is tricky, especially when 
 you try to click on a card that is beneath another card. As it is, there is no option to increase 
 the size of the cards.   

  However, you can change the appearance of your cards. There are 23 different card backs, which 
 range from classic Hoyle designs to abstract patterns and classic cars. There are also four different 
 card faces to choose from, but you'll probably just want to stick with the default face. Several 
 colorful backgrounds have also been included, and you can swap them in or out at any point during 
 a game.   

  Hoyle Card Games also lets you custom-pick your opponents. Sierra has added an offbeat dimension 
 to the games with its cast of ten different selectable players, each with individual animations 
 and commentary. If Ethel - a game-hungry grandma - is too boring for you, you can always replace 
 her with Roswell, a witty extraterrestrial card shark. When the opponents are idle, they blink, 
 shift around, and sometimes do outlandish things. This invariably makes up for some of the starkness 
 of the original card games, though the commentary can get repetitive and even awkward at times. 
 Fortunately, you can adjust the speech meter from "serious" to "talkative," depending upon how 
 quickly you want the game to move along.   

  Your player can also be personalized with the game's patented "facemaker." This part of the game 
 is actually pretty fun to play with. There are hundreds of eyes, noses, heads, hair colors and 
 hairstyles, and body combinations - there's even a "randomize" button that can generate a random 
 combination of traits.   

  Sierra has included a free Internet play feature, which shows that the company understands that 
 cards are a social game at heart. If you decide to challenge living players from around the world, 
 you can access an Internet game browser from the game.   

  Hoyle Card Games is a solid product that includes games the entire family can enjoy. The only main 
 drawback is that this edition is markedly similar to the last one - almost to the point that they 
 seem identical. It would be nice to see Sierra and the Hoyle franchise bring more innovative graphics 
 and more inventive sounds to their card and casino games. But the trump card is already in the 
 gameplay. If you're a fan of playing cards, Hoyle Card Games will inevitably keep you occupied 
 for hours on end.
