It's worth playing through the holes, but chances are once is enough. 

 Either the idea is inherently brilliant or inherently stupid: A miniature golf game based on Mike 
 Judge's misbegotten brainchildren Beavis and Butt-head. Then again, the same can be said for Beavis 
 and Butt-head the phenomenon, so maybe minigolf and the duo are made for each other. And if that's 
 the case, then Bunghole in One is a bad twist of fate, because although it looks authentic and 
 its 18 holes are creative, it doesn't control well, it fails to engage itself with the characters 
 from the show. Sure, it's worth playing through the holes, but chances are once is enough.  

 Each hole takes a distinctive setting (such as a grocery store) or theme (such as nachos) from 
 the Beavis and Butt-head mythos, from the obvious to the more obscure. You have to shoot through 
 the living room, the classroom, and the burger joint, though you'll also brave more sinister challenges 
 like the cheese volcano and the cemetery. Most of the characters from the series, even the minor 
 ones, make cameo appearances throughout the courses. You'll get to see nerd kid Stuart in his natural 
 habitat, complete with train set, microscope, and other nerd paraphernalia. You'll find the duo's 
 classmates loitering about (with Daria notably absent, since she got her own lousy show) . You'll 
 visit the auto shop of Todd, their shades-wearing hero, and you'll run across two smelly old guys 
 who look suspiciously similar to the title characters at the dump. Every hole is introduced with 
 a nice 3D flyby, while the gameplay takes place from a fixed overhead perspective where you can 
 scroll around at will. All the courses look great - though they're 3D-rendered, they look just 
 like the stark, gritty, colorful Americana settings of the show.  

 You can play through the course as either of the heroes, as well as hick neighbor Tom Anderson, 
 hippie teacher Mr. Van Driessen, surly ex-con Todd, or the nerve-wracked Principal McVicker. The 
 choice merely determines which character you'll see swinging a golf club in the upper left-hand 
 corner, and whose commentary you'll hear as you make or break your shots. Up to four people can 
 take turns on the course, and computer ghost players will fill any blanks so that you'll hear three 
 other characters bickering on every hole. It's a good idea, but it's poorly executed - all you 
 get is a bunch of speech samples blatantly ripped from the show, and you can imagine the awkwardness 
 when the sound bits are spliced together in an effort to create dialogue. What's worse is you'll 
 hear the same awkward lines over and over, which sucks most of the personality out of the game, 
 or otherwise just sucks.  

 You also don't actually see the characters walking (or bickering) on the course. You'll wish you 
 could get a different angle on a shot sometimes, when you can't quite tell how the slopes and valleys 
 will affect your aim. At other times, you'll mess up seemingly obvious shots because the aiming 
 isn't represented well onscreen. The holes themselves are pretty nice at least. Some are straightforward 
 miniature golf fare, with a swinging door trap or something to add a little challenge and variety. 
 Other holes are more surreal, like Coach Buzzcut's military obstacle course hole, complete with 
 live landmines. A few of the holes are really tough, but you'll be able to score near par without 
 too much effort on most of them. And since you only have those 18 holes, that means you'll be through 
 with the game faster than Butt-head can surf through the channels. If there were more speech and 
 interaction between the characters, there would have been an incentive to play through these holes 
 more than once.

Review:  This is a great game for mini-golf but chances are you'll only play it once through. Unless you're 
 a fan of the series you may want to consider just playing mini-golf on the internet.
  
  The comical sounds that the characters add to this game really make it feel like it's really a 
 Beavis and Butthead game. But it seems like there's not much effort put into the characters.
  
  The game actually seems like a mini-golf game but with what's out these days you're better 
 off playing a mini-golf game on the internet.
  
  The graphics are good the game's pretty dated but the graphics aren't good and they aren't bad 
 either. I don't see you saying that the graphics should have been better.
  
  The sound is very crisp and comical although it seems mono it sounds great.
  
  Overall I suggest 
 that you only get this game if you're a fan of the show. Otherwise stick to the free internet mini-golf 
 games.
