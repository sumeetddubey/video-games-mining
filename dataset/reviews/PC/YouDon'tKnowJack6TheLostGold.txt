:::Review:::
You may be disappointed at how it refuses to deviate from the series' formula, but as with the other 
 games, you'll still probably get a kick out of the questions. 

  Jellyvision's You Don't Know Jack trivia games have been around since 1995, and since then, they 
 have allowed up to three players to sit around a single computer to answer challenging trivia questions 
 in a format presented like a TV game show. Each game in the series has featured a smart-mouthed 
 host; each has featured a series of both easy and obscure trivia questions that are presented in 
 a bizarre and non sequitur fashion; and each has followed this main portion of the "show" with 
 a series of phony on-air commercials that aired while the credits rolled. You Don't Know Jack 6: 
 The Lost Gold follows this formula to a tee, which is certainly a good thing for those who have 
 yet to try out this entertaining trivia series. If you're a longtime fan of the You Don't Know 
 Jack games and you absolutely adore every last aspect of this long-lived trivia series, you'll 
 also be pleased to know that Jellyvision hasn't changed the formula -- at all. This may only be an 
 issue if you've already played the previous games and are looking for something new.  

          The Jack Attack returns.     

  You Don't Know Jack 6 contains a background story about 
 a seafaring pirate named "The Cap'n" who is cursed to help host the show. Other than this, it's 
 otherwise very similar to the other games in the series. Up to three players can play it on the 
 same computer by competing for imaginary money and buzzing in to respond to one of five question 
 types. These include multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, anagrams, gibberish questions (a gibberish 
 phrase that rhymes with one that you must guess) , dis-or-dat (deciding whether a certain phrase 
 is classified one way or another) , and the Jack Attack, a series of phrases you must match to related 
 phrases. As in the previous games, you can also "screw" your opponents once each game by pressing 
 the "S" key, which forces them to answer a question they (hopefully) don't know so that they lose 
 cash when they answer incorrectly.  

  The game includes 350 questions in total, which is fewer than the number offered by some of the 
 previous games in the series. However, it's still a lot. These questions cover a very good range 
 of academic subjects that you'd expect from a trivia game, as well as the traditionally modern, 
 hip subjects you'd expect from the You Don't Know Jack series, which has always included questions 
 about modern history as well as recent movies and TV shows. The game also does a good job of spreading 
 these questions out so that you'll have to play at least a dozen or so sessions before you see 
 even one repeated question. And if nothing else, the new game's trivia is quite challenging, though 
 for some bizarre reason, the game also seems to put extra emphasis on sexual innuendo in the wording 
 of its questions and answers. This game definitely isn't for kids.  

  You Don't Know Jack 6 looks and sounds very similar to the previous games in the series. The game's 
 graphics are displayed at a locked, low resolution of 640x480 and consist mostly of large, colorful 
 block script to display the questions, answers, and how much imaginary money you've won. The words 
 and numbers bounce and float across the screen, as they have in previous games, but other than 
 a brief cinematic that shows the pirate at the beginning of the game, there are no characters -- or 
 anything else -- to be seen in the game. This means that, like the rest of the series, the new game 
 can be played on very low-end computers. It also means, however, that the game doesn't feature 
 any graphics bells or whistles at all.  

          Some of the sexual innuendo in You Don't Know Jack 6's jokes can be less than subtle.  
    

  The game also sounds pretty good. The soundtrack features appropriately upbeat game show-style 
 music for its intro and segues between questions and features TV cartoon sound effects for when 
 you miss a question or "screw" your opponents. Like previous games in the series, all of You Don't 
 Know Jack 6 is narrated by a wisecracking game show host, and as in the previous games, the audio 
 delivery is seamless. Every question sounds like it's being read like one realistic, continuous 
 line of dialogue. However, host Phil "Schmitty" Ridarelli and The Cap'n, who acts as the stagehand, 
 seem to lack the edge and wit of previous hosts, like Cookie from the original You Don't Know Jack 
 or Paul "Pee-Wee Herman" Reubens from the short-lived TV show of the same name. Just as in the 
 previous games, both characters crack jokes that are appropriate to your situation, such as when 
 you skip the instructions, are playing alone, or lose big. In the new game, though, you can see 
 most of their jokes coming a mile away, so you may not get too many laughs from the voice-over. 
 However, in the customary You Don't Know Jack style, a number of the questions have clever wordings 
 that you'll probably find amusing, especially if you play with a friend or two.  

  This is a decent game to play alone and it's better with friends. It has enough different trivia 
 questions to last you for some time, provided you don't sit and play through the game continuously 
 for several hours on end. It's a good value at $20, though the game is currently available only 
 through Jellyvision's Web site. If you've never played a game in this series before and the concept 
 sounds intriguing, you should definitely consider getting it. However, considering how similar 
 it is to previous installments, you could probably get one of the others as well. Still, it seems 
 disappointing that after all this time, Jellyvision didn't see fit to try and update the series. 
 Perhaps the developer could have incorporated (or parodied) the "new" features of modern TV game 
 shows, like presenting integrated video "clues," audience participation, phone-ins, or Internet 
 surveys, as these are all features that could probably have been implemented well by a studio as 
 clever and creative as Jellyvision. If you're a longtime fan of these games, you may be disappointed 
 at how You Don't Know Jack 6 refuses to deviate from the series' formula, but as with the other 
 games, you'll still probably get a kick out of the questions.

Review:  So, I am probably a bit biased here. I am 23 years old now, nearly 24, and I bought the first jack 
 game way back when, during those years when I had no idea what was going on with it, and in fact, 
 had to wait a year to play it because my computer was too slow, that's right for a trivia game. 
 Either way, once I did play, I loved it, and still have all five versions on CD. My point is, I 
 have a reference point to talk about this version.
  YDKJ 6 is very similar to the past versions. The questions are still witty and cover a wide range 
 of topics, and the "special questions" and jack attacks... well... they definitly exist. Other then 
 the pirate theme though, something is missing. I guess this is advertised when they start the game 
 my saying that YDKJ 6 is really only "half" of a new game anyway. Still, what made the past YDKJ's 
 so great was that each edition added to the previous one. This one has a pirate theme, which is 
 bland if not sort of annoying, and lacks the characters and jokes the past episodes had. It also 
 doesn't let you choose between a 7 and 21 question game (always 7) which sort of stinks. Don't 
 get me wrong, the host (Schmitty... I think) is still great, and the game is a blast to play, it's 
 just that this is one of the greatest game lines every made, and to be teased with half a new version, 
 or even a continuation of an older version, just isn't fair.
  Overall, for $19 you can't go wrong to get some more of the best trivia game the the world has 
 ever known (see... we do know Jack) . Maybe the more people that buy, the more inspired Jellyvision 
 will be to make a YDKJ 7 and really kick butt with it. I imagine they just got tired of doing them 
 (though I admitedly don't know why they stopped... maybe it was the TV show... which was good not 
 great, ya know) but a little consumer support never hurts, so go buy the game, and enjoy playing... JACK
