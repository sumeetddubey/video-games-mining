:::Review:::
Digital Image Design has crafted the latest and perhaps the most exacting reproduction of the USAF's 
 all-new air supremacy/strike fighter. 

 There was a time, not too long ago, when you could count on one hand all of the civil and combat 
 flight simulations released within any given 12-month period. In fact, ardent flight sim enthusiasts 
 were known to snap up every simulation that cruised down the runway, regardless of its perceived 
 faults. Gaming has certainly changed over the past few years, particularly in the realm of modern 
 air combat sims. Case in point: In the past seven months, no fewer than four F-22 simulations have 
 surfaced, each purportedly marketed as the definitive portrayal of America's latest low-observable, 
 stealth technology-driven aircraft.   

 In F-22 Air Dominance Fighter, Digital Image Design has crafted the latest and perhaps the most 
 exacting reproduction of the USAF's all-new air supremacy/strike fighter. Incorporating lessons 
 learned from EF2000 - F-22 ADF's critically acclaimed predecessor - data gleaned from various declassified 
 sources, as well as notional depictions of certain next-generation avionics systems and weaponry, 
 F-22 ADF may be, as DID proudly advertises, the most sophisticated yet equally absorbing air combat 
 simulation ever to be conceived.   

 The F-22 aircraft portrayed in the game seems responsive and accurately modeled, dutifully illustrating 
 every important facet of the actual aircraft. A wide array of internal and external viewing perspectives 
 has been included, not to mention several EMCON levels, which are intended to automatically monitor 
 and adjust the aircraft's in-flight stealth profile. Heck, even a few UFO's manage to put in a 
 cameo appearance, vying for the dubious distinction of being called the preeminent air dominance 
 fighter!   

 Furthermore, F-22 ADF has an awful lot of enticing features that are sure to make a few heads whip 
 around in awe. For starters, you can slowly immerse yourself within the overall framework, learning 
 all of the intricate aspects and capabilities of the F-22 - as well as its present and future adversaries 
 - thanks to a rich, full-featured simulator; a comprehensive, well-written manual; and an equally 
 impressive World Air Power journal. If you prefer, you can kick the tires and light the fires of 
 the F-22 that much sooner, tearing up the skies over the troubled Middle East in the "kill-or-be-killed" 
 quick combat mode. Here, you are initially confronted by a litany of inept enemy ground and air 
 defenses, which become increasingly more adroit - and obviously more lethal - as time wears on, 
 perhaps spanning an incredible five-hour timeframe. For the more adventurous, you may enlist in 
 one of three tours of duty, each depicting a simmering hotbed of tension - ready to explode in 
 the not-too-distant future - in and around the perilous Red Sea region.   

 Although you assume command of several superstealthy F-22 fighters, there are several missions in 
 which you must hand off your responsibilities as a squadron commander and step aboard a loitering 
 AWACs aircraft operating miles behind the FEBA. On these occasions, you are charged with monitoring 
 air and ground activity within the immediate battle sector, eventually vectoring friendly air, 
 land, and naval assets to troubled areas in the most timely and efficient manner. In addition, 
 you can, for the first time, experience the trials and tribulations of engaging in midair refueling 
 with high-flying KC-35 tankers. Even the Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) is excellent. 
   

 Unfortunately, there are several troubling issues that warrant some cause for concern. For instance, 
 although radio chatter is made out to depict English-speaking foreign nationals, the audio seems 
 especially distorted, even during relatively low-intensity moments. If it weren't for the inclusion 
 of accompanying onscreen text, I dare say most players would deem these messages virtually unintelligible 
 and utterly ineffectual. Furthermore, the utilization of canned missions means that you must continually 
 fight and refight the same pre-scripted battles over and over until you somehow manage to meet 
 the mission goals. The omission of a mission planner and the inability to alter an aircraft's weapons 
 loadout prior to mission startup only serves to compound rather than correct these oversights. 
 Lastly, the lack of a customizable mission editor for hypothetical air-to-air combat setups and 
 the exclusion of a mission builder are, at best, inexplicable, especially when one compares and 
 contrasts F-22 ADF with other simulations competing for the same consumer dollar.  

 Undoubtedly, DID's upcoming F-22 Total Air War - the sequel to F-22 ADF - will address most, if 
 not all, of these shortcomings, integrating a host of important upgrades and other "on-the-drawing-board" 
 enhancements to this near rock-solid simulation. For now, though, you will just have to smack your 
 lips and remain patient as you strap into the most engrossing F-22 simulation to roll down the 
 war-ravaged tarmac.
