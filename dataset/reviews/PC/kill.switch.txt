:::Review:::
The mechanics for ducking and getting behind cover are well done, and the premise is a good one. 
 Unfortunately, that's all kill. switch really has going for it. 

  At first glance, Namco's kill. switch looks like a pretty standard third-person military-themed 
 shooter. It has a look to it that recalls both Konami's Metal Gear Solid and Ubisoft's Splinter 
 Cell, though it focuses more on shooting enemy soldiers in the face than on deep storylines and 
 complicated stealthy maneuvers. It presents some relatively cool gameplay techniques, but a lack 
 of length and some rough edges don't make this console-to-PC port go down any more smoothly.  

 
          kill. switch places you in the mysterious role of a brainwashed supersoldier... or  does 
  it?     

  The premise in kill. switch is a mysterious one. You really aren't given much background about who 
 you are or what you're doing, but if you listen closely to the pre-mission dialogue, it quickly 
 becomes apparent that you aren't playing the role of the soldier on the screen. Rather, you're 
 actually taking on the role of a man controlling this supersoldier via some sort of neural link. 
 It also quickly becomes apparent that you're the bad guy of this story, committing dastardly deeds 
 as you try to pit the world's superpowers against one another using this American-looking soldier 
 to ensure the blame is cast elsewhere. While the game has a terrific premise and does have a twist 
 to its plot, the storyline itself is practically nonexistent, which makes the game feel pretty 
 disjointed and, above all, makes your actions feel meaningless, even though according to the back 
 of the box, you're attempting to start a world war. You get a small bit of audio at the front of 
 each mission that's supposed to set things up a bit, but the missions and areas don't feel very 
 related. You just run into a level and kill a bunch of people while trying to accomplish straightforward 
 objectives.  

  The mission design doesn't really help matters much. By and large, your objective in each mission 
 is to simply get to the end. At the end, you'll surely be doing something slightly different, but 
 that usually boils down to either planting explosives on something, pushing a button, finding an 
 exit, or picking up an item -- which are all done in such a way that they all feel like cosmetically 
 different versions of the exact same objective. The game is also very short, and even players starting 
 out on the hard difficulty setting should be able to breeze through kill. switch in six or seven 
 hours. There aren't any unlockable features, multiplayer options, or other bonuses to keep you 
 busy after that.  

  Sure, the missions just have you running around and shooting enemy goons with nary a boss fight 
 in sight, but the mechanics it gives you to play with are well done. The game is designed to force 
 you to constantly find cover. The left trigger is devoted to ducking or, if you're near a wall 
 or nearby box, pressing your back up against cover and getting out of sight. From there you can 
 find your next target, peek around or above your cover, and then take a shot. Or, if you're under 
 pressure, you can fire without peeking out from your cover. Though this technique, labeled "blindfire" 
 by the game, is cool, it's so inaccurate that it's practically useless. Considering that most enemies 
 die from one or two shots, and aiming at them isn't really a hassle from behind cover, you rarely 
 have a need to blindfire anyway. This may have made a bit more sense on consoles, given the less 
 precise nature of the gamepad, but with a mouse and keyboard, the aiming part of the process is 
 dead-simple. The game's easy aiming also makes grenades pretty useless, which is a shame, because 
 you can carry multiple types of grenades, including flashbangs, which blind your opponents and 
 make them fire wildly while clutching at their eyes.  

  The constant use of cover and nonstop gunplay make kill. switch almost feel like a third-person-shooter 
 take on Namco's popular light-gun series Time Crisis. Even on hard, though, the game really isn't 
 very difficult, and if you're good at ducking behind cover and popping off one or two aimed shots 
 here and there, you'll skate through the game without any trouble. The game's AI doesn't throw 
 you any curveballs, either. Sure, they'll occasionally toss a grenade in your direction, but they 
 usually just stay behind cover, occasionally popping their heads out to look for you, making them 
 easy kills.  

  The two console versions of kill. switch look quite nice, though the Xbox version looks significantly 
 cleaner and smoother than its PS2 counterpart. On the PC, the game's models look OK, but overall, 
 the textures and look of the game are a little low resolution. The game actually limits your resolution 
 to a maximum of 1084x768, so there's no help to be found there. The canned animation for every 
 action in the game makes you feel as though you're engaged in some sort of robot-combat simulation. 
 While it's understandable that a brainwashed supersoldier would be running and moving by the book, 
 the enemy soldiers have a similar digital look to their movement, which takes a bit away from the 
 game's otherwise solid graphical presentation. The game had passable, if stiff, animation on the 
 consoles, but here, all of the movement just seems off. Your soldier's feet just move too quickly 
 when he runs, and he doesn't cover as much ground as a man moving his feet this fast should cover. 
 The game basically looks like it's running in "fast-motion," and everything from the camera movement 
 to the animation looks stuttery and fake as a result.  

          The game's fast, stuttery animation problems make the whole game look like a military-themed 
  Benny Hill  sketch.     

  On the sound side of things, kill. switch has some pretty forgettable music. The game's sound effects 
 are quite well done, but, as you might expect, they consist almost entirely of gunshots and explosions. 
 In these regards, kill. switch excels. On the other hand, your character seems to occasionally make 
 twice as many footstep noises as he should. This isn't a big deal, but it's noticeable. A larger 
 problem is that the audio often clips, gets stuttery, and occasionally cut out on the machines 
 we tried it on. Since you'll want to hear enemy fire when and where it happens, the audio drop 
 out is pretty annoying.  

  In the end, you can't help but get the feeling that kill. switch is half a game. The mechanics for 
 ducking and getting behind cover are well done, and the premise is a good one. Unfortunately, that's 
 all kill. switch really has going for it. The game surrounding these mechanics is generic and short, 
 at times feeling more like a demo than a finished retail product. While one could easily imagine 
 a great sequel that uses these mechanics and has corrected the game's inherent problems, what Hip 
 Games has delivered here probably isn't worth your while.

Review:  Whether sensible or not, my foray into lesser known and lesser ranked titles continues in the eye 
 of a PC game release storm. And there are some seriously good shooters hitting the shelves at this 
 instant. So to play a title such as kill. switch at this point in time is at the opportunity cost 
 of, say, Medal of Honor: Airborne. However, my humble PC is not fully prepared for those requirements 
 in any event.
  
  kill. switch is a sleeper for mine. A third person shooter with a decent gimmick in it's cover and 
 blind fire mechanism, but also a game that delivers some tense moments and intense firefights. 
 This atmosphere is compounded with the absence of a quicksave feature, which will drive certain 
 folk up the wall, but it adds a little more care as you control the controller.
  
  The story is disclosed in snippets between missions, but ultimately you are not the gent on the 
 screen for a majority of the game, rather a soul remotely controlling the avatar as he ducks, weaves 
 and shoots his way through generic hotspots. However, your character (Bishop) comes around in the 
 end and pursues his antagonist through levels of reasonably competitive enemies.
  
  The graphics aren't bad. There are reasonable environments for the levels (I thought the temple 
 level was cool) and plenty of nooks, crannys and hide-holes to nestle in and utilise the cover 
 system. Whilst enemy soldiers look blocky and generic enough they do move and roll with realism. 
 Weapons look reasonable enough and it all looks OK whether at close quarters and in open range. 
 It's clearly a port, which provides some angst with some inexplicable camera work, but I've seen 
 a lot worse. The between mission intermissions deserve a mention as it the plot (although a bit 
 on the light side) is unwrapped 'Momento' style.
  
  The sounds are all OK, with suitable atmospheric music most of the time that settles in the backdrop 
 of the skirmishes that regularly take place. The firefights sound realistic enough, but the same 
 can't be said for the synthetic sounding explosions. Sound will also cut out from time to time 
 if there is plenty going on. Voice acting is all quite solid and there is the usual title music 
 and environment effects one expects on such a game.
  
  The gameplay is simple in concept - get your Uberwarrior from Point A to Point B. Whilst there 
 is the odd switch to flick along the way, most of your tasking will be to lay waste to a fairly 
 large amount of enemy combatants. You are not indestructible either, a few good shots from reasonable 
 proximity will bring you down, but you do have strong recuperative powers that, coupled with the 
 lack of in-game save, lead to a guerrilla-like approach. Cover and patience is your ally, and it 
 is done exceedingly well. You can nestle in behind a structure and use blind fire and quick fire 
 to knock over or force back the foes. Most structures can provide cover, but the camera angle will 
 take some getting used to. Rushing is a game of chance but is very satisfying when it comes off. 
 However, you will need to make sure you enemies go down and not look like they go down - some do 
 find a last gasp of wind to stay on their feet - with grim results if you figured them for dead.
 
  
  The staged areas for combat are well designed. They are usually multi-levelled and drawing fire 
 from close and afar, but again there's plenty of cover to retreat, reassess and re-enter the fray. 
 There's no doubt some frustrations as missions will be attempted several times before you get it 
 right (I had to go to the FAQ for one, where in the end all I needed to do was run for my life 
 rather than engage - and that's a hollow victory) , but it's satisfying once you get to the save 
 point.
  
  It's a short game, clocking in a barely half a dozen hours, but thats probably to its benefit. 
 There may only be so many hectic fights and so many objects to use for cover before it wears a 
 bit thin. There are only five levels (not including the training level) , but they increase in difficulty 
 as you progress. No multiplayer, two difficulty levels and the ability to play any mission once 
 you've completed it. You'll probably play it once only.
  
  I picked kill. switch up for $AUD10, which is better than the $AUD70 on release and the $AUD30 soon 
 after. It's hard to find, so if you see it lying about and enjoy this type of game, I'd recommended 
 picking it up.
  
  I liked kill. switch. I could look past some flaws in the gameplay and took the lack of save-game 
 feature as an atmospheric addition to this release. There's probably much better out there, but 
 it's well developed cover system and intense skirmishes provide a solid half dozen hours of rogue 
 mayhem.

Review:  Kill. Switch is a 3rd person shooter that any one can play. Its easy to learn and fun to play. The 
 game also lets you have many different guns to shoot and play around with and the fun of blind 
 shooting and the fun of diving around and just plain shooting things. Kill. Switch gives you the 
 ability to blind fire and this is the 1st game that I have ever played that gave you the chance 
 to do that. This game also lets you dive around corners and shoot things. I mean it sucks that 
 the game didnt do so hot but its still a vary good game for the little kids to start playing. Thanks 
 for Reading.

Review:  Don't buy this. I bought this in China for 10 yen, which is $1.25 American. I played it. The first 
 mission is a training mission that you run around and shoot things. In one of the real missions, 
 the whole point of the entire game is to "take cover." Which really ruins it. Think about it, how 
 the heck is someone supposed to shoot someone on the other side of the brick wall if he can't see 
 him? That's bull. The weapon sounds suck. The M4 sounds like a pump shotgun. Without the pumping. 
 The physics are almost non-existant. There are no objects able to be picked up. And you can't even 
 change the controls! Who the hell uses TAB to throw grenades? All I can say is, don't buy this. 
 Even if it costs 10 yen. Do you know what you can buy with that? (Tons of food)

Review:  Well the game was promising. Intens shooting, using cover and grenade to force your way trough 
 waves of good A. I. controlled armed forces while you reloade your weapon as the concrete is being 
 shot of the corner where u take cover.
  
  well this game should have bin a movie, thats for sure.
  the story is that you are soldier, working 
 for an elite mercerie company and betrayed.
  Military hardware runs trough your brain making you no more then a avatar of the "Controller"... 
 just like a video game ur controlled by a PC and Player.
  "how typical , war at the touch of a button"-game quote
  
  Well the story starts with a trainging 
 where a nifty intro shows you being loaded up.. "say my name"....
  The game REALY starts of in a desert city where some how, there is not a living soul, couch , sounds 
 or even a normaly decorated room, but what there is... is good.
  gaurds that are stupid, who point there guns at comrads ( funny conversation in the first mission 
 ) .
  
  head on in and say HERE IS JONNY and what better what better whay then to trow a flash run and 
 gun a few man down roll beind a pillar and see the bullets fly around you, duck away from the pillar 
 and open a short burst and kill a man, roll to the corner and flash/clear a room...
  well ull be doing that a long long long time ... sigh, there is not much game play differnts, only 
 1 mission where u get to do more diffrant things then run and gun...
  place c4, snipe 2 guys before beying forced back to run and gun, and run the gaunlet trying to 
 escape.
  Well i had a blast , but thats it ... a blast, its way way to short, 5 missions wich is 4 or 5 
 chapters, each missions shows a last memory wich allows u to over come being controlled.... but 
 .. guess ??? yep .. a blast, the whole story is blurry yet direct, u steal a nuke, start a war and 
 that way controller and friends get mighty rich selling mindless Gun man ... kinda like universal 
 soldier... hmmm.
  
  to bad the game play was used in a game to short, to cheap, to flashy, a longer campaing, more 
 inovating missions, more weapons and baddy, maby even a a co-op and a good multie player or 2 player 
 game would have made it a great game. To bad hip games, try try again ... no realy try again and 
 do better !
  
  final:
  
  Well this should have been a 5 million dollar action flick cause the way it goes could make a good 
 action movie for sure.

Review:  I tought this game was very cool. Especially in the beginning but what happend after just 5 hours 
 the game was over. They could have done it at least 4 times as long. But it is a good game and 
 a little other then the usual shooters. If you want fun for a short time then buy this game. i 
 am glad i bought this game but it is not on the top of the list on my funniest games but it quite 
 ok. The funniest part of the game is the take cover thing. You cannot just run and shoot everything 
 then you will die very fast is more to sit and take cover and then when the enamies are loading 
 you get your chance . If you like shooters at least try this game but don run to the store like 
 an antilop and buy it because it is not that good

Review:  Kill. Switch is a cool Action shooter with no thinking or puzzles. Just shooting!
  
  I live such game where you just need to press w and aim a little and shoot a lot!
  Kill. Switch 
 is one of those. Just killing around!
  
  I started the game and first I that I had a complete failure but after a couple of minutes gaming 
 experience I knew I was wrong. It game isnt that special but it is a cool action shooter!
  
  I don`t heve much to tell you about the game. All you should do is checking out the demo and 
 If you like it buy it!
