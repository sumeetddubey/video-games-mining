:::Review:::
A new Blitzkrieg game in everything but its title, Frontline: Fields of Thunder is yet another cookie-cutter 
 WWII RTS. 

  One thing's for sure -- Nival Interactive sticks to what it knows. Though the Russian developer regularly 
 branches out to develop games like Heroes of Might and Magic V, it always seems to return to its 
 WWII RTS bread and butter. So get ready to welcome Frontline: Fields of Thunder to a retail shelf 
 near you. But don't let the new name fool you: This is really just another release in Nival's long-running 
 Blitzkrieg series, complete with all the cookie-cutter town invasions and ridiculously hard missions 
 that have marked that entire franchise.  

          When tanks collide!     

  Precious little separates Frontline from the recently released Blitzkrieg 2: Fall of the Reich 
 stand-alone expansion pack. The graphics and sound seem to have been directly ported over, and 
 both games deal with battles between the Germans and Russians on the Eastern Front. The only real 
 difference separating the two is a tight focus here on the tank warfare that raged around the city 
 of Kursk in 1943. The two 10-mission campaigns are told from the points of view of the Nazis and 
 their commie adversaries, so you get a broad-based look at some crucial moments in this theater 
 of war. This gives the game more of a historical sheen than its Blitzkrieg brethren, a fact emphasized 
 by the inclusion of a military encyclopedia that is remarkably thorough. It doesn't add anything 
 to your enjoyment of the game to know that the Germans outfitted a battalion of captured Russian 
 T-34 tanks with 20mm AA guns in 1943, although WWII history nuts will appreciate these tidbits. 

  But even with the game's Kursk underpinnings, the missions are boilerplate Blitzkrieg. Some of 
 this game's missions are more complex than those in Blitzkriegs past, and feature numerous shifting 
 objectives. Many of these objectives aren't properly explained, however, so it's often hard to 
 figure out how to proceed until you get blown to pieces and restart the level a few times. These 
 additional goals are stereotypical in nature, too, and involve none-too-original WWII game escapades 
 such as blowing up bridges and destroying enemy artillery. Only some of the Russian missions, where 
 you have to break out of pockets to avoid being encircled by the Nazis, feel fresh.  

  Still, the bottom line is that pretty much every mission involves you leading an armor column or 
 three, plus a couple of companies of grunts and support vehicles, into enemy-occupied towns loaded 
 with legions of enemy troops, tanks, and gun emplacements. So, yes, the insane difficulty that 
 is a hallmark of the Blitzkrieg series is front and center here. Frontline may actually be tougher 
 than its predecessors, as the missions here are more historically rigorous in that reinforcements 
 are strictly limited. Much of the time you go into battle with a set number of tanks and troops 
 and must accomplish one or two objectives before receiving any backup. Sometimes you don't get 
 any help at all aside from a couple of calls to recon aircraft to scout out the terrain and fighters 
 to bomb and strafe enemy positions. Even with this aerial assistance, you can't make any mistakes. 
 This is a big change from the Blitzkrieg games, where you could screw up once or twice and rely 
 on reinforcements to save your sorry ass.  

  Some RTS gamers will appreciate this rigorous design, especially hardcore Blitzkrieg veterans and 
 those who find typical WWII real-time gaming too dependent on simpleminded tank rushes. Still, 
 there is something cheap about how enemy numbers and positions are always set up perfectly to demolish 
 you. It may be entirely realistic to have to make the most out of a starting complement of men 
 and machines. And it may be perfectly in line with real warfare to have to scout terrain from the 
 air before sending troops marching up a road. But missions here don't feel the least bit authentic; 
 they feel like artificial puzzles where everything is arrayed against you and there is just one 
 way to get through with your skin intact. The only saving grace is that you don't face the outrageous 
 number of enemies as those seen in the Blitzkrieg games. You're still up against crazy odds, but 
 at least it doesn't seem as if Nival has crammed the entire Wehrmacht and Red Army into a few villages. 

          Calling in air support is crucial, both for reconnaissance and when you want to soften 
 up the enemy with a bombing run or three.     

  All of the above means that multiplayer is really the way to go here. Going up against other human 
 opponents is exactly the same here as it is in the Blitzkrieg games, so it remains a quick, visceral 
 experience. More importantly, though, it allows you to sidestep campaign issues with the puzzle-centric 
 mission design and difficulty. Multiplayer is pretty one-note, however, as there is just a single 
 mode of play and it's a straightforward rendition of capture the flag. It doesn't seem to be taking 
 the RTS community by storm, either, as it's almost impossible to find anybody looking for a game 
 on the Nival. net matching server.  

  While there is something to be said for playing up to your audience, Frontline: Fields of Thunder 
 sticks too close to the Blitzkrieg template to be interesting or entertaining. This is a reasonably 
 competent take on a tried-and-true formula, but it is a formula nevertheless, and one in desperate 
 need of some new ingredients.
