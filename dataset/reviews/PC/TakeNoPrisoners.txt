:::Review:::
Run-and-gun fans can get a breath of fresh air with Take No Prisoners, a shooter that takes an interesting 
 perspective on the genre. 

 With an uncountable number of first-person shooters flooding the market - and even more looming 
 ominously on the horizon - it's refreshing when a slightly different 3D action game comes along. 
 Run-and-gun fans can get a breath of fresh air with Take No Prisoners, a shooter that takes an 
 interesting perspective on the genre - both literally and figuratively.  

 In Take No Prisoners, nuclear warheads and radioactive fallout have transformed San Antonio, Texas, 
 into an irradiated hellhole, full of microwaved ex-yuppies and other mutated critters just begging 
 for a shotgun blast to the chest. You play Slade, a Snake Pliskin wanna-be, who has been recruited 
 by The Man to infiltrate a mysterious, center-city dome. Once inside, the goal is to retrieve a 
 special crystal, using the timeless negotiating skill of blasting everyone with heavy artillery. 

 All of the action in Take No Prisoners is viewed via an overhead floating camera, which follows 
 you around as you romp through post-apocalyptic wastelands while mowing down bad guys, picking 
 up objects and keycards, and doodling with computer terminals. While at first glance Take No Prisoners 
 may appear to be little more than Quake from above, there's a good deal of depth below the surface. 
 You can get a feel for the continuous storyline by reading personal logfiles stored on computers 
 (a nod to Origin's System Shock) , and solve puzzles that are a few steps above the "find the key 
 to open the door" variety.  

 Graphics are appropriately dark and moody, and the control is as responsive as expected. The game 
 moves at a good clip on the base system, though a 3D accelerator will jack up the frame rate while 
 adding sparkly colored lighting to ooh and aah at. Internet play has been implemented via the RedOrb 
 Zone interface, though performance issues are questionable - it's best left for players with fast 
 connections.  

 Aside from the sluggish Net play, a few minor annoyances hold back Take No Prisoners. The game's 
 view seems a bit too low in some places, inducing claustrophobia and depleting the situational 
 awareness of what lies in front of you. And when you pull down your PDA in the middle of the game 
 to read a briefing or check a passcode, the game doesn't pause - if there's a mutated critter out 
 of your field of vision, he'll have you for lunch while you attempt to review your notes.   

 Take No Prisoners' audio is also pretty shabby. It's not just the irritatingly repetitive enemy 
 taunt voices, it's just that Slade's zippy one-liners simply aren't that clever - Duke Nukem did 
 it much, much better. The controversial content is in there, though - if the bordering-on-tasteless 
 ad campaign didn't clue you in, you may be offended by the amount of blood and gore.   

 Though it has its problems here and there, Take No Prisoners is different enough to warrant a look. 
 It may not be the end-all of blast fests, but it's a welcome departure from scores of Quake clones, 
 and consequently a good and solid ride while it lasts.

Review:  Do you wan't to see atmosphere filled top-down action? This is Take No Prisoners
  
  TNP brings you a post-apocalyptic non stop shooting and running, when you meet numerous enemies, 
 such as mad cultists, terrible mutants or perfect war-machines Colossus Cyborgs. Numerous weapons 
 allows you to blast, burn, shoot down all unfriendly creatures on your way, but remember -each 
 weapon - for each type of critter. Mutants can't be killed by a bullet, but the are buring good. 
 Cyborgs don't like EMP explosions, humans die instantly if got hit by toxins. You will have to 
 solve puzzles, search for keys, explore hidden areas. Sometimes you'll find journals, which let 
 you reproduce events in post-apocalyptic city. But you shall never feel safe. Death is always waiting 
 when you take a breath. You don't have any allies - so, take no prisoners!

Review:  I decided to write a review because, it's the only old game I still have and even PLAY.
  
  I was ten years old when I played Take No Prisoners for the first time. It was really bloody and 
 violent back then for me. But that was the reason why I liked this game so much, but especially 
 because it was from a top-down view.
  
  The Intro movie of the game gave me goose bumps. I really liked it when they showed how all hope 
 was lost when you (Slade) suddenly showed up and took matters in your own hands.
  
  There are allot of different weapons that are all really useful, but sometimes it will have no 
 effect on an enemy so you have to look at which weapon has effect on which enemy.
  Almost all the weapons are pretty standard (shotguns, assault rifles) but there are some unique 
 ones in there too.
  You could also use allot of items of course like med kits and grenades.
  But there were also 
 all kind of items I have never seen in any other game.
  Like a grenade that sucked everyone and everything in it if it exploded.
  Or a device that upgraded 
 everything you had ALLOT temporary.
  
  You can also use vehicles (boats, cars and turret mounted vehicles) and turrets.
  
  You also 
 had a PDA. You could find information of all the items, weapons, armors, maps, enemies, logs, and 
 some others stuff on it. Everything was shown in 3D. There are also allot of different enemies 
 that you can meet. You kept meeting stronger and/or faster/smarter enemies. Your enemies were humans 
 that were mutated in the brain, robots, and mutated animals.
  Now and then you would meet a Boss. They werent in some special place; you would see them suddenly 
 somewhere running, walking, flying or driving around.
  
  Another thing I really liked about this game was that it was completely Non-linear.
  You could 
 travel anywhere you liked and travel back anywhere you liked.
  To every place you traveled to you could choose wherever you wanted to go or do first.
  
  The 
 multi player was great too, you could play co-op up to four people and against each other in allot 
 of different standard modes like death match CTF and others.
  
  I has good graphics for such an old game and the sound and music is good enough too. But the controls 
 are something you just have to get used to.
  
  I think its because all the memories I had with this game that I still play it.
  Back then Slade 
 was the toughest and coolest made up guy I have ever seen. He just acted tough; nothing scared 
 him and he just mocked everything and everyone that was around him. He had dark humor, plus he 
 had a cool voice. I liked all his one-liners during the game.
  Also because sometimes I like to play some old game and look at what games used to look back then.
 
  
  PS: it was the first really violent and bloody game I have played.
