:::Review:::
It isn't particularly original in any specific regard, but its solid combination of features collectively 
 form a unique and enjoyable role-playing game. 

 On the surface, Rage of Mages looks and even plays much like Blizzard's Warcraft II or any other 
 real-time strategy game. But within lies an elaborate experience system, an involving plot, and 
 a remarkable quantity of mundane and magical items waiting to be discovered. It's not a technologically 
 impressive game, nor is it particularly original in any specific regard, but its solid combination 
 of features collectively form a unique and enjoyable role-playing game.  

 Its colorful high-resolution graphics are detailed enough that you'll appreciate their nuances more 
 often than you'll condemn the game for looking three years old, though both situations are bound 
 to happen. Variable weather conditions, elevation changes that affect line of sight, and trees 
 that blow in the breeze all help make Rage of Mages look subtly attractive. Unfortunately, the 
 assorted heroes, villains, and monsters in the game all look small, similar, and plain. They aren't 
 animated so well, and when they start fighting, they don't seem very serious about it. At least 
 they sound sincere. And though Rage of Mages isn't anything special as far as sound effects are 
 concerned, at least what's there is appropriate. As for the soundtrack, the composition sounds 
 ambitious enough, but the buzzing, fast-paced pseudo-epic tunes will sooner have you clutching 
 your ears and gritting your teeth than reveling in all the grandiosity. Good voice acting helps 
 make up for it.  

 The game moves slowly and not at all smoothly, and making your heroes trudge across yet another 
 woodland landscape threatens to become tedious after a while. Cranking the speed setting to maximum 
 does little to alleviate the problem and will sooner create a new one, as you'll have little time 
 to micromanage combat. The game can do some of the dirty work for you, with options for automatic 
 retreat and healing. But you'll still need to actively move your units about the battlefield, keeping 
 your mages safely behind the warriors and actively casting the appropriate spells, many of which 
 will be appropriate late in the game. Control isn't particularly responsive during battle, which 
 is all the more frustrating because of the sluggish pace, but at least most of the mission objectives 
 are concise. The combat in Rage of Mages isn't particularly special or exciting, but it's challenging 
 and satisfying enough if only because successfully eliminating your foes always yields all sorts 
 of treasure. Much of that gear will be immediately useful, and you can lug the rest back to town 
 and trade it for gold for purchasing even better equipment, training your heroes, or hiring mercenaries. 

 And it's these role-playing elements that make Rage of Mages fun, even addictive. But Rage of Mages 
 isn't the sprawling RPG you might expect; the long single-player campaign is fundamentally linear, 
 although you'll have a choice about the order in which you take on sets of objectives. You don't 
 get much say in how your characters handle a situation either, as your heroes all speak for themselves 
 and make their moral decisions without your input. Thus Rage of Mages is a role-playing game for 
 only two reasons: It lets you shop, and it has a strong and continuous narrative structure. The 
 shopping part lets you compulsively spend hundreds of thousands of gold pieces on so many kinds 
 of weapons, armor, and magical equipment as to make most other games pale in comparison. Seeing 
 your heroes wearing and wielding the often ridiculously ostentatious equipment is enough to drive 
 you onward, if only with hopes that you'll soon find an even more preposterous wizard cap or a 
 sword with even more barbs sticking out of its blade.  

 As for the story, although it isn't tightly woven or particularly original, it is carefully integrated 
 into every mission. Rage of Mages really would have benefited from Starcraft-style animated portraits 
 and in-mission dialogue, but the game is still loaded with scripted events that make the missions 
 interesting when they might have just as easily been boring. A lot happens in Rage of Mages. You 
 begin your journey alone, but you'll soon meet other heroes who'll join you, and you'll banter 
 and argue with them through the remainder of the game. You might save a lone warrior from a goblin 
 ambush; you might befriend an ogre who will provide the necessary brawn to defeat a monster thought 
 invincible by local townsfolk. You'll free maidens from evil mages, claim treasure from evil dragons, 
 and tread lightly through hallowed graveyards. Combat will occasionally impede progress: You'll 
 occasionally stumble into hopeless battles that require specific solutions (you must have missed 
 that polymorph potion back there) , and you'll need to load a saved game and try something different. 
 Luckily, the game doesn't usually fall into this pattern, and even when it does, the solutions 
 still come about pretty quickly.  

 Rage of Mages includes a multiplayer mode, but it strips away the plot and confines you to fight 
 in no more than six areas (with more available from Monolith) in an eternal quest to gain experience 
 and wealth for their own sake. The multiplayer mode proves that as a real-time strategy game, Rage 
 of Mages is mediocre at the very best. The single-player quest mode, on the other hand, shows just 
 how far a good script and a lot of treasure can go to make a simple game refreshing.

Review:  When I first got this game, it took me a while to get into it. However, much to my satisfaction, 
 I finally did. It is a good solid game that I think would be appealing to many. The controls are 
 easy enough to figure out and the game-play is fairly smooth, considering when it was made. The 
 graphics are decent and the sound isn't terrible. It is a little repetitive but other than that, 
 ok. I did find the story line a little on the thin side, and the mission objectives were all very 
 similar, which I found to be quite unfortunate. It is unlikely that you will fins a copy of this 
 game in many stores now, but if the chance does arise, to buy it, I think you should, because once 
 you start, you'll really enjoy it.
