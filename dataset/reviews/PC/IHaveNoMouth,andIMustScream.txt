:::Review:::
Computer gaming, and the graphic adventure genre in particular, may be in serious need of innovation, 
 but this run-of-the-mill adventure doesn't provide it. 

 This interactive sequel to Harlan Ellison's famous short story of the same name was the subject 
 of much ado before its release. Most of this hype came from the notorious curmudgeon himself, who 
 criticized the state of computer entertainment while promising that his foray into gaming would 
 provide players with a new experience.  

 Unfortunately, Ellison was only partly right. Computer gaming, and the graphic adventure genre in 
 particular, may be in serious need of innovation, but this run-of-the-mill adventure doesn't provide 
 it. I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is replete with all of the shortcomings of its genre. There 
 are numerous dead ends and illogical puzzlesfor example, you must flush a toilet three times 
 to access a hidden room. There are also many programming bugs; characters will walk backwards across 
 the screen and even vanish without warning.   

 To be fair, I Have No Mouth does experiment with some interesting concepts, and the dark tone 
 of the original short story is maintained with bleak artwork and depressing situations. But the 
 so-called ethical decisions these five imprisoned souls must face are no more than 
 red herrings, providing only stopping blocks to progress or disturbing scenes with no tangible 
 purpose. More disturbing is Ellison as the voice of AM (the evil supercomputer which has imprisoned 
 the five protagonists) , which may as well be renamed HAM after his over-enthusiastic performance. 
   

 Die-hard adventurers will certainly find a challenge (especially during the incomprehensible end-game) 
 and Ellison aficionados may be intrigued by this extension of his work, but I Have No Mouth 
 doesn't prove to be a worthy translation of the sci-fi classic. Instead, this title relies on the 
 frustrating cliches and roadblocks that have plagued the adventure game genre since its inception.

Review:  This is not just a game.. It's a real nightmare.. Explore the inner deep of human soul and pray.. If 
 you like psychological thrillers then this game is the right for you. Great story, great atmosphere 
 and 5 original characters who are totally abandoned in a living hell. Can you escape? Can you trust 
 anyone? Are you living this or is this another game of AM? I really enjoyed this game. To be honest 
 i haven't played it when it came out for many reasons. A month ago though i found it and bought 
 without second thought. A classic masterpiece for your collection. I don't understand why it was 
 so underappreciated but i think it has to give something new.

Review:  It's seriously underrated by gamespot. 4.3????? It has sinister atmosphere, great dialogue ( unfortunately 
 very poor voice acting from a few characters) and it kept me playing it although I had better things 
 to do. Absolutely incredible &amp; intelligent story that made me actualy think of the game world 
 as a plausible apocalypse of our civilisation. Graphics: I am playing it for the first time in 
 march 2007, but the background graphics still look nice. The character models are kinda crappy 
 even for when the game was released. However, overall the game looks good.
  
  Sound: Voice acting varies from nice to very very poor ( Dr Nazi is the champion) . Music is fantastic 
 and gives the game 75 % of the overall atmosphere.
  
  Gameplay: on an WIN XP machine it's hard to get this to work properly. framerate is not so good 
 and a lot of bugs, still the story and atmosphere keep it very playable and addictiuve. I actualy 
 finished the game in just 3 sessions. I recommend it to everyone. I found out about this on a top 
 10 scariest games of all time. It wasn't scary at all, it's more like a psychological game with 
 a lot of subtleties but I am very happy I played it.

Review:  "I Have No Mouth..." follows classic point and click adventure gaming style. It hits the mark on 
 a few aspects. The visuals are great, and the character and background art are done really well. 
 It does create an uneasy atmosphere through most of the game, and the voice acting is decent. The 
 puzzles will keep you challenged, and the story was quite unique.
  
  You get to play through the story lines of multiple characters, each with their own set of mentally 
 dysfunctional baggage. You'll also have to play through the fears of each individual to progress 
 through the game, until all their paths converge at the end.
  
  As fantastic as all of this sounds, I did find some of the puzzles a little cumbersome to work 
 through, without a lot of lead as to what to do next. And when you finally figure out what to do 
 next, it's more of a feeling of confusion then satisfaction. The ending was also a little anti-climactic.
 
  
  Definite points for mood and artistic value, though.

Review:  I consider Harlan Ellison to be my favorite writer, and learning about this game a year or two 
 ago was quite a surprise.
  Based on the phenomenal short story of the same name, I Have No Mouth has a original premise (that 
 is, it was original, until every single thing else in existence fought to rip off the entire man 
 vs. machine plotline) . The story begins with the Cold War escalating into a massive world-scale 
 event, afterwards, a dedicated assembly of human scientests create a few MASSIVE super-computers, 
 known as AM. 
  In this game, it picks up with the same plot as the novel, five humans are trapped in the super-computer, 
 as all the different AM machines had wiped out the rest of humanity. The machine keeps these five 
 humans as its cruel amusement, and a outlet for it's never ending hate for the race of humanity. 
 While the ending is certainly several times more optimistic than the one of the written work, some 
 things in the game just don't make much sense.
  Why for example are there so many bizarre puzzles? Many of them are challenging and unique in their 
 own right, but there are so many that just don't make any logical sense. For example, why does 
 one character need to flush a toilet three times to open a door? Although that may seem minor, 
 it become regularly frustrating to stumble upon a wide variety of these, only to spend a hour or 
 so trying to divine the solution, then when you actually solve it you bang your head on the wall 
 for the sheer stupidity of it.
  One thing that interests me about this game is that the actual supercomputer AM is voiced by sir 
 Harlan Ellison himself. While his performance isn't bad, there are some bizarre inconsistencies 
 when it comes to the subtitles and the voice-overs themselves, which do not always match, or sometimes 
 even stray wildly from eachother.
  
  The graphics in I Have No Mouth are to put it straighly, weird. The areas are very well designed 
 and the sound goes hand in hand with the surroundings to make a very atmospheric and creepy environment. 
 But despite the quality of the backgrounds, animations and character sprites suffer. The character 
 art is at best tepid, and some of the animations look chunky and unnatural, like the actors are 
 forced to walk around with a uncomfortable steel pipe shoved tween their buttocks.
  Although I enjoyed it immensely for it's story, and some of the challenging puzzles, its flaws 
 might shoo away some possible Adventure fans. Although certainly not the best there is, it's still 
 worth checking out, just to see what a mind can conceive, if not executed in the best fashion.
