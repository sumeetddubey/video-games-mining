:::Review:::
If you have ever owned an Amiga and said to yourself, "They don't make games like that anymore," 
 Cylindrix is for you. 

 Back in the golden age of PC gaming (before Electronic Arts) , most games were created not by monolithic 
 corporations, but by small groups of dedicated hackers. These pioneers stressed innovative gameplay 
 over flashy graphics, and created some of the finest games ever made. Given the incredible cost 
 and manpower required to produce a modern video game, many industry insiders question whether it 
 is still possible for a small, independent publisher to create a commercially viable game. Perhaps 
 in response to this question, the small development team called Hotwarez has created a game that 
 delivers an innovative and entertaining gaming experience reminiscent of the golden age: Cylindrix. 
   

 As with the games of old, Cylindrix's only real strength lies in its original gameplay. In fact, 
 almost every element of Cylindrix is a new twist on a traditional gaming concept. Perhaps the most 
 creative of these is the shape of the playing field itself. Unlike traditional combat shooters, 
 Cylindrix offers a playing surface wrapped into a three dimensional cylinder (similar to those 
 found in Arthur C. Clark's "Rama" novels) . While this twist may seem rather gimmicky at first, 
 the unique layout of the battlefield actually has a fundamental influence on the play of the game. 
   

 In addition to the unusual playing surface, Cylindrix boasts innovations in the gameplay itself. 
 Unlike most first-person shooters, this title requires a player to develop complex team coordination 
 skills (as well as fast reflexes) in order to win consistently. Much of this team strategy involves 
 the "energy pylons" scattered across the play area. Put simply, each cylindrical battle field is 
 littered with a fixed number of rectangular pylons that change color if touched. The more pylons 
 are aligned with your team's color, the more powerful your weapons become. Since a lone hovertank 
 can decimate an entire team if all the pylons are "aligned" with his color, each team must strive 
 to maintain a favorable pylon balance - and prevent their enemy from doing the same. To accomplish 
 this goal, commanders must assign each of their wingmen a task on the battlefield. For example, 
 you may order one to "Get Pylons" and the other to "Attack Enemy Ships"- leaving the player to 
 concentrate on attacking the enemy base. Knowing which commands to issue, and when to issue them, 
 is the key to victory on the battlefield.  

 While Cylindrix's gameplay may be exceptional, the graphics and overall presentation are not. While 
 the vehicles and landscapes are composed entirely of polygons, there is not a single texture map 
 in sight. To make matters worse, each object is composed of one and only one color. This may have 
 been acceptable in the golden age, but most modern gamers will prefer a little more visual excitement. 

 In conclusion, if you have ever owned an Amiga and said to yourself, "They don't make games like 
 that anymore," Cylindrix is for you. Its innovative and entertaining gameplay make it a jewel in 
 the rough. Unfortunately, the rather plain graphics and unsophisticated presentation may put off 
 gamers who place a high priority on packaging.
