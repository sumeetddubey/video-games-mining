It's easily the game of choice for football fanatics who want to micromanage every aspect of their 
 favorite teams' operations. 

  To the casual pro football fan, it would seem there's not a whole lot worth paying attention to 
 between the end of the Super Bowl and the start of training camps in the summer. Sure, the draft 
 can be exciting, especially now that ESPN and sports-talk radio shows have decided to dedicate 
 a week's worth of coverage (or more) to it. Other than that, though, the sports world is dominated 
 by hoops, hockey, and baseball from late January to June. But the truth is that it's during the 
 gloomy days of winter and early spring that winning franchises are built: Coaches are hired and 
 fired, scouts put rookies under the microscope at the NFL combine, contracts are renegotiated to 
 meet salary cap constraints, and longtime veterans ponder retirement. And it's precisely these 
 sorts of things that lie at the heart of Front Office Football 2001, the long-awaited sequel to 
 1999's Front Office Football from independent publisher Solecismic Software. Published by EA Sports 
 and available only via download, this text-based sim features several noticeable enhancements on 
 the formula established by its predecessor, and it's easily the game of choice for football fanatics 
 who want to micromanage every aspect of their favorite teams' operations.           Front Office 
 Football 2001 is great for hard-core football enthusiasts    

 Despite the name, Front Office Football 2001 kicks off with the 2000 season. You can begin your 
 career with rosters from last summer or create entirely new rosters through a player allocation 
 draft. This is a godsend for fans of teams like the Bengals or Chargers, who can't work themselves 
 out of the depths of awfulness in a single season -- just prioritize the various types of players 
 (quarterbacks, defensive linemen, linebackers, running backs, and so on) and cross your fingers 
 as the draft begins. Though preseason games are when roster cuts are being made, there's no way 
 to access statistics for these outings -- you instead must scroll through your roster and take note 
 of the ratings in a variety of attributes when making your decisions.   

  This is obviously a minor point for users who let their scout (only one) and coach (also only one) 
 manage their roster and depth charts, but even higher-paid cyberassistants can give you strange 
 feedback. For example, after Daunte Culpepper went 21 for 29 with three touchdown passes and had 
 a passer rating of 119.3 in a game, the scout reported that he was "fairly concerned" about my 
 starting quarterback. This was a warning he repeated throughout the year even though Culpepper 
 finished fourth in QB rating at the end of the season. In short, you should jump in and get your 
 hands dirty with everything from molding the depth chart to creating offensive and defensive game 
 plans.   

  Speaking of game plans, you'll find you can craft quite a comprehensive strategy for your team 
 to follow. Should you feel up to the task, you can set an impressive array of parameters: How frequently 
 you'll run or pass based on down and distance, how often your offense will run at each of the seven 
 holes (left tackle, left end, center, and so on) , passing distances, blitz frequency, types of 
 pass coverage, offensive formations, and much more. There are still some problems -- for instance, 
 the game doesn't differentiate between 11 yards to go for a first down as opposed to 20 or more, 
 and there's no provision to change playcalling tendencies when the ball's in the shadow of your 
 goalpost -- but all in all, the system works pretty well. And should watching the text-based play-by-play 
 reveal that bad decisions are being made, there's an option to jump in and call the plays yourself. 
   

  As in real-life football management, the biggest challenge in Front Office Football 2001 isn't 
 creating a solid game plan or even putting together a winner for a single season -- it's trying to 
 maintain a level of excellence over the years while staying under the salary cap. To do this, you'll 
 have to scour the wire for free-agent bargains, coax other teams into trades, and renegotiate salaries 
 with veteran players. The trading model has been vastly improved for this edition, letting you 
 offer a combination of up to five players and draft picks. You're also responsible for adjusting 
 ticket prices and making pitches for stadium renovations, and if things really start going south, 
 you can try to move your franchise to a new location.           The game's interface can be a little 
 intimidating    

 Perhaps the only thing holding Front Office Football back from true greatness is its interface. 
 Rather than having menu selections at the top of the display like you'll find in every other Windows 
 application, for some reason, they're found at the bottom. It's very disorienting, as is the fact 
 that individual windows can't be maximized to fill the entire screen. It's irritating enough that 
 you must scroll like mad to view all the available free agents, but reading a scouting report crammed 
 into a teeny box can be especially frustrating. To be fair, scouting reports can be printed out -- but 
 it'd be much easier to simply maximize the window and see all the info at once. The interface does 
 everything it's supposed to, but after wrestling with it for several days, you can't help but get 
 the feeling that more could have been done to guide you through the myriad of tasks you face.  

  You'll find a few other anomalies as you stick with the game -- a fullback missing 10 weeks because 
 of "tobacco withdrawal syndrome," a team with a 14-2 regular season record sending only one player 
 to the all-pro team, and no options of any kind for multiplayer games -- but the good news is that 
 Front Office Football 2001 is so engrossing that this won't bother you one bit. If you don't mind 
 rolling up your sleeves and investing some serious time in learning all of this game's nuances, 
 you'll undoubtedly get your money's worth and then some out of Front Office Football 2001.
