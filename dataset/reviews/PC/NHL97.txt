:::Review:::
NHL 97 is one of the most downright exciting sports titles I've ever played. 

 It's got some pretty steep system requirements, and its numerous bugs and questionable design decisions 
 can lead to some frustrating moments. But in spite of it all, NHL 97 is one of the most downright 
 exciting sports titles I've ever played.  

 What makes NHL 97 so much fun are its stunning graphics and jaw-dropping animations. It's hard to 
 imagine players more lifelike in appearance than those you'll find here, at least in a PC-based 
 sim, and the animations are even better: when these guys skate, shoot, check, and block shots, 
 you'd almost swear you were watching a match on TV. Subtle touches abound, from glove saves to 
 poke checks - every time I play, I spot something new.  

 All NHL teams are included - thanks to the game's NHLPA license, all the player names and stats 
 are accurate - along with national teams from the U. S., Canada, Russia, Scandinavia, and Europe; 
 play modes include exhibitions, seasons (of variable length) , and playoffs. If you want to keep 
 your roster current, there's an option to trade, re-assign, and create players. The interface for 
 doing all this stuff could be a little more intuitive, but once you've gotten accustomed to it 
 you'll be breezing through the menus with no problem.   

 Various features for toggling rules, injuries and fatigue, and period length mean you can make NHL 
 97 as real as you like. Don't feel like dealing with line changes? Then set it to automatic and 
 let the computer handle the job (and it does it pretty well, too) . Or if you're in the mood for 
 an arcade-style shootout, turn off line changes and penalties, along with offsides and two-line 
 pass rules, and get ready for truly brutal nonstop action.  

 One of my favorite features is the play-by-play announcer (only available in the 16MB version) . 
 Though his commentary tends to lag slightly behind the onscreen action, it's still very good, one 
 of the few play-by-play features I've ever bothered to leave on in a sports game. My favorite lines 
 are "He's got the puck on a string!", a breathless "He carries it right out in front," and - of 
 course - "He SHOOTS!" Some users have reported oddities in the commentary such as garbled speech, 
 incorrect names, constant repetitions of certain words, and more, but I've played the game for 
 many hours and about the only problem I ran into was the delay in the commentary I mentioned before. 
   

 Make no mistake: I love playing this game. But several problems keep it from being all it could 
 have been. Passing in earlier editions of this series was probably too easy, but now it's much 
 too difficult - even a short pass from a center to a wingman is likely to go astray. Scoring, too, 
 is harder: I've seen computer-controlled goalies shut me out when I've taken 50 or even 60 shots 
 (and these weren't hopeless slapshots from impossible angles, either) .   

 Though NHL 97 supports the Gravis GRIP (up to eight players can compete using the GRIP, four per 
 side) only two buttons are used, and because the same button is used for checking and shooting 
 you'll see a lot of accidental icings. (Speaking of icing , the computer-controlled teams do it 
 way too much, slowing down gameplay unnecessarily.) Even more odd is that the two buttons that 
 ARE supported on the GRIP are the two "paddles" at the top of the pad - strange, considering there 
 are six buttons more conveniently located on the pad. Another problem with two-button support is 
 that on offense you have to constantly tap the directional pad to speed up, resulting in a weary 
 thumb and near-impossible "steering" during acceleration. Finally, NHL 97 doesn't work with any 
 processor but a true Pentium, a situation that's caused owners of Cyrix and other "clone" chips 
 to raise such an uproar that EA is currently working on a patch.  

 But there's so much fun to be had here, especially playing against a human opponent, that I can 
 overlook the problems. That doesn't mean I don't think EA shouldn't address the issues, but it 
 does mean that even with all its flaws the game is still a real blast. As a matter of fact, I think 
 it's time for a face-off right about now....

Review:  While NHL 96 was a very good hockey sim, the new game of the series, aka NHL 97 is debuting with 
 some more flair, as no serious problems will stand in your way. The graphics are even better than 
 they were before, detailing more animations in the rink. The game comes along with great music, 
 commentary and of course a detailed sound of what is going on inside the stadium. There is great 
 authenticity with many updated rosters and also the ability to trade or create new players. Nevertheless, 
 there is a serious problem recurring: for once more you will hardly score big, more than two goals, 
 even if you shot like a cannon. With this it comes the AI's lack of creativity in lower difficulty 
 levels, and its supernatural accuracy in the hardest ones. Despite these problems, don't miss the 
 chance to try this game: you will regret it.
