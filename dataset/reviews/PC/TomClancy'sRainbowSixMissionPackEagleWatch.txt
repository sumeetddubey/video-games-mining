:::Review:::
Multiplayer fiends, of course, will have a field day and should remain satisfied until someone comes 
 along with a nifty mod (like the "NATO" patch) or the sequel hits the shelves. 

 There is no doubt that Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six was, quite simply, a blast to play one time through. 
 But then the fun faded, not only because there was a limited number of missions to play, but because 
 the weapon types seemed to be lacking, the artificial intelligence was odd (to say the least) , 
 and multiplayer games became stale after a few goes. Despite a number of user-created mods and 
 the ability to change the game mechanics to your liking, Rainbow Six still felt like a game with 
 a limited life span.  

 Red Storm Entertainment's answer, for now, is Eagle Watch, a brand-new mission pack for Rainbow 
 Six. First and foremost, the mission pack contains a new five-mission campaign that takes place 
 in various famous landmarks, such as Big Ben and the Taj Mahal. The missions run from moderate 
 to hard in difficulty and do not differ from the mission structure in Rainbow Six. There is little 
 variety or randomness to the missions (no need to pack heartbeat sensors on these trips - they 
 are already "planted" on each of the missions) , and you won't have to do any planning either - 
 default mission plans are already included.  

 The missions also include four new operatives to employ, as well as three new weapons (the H&amp; K 
 G36K and G3A3 assault rifles and the .50 caliber Desert Eagle pistol) and two new training levels. 
 A nice small touch is the inclusion of a "full watch" feature, which allows you to plan and execute 
 a mission without actually having to control any of the operatives.  

 The big plus in the mission pack is the inclusion of six new types of multiplayer games, including 
 assassin (each team escorts its general while trying to kill off the other teams' generals) , scatter 
 (you begin the game scattered throughout the map) , scatter assassin, team terrorist hunt (your 
 team must kill more than half the terrorists on the map to win) , scatter team terrorist hunt, and 
 save the base (each team must defuse a bomb in the other bases) . Like Rainbow Six you'll need someone 
 acting as a server online, or you can get on the MSN Gaming Zone or Mplayer to find a game.   

 
 These new multiplayer games add the variety that Rainbow Six sorely needed. Scatter is the best 
 and most challenging mode and is recommended for those interested in cooperative play. Terrorist 
 hunt is a fast-paced race-against-time-style shooting match to see who can kill the majority of 
 the terrorists (or each other) first. Quake aficionados will prefer save the base, a variation 
 on capture the flag or team fortress, which requires you to enter your enemies' bases while defending 
 your own. And assassin can be fun but surprisingly difficult, since it is normally quite easy to 
 kill people in Rainbow Six.  

 For the most part, the multiplayer modes work, and there don't seem to be too many problems with 
 crashing servers, though of course the connection speed matters a great deal. Unfortunately, that 
 is about all Eagle Watch has to offer. Eagle Watch adds absolutely nothing else to the Rainbow 
 Six mix except a little more of the same, more or less. None of the major complaints with Rainbow 
 Six were fixed (such as moronic AI and superaccurate terrorists) , and those interested in the single-player 
 game will be left with very little to cheer about. Multiplayer fiends, of course, will have a field 
 day and should remain satisfied until someone comes along with a nifty mod (like the "NATO" patch) 
 or the sequel hits the shelves.

Review:  Send your team out on maneuvers that you call. Free the captives without losses. Come home safe 
 and become a hero. Yeah. This game was fun at first until other members of my squad were killed 
 off. Maybe I made the wrong call but either way I had to complete the mission solo. That's why 
 I like "Splinter Cell" or James Bond type of games cause you depend on yourself from the get go. 
 Courses are not complex till you get to the middle of the game then everything changes. Never completed 
 the game because I got frustrated with my team dying and me having to do their part to complete 
 the underlined task. Then the pc seem like it went on a mission and got killed in the process. 
 One day I'll load it up on the pc I have now. Better yet I need to get myself a Gaming PC like 
 I said I would. Didn't play too many Tom Clancy games but this one is recommended for play.

Review:  Eagle Watch is a satisfactory expansion pack for Rainbow Six. It contains 5 new missions that are 
 a little more complex than those of the original and they take place in real world locations. It 
 has the additions of new weapons and few new characters. However, these new additions do not add 
 too much to the single-player experience at all due to the lack of a story. Instead, they add to 
 the multiplayer experience especially with the inclusion of 6 new multiplayer game types. The technical 
 aspects are on par with the original and therefore also harbour the same hurdles and annoyances. 
 I would only recommend this to the die-hard fans of the multiplayer component of the original. 
 But since 2 proper sequels are already out, there is little point in buying Eagle Watch.
