Even veteran adventurers can expect 20 hours or more of gameplay from Atlantis, but that's only because 
 of the sorry save-game feature and the obtuse puzzles. 

 If you'd asked me what I thought of Atlantis: The Lost Tales after my first couple of hours playing 
 it, I'd have said it was the best graphic adventure I'd played in a long time and I was really 
 looking forward to getting deeper into it. But you'd have heard a very different song if you'd 
 hit me with the same question just a few gameplay hours later - one whose chorus would go something 
 like "Why? Why? Why?" because there's simply no excuse for several of the problems.   

 Set on the eponymous mythical (or not-so-mythical, depending on your source) island, Atlantis: The 
 Lost Tales puts you in the sandals of an orphan named Seth who's been chosen to serve as a Companion 
 to Atlantis' queen, Rhea. Companions normally get to gallivant around the island with the Queen 
 on foot or in huge airborne boats called fliers, but as soon as Seth arrives he learns that Rhea 
 has mysteriously disappeared and nearly all her Companions have been murdered by parties unknown 
 while on one of those jaunts.  

 Since Atlantis has always had a queen, this is pretty shocking stuff for the Atlanteans - except 
 for the palace guards, that is, who are under the command of the Queen's Consort, Creon. They're 
 in charge of the investigation into the Queen's disappearance, and when Seth tries to do a little 
 sleuthing on his own he's warned by Creon to mind his own business. It doesn't take very long to 
 figure out that Creon has his own ideas about how Atlantis should be run - and that he should play 
 a preeminent role in the new world order. It's up to you to find Rhea, uncover Creon's plot, and 
 stop him from carrying it out.  

 It's a very good setting for a graphic adventure, and Cryo's fleshed it out with extremely handsome 
 graphics and a New-Agey musical score that sets the mood quite nicely. The interface is based on 
 a proprietary technology called Omni 3D, which lets you look pretty much anywhere you like so long 
 as you're not moving. (That's because you move by clicking on a directional arrow and then follow 
 a predetermined path, a la Myst and a host of other games.)  

 But after oohing and aahing at the graphics and enjoying interacting with several characters in 
 the game - something that's been sorely missing from many recent adventures - I began to learn 
 the downside to being a Queen's Companion. The first is that there are no saved games: Your progress 
 is stored automatically in "episodes." What this means is that you might have to travel through 
 five, ten, or even a dozen screens over and over again to get back to the place you left off by 
 dying in the game or simply exiting the program. Like I said, the graphics are good - but they're 
 not so good that I want to see the same dozen screens over and over again just because I'm having 
 a problem with a certain puzzle or obstacle.   

 Next up on the boo-boo list: no pause function. Once I had to answer the phone while Creon lectured 
 Seth, but the only way to stop the dialogue was to skip it entirely - so when I returned I found 
 that I had to answer yes or no to a question I hadn't heard, which meant playing the episode from 
 the start again.   

 Then there's the Omni 3D interface. Yes, it's nice to be able to look all around you, but because 
 you're supposed to be moving your head there's no cursor to place over objects to pick them up. 
 Instead, you must center an object you want to manipulate in the exact center of the screen. I 
 needed to pick up a knife dropped by a guard I'd just knocked out, but after looking at the ground 
 where the knife lay and not seeing the "grab" icon appear I just assumed I couldn't take it. If 
 you think about it, it's like moving the screen around your cursor rather than moving a cursor 
 around the screen.  

 The frustrations don't end there, though. There are several time-based puzzles that use the "go 
 the right way at the right time" design philosophy, most of which lead to death or captivity for 
 Seth at least the first four or five times you try them because things are happening so fast that 
 you have to use trial and error rather than logic and observation to figure out which way to go. 
 While the minimalist interface pulls the plow well enough for most of the game, there are a couple 
 of sequences where you're supposed to do something that's not explained in the manual: A prime 
 example is when you have to start a conversation with a character even though the "talk" icon doesn't 
 appear when you look at him (on a related note, the voice-acting ranges from competent to downright 
 amateurish) .  

 There's a host of logic puzzles that must be solved, and as with most games that rely heavily on 
 these types of puzzles, they're scattered about the game like confetti at a parade: Just because 
 you slap an "Atlantean" graphic on a sliding puzzle or a levers-and-pulleys machine doesn't explain 
 why a game character whipped out the thing for you to solve in the first place.  

 But the apex of bad game design comes near the end with the notorious Crab Race. Here's the deal: 
 you pick a crab (trial and error again!) and race another guy's crab in a best-of-five series - 
 and you MUST watch every race from start to finish because if you don't you'll lose even if you 
 picked the right crab!   

 Even veteran adventurers can expect 20 hours or more of gameplay from Atlantis, but that's only 
 because of the sorry save-game feature and the obtuse puzzles. How obtuse, you ask? Well, I'll 
 put it this way: This is the first time I've seen a company post the entire walk-though for a game 
 on its web site as soon as it hit store shelves.  

 Atlantis will undoubtedly garner a few fans, but don't let that fool you into shelling out money 
 for this game - unless you're working on a new graphic adventure and want some pointers on what 
 not to do.

Review:  When I first started playing this game, I really felt like I was in this magical world! The graphics 
 are superb for its time and the music is just beautiful. The game as you expect from its genre (adventure) 
 is full of puzzles. At first, you'll find them interesting and challenging but after playing a 
 couple more hours, you just feel like you are about to crack! They really get annoying.... but after 
 all, this is the whole purpose of the game, puzzle solving!
  
  Again as most adventure games, once you played the game, u completely lose interest and you even 
 forget having the game. But for serious gamers, Atlantis should be in your collection. It's a classic! 
 I will recommend playing it even now!

Review:  I liked this game very much. It is not the typical game, where you are stopped, and the enemies 
 have a knife in their hands and then you have to pick your way, or select an item to use. In this 
 game, the knife is moving and you have little seconds of life. Also, there are many interactions 
 similar to this, which are great! The graphics are impressive, similar to those of Myst. The music 
 is creative and relaxing, or full of suspense in other parts. But, the game's end and some parts 
 are sort of complex, so a open and smart mind is needed for that parts. And finally, drum roll 
 everybody, this game is LONG!!!!!!!

Review:  People always come to me when I play this game and tell me:
  "This Game Sucks! How can you play such Crap!" Then I simply tell them that this Game got a good 
 story, good voice actors, good graphics (for an Adventure game of 1997: VERY GOOD graphics) and 
 some of the most wonderful moments a game could ever have...
  The story is about a man named Seth (correct spelling?) on his way to Atlantis to serve as the 
 Queens Royal Followers, When suddenly the Queen is kidnapped by someone "possible Barbarians" the 
 guards said.
  There are not much to explain but Im telling you this: You Should Play This Game! I played through 
 this game twice in a row so I could relive it all.
