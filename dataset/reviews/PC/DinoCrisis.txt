Though it has some startling moments and a few fun sections, it's mostly just a mediocre version 
 of a mediocre game. 

 Capcom's Resident Evil was released on the PlayStation in January of 1996. The game popularized 
 a new genre, which video game players call "survival horror" and PC game players call "Alone in 
 the Dark clones." Dino Crisis was one of the many games that followed the Resident Evil formula 
 to the letter - its main selling point being that it was from the same designers. Almost a year 
 and a half after its release on the PlayStation, Dino Crisis has been released for the PC. And 
 though it has some startling moments and a few fun sections, it's mostly just a mediocre version 
 of a mediocre game.   

  The primary difference between Dino Crisis and Resident Evil is the story. Whereas Resident Evil 
 took its setting and its story from Night of the Living Dead, Dino Crisis takes its setting and 
 story from Jurassic Park. You play as Regina, part of a military rescue team sent to a top secret 
 research facility to investigate an accident. The facility, in which a new form of energy is being 
 researched, is located on an island. Something has gone wrong, and the island has been overrun 
 with dinosaurs. In fact, the plot is so much like Jurassic Park that late in the game, one of your 
 teammates exclaims, "It's just like that movie!" Your team isn't much help, needless to say.   
 

  Other than the story, the game is identical to Resident Evil. You run around the research facility 
 while picking up items, shooting things (dinosaurs, in this case) , and solving puzzles. The game 
 is played from a third-person perspective, and the camera angles change to create suspense. As 
 in most games that borrow the concept of Alone in the Dark's cinematic camera angles, much of the 
 suspense in Dino Crisis comes from the fact that you simply can't get a good look at things that 
 are attacking you. Unfortunately, the winding, narrow corridors of the facility aggravate this 
 issue and can make the combat frustrating. You'll be grateful for the few scenes in the game in 
 which the camera actually trails behind you.   

  The graphical problems of Dino Crisis are made worse by the fact that the game does little to take 
 advantage of the superior PC hardware. It looks like an old PlayStation game. The characters are 
 blocky, and the backgrounds are pixilated almost beyond recognition at times. Furthermore, the 
 backgrounds occasionally slightly shake, and textures move like liquid. This irritating effect 
 is not unlike the jittery animation found in the cartoon show Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist, 
 and it may make you take those epilepsy warnings seriously.   

  Like Resident Evil, the course of Dino Crisis is basically a series of door puzzles interrupted 
 by the occasional fight scene. The door puzzles in this case are uniformly easy - when you find 
 the key to open a new area, it will be very obvious where to go next. And where Resident Evil would 
 often give you some sort of exciting sequence to break up the monotony, Dino Crisis doesn't give 
 you much to do other than run around the facility looking for keys and codes to open new areas. 
 The worst parts are the crate-pushing puzzles. For some reason, Regina can push a crate only once, 
 and once it's pushed, it's stuck in its new locale. One crate-oriented maze in the latter section 
 of the game can actually become a premature end, and the weird save-game function (you can save 
 only when leaving certain rooms) makes the game's occasional dead ends all the more frustrating. 
   

  The combat isn't much better than the puzzles. The dinosaurs act exactly like the zombies from 
 Resident Evil, only they're faster. Shoot them a few times, and they'll fall down. But they might 
 get back up again! This behavior makes sense in the undead, but it's less creepy with a big lizard. 
 You'll also notice very few distinct types of dinosaurs. Your primary opponent is always the same 
 dino, a sort of generic large lizard-looking thing. And while your first encounter with a Tyrannosaurus 
 will give you a good start, your second and third probably won't. Besides, you don't actually need 
 to kill these beasts - you can always just run around until an escape route opens.   

  Had Capcom decided to put more effort into a PC version of Dino Crisis, the game would have been 
 slightly better. It would certainly look better, and all the standard problems with video-game-to-PC 
 translations, like the absence of a save-anywhere function, would have been absent. But it's doubtful 
 that Dino Crisis would have been more fun. The problem with Dino Crisis is that even though it 
 is an exact replica of Resident Evil, it lacks the creepy atmosphere that made Resident Evil so 
 popular in spite of its problems. Like Resident Evil, it has bad voice acting and frustrating camera 
 angles. Unlike Resident Evil, it isn't scary. If you love dinosaurs and you love Resident Evil, 
 you'll likely get some satisfaction from Dino Crisis. But those players outside of that limited 
 demographic will find the game to be generic at best.

Review:  We can't play Dino Crisis ignoring the origins it had in the Resident Evil saga. For a moment, 
 Shinji Mikami put away mutant zombies to offer the public a completely new theme: the survival 
 in some tropical island, full of dinosaurs, where new scientific experiments were taking place.
 
  
  Its remembrance to Jurassic Park is remarkable, but Capcom didn't intend to be completely original, 
 rather than just using an already known theme for a game genre that was used to another atmosphere. 
 That change was very welcomed in consoles, so Capcom decided to port the game to PC.
  
  The PC version includes a few changes from the PS version, nothing special to comment, actually. 
 The greatest lack was not to take advantage of the superior hardware the PC had, but we can't say 
 that graphics were horrible, either.
  
  For this game, the developing team decided to create full 3d environments, a big difference from 
 how the Resident Evil saga was in those times. Although there aren't gorgeous environments, the 
 general appeal is solid and it's artistically homogeneous, as we can see in the correct use of 
 lighting and disturbing camera angles (they can also be annoying sometimes) . Characters may look 
 a little blocky, but we must say that polygons were very well put, specially in the model of the 
 main character, Regina.
  
  Gameplay has a right difficulty, but could be a little frustrating some times, due to the fact 
 we must run/walk across the different rooms a lot of times throughout the game.
  
  Without any doubt, a must-have for PlayStation owners, a recommended game for PC owners.

Review:  When people think of Capcom, its either the zombie infested Resident Evil series or the amazing 
 blue boy Megaman. But most people havent heard of Dino Crisis. Its basically a variation of the 
 Resident Evil games, it followed the gameplay and some elements of the series. Although its not 
 as popular as the Resident Evil series it still provide great moments and some fun factor.
  
  Dino Crisis allows you to play as Regina, who is part of a military rescue team sent to investigate 
 a research facility on an island. An accident has occur as a scientist accidentally opens a time 
 portal and transports savage dinosaurs on the island. Its now your team's job to investigate on 
 what happend and capture the mad scientist. But the mission turns quickly into a fight for survival 
 as your being hunted by these savage raptor's. 
  
  The combat system is very much alike Resident Evil style. Though there are puzzles on this game, 
 you will be most likely be busy doing combats on the dinosaurs. Although the game feels more alike 
 Resident Evil, there are some unique aspects on this game. like creating your own weapons like 
 poison darts and tranquilizing darts. You can also defend by kicking a dinosaur, thus giving you 
 time to shoot at it. The A. I is really challenging. if you think dinosaurs have no brain, better 
 think again. These are predators that will hunt you down till the very end. They can follow you 
 into several rooms and if your wounded they can follow the bloodtrail. Though its good to avoid 
 them when they are attacking in group or packs. 
  
  The graphics in the PC isnt much the same. The graphics is like when you play this game in the 
 Playstation. Its very well designed to fit the game perfectly. The character designs is also well 
 created. This is still a Playstation game no matter where it will go the graphics will never change.
 
  The sound on the other hand is very much done. Like in most Resident Evil games, the sound gives 
 you thrill and excitement as you play the game.
  
  In the end, Dino Crisis is a very fun action, survival, horror game. Its not that scary compared 
 to other Resident Evil games, but if you have interest on dinosaurs and love to sovle puzzles then 
 this game is worth playing.
