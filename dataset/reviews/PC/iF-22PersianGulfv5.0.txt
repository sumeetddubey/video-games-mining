:::Review:::
Those who were wary of the initial, flawed release may want to try iF-22 this time around. 

 
 iF-22 was greeted with a resounding chorus of mixed opinions upon release last year. Interactive 
 Magic had been doing well publishing sims like Apache and Hind by UK developer Digital Integration, 
 but with iF-22 it decided to move development in-house and begin work on its own proprietary engine, 
 dubbed DEMON-1. The sim had equal portions of crummy and outstanding elements that are too complex 
 to reiterate here (for a detailed report, see the ) . Short version: good campaign game, flight 
 model, and avionics, bad performance and graphics problems.  

 The good news is that version 5.0 brings iF-22 perilously close to being a quality product, but 
 there are still problems to be resolved. The biggest sticking points in the original release were 
 a host of issues related to graphics. Show-stopping disc access, choppy graphics, muddy terrain, 
 and huge hard drive requirements all conspired to make a good flight engine very difficult to fly. 
 Much of this has been addressed. Terrain files have been pared down to about one-third their previous 
 size. Perspective correction, dithering, and stronger 3D support have been added to smooth the 
 rough spots. Smoke effects are less cartoonish, and translucent smoke has been added for 3D card 
 owners. Disc hits are less frequent and egregious, but they are still there and still cause chopping 
 graphics that interfere with flight maneuvers. It's better, but still not completely there.  

 
 Cockpit and avionics have been tweaked slightly with the addition of Flight Weapons Status and 
 Engine Status MFDs. There's still no moving map display in sight, however. Three new views - bogey 
 padlock, missile padlock, and "free" - are welcome additions and help pilots keep a grip on the 
 situation. Wingman controls are still cumbersome, but wingman performance has gotten a much-needed 
 shot in the arm. Two of the most frustrating radio calls were "My missile's gone stupid!" and "I've 
 gone Winchester!" Both were the result of very stupid wingman AI, which has been largely fixed 
 (as has the annoying overtalking) . They're still not the brightest pennies in the jar, but they're 
 better than they were. Verdict: improved avionics and wingman AI.  

 With the inclusion of the Persian Gulf add-on disc, the total number of theaters is now three, and 
 all feature some of the strongest campaign play and mission structure outside of the Jane's line. 
 Some of the kinks have been worked out of the campaign and mission-planning sections, making them 
 strong examples of what sim developers should aspire to.   

 The final verdict? A good repackaging and enhancement of a promising game. It shows that Interactive 
 Magic is serious about improvements and is well aware of the areas in which improvement is needed. 
 Owners of the original really don't need iF-22 v5.0, since most of the fixes have already been 
 issued in patches, and the Gulf add-on is available separately. But those who were wary of the 
 initial, flawed release may want to try iF-22 this time around. It is by no means perfect, but 
 it is in many ways very interesting.
