:::Review:::
It plays wonderfully, looks absolutely fantastic, and serves up hours upon hours of wicked deep 
 space warfare. 

 Trailing Electronic Arts' release of the disappointing Privateer 2: The Darkening comes the similarly 
 named Darklight Conflict, an excellent 3-D space combat action game that threatens to slip into 
 obscurity. At first glance Darklight Conflict is just another Me Too sci-fi action title, but closer 
 investigation reveals breathtaking 3-D graphics, solid audio, fast-paced gameplay and clever design 
 innovations.  

 The letterboxed, high-resolution combat view screen allows for comfortable peripheral vision and 
 serves to boost the game's frame rate such that it screams on a mid-range Pentium. Gameplay is 
 fast and simple, so while the rudimentary joystick may prove problematic, Darklight Conflict plays 
 wonderfully, even with a keyboard. From the escort missiles, which fly alongside your craft and 
 zero in on any approaching assailants, to the indirect but deadly fragmentation cannon, this game 
 offers a wealth of unique special weapons for you to try - not to mention a very cool targeting 
 system: A trio of 3-D arrows shows you exactly where your opponents are, while your computer automatically 
 calculates the trajectory of the offending spacecraft with respect to your weapons, allowing you 
 to line up your shots just right.  

 Your ship can take serious damage very quickly, so you'll need to get used to using your shields. 
 They have a limited energy supply, and you can't fire your main weapons while your shields are 
 active, so mastering the proper use of these defenses is key. You'll have a chance to pilot several 
 kinds of spacecraft against scores of enemy fighters in over four dozen campaign missions, including 
 a number of useful training scenarios. The missions tend to be furiously direct, and they range 
 from old-fashioned dogfighting fare to search-and-retrieve operations. You can take a break from 
 the heat of battle by browsing the online encyclopedia, which shows off and describes all of the 
 objects you'll encounter in the game. Darklight Conflict packs a lot of action between its campaign, 
 arcade, and six-player network modes, so it'll keep you occupied for a long, long time. And you 
 can bet you'll be gawking at its visuals all the while.  

 The various polygonal spacecraft are beautifully rendered and tastefully texture-mapped. The ships 
 are sleek and aerodynamic, unlike the blocky designs so common to the genre. But as good as they 
 look flying about, they're oh so much more spectacular when they explode; a vanquished fighter 
 detonates in brilliant fireworks, spraying shrapnel in every direction. Dramatic, semi-transparent, 
 colored lighting effects and real-time lens flares the likes of which have never been seen in a 
 PC game make Darklight Conflict nearly as exciting to watch as it is to play. Its audio keeps in 
 beat with the graphics very nicely, with heavy-duty explosions and good mission voice-over, as 
 well as a cool, moody techno soundtrack that captivates but never offends the ears. Darklight Conflict 
 is among the most aesthetically attractive games of its kind. So what's wrong with it, anyway? 

 The fact that it's not touted as part of some big sci-fi franchise like Star Wars or Wing Commander 
 proves a particularly punishing blow to Darklight Conflict. As good as the space fighters and capital 
 ships look, they're completely foreign and take some getting used to. Darklight Conflict is an 
 action game and not a simulation or an epic piece of storytelling, and in consequence it just doesn't 
 have the immediate allure of something like Wing Commander. Regardless, it plays wonderfully, looks 
 absolutely fantastic, and serves up hours upon hours of wicked deep space warfare. If you're looking 
 for rock-solid gameplay, then you mustn't let Darklight Conflict slip through your fingers.

Review:  I picked up the Darklight Conflict right when it came out for a mere $20. Money well spent.
  
  Overall it's your standard space sim, with a good solid storyline, great ship designs and a 
 powerful graphics engine (which I suspect must have been written entirely in assembly, as it BLAZED 
 by other sims of the day, with better graphics and a better framerate) .
  
  What makes this title exceptional was it's gameplay, which was more arcade-like than the norm. 
 You also receive 2 copies of the game for that twenty bucks. Which allows you to give another copy 
 to a friend, and you can deathmatch. I tried this out a few times and it was terrific fun.
  
  I'm sure nowadays however this game won't shine quite as bright as it did back then. I doubt 
 it will even run properly on today's hardware as well, as it was a DOS4GW game and totally made 
 for that environment (though at it's peak, right before everyone started making games for Win95) .
 
  
  If you do get a chance to try this, and it works, you're in for a fun little time though. Enjoy.
