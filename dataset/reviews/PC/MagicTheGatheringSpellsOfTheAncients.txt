:::Review:::
With a price tag of around thirty bucks, Spells of the Ancients is an expansion pack that promises 
 a lot of power for a moderate price. 

 Players of the computerized Magic: The Gathering have been waiting for this. MicroProse has finally 
 released Spells of the Ancients, the first expansion set for Magic, and it's a top-notch add-on 
 that every MtG player should own.  

 The most obvious addition is the 138 new cards, culled from the Unlimited, Arabian Nights, and Antiquities 
 sets. These are the earliest published sets of the Magic card game, and contain some very rare 
 cards. MicroProse has also included six promotional cards that are among the rarest of all Magic 
 cards ever printed. Cards from these early expansion sets are some of the most powerful around 
 and can quickly boost the force of your deck.   

 While some developers would consider this alone enough for an expansion pack, MicroProse goes even 
 further - using the add-on to give Magic a much-needed facelift. Spells of the Ancients upgrades 
 Magic: The Gathering to version 2.0 and fixes several of the problems found in the original. SotA 
 revamps the clunky interface, improving aesthetics as well as usability and simplicity. There is 
 also a "Face Builder" utility that allows you to create your own persona. Sounds like a neat idea, 
 but it actually boils down to flipping through tons of clip art, which does little but change color. 
 Perhaps the coolest new feature is the addition of sealed-deck tournament play. In the sealed-deck 
 tournament, you must build a deck from unopened Starter Decks and Booster Packs chosen from the 
 various sets. You can then challenge up to thirty-one other AI players using your new deck.   

 
 The game itself hasn't changed, but several improvements have been added to improve gameplay. Version 
 2.0 is much more stable than previous versions and I suffered no crashes. It is also easier to 
 avoid combat in the wilderness, making the campaign mode much less tedious. MicroProse has even 
 updated the computer AI, and your computer opponents rarely make obvious flubs.  

 Even with all of these additions, MicroProse still has not included multiplay ability in this new 
 upgrade package. However, a ManaLink coupon that promises multiplay action over the Internet is 
 included with the game. When ManaLink becomes available (which should be sometime in November) , 
 MicroProse will send registered purchasers of SotA the first copies via electronic transfer.  

 
 With a price tag of around thirty bucks, Spells of the Ancients is an expansion pack that promises 
 a lot of power for a moderate price. New cards, improved features, and sealed-deck tournaments 
 should keep Magic: The Gathering fans busy for a while - and after ManaLink is released, perhaps 
 eternity.

Review:  It must be very strange for anyone to write a review for this uncommon game 10 years later. For 
 me... the fact is... I'm still playing it! Haha! Yes, I'm a fan of the card game and I can't get 
 enough of the only single player version in pc format. Just happens that I'm now diligent enough 
 to share my views on this game with the rest of you out there.
  
  Well, other than over 130 new cards from the Arabian Nights (Mr Juzam!) , Antiquities (Library of 
 Alex) , and the Unlimited (dual-lands) expansion sets, there is also the crowd pleasing Sealed Deck 
 Tournament generator. Open virtual boosters and decks without the pain of emptying your purse! 
 Yup, that's a cool addition. Also, the AI is tougher and there are over 50 new pre-built decks 
 for your 1-on-1 matches.
  
  Shandalar is still the same, except for the addition of the new cards. Graphics and music are untouched, 
 and that's a good thing, cos the music's still great to listen to.
