:::Review:::
If all you're looking for in a baseball sim are handsome graphics and a good interface when playing 
 in action mode, VR Baseball gives you everything you want. 

 The first thing most hardball fans do when they fire up a new baseball sim is try their hand at 
 an exhibition game - and in the case of VR Baseball that means they'll get to see the best parts 
 first. Provided you've got a 3D card, the graphics and animation in the game's action mode are 
 some of the best yet in a baseball sim (though I did notice a major drop in performance when using 
 a Verite 1000-based 3D card as opposed to a 3Dfx-based accelerator) .  

 All 28 MLB stadiums from the 1997 season are accurately modeled here, and shadows for all objects 
 (including pitched and hit balls) add that extra oomph of realism to make you feel like you're 
 out on the field. Player animations are extremely smooth and lifelike: Batters tap the plate with 
 their bats, outfielders can dive or leap to make a catch, and runners slide to beat out a throw. 
 About the only graphical shortcoming is that except for various shades of skin color, no efforts 
 have been made to distinguish individual players: Everyone's got the same Quake-style face, and 
 you won't find any signature sartorial stylings such as Chipper Jones' knee-high socks.  

 VR Baseball continues the winning ways of its action mode by offering a high level of control. Up 
 to six joystick or gamepad buttons are supported, and you can configure them as you like. What's 
 more, you're able to affect pitch location using the stick or gamepad's directional - a lot more 
 satisfying than simply picking a pitch location a la FPS: Baseball Pro '98 and watching the play 
 unfold.  

 On defense, you have the ability to decide each outfielder's position; after a hit deep into the 
 outfield, you can opt for a cutoff throw to the pitcher or shortstop instead of trying to hurl 
 it to a baseman. On offense, you control all base runners, whether sending them for a steal or 
 advancing them on a hit.   

 What this all adds up to is an exciting nine innings at the ballpark. Once you move past the action 
 mode and into the role of general manager, however, you discover that all the good looks and exciting 
 on-field action have apparently come at the cost of any attempt to simulate the vagaries and intricacies 
 of playing a full season.  

 I can overlook the fact that the game uses 1996 statistics despite a December 1997 release date, 
 but considering that all 1996 rosters were pretty much set in stone by August it's dumbfounding 
 that VR Sports couldn't have gone to the trouble of having the announcer use each player's real 
 name when he comes to the plate. Sure, this is supposed to just be the 3D hardware version of the 
 game, but how much time would it have taken to have the announcer say the names?   

 But that's a trifle compared with the other stuff missing here. Let's say you actually want to put 
 in the hours and play out each of your team's games in a 162-game season in action mode. Want to 
 check out how many pitches your starter's thrown or access some type of fatigue meter to see how 
 he's holding up? Tough - there's no way to see how tired your pitcher is or even see how many pitches 
 he's thrown. Need to choose the perfect pinch hitter to win the clutch game? Good luck - there 
 aren't any stats to show you how a hitter performs against righties and lefties, a crucial factor 
 in making a substitution in a tight game.   

 In fact, VR Baseball is best summed up in two words: "You can't." You can't view rosters by position, 
 only statistics by name - and if you aren't familiar with every player on every team that's not 
 a big help. You can't move players to different positions - not that it matters, because there 
 are no injuries. Yes, you heard right: No injuries! Want to alter the batting lineup to take advantage 
 of a particular pitcher? The only way you can do it is to play the game out manually. Want to alter 
 the bull pen? Again, you can't unless you play out the game manually.  

 And the sim sins don't end there. Trades are automatic, so you can pawn off the lousiest swatter 
 for Barry Bonds in the blink of an eye. Custom leagues and schedules? Forget it - all you can do 
 is play out the 1997 season (with the previously mentioned encumbrances, of course) , which eliminates 
 any possibility of setting up a 1998 league to accommodate the two new expansion teams.   

 Want to edit a player's stats to reflect his real-life condition? Sorry - you can't. View an instant 
 replay from the nearly infinite viewpoint the game offers? You can't. Want to play someone via 
 modem? You can't. Want to play over a network? You guessed it - you can't.  

 Those last two flaws are almost inexcusable, especially in light of FPS: Baseball Pro's remote league 
 capabilities; when a game released in the last month of 1997 only offers head-to-head play on the 
 same computer, about the only conclusion you can draw is that someone just gave up on the idea 
 of human-versus-human play altogether.  

 If all you're looking for in a baseball sim are handsome graphics and a good interface when playing 
 in action mode, VR Baseball gives you everything you want. Anyone longing for a serious attempt 
 at simulating the trials and tribulations of a World Series championship hunt, though, will walk 
 away from VR Baseball feeling unfulfilled.
