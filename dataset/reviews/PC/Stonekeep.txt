:::Review:::
A game so long in the making, even Stonekeep's supposed cutting-edge technology is dull compared 
 to that of its competitors. 

 In the past, Interplay was considered the premier role-playing game creator with such titles as 
 The Bard's Tale, Wasteland (still an all-time fave o' mine) and Dragon Wars. That was then, this 
 is now. Born out of a rocky history of canceled and revived plans, Stonekeep doesn't measure up 
 to the expectations that other 3-D RPG games have created. Stonekeep is no match for Arena's huge 
 world, System Shock's real environments, or Betrayal at Krondor's rich story. A game so long in 
 the making, even Stonekeep's supposed cutting-edge technology is dull compared to that of its competitors. 

 Stonekeep's out-of-date syndrome extends to its limited movement interface. Sure, it's a first-person 
 game, but there's no real-time, freedom-of-movement 3-D here. Instead, Stonekeep uses a node-based 
 system that moves you from node to node without letting you control the parts in between. Also, 
 you can only turn at right angles. The basic game mechanics are only slightly different than the 
 now 15-year-old original Wizardry on an Apple II!   

 Graphically, Stonekeep supplies some interesting bits. The monsters and non-player folks are done 
 in full motion video, and the even the stones in the walls have a photo-realistic look, but the 
 game's color palette looks dull and dreary. Still, Stonekeep is easy to play, and the addition 
 of neat sound effects supplies a suitable atmosphere. Overall, Stonekeep is a dated first-person 
 RPG that suffers from a poor interface, little depth, and few frills.

Review:  Summer 96, i got this game at a swapmeet for twenty dollars. All I can say is this was an awesome 
 game in its time , It had a corridor take in RPG gameplay. That is a big deal. It is used in games 
 to this day (elder scrolls) , i couldn't believe how few the fanbase was, however. My favorite part 
 was the fairy players, though most thought them to be annoying. I have seen fallout resurrected 
 by bethesda but why dont they reach out for a stonekeep redux or sequel. I think it has been a 
 long time coming. Actually, I think it would be appropriate for Bethesda to pay back the game that 
 broke some new ground in their favor. Wishing to see this again. I leave you, the gaming populous 
 with this, Roses Down and Twice Around! . S

Review:  It's a miracle this game ever got released because it had been delayed so many times, but I for 
 one are glad Interplay finally released it.
  
  The graphics in the game were supposed to be top notch but because of the delays when it came out 
 there were many games with better graphics.
  The NPC's and the monster are in full motion video which for the time was amazing in itself.
 
  
  The sound/music are very impressive and really add to the games atmosphere. 
  In most games the voice acting is terrible but in Stonekeep is actually quite good. I would probably 
 say it's some of the best voice over work i've heard in my 20 years of playing computer games.
 
  
  The control system and party management are so simple even a complete novice (which I was at the 
 time I first played it) can get to grips with it in seconds. 
  
  The game even came with a small novel co-written by the legendary Steve Jackson himself (Fighting 
 Fantasy Role playing books) . The book gave you to basic back story to Stonekeep.
  
  However Stonekeep did have it's problems and one was bugs, it had quite a few. Sometimes certain 
 things in the game that were scripted wouldn't happen or the game would crash etc etc...
  
  All in all buy the game if you see it, it's well worth it from the intro movie (which is still 
 one of the best intros i've ever seen) to the freeing of the gods.
  
  *Does the Faerie players dance* Wahooka Wahooka Wahooka! LOL

Review:  this was one of my fav games of all time!
  the control system used one mouse button for each hand so you could equip two dagger if you wanted 
 to, party management was all done through a "magic mirror" at the top of the screen making it easy 
 to swap items between your party. this lead to the game having few windows cluttering the screen.
 
  the only complaint i would have about this game was that once you had killed all the enemies on 
 a level no re-spawn occurred leaving you in a empty area.
  i heard they were going to make a sequel but this never materialized.

Review:  This game really introduced me to gaming. It was amazing the idea of being an adventurer in Stonekeep. 
 The opening video really set the scene and brought the game to life. The endless quests, riddles, 
 secrets and monsters. The challenge of getting through the levels, the skill involved. A game certainly 
 still worth playing and will take you a long time to complete. You will enjoy it as im sure many 
 people have before.
  
  If you have completed the game you get a great deal of satifaction and its really as if you've 
 spent years trying to get out of the Stonekeep. A classic game.

Review:  THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST PC GAME I EVER PLAYED.
  
  And it was awesome, the graphics were bad though because you couldnt really move correctly and 
 it was all fuzzy. But the sound was alright and the game itself was awesome. This was also my very 
 first RPG. I can really appreciate RPGs since i played that game. I never got to complete it because 
 i got stuck. In the game you would get stuck a lot cuz of riddles and secret buttons on the walls. 
 but this game is absolutely great. if you can find this game still BUY IT. It may be very hard 
 to find because i found it 4 years ago and it was 10 dollars. Try it out if you can find it.
  
  Id give it a total of 8.2/10 GREAT
