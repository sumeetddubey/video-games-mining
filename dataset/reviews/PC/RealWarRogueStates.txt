:::Review:::
Although Rogue States does fix several of Real War's problems, the original game's biggest problems 
 remain. 

 Real War: Rogue States is the follow-up to a pretty bad real-time strategy game. But since there 
 was room for improvement, developer Rival Interactive had a perfect opportunity to go back and 
 address some of the original game's shortcomings, though apparently, the developer didn't take 
 care of all of them. Although Rogue States does fix several of Real War's problems, the original 
 game's biggest problems remain.           Rogue States' missions are loosely based on real-world 
 military campaigns.    

  Last year's Real War had a poor user interface and terrible AI. That game's story involved US military 
 forces going overseas to battle terrorists, and it was notable mainly for its bad timing, since 
 the game was released a few weeks after September 11. The subject matter in Rogue States hasn't 
 changed much. You could certainly say that some of the game's missions -- for example, those involving 
 the use of Apache helicopters to hunt down Scud missiles tipped with biological contaminants -- are 
 timely. And if Ben Affleck can do it in  The Sum of All Fears , then searching through an American 
 city for a nuclear bomb counting down to detonate must be OK for a real-time strategy game. Rogue 
 States' box even borrows President Bush's language about an "axis of evil." However, it's still 
 unsettling, when you're playing Rogue States as the Independence Liberation Army, to load terrorist 
 units into trucks or airplanes and then drive the vehicles into an enemy building for a suicide 
 attack, all the while hearing them confirm the orders in Arabic. It's hard not to find this sort 
 of thing to be in poor taste. It's also hard to believe that most of Rogue States' audio is lifted 
 right from Real War, including the same canned sound effects and the same voicework from  Full 
 Metal Jacket  star R. Lee Erney.   

  Rogue States features two playable factions: the United States and the Independence Liberation 
 Army, an amalgam of terrorist groups with access to heavy weaponry. Although each side has a couple 
 of unique weapons, their arsenals are largely identical. However, Rogue States does add some new 
 units. Both sides get a medic to heal injured infantry units, a flying drone to scout enemy positions, 
 and an amphibious attack transport. Rogue States also has some new planes, including a hardy C-130 
 gunship, the B2 stealth bomber, and some advanced fighters. The most notable additions are the 
 new base defenses, including rocket, machine gun, antiair, and artillery emplacements. More than 
 anything else, these make a big difference in how Real War plays, since you won't have to divide 
 your limited army between offensive and defensive duties.   

  Rogue States has some useful new hotkeys (although it should have more) , and the graphics and animation 
 have been cleaned up a bit since the last game. Units move a little more convincingly and don't 
 routinely march right through each other like ghosts or shuffle sideways as if they were on ice. 
 You can also select camouflage patterns for your units. Ironically, this is mainly useful to make 
 them stand out better against the terrain. In addition to a new seven-mission campaign for each 
 side, Rogue States features beefed-up skirmish and multiplayer modes. There are loads of new options 
 for unit restrictions and resource availability, as well as some clever maps and new game types. 
 Rogue States' improved resource model encourages control of certain points on the map to improve 
 your income. You can even play games in which allied human players control the same side, sharing 
 command of their units.           Unfortunately, the game's interface and unit AI have real problems. 
    

  Then again, it's difficult to recommend playing Real War: Rogue States in the first place. If you're 
 a glutton for micromanagement and punishment, then this is the game for you. The game's interface 
 has changed only slightly since the original Real War. Rogue States still requires a lot of careful 
 clicking on tiny moving units, indecipherable pictures, or little icons. The game's unit formations 
 and new AI settings aren't very helpful, because the AI simply doesn't work. Units stand around 
 while they're being attacked. Oftentimes, you'll have to manually target an enemy to get your units 
 to react to taking fire, but even then, your units will occasionally just ignore you, as if they're 
 on some union-mandated coffee break. In fact, Rogue States' pathfinding is just as bad as Real 
 War's.   

  An AI this bad completely undermines the gameplay. In fact, you could say that having to deal with 
 Rogue States' frustrating AI is a bit like playing a multiplayer game with some guy who keeps breaking 
 up the game by walking away from his computer to grab a snack from the kitchen -- even though you're 
 all set and ready to play, something that's out of your control keeps disrupting the experience. 
 Considering that there have been several other real-time strategy games this year that are much 
 more highly polished, solid, and enjoyable, you'd probably be better off spending your time and 
 money elsewhere.

Review:  I liked many things about this game, like the way you build buildings and how their is a limit 
 to powerful units to prevent massing, but their were some pretty inexcusible problems. The AI is 
 horrible, online only supports 4 players, and the graphics are terrible. There is also a very small 
 amount of maps, maybe 20 in all, and no map editor. Not only that but the noise this game makes 
 hurts your ears, it's a bunch of sounds that seem like they were ceated by various animals getting 
 tortured. If you have a bad computer it would be better for you just to purchase Starcraft. I would 
 suggest Command and Conquer: Generals instead, it's pretty similar just much, much better.

Review:  Very easy to learn
  I love the gameplay, the timing was not good. But just because of the bad timing people gave it 
 a low score. come on people, sure it was bad timing with setember 11 and all, but do not bash a 
 good game. i see no probs with the ai. at least on my computer. anyway, i think the game is great! 
 If you like startegy or playing against freinds online, you wil like this game. It has a great 
 air fleat, land is good. The best base defense is with the ILA. The greatest offence is the US. 
 So, in short, whatever team you choose, It can get really hard
