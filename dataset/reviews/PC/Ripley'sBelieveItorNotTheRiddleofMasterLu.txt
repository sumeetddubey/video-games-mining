:::Review:::
Although Riddle of Master Lu is a multimedia experience of epic proportions, its troublesome game 
 mechanics keep it from the majesty that it sets out to achieve. 

 Whenever I watch any of the Indiana Jones movies, I'm awestruck by the main character's ability 
 to escape certain death time and time again. Sanctuary Woods' first adventure game from their in-house 
 production studios, the grandiose Riddle of Master Lu, gives us a chance to test our Indy-like 
 qualities.  

 Robert Ripley, known mostly for his museums of curiosities, actually lived a life of globe-trotting 
 adventure in his search for unusual items and marginally believable stories. Guiding Mr. Ripley 
 through the game's exotic locales gives you a chance to relive his richly entertaining life, complete 
 with its wonder, mystery, and hyperbole.  

 Although Riddle of Master Lu is a multimedia experience of epic proportions, its troublesome game 
 mechanics keep it from the majesty that it sets out to achieve. Oversensitive mouse controls and 
 incredibly small hot-spots make some of the more challenging puzzles nearly impossible. Sometimes 
 Ripley stands in the way of objects that you need to access, requiring you to shuffle him to the 
 side before you can even tell whether the object exists. With a bit of fine-tuning, this game could 
 have been outstanding, but because of these flaws, you'll most likely need the help of a full walk-through 
 to complete it.  

 Master Lu has broken new ground on the front of infotainment. Woven within the game, but not essential 
 to completing it, are whole sections of information on the various locales Ripley visits. You can 
 spend hours poring over the historical content here without ever feeling that the data is being 
 forced on you. The game's designers should be applauded for including such useful information in 
 an entertainment product.  

 All said, Master Lu is a giant game with good intentions and a number of the ingredients that make 
 a successful adventure, but its unforgiving interface ultimately led me to frustration, not recommendation.

Review:  That game was my first point &amp; click adventure and i must say i find it highly underappreciated 
 in this site. Hard puzzles and so many of them made me addicted to it. Great story for any true 
 p&amp; c adventurer. Thou i never made it to the end of this game becouse of some game bug on the 
 half of the game, maybe of linear playing... where you find myself in some secret laboratory and 
 never get out of it sadly. The game was old school and graphicaly made revolution for that age. 
 In the game you travel and discover the whole world thru so many riddles you must solve to advance 
 in the further playing. Game also had action elements where you must get yourself out of the house 
 before it explodes to pieces.

Review:  Clearly the Reviewer didn't find out the glory of this game when he played it and doesn't understand 
 the greatness of this game. The controls for one were actually fine, there were times when I played 
 and I was like "hmm i'm not understanding the objective on how to get out of this room?" ,but eventually 
 I found the way and was back on track on playing the game. If I found a copy of this game people 
 would ask why I would play it again, and my answer would be easy. I played this game when I was 
 young, and i'm sixteen now, just it was my something I grew up to and it was a great experience. 
 If I were to rate this this game, which i'm doing right now i'd rate it a 9.0 out of 10. Just because 
 the way it was presented and everything throughout it. Seeing as it was developed in 1995 of course 
 its going to have some bugs or glitchy controls that are annoying at times, but if you don't worry 
 about them and stick to the game than its a magnificent masterpiece. I really enjoyed this game 
 thank you Sanctuary Woods, and Woodward Studios for a great game. If only the reviewer of this 
 title had as much fun as I did.
