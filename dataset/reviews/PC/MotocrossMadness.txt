:::Review:::
With its multitude of modes and good terrain graphics, this is pretty much everything you could 
 hope for in a motocross simulation, and then some. 

 Microsoft seems to be cornering the market on sports requiring that a perfectly good sports arena 
 be filled with mud. First, it releases the surprisingly fun Monster Truck Madness series, and now 
 it follows it up with this motocross simulator. Anyone who's ever seen a commercial for a Super 
 Bowl of motocross will undoubtedly already have a pretty vivid image of the game in his mind: masked 
 cyclists flying through the air at unbelievable heights, waving raised thumbs and legs at the wildly 
 cheering audience, then landing (possibly in a heap) on the dirt track below. And that's pretty 
 much what the game delivers.   

 Which is a compliment. With its multitude of modes and good terrain graphics, this is pretty much 
 everything you could hope for in a motocross simulation, and then some.   

 Motocross Madness is really two games in one. Most of your options are for races - there are national 
 races, supercross races, and the grueling Baja. The first two are typical multilap races in outdoor 
 or indoor arenas. Though the game is by no means a serious sim, the races follow in the tradition 
 of more realistic driving simulations. For instance, you really have little hope of doing well 
 unless you've spent some time memorizing the various tracks.   

 The Baja races are very different. These marathons have you racing many laps through expansive outdoor 
 environments - they aren't so much about speed as endurance. These are quite fun, as they take 
 a great deal of time to complete, and the standings can change dramatically over the course of 
 a single race.  

 In the race modes, understanding motorcycle mechanics comes in handy, as well, and you'll have to 
 adjust shocks, engine, and gears if you want to hit peak performance in the different environments. 
 And while Motocross Madness does provide preset values for these - as well as a number of assists 
 - the only major problem with the game is that it doesn't give beginners any context or help in 
 determining how to tweak the different elements.  

 But where the game really shines is in the stunt quarry. Each of the arenas for this mode is a series 
 of sharp rises and valleys where you compete to successfully perform the most stunts in a predetermined 
 period of time. This mode flaunts Motocross Madness' greatest feature: the excellent physics engine, 
 which has just enough realism to make it believable and just enough exaggeration to make it fun. 
 There's only one minor problem with this mode, which is that the stunts themselves are just a series 
 of preset button combinations, and you gain more or fewer points depending on how long you hold 
 them. It'd be great if there was room for a bit more freestyle action - but there's no denying 
 the thrill of pulling off a few stunts in a single while you're careening through the air over 
 the competition.  

 Add to this some solid graphics (which require a Direct3D-compatible accelerator) , and relatively 
 lag-free multiplayer racing over Microsoft's own Internet Gaming Zone, and there really isn't much 
 to complain about. Motocross Madness is, quite simply, a great deal of fun with a lot to offer 
 both the motorcycle racing fan who wants to test his mettle on the Baja and the action fan who 
 just wants to pull some Barneys a few hundred feet in the air.

Review:  This 3D game is not a simulator, nor is it an arcade fun get-together with your mates. It simply 
 lets you play around on a dirt bike in barren countryside. You can choose from a small variety 
 of competitions to compete in; be it a point to point race or a challenge to achieve the highest 
 trick score.
  
  You can choose from a variety of bikes and player outfits. You customise the bike mechanical setup 
 to your style, so soften up those springs.
  
  GAMEPLAY  is best done with a controller pad. There are a multitude of tricks you can pull off 
 in mid-air. A simple pull back on the stick means you lean back ... and so forth. Add this with 
 a trick button and youve just pulled a whoopa doopa trick.
  
  The bike scurrys across the dirt with fair realism, lean too far over on a corner and you might 
 just fall off on that dirt. Your player is indestructible, so test to your hearts content. Landing 
 the bike is a skill in its self; which makes the game less arcade and less boring.
  
  SOUND  has the noises of the two-stroke engines to a tee; but Id rather put some music on my 
 self. Sounds are basic.
  
  GRAPHICS  are somewhat blocky for their day. The backdrops are poor. Maybe this is all due to 
 the Massive maps you ride about in.
  
  Add to the replay-ability by using the mapmaker, which is a place where you can create an indoor 
 race track; simple yet fun.
  
  The game soon gets boring though. Ive owned plenty of bikes in my time and would much rather be 
 outside doing it for real. The game needs some fun factor.

Review:  The hours and hours i've spent playing this game is insane, i played this game so much when i was 
 little i can't belive it, I was so addicted to this game i'd spend hours and hours and hours playing 
 it. It's an awesome motocross game!, and any motorcycle person should have it, It's even cheap 
 now, i think the funnest part of this game is in stunt mode, you go out to the edge of the map 
 and climb up the mountain, and go past the edge and you'll get flinged in the air to the middle 
 of the map, it's great to watch :) , the graphics are very well done for the time of this game, 
 the sound is awesome, the variablely in tracks and bikes is greaty done, microsoft did a real good 
 job with this game.
