 Armies of Exigo has some great graphics but the gameplay feels more like a RTS from 1999, watch

  Servers Offline    Posted: Nov 5, 2008 4:31 pm PT      Toward the end of 2006, the online service 
 for this game was shut down by EA. &nbsp;               

  If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Armies of Exigo is a real-time strategy game 
 that should have Blizzard blushing. This debut offering from developer Black Hole Games borrows 
 quite a bit from Blizzard's classic real-time strategy releases. In making its Blizzard clone, 
 the developer has emulated everything from the 3D look of the units and buildings of Warcraft III 
 to the three-pronged storyline of Starcraft and the Hollywood-quality cutscene movies that Blizzard 
 is known for. The only problem is that while Black Hole has all the ingredients of a great real-time 
 strategy game, the formula in Armies of Exigo comes off as, well, far too formulaic. Armies of 
 Exigo is in many ways a 1999-era real-time strategy game with 2004 production values. It's a beautiful 
 strategy offering that's technically on par with the best games on the market, and you can appreciate 
 the graphical detail on display as armies clash, magical effects rain down, and units are hurled 
 into the air by mighty blows. However, it's disappointing that the gameplay is very much like that 
 of the earliest real-time strategy games. This is a traditional RTS that seemingly ignores all 
 the advances that the genre has experienced over the past several years.  

          The three races in Armies of Exigo are all familiar, from the human/elven empire to the 
 wild beasts.     

  The story is set in the fantastical world of Noran, which is plunged into a catastrophic war after 
 the beast hordes launch a sudden attack on the human and elven empire. As the two races battle 
 it out, a third race, the fallen, plots to conquer the world so it can unleash a 500-year-old prophecy. 
 The story, which is told over 36 missions that are split evenly among the three races, is a familiar 
 tale of fantasy warfare that's been presented before in other strategy games, with all the predictable 
 plot developments that we've come to expect. And in many ways, this also describes the overall 
 Armies of Exigo experience, because it feels like we've played the game a dozen times before.  
 

  Understandably, all games borrow and build upon concepts from earlier ones; this is how the evolutionary 
 process works. However, Armies of Exigo almost shamelessly copies features and ideas from other 
 games... wholesale. The most glaring example is the fallen, the alien race that employs insect units 
 that look and sound a bit like Starcraft's zerg. As if that weren't enough, the fallen can only 
 build structures on purplish goo that must be laid down beforehand, exactly like the zerg. At this 
 point, the resemblance is beyond uncanny. The other two races aren't clones of existing races in 
 other games, but they remain familiar nonetheless. The empire consists of all the staple fantasy 
 races, including, aside from humans, elves, gnomes, and dryads. Meanwhile, the beasts feature demons, 
 goblins, ogres, harpies, and more. Each race features different units and tech trees, but ultimately, 
 they're all similar in a lot of ways to balance play. The empire features a nice equilibrium between 
 conventional and magical forces; the fallen can build rapidly and unleash hordes of insectoid units; 
 and the beasts have some of the fiercest units available.  

          You'll be forgiven for mistaking the fallen for Starcraft's zerg, right down to the purple 
 goo.     

  Armies of Exigo employs a three-resource economic system that's universal across all three races, 
 so you'll dispatch dozens of worker units to constantly harvest gold, gems, and wood to build the 
 myriad different buildings and unit types, as well as research all the technologies on the tech 
 tree. This build-up phase can take quite a while, so there's not much sense in sending out small 
 groups of lightly armed and lightly armored units much of the time, because they'll usually get 
 chewed up easily. Battles in Armies of Exigo take a long time because they usually come down to 
 a lengthy grind as you wear the other side down through sheer attrition. The problem is that the 
 game lets defenders build formidable defenses, such as life-sapping totem towers that drain hit 
 points from attacking units. Meanwhile, the unit limit usually restricts the attacker to roughly 
 the same number of units as the defender, which means that the attacker is at a disadvantage already. 
 Consequently, most offensives require you to build up consecutive waves of units to slowly wear 
 down the enemy defenses and defenders, and this takes a fair amount of time. You can easily spend 
 a couple of hours on most of the game's missions.     "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"

    Posted: Nov 5, 2008 4:31 pm PT      Toward the end of 2006, the online service for this game 
 was shut down by EA. &nbsp;               

  Your job would also be a lot easier if the game featured better default unit behavior. Alas, you 
 have to constantly hold your units' hands in battle, because groups will have the tendency to split 
 apart as each man chases down an enemy. So during base attacks, you'll watch your precious armies, 
 which include your prized veteran units, as they're shredded before your very eyes. To prevent 
 this, you have to constantly issue the "hold" command to make them stand still and not chase anything 
 that catches their eyes. Now, try juggling this with multiple groups at the same time and the game 
 can quickly become an exercise in frustration. There are also no formation controls, and units 
 will not automatically arrange themselves so that melee units are in the front while support units 
 are in the back. Accordingly, you'll see your healer unit dash into the middle of a huge fracas 
 only to be cut down seconds later. Eventually you'll discover that the easiest way to progress 
 through a mission is to constantly save the game when everything is going well while reloading 
 when everything is going badly.  

          Battles can be wild melees, but you have to constantly micromanage your units to be successful. 
     

  One of the game's most touted features is the dual-layer map system that lets you battle it out 
 above and below ground at the same time. This certainly comes into play during some missions, where 
 it's all but impossible to win unless you use the underground. You can, for instance, place spellcasters 
 beneath an enemy base so they can cast spells "upward" to affect units there. On the flip side, 
 if you're directly over an enemy base, you can return the favor. However, in a lot of missions, 
 the dual-layer system is a management hassle because you'll have to constantly toggle between the 
 two to hand-hold your units. Try juggling base-building, resource-gathering, and base-defending 
 with exploring an entirely different map at the same time.  

  The artificial intelligence is very predictable, and it will build up and dispatch the same units 
 at you over and over again. Once you figure out the pattern, it's easy to build a defensive layer 
 to repel it while you're off handling other things. The only advantage the AI has is the standard 
 RTS one that makes it much better at handling multiple tasks at once than you. Thus, in skirmish 
 games, the AI's better at exploiting the different resource areas on the map and at directing armies 
 at you while you're still building up your base. Armies of Exigo features the standard multiplayer 
 modes, including melee, team melee, king of the hill, skirmish, and capture the flag. The game 
 supports up to eight players, though we wish you good luck in trying to find an opponent. The built-in 
 server browser makes it easy to go online, but the matchmaking lobby is largely empty throughout 
 the day, even though the game has been widely available for more than a week.  

  From a technical standpoint, Armies of Exigo does put on a great show. The graphics are beautiful, 
 while the prerendered cutscenes are downright gorgeous. You can admire the detail on the elaborate 
 units, such as the gnome steambird, during the quiet moments of the game. Meanwhile, the action 
 looks good, especially if you have magic users who are able to cast wide-area spells over the battlefield. 
 The sound effects are about average for the genre, and they feature all the typical sounds that 
 you'd expect, such as swords clashing. The music is good, but it's hardly noticeable throughout 
 most of the game. Finally, the quality of the voice acting is uneven. As a result, there are some 
 solid performances in there, but there are also some lame-sounding ones as well. The script could 
 also use some variety, because not only do units utter the same two phrases over and over again, 
 but also lines of dialogue are practically taken verbatim from  The Lord of the Rings  movies. 

          The game takes place in the forests, caves, and deserts of Noran.     

  Developer Black Hole certainly has displayed technical prowess with Armies of Exigo, but in the 
 end, the game comes off as a familiar clone in a genre that was overwhelmed by clones several years 
 ago. If Black Hole could mate its modern production values with better gameplay, then it could 
 have a very interesting offering on its hands. That said, if you're looking for an old-school real-time 
 strategy game, then you'll most likely enjoy Armies of Exigo, especially since it features a lot 
 of gameplay in its single-player campaign. Just be prepared for some frustration along the way. 
 However, if you're looking for innovation or streamlined or modern gameplay, you won't find it 
 here.

Review:  Graphics: 9
  Sound: 6
  Gameplay: 8
  Multiplayer: 8
  Storyline: 7
  Impression: 9
  
  Score: 8 (7.8 real)
  
  Don't be fooled by the shoddy packaging and flimsy marketing text 
 on the box - Armies of Exigo is a very strong RTS release. 
  
  Anyone who's played Warcraft, Starcraft, Age of Empires, or Warlords: Battlecry will feel right 
 at home with Armies of Exigo. In standard fashion, you gather gold, wood and gems with peasants, 
 then create a variety of troops. 
  
  The box claims over 200 troop types for each race, but the only way I can see that is if they're 
 counting the 5 experience levels for every trooop type as a separate troop. Experience levels are 
 nothing more than the usual HP, attack, etc. bonuses that are not customizable. The game would 
 have been much deeper if there'd been customization on the level of the Warlords series. That said, 
 troops are diverse, well-rendered, and fun to play with. Different types receive special abilities, 
 and some troops receive auras which affect the troops around them (another idea originally stolen 
 from Warlords: Battlecry and implemented in Warcraft 3) . 
  
  There are a number of spells, and different troops receive bonuses against opposing forces (i. e. 
 Pikemen gain a damage bonus vs. large land troops like Ogres) . This really gives the game a "counter-troop" 
 feel like that of Age of Kings. 
  
  Graphics are outstanding - trees sway in the breeze, and the level of detail is high. The engine 
 is very, very standard, and with the exception of a slightly annoying up-and-down jog to the screen 
 when panning left and right, I was very impressed with how smoothly the game plays. Exigo does 
 an excellent job of blending Diablo-esque cut-scenes with in-engine cinematics to draw you into 
 a story that would otherwise just be standard "defend the council of mages" fare. It's interesting 
 to see someone do unto Blizzard as Blizzard does unto everyone else - take a good concept and polish 
 it until it shines.
  
  The underworld is really not the revolution the game claims it to be - as a strategic element, 
 it's not much deeper than old turn-based games like Heroes of Might and Magic, or even the Starcraft 
 abilities of Zerg to create tunnels into the enemy base. 
  
  I haven't spent enough time in multiplayer to really feel comfortable with an endorsement, but 
 so far, it seems like this is where the game will really shine. 
  
  I really feel like this game could have done much more - all the expensive basics are there - it 
 just needed a bit more innovation to be a real classic. More hero development or more troop customization 
 would have made a big difference to me. What Exio does, it does well. If you're a fantasy RTS fan, 
 you'll definitely feel that you've gotten your money's worth.
  
  
  The Good:
  -worth playing
  -worth buying it
  -feels like you are playing a Warcraft, Starcraft etc. game
 
  -impressive graphics
  -a combination of famous RTS games like Warcarft
  
  The Bad:
  -it could've been better
  -few players on multiplayer
  -campaign is quite short
  -no sequel

Review:  Much this game as been evaluated and rated below the score that I think it truly deserves. Those 
 outstanding graphics thay may leave some players truly impressed are not the only quality of this 
 game, unlike what much people has been saying. Besides this, in this game resides a story that 
 contains an amazing series of events along with a campaign with great cinematics that could built 
 a well-made movie in the cinema as well as a feature that many famous RTS don't have: the two sides 
 of the same coin. That is, in the campaign that the game offers, we can play both by good and then 
 by evil, which I think it's quite interesting. About the micromanagement that so many people have 
 talked about, I think it's also another good feature of this game for it allows us to develop our 
 own strategy and, therefore, been abble to experience a wilder way of playing. The two-map feature, 
 besides being unique, it's also good for it favours the gameplay strategy of the game. The single-player 
 skirmishes are also good, with a AI that we can program for each player, which allow us to play 
 the scenario with the exactly level of difficulty that we want. The scenario editor is also good, 
 regardless of the trigger editor and other many other components being a little complicated for 
 those who wants to create advanced scenarios. Basically, I think that Armies of Exigo is a very 
 good game and that appeals to those who simply want to play a game not too complicated and that 
 may offers them a good time experience for relax and have fun.

Review:  This was a game that I had stumbled upon and was tempted to buy after due to a weird gut feeling 
 that it would be money well spent. Unfortunately, it now shows that not only had I wasted my money 
 but have also regretted buying this game.
  
  The gameplay, it's the same old strategy, build your base, collect resources and attack your opponent. 
 The game manages to keep you entertained for the first few missions but eventually it drags on. 
 However, a single mission in the 36 missions campaign does bring some respite, by allowing you 
 to rescue someone without base building, but the game retains it's monotony nonetheless. Also, 
 the dual map is a real headache.
  
  The graphics are fanciful. With a cartoon-ish feel to them, it does indicate that the developers 
 were trying to make a graphics-centric game. I particularly liked the cut scenes, they were all 
 flawlessly done. Albeit, there are some moments which you feel are rather tacky.
  
  It became quite conspicuous that the game was graphic centric after hearing the same score playing 
 over and over again. It was as if my ears were being subject to some agitating melody nagging me 
 to stop playing the game. 
  
  Overall, the game is overwhelming boring, with neither content nor entertainment to keep you interested 
 in it for long. But there is one commendable feature of the game - the ending. Personally, I feel 
 this game isn't worth playing, if your not a hardcore elfish and fantasy-RTS fan. Hence, it is 
 only logical to keep away from this game.

Review:  if you are considering a new rts game... make SURE you bunk this one... sure the graphics are gorgeous 
 and the playing smooth but the game is like a copy paste of Warcraft 3 minus the good stuff... 
 units are old-style (which is BAD) the standard meelee then ranged and then supporter and etc. 
 etc. the story is highly cliche'... man fights beast then out of nowhere the fallen emerge... gameplay 
 is slow and monotonous even online... if your ever find anyone to play with online... if your friends 
 try to force you into this game... divert all of them to a better game... i fell victim to some 
 friends... i showed them the truth now we focus on warcraft. Also the double map layer thing is 
 nothing great adds more irritating micromanagement. on the sum total if u want something like warcraft 
 3... just continue playing Warcraft till the fourth game comes out or divert to other rts games 
 like C&amp; C, Warhammer and StarCraft (2nd game coming hopefully by 2008 :D)

Review:  Armies of Exigo is an RTS game from Black Hole Studios, which has many people who apparently had 
 some experience in Hollywood. That experience really shows here, as Armies of Exigo is a great 
 looking game, but the actual gameplay underneath the shine is really underwhelming due to how out-dated 
 it is.
  
  The game's story takes place with 3 factions vying to become the dominant power. You've got the 
 Empire, which is a classic combination of humans, elves, and gnomes. The Beast horde, which features 
 hordes of strong Beastmen, goblins, dragons, ogres, and other creatures. Then you've got the Fallen, 
 which are a race consisting of insects, dark elves, and another group that is essentially an alien 
 race. In all reality- forget all that I just said. These races might as well just be the Terrans, 
 Protoss, and Zerg respectively in a fantasy setting, with only a few minor differences and reshuffles 
 in gameplay elements. For example, there are no pylon structures in this game, but the beastmen 
 (Protoss) do use the Zerg style of getting more room for units- by producing Borons (i. e. ground-based 
 Overlords which trade transport capabilities for combat capabilities) . Ultimately however, the 
 Fallen are by far the worst offender here, as they might as well be an almost complete carbon copy 
 of the Zerg, since they have the fewest differences.
  
  The gameplay itself is also completely copied from Starcraft, with only one novelty feature, and 
 that is the underground sections in the game. The underground areas allow you to essentially play 
 on two maps at once in a game. This can also make for some interesting tactics, since some abilities 
 can only be used underground, yet only affect the surface. This also allows you to outflank your 
 enemies quite easily if the map design allows for it. Two problems here however: first off, this 
 leads to some major micromanagement if you have bases on both levels in a game, so you'd better 
 be a micromanagement junkie if you want to appreciate the two-level gameplay in Armies of Exigo. 
 Also, the map design of the game is lackluster, so the underground might as well just be another 
 direct route to your enemy which is easily defended.
  
  Armies of Exigo does have a single player campaign, which is split into 3 parts just like Starcraft's 
 campaign. Only difference being that you must play the 3 sections in order (Starcraft let you play 
 any campaign from the start) . It really doesn't much matter, for the campaign is rather boring. 
 The scenarios are bland, and the characters are not interesting since they have bad voice acting 
 along with potentially worse dialogue.
  
  Graphics is the one area Armies of Exigo shines. The game looks quite fresh, with great looking 
 environments both above and below ground. Unit animations are also well done. Unit portraits seem 
 a little stiff however, especially when talking (Though, you'll definitely not want them to talk 
 that much...) . Sound wise, the game has music that fits the theme just fine, but horrendous voice 
 acting really brings the sound quality down. The game's battle sounds are repetitive, but they 
 sound decent.
  
  In the end, Armies of Exigo is a poorly executed rip-off of Starcraft. Unless you haven't experienced 
 the classic RTS gameplay of those days, you should definitely pass on Armies of Exigo.
  
  Pros: Great Graphics.
  
  Cons: Out-dated and poorly executed gameplay. Level design doesn't 
 fully take advantage of the underground. Terrible Voice acting. Poor AI.
  
  Recommendable for: Only for people who haven't been spoiled by the likes of Starcraft or any other 
 decent RTS. Especially if you don't put your expectations high.

Review:  Blaze gonna break it down for ya.
  
  add one part Starcraft, one part Warcraft and one part lord of the rings and you get this ... except 
 .... not anywhere near as good as the games i just mentioned .... well maybe lord of the rings...
 
  
  nothing ground breaking, each stage possibly has a subterrainian underworld.... but who cares.
 
  
  Easy to play and learn beacuse for some strange reason you feel like you've played it before....
 
  
  Humans = Warcraft humans
  The Fallen = Starcraft zerg / warcraft undead
  Chaos tribes = Warcraft Orcs / Sauron's dark forces
  
  this game just feels like a cheap copy 
 of much better games.

Review:  The Armies of Exigo was my first strategy game that I have played. I never played strategy game 
 before and I though it's a boring type of game but when I tried this game I realized that strategy 
 games can be a lot of fun! The game is not the best game I have played but I give it this score 
 because it was the first strategy game and it helped me to see that strategy games are not that 
 bad. This game is pretty long and it has three campaigns. Humans, aliens, and monsters. Each campaign 
 has its abilities and different people. My favorite campaign is monsters, I guess. Well, all of 
 them are interesting and unique. I really enjoyed this game and I finished it with all campaigns. 
 It has interesting maps and missions. I have heard that this game is a clone of Warcraft but I 
 haven't played that game so I don't know. Thus, I think this is a good strategy game and I don't 
 think is that bad. It gave me a lot of funny moments! :)

Review:  Okay, I'd read alot about this game and I wanted to buy it, I didn't really believe gamespot so 
 I ignored them and bought it anyway. LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY ... -&gt; I got this game for $4.99 and 
 still think it was a rip off. It stays dusty on the shelf and I don't look at it. Seriously, the 
 story starts off so hard and unoriginal that after you finish the first level, you get a pretty 
 good idea of how much it sucks. The graphics are good but so what, graphics don't make up for unoriginal 
 ideas, bad gameplay, terrible difficulty and more. If you are looking for a good RTS get either 
 Lord of the Rings battle for Middle Earth 1 or 2 or AOM or AOE. Please don't listen to the other 
 reviews this is nothing like warcraft and it sucks.

Review:  Well I was quite excited when I purchased AoE. I love 'real-time' strategy games, so I had been 
 looking forward to playing AoE. I was very badly disappointed.
  
  Virtually every aspect of the game is good. The graphics are beautiful, making full use of your 
 PC's graphics card. The bodies blow up and fly everywhere, the magic spells look very pretty ("like 
 fireworks" as my friend said) , and the landscapes are of a high standard.
  
  The sounds are good. The screams of dying units, the sounds if spells being cast, the music. They 
 all add to the atmosphere and overall they make playing the game more enjoyable.
  
  The problem with AoE lies in the gameplay itself. While most strategy games borrow concepts and 
 ideas from other strategy games, they generally make at least some effort to build on it and change 
 it a little to make it better. Not AoE. A lot of ideas have been ripped from other strategy games 
 and placed straight into AoE, with absolutely no attempt to change them slightly. Even one of the 
 races (see if you can guess which one) bears an uncanny resembelance to the race known as the Zergs 
 (a la Starcraft) .
  While a lot of the features of AoE have been shamelessly pinched from other strategy games, it 
 does manage to come up with a few ideas itself. The dual-layer system is a great strength. Not 
 only can your units travel on the land, they can travel under it as well. This makes things a lot 
 trickier, but work out how to use it and missions become a lot easier and enjoyable.
  
  Overall, AoE is a fairly good game, despite a very small part of it actually being original. It's 
 not one that people will be stampeding to go out and buy, but if you're into classic-style strategy 
 games, AoE will be right up your street.

Review:  Here is the worst RTS i have tried. The AI is dumn the balancing is terrible and over all it is 
 just a bad game. When I would go to attack the army would see it even though the fog of war is 
 on and would retreat. If i was building up my base the army would come then when my army machted 
 it it would slowly retreat then get some more then slowly come back over. It wouldn't even try 
 to conquer any of the land or mines. This is the first EA game i have not enjoyed. Just not to 
 bag on it to much haha the underground battle feature is probably the only thing that saved it. 
 That was pretty intresting and would like to see that in more game. Still when i took my creature 
 army against the humans maxed out pop cap and went head to head with them i died in like 30 seconds 
 and only managed to kill a foot soldier. Now try to tell me that is balanced. Waste of 35$. Wouldn't 
 be so mad if i didn't pay so much.

Review:  Well, this game is very hard. Very Nice intro might you say. AOX has alot of good and bad moments. 
 I really like the RTS elements. The graphics are perfect, and I havent seen a single glitch in 
 them. It is important to have a good computer to run this game otherwise it will appear very slow, 
 with horrible framerate. I didnt like the unit controls because It was really hard to get them 
 to follow commands. The sound was exceptional, I cant say it was too good or too bad. I really 
 enjoyed the character modules, they just look too hella cool. It required alot of thinking on what 
 to build and how many units you wanted. Very Tactical. You will have alot of trouble finding someone 
 online though, not the most popular game. Although Single Player will be alot of fun. I would reccomend 
 this game.

Review:  Graphics of this game is great. but everything else needs work. The game play is poor and slow, 
 it can take hours just to finish one level and considering that there are about 32 levels its a 
 very long time. 
  Controls are difficult to use and your army runs off at the site of an enemy, this becomes really 
 annoying when you are trying to keep archers and spell casters in the back, and they just charge 
 forward and get slaughtered in a matter of seconds. When attacking the enemy base, your troops 
 scatter to chase after any enemy they, meaning you have to keep a close eye on your army and any 
 minor mistake can cause you to lose the game.
  The underground passages are a real hassle, having two grounds to battle on just makes the game 
 more difficult and frustrating. With three different types of resources being required to collect 
 just make constructing buildings and units more difficult, especially when you are bombarded with 
 a large assault every now and again. 
  Armies of exigo basically took the normal foundations of a RTS game and added better graphics. 
 The game lacks any original ideas of any sort and have mostly borrowed ideas from other games such 
 as starcraft. I mean doesnt any seen any resemblance between the zergs race from starcraft and 
 fallens race? Lacking any original ideas makes us seem like we've played this game before and we 
 get bored within half-an-hour or -so.
  Anyone has rated this game anything above fair has no idea what a good RTS is. But if you liked 
 games such as age of empires 2 then you ought to give this game a go. But be prepared to have hours 
 of frustration when you are trying to win a mission. But you keep failing miserably just because 
 your the computer has way too many defencive structures, or your army wont stay still for more 
 than a minute.

Review:  Amazing that this solid game has been so overlooked and underrated.
  It is true that it has used all the tried and true elements of a successful RTS, but so much the 
 better. It gives those of use who want more of the same gameplay (but with a new ambiance) what 
 we want. The music is great, the story is great, and the voice acting is also great. Just like 
 the C&C franchise was improved with C&C Generals, so to was Warcraft etc. improved and carried 
 on with Armies of Exigo. A good story, good graphics, bug free with ample missions and I will buy 
 it. I do not think I am alone on this one.

Review:  The premise of this game shouldn't surprise anyone its the same old story humans battle orcs or 
 drow elves, in any combination you choose. Very good graphics also this game has a realistic chess 
 board of characters you can pick any combo of creatures to play and battle. I probably play the 
 chess more then the accual game due mainly to the fact that the A. I. of this game is one donut 
 short of a dozen, in that i mean the opponent comes on strong at first but if you attack them after 
 that forget about them rebuilding or getting another army together in any short time. Also the 
 coolest creatures of the game in my opinion are the drow elf undead thingies and they are always 
 whipped out before any other teams so ive yet to battle it out good with them. All in all I have 
 to say pick this one up the bargain bin if you must. I give it a 5 out of 10 replay ability.

Review:  I have tried this game with one of my friends and it was damn funny.
  
  I will admit that this game reminds much of blizzards games, but i do think anyway that it is a 
 good well should i say remix?
  
  The three races EMPIRE BEASTS and FALLEN all include different units. Empire includes humans elves 
 and some creatures, very traditional. The beasts also include includes classic beasts such as goblins 
 lizardmen and so on. The fallen includes more disgusting creeps such as spiders and that and build 
 their things on goo or something like that, reminds of zergs as Gamespot says.
  
  There are the overworld and the underworld, like Hoom3 and 4 but in real time. The world is well 
 made and the graphics is great. Much better than blizzards games, but that dosent mean that criticise 
 blizzards games.
  
  Sound? Well kinda average. They are well made but to quite, so you have to turn your speakers up.
 
  
  Armies of Exigo combines some new RTS things while combining other older things.
  
  Armies of Exigo is a very good game if you like the ones from blizzard, then you will feel at home 
 here, and also combines great graphics. Also if you havent got anything against playing older RTS 
 games you will also like this. A perfect reincernation of blizzards games!

Review:  Inspired by starcraft and warcraft, this game offers more of the same solid fun in a different 
 setting.
  
  The Good:
  - Will please fans of starcraft and warcraft looking to get their fix.
  - Immersive graphics 
 and sounds. Cinematic are nice, if short.
  - Good, Solid, fun game play.
  - The story looked formulaic at first, but then it grew on it.
  
  The Bad:
  - A. I. is pretty 
 dumb
  
  The Ugly:
  - For some, too much like starcraft and warcraft.
  
  
  
  Final words:
  This is a solid 7.9 game. The reviewer is dead wrong about the potential of this 
 game. Just because a game doesn't innovate doesn't mean it deserves a 6.7. Heck, if anything Doom3 
 should get a 6.7 because the lack of innovation. If you are a huge fan of starcraft and dislike 
 the newer RTS games, you'll like it even more.
  
  Those of you looking to get some new and different, I recommend Ground Control II or Dawn of War. 
 Or if you are looking for mindless fun, also check out LOTR: battle for middle earth.
  
  Retail, eBay or Never:
  Not worth buying at full price, but shop around for it in value bins 
 or look for it on ebay.

Review:  I'm more the turn-based, empire-building grand-strategist type. RTS games rush me and make me panic 
 : so I'm not very good at StarCraft & WarCraft (even against comps) .
  
  AoEx appears to somewhat be a mix of StarCraft & WarCraft : but a lighter, diet version of those 
 two Blizzard classics. That suits me just fine. 
  
  To my delight, AoEx has been tailor-made for me : it is easier to manage. 
  
  I like the look 
 of the game, and its two levels. I don't think this is a RTS that will satisfy veterans of SC & 
 WC : but for those of you out there who are intimidated by the frantic frenzy of RTS logistics 
 & tactics, AoEx is a relaxed, refreshing title (in skirmish mode, on huge maps, with AI allies) . 
 
  
  I have not played WC for the past two years, but I am sure that I will play AoEx until next year 
 : when I wish to relax and look at the pretty colors.

Review:  Wow, how should I put this? Black Hole Games has created a Warcraft 3 game with a slight twist. 
 Thats basically all it is. I was really looking forward to enjoying this game a lot due to its 
 similarity to WC3 and the new sub terrain feature made me remember the good ol' days of playing 
 Metal Fatigue (awesome game, check my review on it if you dont know it)
  
  The big problem with Armies of Exig is that it does everything Warcraft 3 did, but slightly worse. 
 Actually, some things are done MUCH MUCH worse than anyone could have expected. Gameplay feels 
 recycled, sound is repetitive, graphics arent anything special, and overall its not really worth 
 the money. Unless a amazing expansion comes out to save this game, better leave it for the bargain 
 bins.

Review:  We played this game already. We called it Starcraft. We called it Warcraft 3. We called it Empire 
 Earth. Not that any of those titles were particularly bad; in fact, far from it. Armies of Exigo 
 continues in a long tradition of basic strategy formulas and attempts to infuse some originality 
 into it by letting players battle below and above ground simultaneously. The mechanic does add 
 some spice, but ultimately, some poor unit AI and the resulting difficulty make playing it an exercise 
 in frustration. Black Holes title isnt terrible, and it certainly looks great, but ultimately, 
 is neither very fulfilling, nor all that interesting. 
  
  The humans and elves of Noran have been battling the beastmen ever since a colossal war known as 
 The Rage. Now, another race, the Fallen, has descended upon the world, set to fulfill the ancient 
 harbingers of the past and ready to destroy any who would stand in their way. It isnt anything 
 new, although the amazing cutscenes that tell the story between missions are a wonder. In-game, 
 your leaders will help move your missions along by speaking in the lower left corner of your screen, 
 making you wonder from time to time if you arent playing Warcraft 3. For better or for worse, 
 this isnt Warcraft 3, and the characters have little personality  and give you little reason 
 to really care about any of the proceedings. Trying to get involved with Exigos narrative is akin 
 to getting into the recent Star Wars movies: cool to watch as it happens, and completely forgettable 
 when its over.
  
  All in all, Armies of Exigo features 3 races, with 12 missions each, giving a goodly amount of 
 playtime to those patient enough to keep up. In fact, patience is what the game is all about: the 
 three factions are balanced nicely enough, but not only are the units standard RTS fare, but many 
 of them are blatant rip-offs from Blizzard titles. The fallen look, sound, and act like zerg from 
 Starcraft, and the Empire races actually move with the same jaunty animations as those in WC3. 
 Maneuvering them around is as simple as any other RTS: select and give orders. Exigo tries to innovate 
 the standard grouping procedures by limiting standard groups to 15 units, and letting you create 
 four super groups. It sounds great in practice, but fails miserably due to the games most frustrating 
 aspect: artificial intelligence. 
  
  Apparently, even Black Hole realized the limitations of the game's AI, since your enemies will 
 build up and begin the offensive quickly  rather too quickly. The problem here is that Exigo's 
 super group and mild formation options look grand on paper, but fall apart ridiculously in practice. 
 Your groups fall apart as soon as they are engaged, because each individual unit will traipse off 
 after their enemies, disregarding their place within the group. Suddenly, your ranged foes that 
 were comfortably hunkered behind your melee units go running off in their own direction, making 
 the concept of formations almost useless. Considering the game's already daunting difficulty, babysitting 
 your units is a hassle, since they can't be depended on to attack the obvious foes, running off 
 like foxhounds after elephants. Leave a group to fend for itself a while and you should assume 
 to restart the mission: there is no room for error, and you will be easily overrun if you aren't 
 paying close attention to every unit. Of course, you can always try your skills against other players 
 online, and bypass the campaigns altogether. However, finding another player isn't just difficult: 
 it's impossible. The few multiplayer matches we found were fun, and lasted for a few hours, but 
 finding human competitors is uncommon, so if you wish to avoid babysitting your units against the 
 computer AI, the only other choice is to babysit the mutiplayer component until someone actually 
 comes online. 
  
  The economy is standard for the genre  and the same for each race. You collect gold, gems, and 
 wood to build your various units and buildings, and to upgrade them on your tech trees. This doesn't 
 happen quickly: your base building and resource collection takes time, and it's unwise to venture 
 out with weak units, as you will be crushed quickly. Churn out peasants, collect your resources, 
 build and upgrade units  rinse and repeat. There is never a reward for an early surprise attack, 
 so your pre-battle preparation tends to be droll. Of course, you could always admire the units 
 you churn out, for while they may not play any differently from their RTS cousins, they look fairly 
 inventive. The gargantuan beasts are awesome to behold, and can carry other units on their backs 
 for easy transport. The fallen's buzzing drones amass quickly and their sheer numbers can look 
 formidable, even if they are rather weak. 
  
  Even the most-touted feature, the dual-layered maps that let you attack above and below the surface, 
 contributes to an ultimately frustrating experience. You can tab easily from one level to the other, 
 but micromanaging your minions in Exigo is enough of a challenge without having to worry about 
 two maps at once. There are some nifty features that make it work more than two simultaneously-played 
 maps, however; certain spells can affect adversaries on the other level, and sneaking underground 
 certainly makes for an engaging surprise attack when executed well. 
  
  Armies of Exigo looks surprisingly good for a game so reliant on old-school pretensions. The standout 
 feature here is the cutscenes, which are downright gorgeous, and easily amongst the best ever seen 
 in a game. Units themselves look great, and many of the larger units are rich and detail. Environments 
 lend some character to the mostly flat gameplay, and they are nicely textured and colored brightly. 
 Underground maps provide some good contrast: they are dark and creepy, and make the game visually 
 arresting. Particle effects in spells and other nice touches round out some truly attractive graphics, 
 even if the engine isnt really pushing a lot of polygons. 
  
  While Exigo may look terrific, the sound just cannot keep up  and in fact, our enjoyment was limited 
 by some very annoying bugs that we could not overcome on two separate test systems. The voice acting 
 is not all that great, particularly given the obvious Warcraft 3 comparisons regarding character 
 speeches (and the semi-inaccurate lip-synching.) Sometimes, dialogue would drop several levels 
 until it was almost impossible to hear when we scrolled across the map as the character was speaking. 
 Other times, it would sound as if the lines were recorded in an empty bathroom, with a distant, 
 echoing reverb. The in-game music cant quite make up for the lack of voice acting prowess, either: 
 the standard fantasy fare is both uninspired and repetitive  and just like the dialogue, would 
 occasionally either disappear, or simply drop a few levels in volume for no apparent reason. Sound 
 effects manage better, but there is nothing that really stands out: spells whoosh, swords clash, 
 ogres grunt, but none of it happens in any way that makes the game seem more exciting than it really 
 is. 
  
  In the end, there isnt much to hate about Armies of Exigo, but there isnt much to really love, 
 either. The gameplay is standard, if sometimes uneven and difficult, and the units arent anything 
 we havent seen before. While there are many hours of play to be found within, theres nothing 
 to really keep you coming back after the first few failed missions. If you are an old-school fan 
 of Blizzard's and Westwoods earliest efforts, you might get some nostalgic enjoyment from Exigo; 
 otherwise, there are better choices on store shelves  and bargain bins.

Review:  Gamespot's Jason Ocampo is out to lunch or is biased to Blizzard. Grant it AoE looks like WIII 
 and Starcraft. It is a cross between the two. Not surprising since some of the designers were also 
 involved with Starcraft. Ocampo goes on and on about the fact that AoE does not take advantage 
 of the new elements of RTS without saying which ones. Because there are none (LOTR War of the Ring, 
 Warhammer, WIII, Spellforce, AoM, etc..) . Other than Perimeter, nothing but cool graphics has been 
 invented since Warcraft and Starcraft. Every RTS you pick up after Warcraft uses the good old gathering, 
 building, attacking scheme or some variation on the theme. Contrary to Ocampo's comments about 
 being impossible to micromanage above and underground while battling, it's actually very easy to 
 do using the 2 map system. Maybe he should stick to simple RTS like Starcraft. Grant it AoE borrrows 
 a lot from WIII, but with its own story, which is quite good. Unlike Gamespot's review, your units 
 do not dive into battle for no reason, unless attacked or inside enemy base. The game runs very 
 smoothly, no glitch in pathfinding or balance. Overall, this a great looking, fun to play RTS that 
 will keep you busy for a while. It's a classical RTS for veteran and newbies. Why fix what's not 
 broken. The community reviews say it all.

Review:  I was optimistic when I bought this game. I had read the few reviews and took a risk and b ought 
 the game. I was very happy with the short learning curve for playing the game. I found it to be 
 a cross between War Craft and Rome: Total. 
  Being the trading manager nut I am, it could have had more trade, supply and demand to serve my 
 hunger, but it had plenty of great action to keep me occupied.
  The sounds are great and the game play is adequate. 
  A new twist is the underground areas under 
 the game map. This adds new challenges, as the best resources are typically found in these special 
 map areas.
  
  This was well worth the money spent and im still playing it after 50 hours. This makes it a good 
 game in my book..

Review:  Don't be fooled by the shoddy packaging and flimsy marketing text on the box - Armies of Exigo 
 is a very strong RTS release. 
  
  Anyone who's played Warcraft, Age of Empires, or Warlords: Battlecry will feel right at home with 
 Armies of Exigo. In standard fashion, you gather gold, wood and gems with peasants, then create 
 a variety of troops. 
  
  The box claims over 200 troop types for each race, but the only way I can see that is if they're 
 counting the 5 experience levels for every trooop type as a separate troop. Experience levels are 
 nothing more than the usual HP, attack, etc. bonuses that are not customizable. The game would 
 have been much deeper if there'd been customization on the level of the Warlords series. That said, 
 troops are diverse, well-rendered, and fun to play with. Different types receive special abilities, 
 and some troops receive auras which affect the troops around them (another idea originally stolen 
 from Warlords: Battlecry and implemented in Warcraft 3) . 
  
  There are a number of spells, and different troops receive bonuses against opposing forces (i. e. 
 Pikemen gain a damage bonus vs. large land troops like Ogres) . This really gives the game a "counter-troop" 
 feel like that of Age of Kings. 
  
  Graphics are outstanding - trees sway in the breeze, and the level of detail is high. The engine 
 is very, very standard, and with the exception of a slightly annoying up-and-down jog to the screen 
 when panning left and right, I was very impressed with how smoothly the game plays. Exigo does 
 an excellent job of blending Diablo-esque cut-scenes with in-engine cinematics to draw you into 
 a story that would otherwise just be standard "defend the council of mages" fare. It's interesting 
 to see someone do unto Blizzard as Blizzard does unto everyone else - take a good concept and polish 
 it until it shines.
  
  The underworld is really not the revolution the game claims it to be - as a strategic element, 
 it's not much deeper than old turn-based games like Heroes of Might and Magic, or even the Starcraft 
 abilities of Zerg to create tunnels into the enemy base. 
  
  I haven't spent enough time in multiplayer to really feel comfortable with an endorsement, but 
 so far, it seems like this is where the game will really shine. 
  
  I really feel like this game could have done much more - all the expensive basics are there - it 
 just needed a bit more innovation to be a real classic. More hero development or more troop customization 
 would have made a big difference to me. The current average reviewer score of 9.3 is too high, 
 but I was pleasantly surprised with how good this game actually is. What Exio does, it does well. 
 If you're a fantasy RTS fan, you'll definitely feel that you've gotten your money's worth.
