:::Review:::
This good-looking, light-hearted, and addictive arcade racer features some of the most unique cars 
 and intense tracks you'll see this side of Whiplash. 

 A few years back, ESPN ran a series of NASCAR commercials that portrayed hotshot Jeff Gordon as 
 Speed Racer. In Jeff Gordon XS Racing, ASC Games and developer Real Sports seem to have taken that 
 idea one step further. This good-looking, light-hearted, and addictive arcade racer features some 
 of the most unique cars and intense tracks you'll see this side of Whiplash. Though it has its 
 problems, XS Racing is a decent title for those gamers who aren't hung up on realism.  

 Taking the wheel of a futuristic, sleekly aerodynamic car, you can battle it out with up to 39 opponents 
 on a series of ten short tracks. The cars in the game are meant to represent "the next generation 
 of stock cars" ("GeneratioNext" would have been more appropriate, however, considering the amount 
 of advertising in this game for Pepsi, 7-Eleven, and Fritos) . The tracks, on the other hand, are 
 like something out of a childhood Hot Wheels fantasy.  

 Like any good arcade racer, XS Racing lets you bump and smash your way to first place, never having 
 to worry about pit stops and other bothersome details from the real world. Each car in XS Racing 
 is self-healing (they're constructed of space-age polymers, no doubt) , so even though your vehicle 
 will get smashed and distorted after repeated collisions, it will automatically morph its way back 
 into shape. This is a pretty slick idea, and it works well in the game. Considering how simplistic 
 the gameplay is, however, it might have worked better if you had to initiate the repair feature 
 manually. As it is, you hardly notice the morphing at all as you whip around the tracks at 300 
 miles per hour.  

 The game options are pretty straightforward: You can take part in a ten-race championship season 
 or take on a single track in arcade mode. In a championship season, you pick a car and a sponsor, 
 such as the aforementioned Fritos, then try to finish first overall after ten complete races.  
 

 You can change cars between races, which is helpful on some tracks that require better handling 
 than others (each car is rated for top speed, cornering, and braking) . Like most arcade racing 
 games, XS Racing includes a few locked cars, so if you do well, you'll eventually gain access to 
 more vehicles. Bringing that Speed Racer metaphor to mind, each car has wings that pop out when 
 you catch a little air, allowing you to sail over your landlocked competitors. There are no acrobat 
 cars in this game, but maybe in a sequel.  

 Perhaps the coolest feature of the entire game is its support for 40 cars on a single track. Sure 
 we've seen full-field racing sims before, but rarely in a pure arcade racer like this. Racing against 
 39 other vehicles really adds some excitement to the game. And unlike most arcade racers, which 
 let you zoom to the front of the pack and then cruise to victory by simply staying on the track, 
 XS Racing forces you to actually race and steer carefully whether or not you're in the lead.  

 
 After completing your first championship season, you begin a second, which is exactly the same 
 except that now Jeff Gordon will be one of your rival racers. Gordon, identifiable by his all-red 
 car, adds a little extra challenge to each race and is generally more aggressive than the other 
 AI racers. For example, on the first track (Cloverleaf) , most of the computer cars will not take 
 the superfast accelerated-turn shortcut, but Gordon will. If you win the second season, you get 
 to do it all over again, but this time it's you and Gordon head-to-head with no other racers on 
 the track.  

 In general, XS Racing is not a terribly difficult game. In fact, on the lower difficulty settings 
 (there are five in all) the game is downright laughable. Jacking the difficulty up a few notches 
 can make things more interesting, but because you can bounce and bump your way around a track with 
 near impunity, you can almost always stay in or near the lead. You actually do take a hit on speed 
 and maneuverability while your car morphs, but it's pretty negligible.  

 The game's problems are fairly minor, but they do exist. For starters, the advertising is a little 
 over the top. OK, it's sort of amusing to sign onto the Fritos racing team and drive a big yellow 
 car, but must we be bashed over the head with 7-Eleven signs over the track and tracks named "Pepsi 
 2000"? How about letting players create their own sponsors with their own color schemes? This should 
 actually be quite easy, since the cars are textured simply with colors and stripes - no logos at 
 all. In fact, if this game had a multiplayer feature (amazingly, it doesn't) , custom sponsors would 
 be a great addition to online play. Oh well, maybe in a patch.  

 Also, for some mind-boggling reason, XS Racing runs at a maximum screen resolution of 640x480. This 
 just can't sit well with gamers who plopped down over $200 for their spanking-new TNT2 Ultra cards, 
 let alone people like me who are still going with the dual Voodoo2 SLI configuration. Simply put, 
 a 3D-accelerated title released in the middle of 1999 should support higher resolutions. I mean, 
 even 800x600 would be nice.  

 Though the game's sound effects are generally quite good, the music is pretty mindless stuff. You 
 basically just get a beat, which would be fine if not for the fact that the looping music tracks 
 are short enough that they restart several times during each race. Since the game uses CD audio, 
 most players are going to experience a pause while the CD jumps back to the beginning of the track. 
 Note: A pause in gameplay during a fast-paced high-twitch racing game is a very, very bad thing. 
 When the music starts up again, your car is typically spun around, bashed up, and in last place. 

 Finally, the game's 3D engine has a tendency to drop cars when you race with the 40-car setting. 
 Even on a Pentium II/450 with a Voodoo2 SLI setup, I frequently saw shadows with four wheels where 
 a car should have been.  

 The lack of multiplayer options is somewhat baffling, since this would be an ideal game to play 
 head-to-head with friends, and the 640x480 limitation is irritating, but Jeff Gordon XS Racing 
 does have its good points. The graphics are good, and the gameplay is decent enough to be fairly 
 addictive. Basically, this game can be a lot of fun for players who like their racing simple, fast-paced, 
 and full of gimmicks.

Review:  Jeff Gordon Xs Racing is a futuristic arcade racer with colorful tracks and up tp 40 cars to race 
 against. There are 10 different tracks and 6 cars to choose from you have 5 differnet levels and 
 you dont need to pitstop or learn any hard tactics because its just to drive and burn.
  
  Graphics: The graphics are bad the cars and details are almost ok but a little to futuristic for 
 my taste the tracks looks really bad.
  
  Sound: The sound is ok with jeff gorson himself showing each track before you race it. The car 
 sounds are ok to
  
  Control: The control is average with a little hard to steer and no handbrake.
  
  Value: The 
 lenght of the game is bad you race two seasons and the have a challenge with Jeff gordon and this 
 takes 1-2 hours. Then you have the arcade mode were you can race up til 40 opponents and this makes 
 the game last a little longer. 
  
  Tilt: The game i fun in little dozes. Its sometimes hard to stop because you want to beat that 
 last opponent but in the whole its a pretty boring game.
