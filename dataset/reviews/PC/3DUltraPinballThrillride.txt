:::Review:::
It's a simple pinball game that's just trying to provide some innocuous fun. 

 The last few years have been hard on PC pinball simulations. Just a few years ago, they were quite 
 common. Companies like 21st Century Entertainment were devoted exclusively to replicating pinball 
 on the PC, and other companies churned out simulated tables on a regular basis. However, these 
 days there are really only two series that can be counted on: Empire's Pro Pinball and Sierra's 
 3D Ultra Pinball.   

  The two series couldn't be more different. The Pro Pinball games are impressive simulations of 
 fictional tables that render every flashing light, screw, and doohickey with a nearly obsessive 
 attention to detail. On the other hand, the 3D Ultra Pinball games are, at best, pinball-like computer 
 games that attempt to simulate how a pinball table would look and behave if it had to fit in the 
 dimensions of your computer screen and wasn't constrained to the confines of reality.   

  The newest entry, Thrillride, doesn't break from the formula used for its predecessors Creep Night 
 and NASCAR. Its amusement park theme harkens back to Williams' Funhouse, though Thrillride opts 
 for a sort of Disney family-fun quality that doesn't quite compare to Funhouse's creepy talking-dummy 
 theme. As in all previous 3D Ultra Pinball games, Thrillride is a small table with lots of ramps 
 and a small area off to the left that opens when you complete some tasks.   

  In the case of Thrillride, the tasks involve going on rides and visiting the snack shop. When you 
 open the "thrill zone," you must get the ball over to the left side of the table, where you must 
 complete more tasks in a small, self-contained area. It's a good idea, and Thrillride is certainly 
 fun for a bit. Seeing the ball go over loops and ride down water flumes is cool, and the bonus 
 tasks, appearing as if by magic on the table proper, are pretty fun as well.   

  There are also more substantial bonus games in which you're taken to another screen altogether 
 to play another pinball-like game to clear a river for some bumper boats or to build your own roller 
 coaster by hitting buttons that determine its movements.   

  The graphics are suitable and colorful, though they aren't nearly as detailed as in the Pro Pinball 
 series. Likewise, the physics are fine, but not noticeably realistic. It's clear that 3D Ultra 
 Pinball is meant as nothing more than a fun diversion and not as a hard-core pinball simulation 
 aimed at silver-ball fanatics.   

  And if Thrillride has a single problem, it's exactly that. As a result, it is simply too easy. 
 My first game lasted more than 30 minutes before I finally quit out, and I was only on ball two. 
 The middle aisle is the only way to lose the ball, and the lack of a challenge makes the game seem 
 a bit tedious. It's no fun to feel as if you'll see everything in the game on one play, which makes 
 Thrillride not very enjoyable. With the exception of one particularly hard ramp, almost everything 
 can be accessed just by constantly banging the flippers. Eventually, you'll hit your goal and get 
 the reward.   

  Such criticisms might seem harsh in light of the fact that Thrillride clearly isn't designed as 
 a simulation. It's a simple pinball game that's just trying to provide some innocuous fun. And 
 it succeeds to a degree, though the thrills are sporadic and the ride is a bit too short.

Review:  i played this and well its not all that i think it was going to be. its good for those causal pinball 
 players but i has not much fast paced action. thats aokay but not all games are perfect. it had 
 2 common fetures fun zone and thrill zone which you play by getting to a certain area. it has some 
 mini games that test your flipper skill. but im not done yet. the music is the same thing on the 
 main board and that makes it well a little annoying if you keep hearing over and over. the graphices 
 chaged from a day time to a night time when the fantasy or lights out mini game starts. overall 
 its preaty decent. but it might have been better. like maybe some more mini games and some more 
 music on the main table. and night table. ok thats this review done just wait for what i have to 
 say about my next game review

Review:  3D Ultra Pinball Thrillride is a very unappreciated game. For a pinball game, it has great goals 
 to achieve and will keep you coming back for more. Its built-in mini games add some fun while the 
 music is great, too. That chocolate world is awesome! What else does it have? It has great roller 
 coasters and great multiplayer competition. This and Pinball Hall Of Fame are the best pinball 
 games ever. Once I got this for my PC, I thought, Whoa, this sucks, but when I played it, boy was 
 I surprised! This should be recognized as a great game, yet it gets a bad rating just because it's 
 a pinball game! Come on people, pinball can be good too!
