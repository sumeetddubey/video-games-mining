:::Review:::
Eat your heart out in this undersea action game, in which you guide a fish around as it swallows 
 up anything smaller. Fun, simple gameplay makes this one a fine if brief diversion. 

  Feeding Frenzy is a fun little arcade action game about undersea Darwinism. What you do in it is 
 eat any fish that's smaller than you are, simply by guiding your fish around a small 2D area teeming 
 with undersea life -- and occasional explosive mines as well as pearl-bearing oysters, for good measure. 
 Power-ups temporarily speed you up and freeze all other fish in place, helping to keep things interesting. 
 The two modes of play let you munch through several dozen stages either against the clock or not. 
 The game's slippery feel fits the setting well, and your fish has a couple of abilities: It can 
 lunge forward or vacuum up anything in front of it at the touch of a button.  

          There's always fresh fish on the menu in Feeding Frenzy, a short-lived but compelling little 
 action game.     

  The game's graphics are simple, crisp, and colorful, especially in HD, and it's satisfying to watch 
 your fish grow bigger and bigger during the course of one of Feeding Frenzy's brief levels. The 
 chomping noises and upbeat soundtrack fit the game well, and the cartoony look makes this one suitable 
 for  Finding Nemo  fans of all ages.  

  Feeding Frenzy might not have what it takes to keep you coming back for more, but it provides simple, 
 addictive fun for an hour or two. A dozen unlockable achievements and online leaderboards entice 
 you to play through the main modes and then to stick around for a while to accomplish some tougher 
 challenges. One achievement is automatically unlocked after you've played the game for 10 hours, 
 but you probably wouldn't stick with Feeding Frenzy for nearly that long without the carrot-on-a-stick, 
 which is 20 additional gamer points. At about $10, the price of admission is a little steep for 
 this one, but you'll find it to be a nice, mindless diversion if you give it a shot.

Review:  feeding frenzy is a great game and includes many stages where of which you start off as a small 
 fish eat other to become bigger
  there are lotts of fish you have to eat on you way and you will encounter barracudas, sharks and 
 jellyfish along your journey.
  
  you can get a free 60 minute trial if you search for it on google there is also feeding frenzy 
 2 which is adzactly the same but a few minor changes
  overall feeding frenzy is a really addicting game.
  
  the graphics are terrible but there not 
 supposed to be the games major strongpoint.
  the gameplay is what really makes this game fun, addicting and more fun.
  you should check the 
 free trial out cause this game is wicked.
