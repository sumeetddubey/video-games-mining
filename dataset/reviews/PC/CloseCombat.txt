A typical day at the beach: the sand under your feet, the roar of the surf... and the ripping sound 
 of German machine guns as they cut your troops to pieces. 

 A typical day at the beach: the sand under your feet, the roar of the surf and the ripping 
 sound of German machine guns as they cut your troops to pieces. The beach is in Normandy. The date 
 is June 6th, 1944D-Day. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to take control 
 of either the German or American forces and rewrite history. Atomic Games, creators of the popular 
 V for Victory games, has joined with Microsoft to create one of the most innovative military simulations 
 on the market. Close Combat offers a real-time approach to warfare, delivering an experience you 
 may never forget. Close Combat's unique feature is the impact of combat psychology on the engagements. 
 Over a six-week period, your troops will gain experience, rise or sink in leadership, and pay a 
 price for their wounds. As their commander, you cannot simply order your troops to charge to their 
 deaths. They react realistically to stress on the battlefield, and few things are more stressful 
 than another human being's attempts to put bullet-sized holes in your body (if the psychology twist 
 starts to overwhelm you, though, you have the option to make your troops follow your every command 
 without question) .  

 The real-time aspect of Close Combat makes this a fascinating game. You give the orders as you go, 
 then see what happens. The scenarios force you to think on your feet. If you make bad decisions, 
 the frighteningly realistic screams of your dying troops will unnerve you. The chatter and roar 
 of guns on the battlefield can increase your stress level as well as that of your men. The Artificial 
 Intelligence shows flashes of brilliance, and can turn your men into heroes as well as cowards. 

 Close Combat looks slick. At first the numerous panels on the main display may seem confusing, but 
 the well-designed tutorials show you how to use them effectively. The control is of the drag-and-drop 
 approach; you select troops, give them basic commands, then tell them where to go. The battlefield 
 is incredibly detailed - muzzle flashes, smoke rounds, and the bodies sprawled in the rubble give 
 you an idea of your progress. I strongly encourage you to read the excellent manual, which provides 
 invaluable information on the tactics and history of the Normandy invasion, before plunging into 
 combat.   

 Microsoft and Atomic Games have set a new standard for games in this genre. Real-time combat, troops 
 that think, and an option for network play provide gamers with an opportunity to discover what 
 kind of commanders they really are. Will they be the next Patton... or the next Saddam Hussein? 
 Close Combat might benefit from additional scenarios, but everything else in the game is just fine.

Review:  Well well Microsoft made poi withs this game, I'm talking about a game of the year 1996 so maybe 
 if you buy it today you're going to say that game it's good. I played a lot of games and I still 
 playing it well why??
  
  The history of WWII is followed in a great form, there appear some real videos and some memorable 
 momments in the history so you can count with that point. Entering the game this first vesion of 
 Close Combat has good graphics you have a zoom that in my concept it's good, also the algorithm 
 of the morale of the troops it's good and the relation with the sound are great.
  
  About the graphics
  
  You need to understand that the graphics are from 1996 and they still 
 great, you have a zoom and you watch all the field except for the unknow places, also the craters 
 bombs and the support machines that you kill stay remains there also the soldiers (This in combat 
 and that is reasonable) .
  
  The Algoithm Well they had the idea of war and the made a good game for that, the soldiers act 
 like real trop that means that the will be scared and that's a trouble for you, also you can won 
 medals and your troops too. One important part of this game it's the idea of the weapons you can 
 kill a german tank with a sherman so you need to attack it so many times or in the back
  
  The sound One important part it's the sound, all the weapons has a real sound so you can count 
 with that. I recommend to buy this game you will be gald when you play it

Review:  When close combat came out, I had already had my fair share of Command and Conquer. But this was 
 totally dirrent from what I had been used to fron Command and Conquer. Close Combat gives you a 
 limited number of soldiers at the beginning of the battle, and you do not receive reinformencts 
 until the next mission. You had to be strategic and only use what you were initially allowed. I 
 remember the graphics for the time were amazing. You could tell what weapon each soldier had, and 
 his limbs. The surrounding environments were also amazing to look at. The sound was revolutionary 
 for its time. Birds chirping one minute, guns blazing the very next. I give this game a perfect 
 score, and I do not throw those arounding lightly.

Review:  This game was awesome when it first came out. It doesn't look too fancy compared to modern offerings, 
 but back then, I couldn't complain about it. 
  
  This game can be really hard and stupid decisions can lead to a total massacre of your own forces. 
 
  
  Basically, you command a few half-squad-size soldier elements either commanding the U. S. or the 
 Germans. The U. S. goal is to advance and take land while the German goal is to hold land and/or 
 slow down the U. S. advance. 
  
  It takes a bit of planning to get things a little bit right and lots of patience so that you don't 
 die all the time. This is no Command & Conquer where you just point and click. You must maneuver 
 your forces into position, taking heed of line of sight and cover, and hopefully find a position 
 to lay waste to the opposition. Easier said than done. A lone machine gun emplacement can rip up 
 your guys. 
  
  The sound is great for the time and the graphics are ok. I mean, this game came out in 1996, ok? 
 There are some videos to watch before each campaign part and they add some nice history to the 
 game.
  
  Overall, I would say that this game is excellent! If you have an older, slower system and actually 
 have a copy of this game, then have a blast! I tried playing it on Win XP with even an Athlon xp 
 1600 + and it was not fun to do.
