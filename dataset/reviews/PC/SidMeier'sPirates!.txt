:::Review:::
This is a triumphant remake of a classic strategy game, featuring an intoxicating blend of action, 
 strategy, role-playing, and pure fun. 

  The original Sid Meier's Pirates! is one of the famed designer's most beloved games, which is saying 
 a lot. After all, Meier is responsible for some of the greatest games ever made, most notably Civilization. 
 Sid Meier's Pirates!, first published in 1987, is renowned to this day for its addictive blend 
 of action, strategy, and role-playing. And the good news is, with this newly released remake, it's 
 clear that Sid hasn't lost the magic touch. This new Sid Meier's Pirates! is an amazing, wonderfully 
 lighthearted game that boasts an intoxicating blend of strategy and action, and as such it's a 
 dire threat to your professional and personal productivity.  

          The Caribbean is brought to life vividly, thanks to the beautiful and colorful graphics. 
     

  In Sid Meier's Pirates!, you play as a pirate out for revenge against the evil Spanish nobleman 
 who wronged your family. At least, that's your initial reason for going to sea. The beauty of Sid 
 Meier's Pirates! is that this open-ended strategy game lets you live the glorious life of a swashbuckler 
 your own way. You can pursue the career of a privateer, a treasure hunter, an explorer, or a trader. 
 More often than not, you'll dabble in all those fields at the same time. You'll sail the Spanish 
 main, trade broadsides with other ships, engage in dashing swordfights, search for buried treasure, 
 sneak into hostile towns, and dance with many a governor's daughter along the way. Your character 
 will age over time, so your ultimate goal is to amass as much fame and fortune as possible before 
 you retire, at which point your pirate will go into the hall of fame and you can start all over 
 again.  

  The game's prologue explains how your wealthy merchant family was imprisoned and how you escaped 
 as a young boy. Now, years later, it's up to you to save your family, vanquish the evildoers, and 
 get rich along the way. The first thing you'll do is choose a name for yourself, as well as a specialty, 
 such as sword fighting (which is useful in duels) , navigation (which makes you sail a bit faster) , 
 or wit and charm (which help your dancing skills) . You also select a nation to align yourself with, 
 which determines which ports are friendly to you, as well as a time period, which affects the starting 
 balance of power in the Caribbean. After that, you'll begin in your tiny ship in a great big sea 
 that's alive with commerce and activity.  

  Sid Meier's Pirates! is remarkably easy to pick up and play (in fact, you can practically play 
 the entire game without lifting your right hand from the numeric keypad on your keyboard) , yet 
 that simplicity belies a considerable amount of strategic depth. Your first stop will be in port, 
 where you can pick up a letter of marquee from the local governor, which basically gives you the 
 right to sink any ship not flying that nation's flag. You can also swing by the tavern to get the 
 latest gossip (which can reveal useful info, such as the sailing of a treasure ship) , purchase 
 a useful item from the mysterious guy in the corner, or hire a bunch of scurvy knaves for your 
 crew. After you check in with the shipwright, who patches up any damage and can upgrade various 
 components of your ship, you'll visit the local merchant, where you can provision your ship and 
 purchase or sell trade goods.  

  When sailing around the Caribbean, you can go anywhere, though you're limited by two constraints. 
 The first is food. You can carry only so much food, and the bigger your crew, the faster your food 
 will disappear. While this doesn't sound much of a problem, in an age when sailing voyages took 
 weeks and even months, it becomes an issue quickly. Thankfully, you can always pull into a friendly 
 port, or hijack a nearby vessel and commandeer its food. The other constraint is the morale of 
 your men. Your salty crew members expect a fair share of the plunder when the voyage is over, and 
 you'll have to keep them happy by bringing in the income -- otherwise they'll start to desert you 
 in droves.  

  What makes Sid Meier's Pirates! so compelling, though, is its exquisite pace. There's just so much 
 for you to do when you're sailing about the Caribbean, and you're never too far from accomplishing 
 some kind of goal, whether it's finding the final part of an important treasure map or chasing 
 down some dastardly nobleman who wronged your family. This pacing makes it easy to get drawn into 
 the game and even harder to stop playing -- you may well discover yourself looking up from the game 
 and realizing that you've spent the entire night playing. At the heart of the game is the sense 
 that it's essentially a series of enjoyable, fast-paced minigames stitched together. In the span 
 of half an hour, you can easily wage several ship battles, dance with numerous governors' daughters, 
 sneak into an enemy port, and dig up a stash of buried treasure.  

          Battles involve using the wind to maneuver yourself into position and then unleashing a 
 powerful broadside.     

  When your ship engages in battle, the game zooms in on the immediate patch of ocean (including 
 any nearby landmasses, rocks, and shoals) and you have to maneuver into position and then fire 
 broadsides at the enemy. These battles last only a couple of minutes at the most, but there's a 
 great deal of tactical depth to them, particularly at the harder difficulty levels. Not only is 
 the enemy more cunning at harder levels, but you must also factor in the constantly shifting wind, 
 which affects your ship's maneuverability. Ideally, if you're upwind of an opponent (which is called 
 "having the weather gauge") you can control the battle. And to capture a ship, you must use different 
 ammunition, including medium-range chain shot to destroy sails and rigging and short-range grape 
 shot to whittle down the opposing ship's crew. That last one is the most important, because if 
 you try to board a ship, there's a chance you'll have to fight its captain in a duel, triggering 
 the sword-fighting minigame. Defeat the captain and you can capture the ship and sail it into the 
 nearest port, where you can sell it and its cargo for a profit and then pay a visit to the governor 
 for your reward. You may also have the opportunity to dance with his daughter, and if you charm 
 her, she may reward you with a valuable piece of information. You'll then go out to sea to repeat 
 the cycle all over again.     

  Perhaps the most difficult minigames involve sword fighting and dancing, due to the fact that they 
 rely on fast reflexes. (This can be tough, especially since some strategy fans aren't used to twitch-based 
 games.) To keep things simple, sword fights are highly scripted in the sense that they all unfold 
 the same way. During a bar fight, for instance, if you're winning, you'll always knock your opponent 
 off the balcony, and if you're losing, he'll always chase you back up the stairs. Push him back 
 far enough and the barmaid will break a bottle over his head, knocking him out. The only thing 
 you have to worry about is timing the right swing at the right moment, and parrying or dodging 
 his swings. Meanwhile, during a dance, you have to quickly respond to the dance cues that your 
 partner gives you, or else you'll stumble and mess up. While both sword fighting and dancing can 
 be difficult at first, they get much easier once you learn to recognize the patterns. Plus, you 
 can purchase or acquire special items to make both minigames easier, such as a superbly balanced 
 sword that lets you swing faster or dancing slippers that give you more time to react to a cue. 

          Charm a lovely governor's daughter by dancing well and she'll reward you with something 
 valuable.     

  When you need to infiltrate a hostile port, you'll encounter the sneaking minigame, which is sort 
 of Pac-Man in reverse. Your goal is to skulk around the mazelike streets of a town, avoiding the 
 town watch. If captured, you'll be thrown into jail, where you'll rot for a few months before they 
 let you go. At the easier difficultly levels, dodging the guards is incredibly easy, but at the 
 harder levels, it's a lot tougher. Thankfully, you have a few moves at your disposal, such as the 
 ability to scale walls, knock out guards from behind, and duck behind bales of hay to hide. The 
 suspense can be high at times, especially when you narrowly weave between several guards.  

  Then there are the turn-based land battles that occur when you try to raid an enemy port or face 
 off against the main bad guy at the end of the rescue-your-family storyline. In these, you have 
 three kinds of units at your command: officers, sailors, and buccaneers. Officers and sailors are 
 melee units, while buccaneers are armed with muskets. In battles, you have to maneuver your units 
 to take advantage of the terrain and try to destroy or demoralize the enemy. You can flank enemies 
 or use the jungle as cover. Win the battle, and you will not only plunder the town, but you'll 
 also have the ability to switch its allegiance, thus earning you points with a particular faction. 

  The Caribbean of Sid Meier's Pirates! is a colorful place, and the game approaches the subject 
 matter with a light touch. The pirates are charming rogues who like to sing drinking songs, the 
 stuffy army officers are bombastic buffoons, and the ladies are all lovely. In other words, these 
 are sorts of characters who would feel at home in an Errol Flynn movie or  Pirates of the Caribbean 
 . The game has a beautiful art style that's simple, clean, and packed with all sorts of graphical 
 frills. The cotton sails on your ship softly glow in the warm sun, and beneath the glittery ocean 
 water you can see dolphins and porpoises swimming in your ship's wake. The game's audio effects 
 are also lighthearted and soothing, from the sound of water lapping against wooden hulls to the 
 distant crack of cannons firing. Above it all is the game's wonderful soundtrack, which mixes historical 
 tunes with memorable original themes. It also helps that the characters in Sid Meier's Pirates! 
 speak in a sort of The Sims-like gibberish, which adds to the game's overall charm.  

          The map keeps track of all your accomplishments and failures, as well as the lovely ladies 
 who have crossed your path.     

  Sadly, Sid Meier's Pirates! didn't make it out of the shipyard without a few flaws. The game suffers 
 from some minor stability issues, which caused it to crash on one of our test systems every few 
 hours. Thankfully, the game autosaves every time you enter port or battle, so you never lose much 
 progress when it crashes. You can save the game manually as well, though you're not allowed to 
 name saved games, which can cause a little confusion, especially when you have multiple characters. 
 There's also no multiplayer, which is a noticeable omission, since it would have been fun if you'd 
 been able to go head-to-head against another player in the naval battles. Finally, the game is 
 incredibly easy on the beginning difficulty levels, so you'll need to ramp up the difficulty level 
 to find the appropriate level of challenge.  

  Nevertheless, this is still a completely engrossing strategy game that will easily consume countless 
 hours. While the average pirate career might last only about 5 to 10 hours, there's tons of replay 
 value here, as you can play on harder difficulty levels, try out different approaches, and check 
 out different sailing eras. With its engrossing gameplay, impeccable pacing, and charming presentation, 
 Sid Meier's Pirates! is quite simply one of the most enjoyable games to come out in years.

Review:  I got this game at Wal-Mart for $10. So I was like.. what the heck, I might as well try it. Anyway, 
 it doesn't take too long to get use to all the controls. they are pretty basic. the graphics in 
 this game look pretty good for a 2004 game. 
  
  You as a pirate go looking for treasure, then you dance with the ladies, fight other pirates, and 
 other pirate stuff. I played this game for many hours in a row. I was still on my first pirate. 
 Once I started getting older, it was getting harder to fight becuase of his age. I was the 1st 
 top pirate and was plundering cities and everything. It gets repetitve for awhile, but it was a 
 game that lasted me for a few weeks which I am glad. It was worth the money. In 2004 I think it 
 would have been worth the money also.
  
  Other then that, it's a good game if you want to entertain yourself for awhile before the next 
 video game comes out!

Review:  Pirates have existed for thousands of years, but the pirates that we commonly associate are those 
 sea-lovin', treasure-huntin' free spirits that roamed the Caribbean Sea during the colonization 
 of the surrounding lands and isles by the Europeans hundreds of years ago. The pirate life has 
 been the focus of many literary works, films and other forms of media, which have inspired our 
 imaginations. Oh, if only we could've lived the pirate life ourselves. Well, give this game a shot. 
 Sid Meier's Pirates! might be the game for you. 
  
  Gameplay: What makes Sid Meier's Pirates! Such an enjoyable game is the fact that it is really 
 open-ended. You start out as a pirate, along with a ship on the Caribbean waters. From there, it's 
 really up to you. You may outrank other well-known pirates to be the most fearsome of them all, 
 search for treasures, ally with the British, French, Dutch or the Spanish, conquer and pillage 
 towns, fall in love with a governor's daughter, search for your missing family members, and defeat 
 the one who held them captive. 
  
  The game is very easy to grasp, for all you need is a mouse, and the number pad on your keyboard. 
 For example, there is no running through town, trying to find where you need to go. Instead, you 
 get a simple-to-understand menu, one saying "Go to Tavern", and the other "Go to Shipwright". The 
 game is made up of mini-games, using the same interface. Sword fighting is quite simple; you only 
 need the keys on your number pad to tell the commands. One tells you to jump, the other to duck. 
 Though this might be too simple for some players, on higher levels, your opponents get a bit more 
 of an advantage.
  
  The only other bad thing I could think of about this game is the fact that sailing the seemingly 
 never-ending seas can become tedious, so a fast forward option wouldn't be such a bad idea.
  
  The game is very simple and easy to understand; its open-endedness and its higher levels offer 
 high replayability and a challenge. Plus, the fact that you get to play a pirate is fun in its 
 own right.
  
  Graphics: Like many Firaxis titles, Pirates! Has a very colourful, stylized look to it. With the 
 use of bold colours, very well animated and entertaining cutscenes, battles, fights, and characters, 
 the game gladly invites you into a world of a pirate, even if the graphics look a bit blocky. Maybe 
 that's the reason the game runs smoothly, unlike other games, where a lot of clutter and detail 
 on the screen, causing the game to slow down. That's another plus.
  
  Sound: Along with such a vivid and bold look, Pirates! comes with great music and sound of the 
 same quality. From cannon blasts, sail-carrying winds, and slashing from swords, the game comes 
 with almost every sound imaginable for a game about the pirate life. The characters speak in gibberish, 
 which is good, because it is done in a very expressive, and at times, entertaining way.
  
  Music is in good supply and quality here, ranging from flamenco music once reaching a Spanish port, 
 a climatic piece chronicling a sea battle as you fire away your cannons, dance music when dancing 
 with the governor's daughter, and a silent and suspicious piece as you sneak into an enemy town 
 at night.
  
  A great array of sounds which makes this life of a pirate all the more better.
  
  Value: The 
 game still holds its value, despite it being a game released back in 2004. The game has a high 
 replayability and a lot of fun; it will make you want to come back for more. So for a game that's 
 about $20, that's a bargain. A great addition to anyone's collection.
  
  Tilt: What do you expect? I love the game.
  
  Conclusion: I honestly can say that I have never 
 tried the original Pirates! game. However, the new game will certainly welcome newcomers to the 
 series quite easily. The game is simple, not very complex, but makes up that by being so open-ended 
 and challenging. Very recommendable to pirate-lovers and adventurers. In conclusion, a game that's 
 just plain fun.

Review:  I really wanted to like this game, I've been in the mood for a good pirate game, this isnt it though.
 
  
  It looks nice and sounds good but the gameplay is very shallow, and unrewarding.
  
  The mini games, fencing and dancing are kinda fun for an hour or two than they become somthing 
 that just has to be done to move on.
  
  Ship battles kinda look cool and are fun for a bit, but theres no point to it. Why blow an enemy 
 ship to hell (reducing its value) when you can just ram into it, sword fight the captain and take 
 it in pristine condition. Which leads to even more fencing - boring, and easy... did I mention boring? 
 There are other things to do in the game but they're not even worth mentioning.
  
  All the places you visit are boring and repetative.
  Talking to the NPCs are boring. The quests 
 are boring. The accumulation of wealth, ships, titles, land... all boring, shallow, pointless.
 
  
  The storyline quest is ok once, it never changes, and isnt very engaging, hence boring. 
  
 
  One thing I really hated was not being able to pan out far enough to see where the hell you're 
 sailing to.
  
  Bottom line:
  The game was cool for about 3 hrs, then ok for 3 more. It now rests in the lower right desk drawer 
 where all the highly rated crappy games that I've foolishly purchased go.
  
  Why it scored as well as it did is too frustrating to ponder.
  
  Enough said... now back to 
 Mount&Blade, the funnest game Ive played for years (scored a 6.0, go figure)

Review:  I played one of the originals for the NES back in the day. For the simplicity of the game, it was 
 quite fun. I can still recall many of the historical cities in the Mediterranean thanks to this 
 game.
  
  Playing the game is simple enough and you don't need twitch skills or a strategic mind to have 
 fun. Your character interacts with other characters in a limited yet hilarious way using babble 
 language (Chubain!) . The graphics are well done and only slightly cartoonish. This is definitely 
 not a simulation type shipbattle game. The battles where you storm cities take forever. In the 
 old game, all you had to do was to lure the entire defending army to attack one group that was 
 located far away from the town on the battle screen. You then hide the rest of your army in the 
 trees between your army and the defending army and watch them get wiped out completely. But that 
 is a different story, er game...
  
  In this one you can save just before you reach someone you are either trying to rescue or attack 
 because they usually give you pieces to important maps. If you don't like the map, just do the 
 battle or rescue all over again. This is the /easy card. The other part that makes this game easy 
 is if you join the right time period and choose anyone but the Spanish. The other three countries 
 are almost always at war with the Spanish and they have all the good cities to attack, and more 
 treasure ships.
  
  The game can be made more difficult by upping the difficulty level to 3-4 different levels. All 
 in all, this game is definitely worth $20, even $30. The fun isn't endless as it doesn't change 
 much, but I find myself coming back to play it more often than other games I have lying around.

Review:  Sid Meier's Pirates (By Sid Meier) is, put simply, an extremely fun game created by Sid Meier, 
 the mastermind behind the life stealing series Sid Meier's Civilization (Also By Sid Meier) and 
 co-founder of Firaxis games.
  
  The game has a story which you can really choose whether to follow or not, said story starting 
 off when your character, as a young boy, and his family are celebrating the coming of a fleet that 
 will end their debt to the antagonist of the game, sadly the antagonist (Who is obviously a terrible 
 gate crasher) bursts in with the rather suspicious news that the fleet has been lost, and that 
 it is time for the debt to be payed and presses the family into bondage, unsurprisingly you character 
 avoids the guards and runs off into the night. Years later (I can't remember how many, either 10 
 or 8) your character strides into a tavern, now looking a bit like a young Errol Flynn, asking 
 for passage to the new world, after filling in a form (A not so cunningly disguised character creation 
 screen) , picking a nationality, and taking over a ship, you are left in your ship outside a town 
 of your nationality in the Carribean, from here on out you can play as you like in an open world.
 
  
  There are several different systems, one for ship battles, one for sword fights, one for dancing, 
 one for exploring, and one for land battles, but they all follow a basic control system and are 
 great fun, especially the sword fights which have to be one of my favourate systems in all of gaming. 
 But this is where the game gets confusing for me, despite all the different things you can do, 
 this is definatly one of the most repetetive games I've ever played, but despite this I love it, 
 and thats just something I can't understand.

Review:  This is a fun game to start with but then it gets old. You have the same kind of mini games over 
 and over and over again. There is no story line at all and so it just makes seem to drag after 
 a while. I just feel like the lack of objective and the lack of story kills it. If the family member 
 sure had some dialogue that went with it that could help. I just have gotten bored with it and 
 it has been less then a month.
  
  I just get tired of dancing with the same girls over and over to learn the same information that 
 my sister is in the hands of a baron in "this" town. Or that there is a crock in this town.
  
  The fights are simple and the lack of interaction in the towns gets really boring after a while 
 you can only do 3 different kinds of things and there are only a few people to talk to in town

Review:  Very Charming and VERY Addictive!
  
  In the begaining of the game you can select one of 5 difficulty levels as well as a skill that 
 your especially good at (sailing, dancing, swordfighting or a couple others) .
  
  This game has just about everything you could want a Pirate game to have: Governor's daughters 
 to woo, balls to attend, 4 different factions to interact with, lots of treasure to be sought out 
 and dug up, main storyline quests (to search out and find your missing relatives) , and TONS of 
 ships to destroy/rob/take over. 
  
  You can attack any ship and depending on what faction the ship is (either English, Spanish, Dutch 
 or French) you will get reputation and points with whichever faction is at war with that particular 
 ship and at the same time will be gaining hate from that ships supporters... and become hated by 
 them and if you continue to attack a particular faction they will put a bounty on your head that 
 will continue to grow as you continue to attack them.
  
  There are a lot of side quests that can consist of escorting new governors, finding the hidden 
 Incan village, getting revenge against the ones who broke your family up when you were a child 
 and more.
  
  I think everyone who tries this game can find something to love about it. So with that said if 
 you haven't tried it yet I highly recommend it for your next game purchase!

Review:  This game basicly is plain fun and will suck you in.
  From the awsome pirate ship battles and if you strike them with your ship you have a sword battle 
 with the captain, to storming a town and making it have a new king, sneaking into towns because 
 the Spanish (for ex.) don't like you and won't allow you in their town. Just a whole lot of fun.
 
  
  This game also has lots of interactivity, you can buy equipment for yourself and upgrade your ship, 
 do side quests, find tresures, find lost cities, find lost family members, romance a king's daughter 
 and marry her, and sometimes you may have to save her because she gets kidnapped by some random 
 bad guy, and kill the most wanted pirates! How cool does that sound?!?
  So for people who like or don't even like this kind of genre for a game, you have to pick this 
 up!!

Review:  When i back to play this game i say "wow, just like Pirates of the Caribbean", and the game is 
 amaxing, just like that movie, you can do every thing just like a pirate, find teasures, escape 
 of prision, have a battle on a boat, married with the princesses, have a good sword- fight and 
 do what do you want!. In some cases it gets highly addictive, with the fact of be a pirate, and 
 be that it's really cool.
  
  Well, the gameplay it's really cool, handling a boat, have fights, dance, have a shot ith the guys 
 of the castles, get being the best pirate ever!.
  
  Graphics: it rocks, it's awesome the graphics, for the water, the teasures, the fights, the boat 
 shots, its just unvelibeble the emiotion of this game can give to you.
  
  Sound: it innovative this game and why not the sound? this have some screams of the players, the 
 gun shots, the voice, the civilians, it's amazing.........

Review:  Gameplay: in many ways the game is very close to the original - so close that parts of the manual 
 and script are verbatim from the original game. The only thing missing is the command a famous 
 expedition option from the original game. These six short, scripted missions were delightful. The 
 game suffers from the omission. Well the plot is pretty much the game, Evil Colonel Mendoza goes 
 around the Caribbean and kidnaps all the governors' daughters that you court. He keeps the daughters 
 in his forecastle, which looks surprisingly like the abandoned cabins where evil Baron Raymondo 
 has hidden away your sister, uncle, aunt and grandfather. At one point I had twenty Colonel Mendozas 
 sailing the seas. I found four of them sailing in formation north of Santiago. As in the original 
 game, you can start out on a French, Spanish, English, or Dutch vessel. Nationality, historical 
 age, and difficulty choice determine your starting ship for the game. So then you go around the 
 Caribean doing quests, courting goventers daughters, Attacking towns, trade with towns and find 
 kidnapped goveners daughters. The controls are quite easy to manage just the four arrow on your 
 keyboard and thats about it to move around. When you also get to do some fenceing with other captains. 
 Fencing is different. The original game used the 1 through 9 buttons of the numeric keypad to deal 
 the nine side-view fencing moves: high, mid-level and low slash, thrust and defense. The new fencing 
 game uses seven keys for thrust and parry, chop and jump, slash and duck, and taunt. Number pad 
 controls for all games was best - while mouse control worked on menus in the mini games, the mouse 
 was a liability. Graphics: The graphics are quite good in this game, they are colorful and vibrant 
 and everything moves quite smoothly and nicely.. They are all in 3-D but the over view of the map 
 is in 2-D. Sound: The soundtrack is quite good to listen to and it fits the game well. Also the 
 sounds of the ships on the water, gun fire and sword clashes all sound good and sound like they 
 should sound. To bad there is no voice acting in this game which I would of liked to hear/see.
 
  
  Value: This game has ok replay value. Once you have gone though the game once then you have pretty 
 much done every thing. It can be pretty repetative in the fighting and visiting the taverns that 
 mostly look the same. I would of liked to see a little more veriaty with the fighting, boats and 
 tavers and towns your visit. Don't get me wrong this is a good game but it just get a little repetative 
 at times. I give this game 8.5 out of 10.

Review:  Booting up Sid Meier's Pirates! after so many years felt just like coming home since my old gaming 
 days of playing Pirates! on an Apple IIe in my school computer lab, and for about eight hours I 
 had one of the best times of my life. There's a lot of old school charm here, wrapped in a cheery, 
 colorful new package. But after a while I began to realize that I'd seen all there was to see and 
 done all there was to do. I saw just how much gaming has changed since I used to conquer Port Royal 
 in the days of mono-chrome, and how much Sid Meier's Pirates! tries to stay relevant by adding 
 new bells and whistles (in every sense of the phrase) but ultimately changing little, like an aging 
 pirate wench who wears too much makeup. There's a vestigial plot here, but you have to look for 
 it. Nominally, your mission is to track down the scattered members of your once-influential family 
 and avenge yourself upon the scabrous dog responsible. Really all you're after is enough fame and 
 treasure to put yourself on the high score board as the wealthiest and most feared pirate to ever 
 shiver some timbers. After so many years, I'd almost forgotten what it's like to compete for a 
 high score. I haven't done that since I played Galaga on an arcade machine. You'll notice quickly 
 that there's just no depth here, just a lot of minigames tacked onto a world map that get repetitive, 
 fast. Most towns look the same except for the flag over the port, and you'll barely notice any 
 difference as you go to the same tavern in every port-o-call in the Caribbean and find the exact 
 same people waiting for you in the exact same tables. The plot boils down to traveling, collecting 
 map pieces by trouncing the same bad guy multiple times until you have all of them, and then beating 
 up another guy to rescue a member of your family, repeated dozens of times. Naval combat is beyond 
 simplistic, boiling down simply to who has the most guns -- if you even care to trade fusillades 
 of cannonades with your opponent. Most often you'll just want to end it quickly and crash headlong 
 into their broadsides and defeat their captain in the numbingly easy swordfighting minigame, which 
 you'll master in about five minutes, allowing you to prevail against the most lopsided odds. Courting 
 the ladies is another cute minigame which, while fun for a while, is similarly pointless. Sid Meier's 
 Pirates! offers up a lot of freedom, something you'd expect in a game about looting and pillaging, 
 but with its G-rated facade and repetitive nature, it ends up feeling like half a game with the 
 holes crudely patched with cheap minigames that favor simple timing memorization or sheer force 
 of numbers. I can't help but wish the game was more goal-oriented, offered more varied missions 
 and depth of gameplay.

Review:  At my friend's house, I first saw this game. I was enchanted by all the things you can do in here.
 
  
  This is the ultimate open-ended game. There are four nations: French, English, Dutch and those 
 Spaniards. At first, you choose a nation and get a letter of marque saying you can blow up whoever's 
 in their way. Then, you can turn traitor or sail for them or just be a peaceful trader. Ship battles 
 are lots of fun with a great control scheme using just the number key pad. Sword fighting is delightful. 
 You can even woo governors' daughters. [very fun] There are tons of side missions you can do and 
 you don't even have to carry out the task if you're lazy [like me] The taverns are very awesome 
 giving you a chance to recruit, get the inside scoop and pick up some cool items. When you get 
 old and cranky [in the game] you can retire and you get a new career depending on how successful 
 a pirate you are. It leaves you hanging by not letting you take a go at your new career but I understand 
 that that would be too hard. Sure Sid Meier's Pirates has a story line that you can follow, but 
 all the other things you can do in the game is much better than rescuing your family members.
 
  
  The graphics in pirates were pretty good. I had no cause for complaint. There were some glitches 
 though that I learned to ignore.
  
  The sound was AWESOME. I loved the music and I want it to be downloadable on Itunes. The cannon 
 and sword clanging noises were great and the in-port music was cleverly different on how prosperous 
 that city was. Sid Meier's Pirates is in my opinion one of the best P. C games ever made. It would 
 be a lot of fun to see it on the Wii or maybe a sequel on the P. C. Once you beat it , you'll find 
 yourself wanting to go back and immerse yourself in the world of Pirates!

Review:  Good: Fun action and strategy, very addicting, nice graphics, and a open world.
  
  Bad: Long load time, stability issues.
  
  Overall: I recommend this game to all of those that 
 like role-playing and strategy. No two games are the same. A lot of replay value with this game, 
 and the outcome is based upon your game play and decisions you make. Some things a little annoying 
 with the game, it did have the tendency go freeze at times, and also was a little repetitive. Despite 
 this, I still found myself playing the game at 4 in the morning. I recommend this game to anyone 
 that likes strategy or role playing games.

Review:  At first thought, I was never really into pirates or sailing. Things I enjoy about video games 
 however, are things like, great graphics, re-playability, great strategy and open-endedness. This 
 game combines all of that and more. One of my favorite aspects of this game is how lighthearted 
 it is. Even when you are decimating an opponents ship with your cannons, the enemy sailors just 
 seem to fly overboard into this clear blue water. It looks almost cartoon-ish and fun, even though 
 they just got wasted with forty 50 lb. cannon balls. From trading goods, to ransacking villages, 
 to searching maps for buried treasure, to searching for long lost family, and most important, trying 
 to hook up with the Governors daughters, this game has great replayability and will thoroughly 
 entertain the most critical gamer, because its just plain fun!

Review:  Pirates is a well done, easy going time killer. You sail through the Caribbean doing searching 
 for you kidnapped family, but the main quest takes a back seat. You will be able to gain promotions 
 in one of the 4 nations by capturing (or sinking) their enemies ships, or ransacking their enemies 
 towns.
  
  The game takes an easy going approach, killing is not rampant, there is no blood what so ever, 
 people have odd voices, and everything appears nice and bright. To me this gives it a less serious 
 environment and a perfect game to unwind with. It does get a little repetitive sometimes.
  
  Unlike other RPGs, pirates will not make you hung up on your character. If lose a save file 
 or just want to start over again you know it will be fairly easy to get what you want. The only 
 ships that are really hard to find are ships of the line.
  
  As stated above, its fairly easy to get what you want, even on the hardest setting. Thus the game 
 is a little easy, but as I said, its an easygoing game.
  
  Pirates is not a RPG or game for someone that wants a deep story and interesting characters, weapons, 
 and armor. Its a game for someone that wants a break from that form that, even if just for a small 
 bit.

Review:  I was a high school student when the original was released on C64. That game could only be called 
 as a ''revolution'' ; no game has ever captured the same attention from a game maniac like me since...
 
  And now I finally get my hands on the ''modern'' version.... still fun with the same sense of humour. 
 I spent 8 full hours enjoying every single moment and recalling my memories. But there's one huge 
 problem: The Pirates! is nothing different than a modernised version of the classic - there's almost 
 nothing new in the game that can be called as a solid addition. (well yes there's the part that 
 you dance with the governors' daughters but hey, who cares?)
  I realise that I've grown up - maybe too old to play computer games - but shouldn't a gaming mastermind 
 like Sid Meier have designed new solid additions to his all time masterpiece? He probably thought 
 that the game was perfect already; which is almost a %100 correct thought but there's always room 
 for improvement in gaming industry especially if the original was released almost 20 years ago!
 
  Still a classic - get it!

Review:  This game isn't difficult, you can learn to play in 20 minutes. You are pirate and you must revenge 
 your family. You earn promotions, find treasures, lost city, attacks enemy ships and town, charming 
 guvernor's daughters and so many other things. But when you find all your family this game become 
 boring and monotone. But you can always attacks other ships and take gold.
  Gameplay and graphics are great, sound is good but there isn't multiplayer.
  With multiplayer 
 this game become best adventure.
  Everyone who like adventures and pirates this game is reason to stay at home and play it all day 
 :D

Review:  I've been looking for a decent pirate game but havent found one that interests me till now. I looked 
 at the screenshots of this game several time but the cartoony graphics kinda turned me off. I will 
 say they look better in person and the screenshots really doesnt do the game justice. I am just 
 starting to get the hang of it so I'm no expert on this game but it really isnt that hard to figure 
 out. It appears to have lots of quests so many hours of gameplay awaits. though one thing I have 
 noticed already is some repeditiveness in the game. Oh well , what can you expect from a game that 
 came out in 2004? After looking at the box several times in best buy over the years i finally decided 
 to pick it and it is well worth the price! Still, always on the lookout for something better.....

Review:  Ever single human being wished to either be a pirate or a commando as a child, this is fact. This 
 game helps bring one of those dreams to life (play Contra for the other) . In the game you are a 
 pirate out to avenge your family, but who really does that? The real fun is looting, pillaging, 
 and dancing to your hearts content. Blackbeard's over on an island north you say? I'll get right 
 there after i buy my new cannon and dig up the gold on that island. While the games visuals aren't 
 especially pretty, they do there job well enough. A game this varied is worth every penny you spend, 
 which at this point shouldn't be to much. I can tell you one thing for certain, this game is better 
 than a swift kick in the jewels by a midget at a black sabbath concert, so just go out and get 
 it!

Review:  I like the game a lot but aging in a game just kind of makes the game boring and not worth playing 
 you get all excited then your player gets old and the greatness wears off the point of a game is 
 that fantasy takes over and reality takes a back seat aging ruins a game in my opinion. If they 
 took aging out of this game I could play it forever. And the sailing gets annoying every now and 
 then but for the most part i can deal with that kind of makes it more realistic but it would be 
 nice if the wind shifted every now and then the wind is always blowing to the left which is a little 
 odd in my opinion.

Review:  Pirates! Live the Life is a swashbucklers ultimate digital fantasy. It hearkens back to the day 
 when gaming was innocent and for everyone of a mind. Sid Meiers Pirates! Live the Life is a remake 
 of the original Pirates! which happened to be on floppy disks, yes diskettes!
  
  You play pirate John (or whomever you decide to name him) . A privateer set out to find fortune 
 and fame, along with the hearts of governors daughters. Along the way you will venture into English, 
 French, Spanish and Dutch ports, venture into indigenous Indian villages, ancient Incan and Mayan 
 cities, and friendly if misguided Jesuit colonies. One of my only complaints with Pirates! is the 
 necessity of dancing with the governors daughters. I utterly hated the repetitive dance moves, 
 the music, and the daughters! Its necessary because they give you hints and objects if you woo 
 them well enough, but beware the annoying dance floor. The gameplay is simple, and easy to quickly 
 sit down and pick up, even if youve never played the original Pirates! Basically the entire game 
 can be controlled with the keyboard, and most of it is done with the Numeric pad. There is a legend 
 at the lower right that contains all your controls at all times, the F-keys (F1, F2, F3, etc) control 
 your status windows for items, quests and fleet status. You can control a fleet of up to eight 
 vessels on the high seas and hundreds (thousands if youre particularly talented) of pirates in 
 strategic land battles. The open sea is where you will spend most of your time, fighting the winds 
 and navigating by ragged old maps (the in-game map is quite polished) ; in an effort to cross large 
 stretches of water. Trips spanning months will make your crew unhappy, therefore you must keep 
 a steady stream of booty to keep them happy on those long voyages. Youll also find objects of 
 luxury and wonder to make them happier on long voyages. There are 10 top pirates in the game, all 
 with deadly ships and large well maintained crews, and their own special sword fighting tactics. 
 One of your goals is to become number one on the top pirates list, the rest of the goals are mostly 
 up to you, this game is extremely open ended and caters to almost any gamers desire to do what 
 they want. You can spend your time blasting other ships into oblivion with your 48 cannon Ship 
 of the Line pirate vessel, or ripping into the enemys sails so as not to damage the hull and the 
 goods on board, making it easier to take bigger hauls of the loot. Or you can ram the enemy vessel 
 and board their ship, where each crew faces off against each other as you face the enemy captain 
 in one-on-one swordplay, where your reflexes, wits, and indeed weapons will win the day. If youre 
 not a fighting sort, you can alternately spend your time looking for buried treasure, or buying 
 goods at low prices, sailing across the sea and selling them where theyre needed most at very 
 high prices, and this can be quite profitable. You can also take it upon yourself as I did, to 
 destroy the English and French and make the Spanish the dominate face of the Caribbean, by going 
 to each town, making them angry enough to hunt you, and then attacking and destroying them in decisive 
 land battles. Once the town is won, you can appoint a governor of your choosing (of a nation youre 
 affiliated with) and then worry about defending it and making it prosper. The only thing holding 
 you back is time, your pirate ages and the months you spend at sea make him get older, slower, 
 and it becomes much harder and almost impossible to win a sword fight. You can privateer into your 
 golden years if you like, but youll find it increasingly (very) hard to find crew that wants to 
 join an old man, and that your sword arm is so agonizingly slow you just want to jump off the plank 
 on your own. If you loose the sword fight I might add, you lose your ships too. Ive only scratched 
 the surface of the gameplay in Pirates!: Live the Life, there are many more things to do and far 
 more depth to be reached, however the beauty of it is that you dont have to, you can spend your 
 time doing whatever you want, and still be successful.
  
  The graphics in Pirates! are very pretty, the lush blue ocean and all the little ambient details 
 like the semi transparent water against the hull, the foam wake behind the boats, the dolphins 
 riding the wake and jumping out of the water, the little white clouds and the storm clouds. It 
 all adds to the atmosphere and the new graphics engine has done a very good job of making it feel 
 like youre in the Caribbean sailing on a pirate ship. The new 3D engine brings realism to the 
 game, but still respects what made the original fun, and youll immediately see the old style graphics 
 do not hinder the very thing that makes Pirates! what it is, amazing open ended gameplay.
  
  The sound is just as enveloping as the new graphics engine and also is integral to making you 
 feel like you are there. You hear ambient things like waves, birds, masts creaking, the wind blowing 
 in the sails, storms, squalls, sails ripping with chain shot, the immersive audio bits are endless. 
 My only complaint, and one that is only an annoyance because its pretty much necessary, is all 
 the governors and their daughters that you talk to, are voiced but it isnt speech, its more like 
 old cartoons where they talk gibberish with fake gibberish accents. Annoying as this is, there 
 isnt much point in making them speak fluent Spanish or Dutch as nobody would understand it anyway, 
 and it would have driven costs up for the voice talent. The replay value in Pirates! is one of 
 its best features. Due to the open ended gameplay, the fact you can play in different time periods 
 with different economic situations, and the different difficulty settings actually making it harder, 
 it is a worthy title of the herald re-playable. Very addictive gameplay, and easy to pick up and 
 go even if you have never played it before. The open ended non-linear gameplay keeps you coming 
 back for more, but overall its just extremely fun. Everyone should try Pirates! Live the Life, 
 even if they arent a big pirate fan, its just one of those games that is easy to enjoy. Good 
 job again Sid.

Review:  There's much to expect when a game comes from Sid Meier, and this is it. The game has got every 
 aspect that you would look for in a pirate game, from sea battles to sword fighting to even dancing.
 
  
  The game play is smooth, enabling the player to use a mouse, arrow keys or number pad on all aspects 
 of the game. Also there is almost no lag at all, and I haven't had a crash yet. There is much to 
 do, from finding your lost relatives and hunting down wanted criminals, to searching for treasure 
 and famous pirates like Black Beard. It may seem small but the area of play is roughly from as 
 north as St. Augustine to as far south as what is present day Venezuela; the west edge is Mexico 
 to east edge being St. Lucia. The level setting is fairly well balanced from the easiest setting 
 being almost too easy, to the hardest setting being almost too challenging for veteran game players.
 
  
  The graphics are what is to be expected for a game by Sid. They're not pixilated, and are well 
 detailed in showing the cannon doors opening/closing on the ship during a sea battle. The only 
 down fall is that there isn't many variables in the ships, and other characters; only offering 
 what seems to be about 5 to 7 different looks of each, even though there is many more than that.
 
  
  Sound quality is top notch; the ambient noise doesn't get annoying and is actually there. After 
 you plunder other ships your crew sings Yo Ho and while sword fighting after a good blow is made, 
 the character makes a grunt while a crowd laughs or ohs. There is not much music variety but hey, 
 its the 1600s so there wasn't much to begin with, and thats what your cd player is for.
  
  I bought it just recently so I purchased it for around twenty bucks, and its worth every penny, 
 if you see it for more you may want to shell out the extra. As the time I spent is nearing 50plus 
 hours you can see that I has great replay.

Review:  Ill start with the gameplay seeing as its the main draw to Pirates!. Rather than feelings like 
 a cohesive bunch of gameplay elements, Pirates feels like a bunch of mini-games linked with a pirate 
 theme. Sailing is controlled by the arrow keys, sea battles are much of the same except for the 
 options or changing cannon types and when to fire. Duels are done in almost a rock-paper-scissor 
 fashion as there is always a move that beats the other along with a matching defensive move. Then 
 theres dancing, the trading, and invading cities. All these modes alone are well done but that 
 still doesnt stop from giving me the feeling that the game isnt really a total, solid experience.
 
  
  The visuals of the sailing are more than adequate, dozens of ships sail by, clouds pass over head 
 and schools of dolphins playfully chase ships. When the game actually zooms in to your hero, whether 
 hes dancing or dueling, the graphics take a bit of a hit. Theyre clear, crisp and clean, but 
 they are also a bit blocky. Other graphics in the game are along the same lines. Nothing too impressive 
 here.
  
  The spoken language of the time seems to be a simlish like language. However the sound effect 
 and music are spot on. While the music isnt of epic fare like that of Pirates of the Caribbean, 
 its more than suitable given the quality of the rest of the game.
  
  I suppose the best part of the game is the fact that there are a bunch of things to do while youre 
 sailing around; finding relatives, expanding your wealth, trading, chasing pirates, stopping baddie. 
 These quests are all available from the outset of the game and are ready to be pursued at any time 
 you please. Completing each one will add to your fame rating as a little way to show off everything 
 youve completed. In the end the game is easy to beat depending on what you want out of it. My 
 first save I tried to rack up money and fame and my second save I just went after Montalbon to 
 avenge my family and to get the main conflict out of the way. It was a pretty good time, it just 
 lacked the sense of adventure I was looking for in a pirate game.

Review:  Gameplay
  
  Sid Meier's Pirates! is an easy game to learn, and in no time you'll be pillaging ships and swordfighting 
 with the top pirates in the Caribbean. The control system fits the game nicely, using the numpad 
 to navigate your ship and the 1,2,7 and 9 buttons for other commands, like firing your weapons 
 and adjusing your sails. It may be difficult at first to remember all these commands, but they 
 always appear at the bottom-right side of the screen should you forget.
  
  Graphics
  
  Unfortunately for me I can't run Pirates with the maximum graphics detail, but that doesn't bother 
 me too much and it shouldn't bother anyone else with a low-end computer. Ships look great, and 
 the pirating world is pleasing on the eyes, so no complaints can really be made here.
  
  Sound
  
  All the usual piratey tunes are here (whey, hey, up she rises! etc) which do a wonderful 
 job of enhancing the realism factor of the game, and the firing of ships cannons and the sound 
 of swords clashing among other effects sound great. I find that the only letdown is the voice acting 
 - there is none. When you visit the Govenor of an island you'll receive an incoherent grunt as 
 a greeting, so this brings the score down a little.
  
  Value
  
  When Sid Meier's Pirates! was first released (at around the &pound;40 mark) I would have given 
 this a lower score than I'm giving now, because the game can become repetative and the main story 
 mode is a little on the short side. However, because you can now buy it for half the original price 
 it's definately a game worth getting.

Review:  Right off the bat, the manual for Sid Meier's Pirates was fun to read, and the game itself didn't 
 disappoint at all. There are many different aspects to what you can do in the game, all of which 
 offer a different element of game play: sword-fighting; ship battles; trading; the turn-based strategy 
 of the land battles; the 'Pac Man'-esque sneaking into town, etc. It all makes for a rousing pirate 
 adventure. The only quibbles I have are that the ship speeds are too slow when going against the 
 wind for long distances... not that they should be fast, but there should be a speed up time option 
 to get you where you're going in better time. Also, it's nice to have to gather the pieces of the 
 treasure maps, but it would have been nice if it was a little more challenging to actually find 
 the treasure once you have the map.
  
  Otherwise, the only other drawback is that there hasn't been an expansion or sequel. Actually, 
 I was thinking that a good 'sequel' of this game, at least in spirit, might be something with an 
 Old West setting... Gunslingers , perhaps. I think a lot of the same fun elements from Pirates 
 could be incorporated to make a good Old West game.

Review:  I have been an avid fan of the originsl 1990 Pirates game for the PC; in fact, I upgraded my first 
 286 12 Mhz PC 1990 right after buying it up to a 1 MB (!) Graphics Card to be able to play Pirates 
 in colors (!!!) .
  
  So I was more than thrilled at the notion of a 2004/2005 remake exploiting what is technically 
 possible today. Initially, I was more than happy, but after a couple of games this sentiment turned 
 into outright anger over Sid Meier&acute; s obvious money milking approach 
  
  In all, this game is nothing more or less than a collection of 7 Minigames on a Nintendo Console 
 early 1990ies sophistivication level.
  
  1. Shipfight
  
  Essentially this is using left and right arrows, until most of a broadside hits home - yaawwwwwn
 
  
  2. Swordfight
  
  I myself used exclusively the left arrow on the 9-key-keypad for direct thrust - once figuring 
 out the right times/intervals to press that key it was ultra-boring!
  
  3. Trade 
  
  I don&acute; t even wanna talk about this!
  
  4. Treasure Hunt
  
  Everything consistently 
 looks the same! the first hunt mirrors the last hunt - the terrain objects are insultingly repetitively 
 distributed on the map by a random generation engine
  
  5. Land Fight ( turn based strategy game )
  
  That really sucks: about what you would expect 
 from a 1983 Commodore C 64 title
  
  6. Stealth in cities 
  
  By far the most stupid of all - actually I hated it so much that I rather razed the cities. It&acute; s 
 like PacMan on sleeping pills!
  
  7. Dancing
  
  My favourite! With beautyful (big boobed) daughters it can get really challenging
  
  And then 
 the general shortcomings:
  
  Probably due to their thriftyness/greed the makers of the game replaced localized voice dubs by 
 an ultrarepetitive voice acting , which is unintelligible pidgin-mumblejumble not understandable 
 for anyone. Example: Gouvernor&acute; s doughters tell you after a successful dance : Myfudge , 
 whatever that is supposed to mean!
  
  Bottom Line: I loved it for the first two complete games and after that (and during the last half 
 of both) , I simply hated the simplicicity and repetitiveness of the minigames. Having said that, 
 my kids (4 and 6 years old) love it. That in my mind says everything!
  
  IF SOMEONE WERE TO SERIOUSLY BRING THAT CONCEPT INTO THE 21ST CENTURY, I&acute; D LOVE IT.

Review:  Very addictive. I enjoyed the original Pirates! when it was released in the early 90's, but this 
 one is even betta. The storyline, or rather character-building plot sucks you right in. For the 
 next 12 hours all you want to do is to board another trade ship, take another port, find another 
 treasure and charm another beautiful governor daughter. It never ends! Well, it actually does, 
 the game does have an ending, either you accomplish all of the quests or you're forced to retire 
 after 20 years or so on the sea.
  As I said, the gameplay is very well designed, most of the stuff was taken from the original game 
 and made better; some were new. The only dissapointing thing was the bugs. Even in the 1.01 patched 
 version, there were some glitches with graphics when instead of ships there would be blank rectangles. 
 But I bet it is not as much annoying as the pre-patched version. I read some of the posts how bugged 
 the first release was.
  Graphics are outstanding. Sound is a bit flat, could use more depth with subwoofer effects, especially 
 during battles.
  I predict that as I play the game more, it will get old after a while. After all, missions and 
 quests are exactly the same, only geographical locations change. But for now, man, I can't stop 
 playing it.

Review:  i think sid meier's pirates is a cool games but is has some frustrating parts ... such as the wind 
 witch never changes direction .... it always blows from the east to the west side of the map ... 
 making it very hard to return to the west ... taking a very long time ... i also think it is short 
 and at higher levels it's very difficult ... beyond the capacity of a normal player ... crew is 
 very hard to get if not impossible ... and the fights between the player and the captain are nasty 
 .... still sid meier's pirates brings new and interesting concepts with many interesting things 
 to try .... its a game worth playing

Review:  Meh, the replayability of this game just isnt worth it. Sure different stuff happens, but its the 
 same quests to do each time, the same battles, the same sword fights, the same items, the same 
 10 enemy pirates, and the same main character. It's basically a good looking rock/paper/sissors 
 and DDR game with pirates. Maybe each ship battle is different, but after the first few, your attack 
 begins to look the same each time. Just wait for them to shoot, you dodge, fire and repeat. The 
 crew was like pleasing a sploiled toddler who wanted everything immediatley. There needed to be 
 a button that said Tell the crew to suck it up and wait 3 weeks till you are in port . The crew 
 also didn't seem to understand that the longer they pilaged the more money they would ultimatley 
 make. But instead they instist on having their petty 600 gold from you and then wasting the next 
 6 months of your short life sitting around in port. And then when you do finally get a crew of 
 40 you only have 1000 gold to buy food/upgrades/supplies because your toddler crew took the rest. 
 So yes, if you think playing the same linear game over and over again is considered to have a good 
 replayability valure then this game is for you.

Review:  Pirates! is an ambitious game that allows you to take part in several aspects of a pirates life: 
 sinking ships, capturing ships, capturing ports, finding treasure, finding lost relatives, keeping 
 your crew happy, and finding love.
  
  The main thing that makes this a Sid Meier's game is that the gameplay is entirely open. If you 
 choose, you could sail the seas sinking ships and never progress towards finding your long lost 
 relatives. The setup is pretty simple: sail a large world map and when you choose to attack other 
 ships the map zooms in and allows you begin firing. Your ship can be upgraded at the ports, each 
 port having one upgrade that it can give. The upgrades allow your ship to move faster, take more 
 damage, shoot different cannon balls and so forth. Treasure maps can be found that lead you to 
 the buried treasure from the other 9 pirates in the game (all of whom can be found and killed) . 
 The other aspect of the game is finding the map pieces for your lost relatives and the lost city. 
 You get pieces of the map by hunting down Baron Raymondo from hot tips given by governor's daughters 
 should they take a fancy to you. The daughters will also give you gifts that can keep your crew 
 happy at sea, or make you a better fencer.
  
  The downsides to the game can be overcome with a high tolerance to frustration. Wind only blows 
 one direction throughout the Caribbean so sailing into the wind tests your patience. Also, your 
 pirate ages with time and his skills begin to decline (this ranks high with me as a negative because 
 this is a gaming pet peeve of mine) . Getting older really dumps water on this game's fire as sailing 
 between ports can take several months and you find yourself wondering where all the years went. 
 In summation of my review, the game is worth playing and combines a few different styles of gameplay 
 into one neat package. The drawbacks are mostly based on my playing style, and I'm sure they will 
 be no problem for some gamers. If the drawbacks do keep you from enjoying this game to its fullest, 
 I'm sure you'll be glad you played anyway.

Review:  This is a great game. Lots of replay value, excellent sound, graphics, and low sys requirements. 
 I would not be afraid to highly recommend this game. From a purely strategic perspective it lacks 
 a little bit of depth, and to really get good at the game requires quite a bit of time and a lot 
 of patience. Supposedly they have fixed the rather aggravating dancing and fencing mini games in 
 the PSP version, but having seen the XBOX version I'll stick with the PC version. I have a bunch 
 of Sid Meiers games on PC, the man is a genius and his games are simply amazing. This game is easy 
 to learn but hard to master. In fact I must admit that I am still learning....

Review:  I'll just be lazy and split this review up into sections... Haar.
  
  Gameplay: you can do anything and everything from sailing round the Caribbean to going about ye 
 scurvy piratin' ways to sending ships down to Davy Jones' locker to engaging in war ('privateering', 
 i. e., legal pirating for a particular nation) to romancing beautiful (or ugly if that's your thing) 
 governor's daughters to boardin' ships to fighting scoundrels to conquering colonies to finding 
 lost cities, buried treasure and lost family members to being a merchant to changing the whole 
 political landscape of the Caribbean.
  As you can see, there's quite a lot to do. Every aspect is extremely fun and well-designed (especially 
 ship battles) . One part of the game, however, can be extremely frustrating if you don't know how 
 to go about it: finding lost cities and/or family members. You can even get stranded on a desert 
 island (following a mutiny, for instance) or be arrested and put in jail.
  
  Graphics: the graphics in Pirates! are very well done. Albeit slightly cartoony (although that 
 gives the game its charm, I feel) , they are very colourful, vibrant and full of character and charm. 
 Sure, this may not be Crysis, but it's not trying to be. All in all, I have nothing bad to say 
 about the graphics.
  
  Sound: I bet the producers of this game had a lot of fun with this. I feel that the sound is superb. 
 It certainly sounds like a pirate game and helps to immerse you into the whole experience, from 
 the ballroom orchestras to your crew's high sea singing and yo-ho-hoing, to the peculiar Sim-like 
 gibberish that the characters speak.
  
  Sid Meier sure knows how to make a game addictive. Next to the Civilization series this must be 
 one of the most addictive games I have ever played. Pirates!' open-ended sandbox-like nature means 
 that you can pretty much do whatever you want whenever you want however many times you want (until 
 your character dies of old age, that is) . You never run out of options, and the desire to become 
 the most notorious pirate in the Caribbean can be overpowering (overcoming even real-life needs 
 such as sleeping and socializing) . In the 6 months I have had this game I have kept coming back 
 to it. I'm starting a new game as we speak.
  All in all I recommend this game to anyone who likes pirates (that would be everyone, then) . Hell, 
 I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes to have a good time.

Review:  Gameplay: Much like the game it's based on, fun for a short period (10-20hours) , then it gets so 
 repetitively boring you'll want to put a gun to your own head.
  
  Graphics: Stability issues where graphics are concerned. Otherwise, colourful and decent.
  
 
  Sound: Good sound for the most part.
  
  Value: No multi-player. Once you've reached the point where everything gets so repetitive you want 
 to commit yourself, you'll never want to go back.
  
  Tilt: Before I'd actually played the game for 10-20 hours, I would have wholeheartedly recommended 
 it to anyone with a decent PC set-up.
  
  Sid Meier's Pirates! Is a game that will keep you playing it for between 10 and 20 hours. Then 
 you'll leave it forever.

Review:  Sid Meier's Pirates! took me completely by surprise. I found the game at my local Wal-Mart and 
 decided to give it a try about a year ago, and I have to say it was well worth the $20 price tag.
 
  
  The game makes perfect use of a large sandbox type world in which you can lose yourself in. You 
 have complete control over how you spend you character's life (yes, you can die of old age in this 
 game) . Want to be the most feared pirate in all the sea, go right ahead, pillage and destroy as 
 much as you like. Want to earn yourself a fancy captain's hat from one or more of the many factions 
 in the game, go out and kill their enemies and land, wealth, and a fine governor's daughter will 
 be yours for the taking. The ship battles are great, and blasting a helpless merchant ship into 
 submission never gets old. The turned based land battles are slightly clunky, but they are completely 
 optional since this IS a ship pirating game after all. One could go on all day about how the game 
 plays, but whats fun about the game is discovering all the things you can do within it.
  
  The graphics are great, but they do not stand up to the high powered games such as Doom, Prey, 
 or Oblivion. They aren't meant too. They are just something nice to look at while you are doing 
 all your pirating. The game runs fine on mid- to high-powered systems, and this opens the game 
 up to a wide audience of all budgets.
  
  Pirates! sounds like a pirate game should. Although there isn't a word of english in all the voice 
 work, only arrgs and aahoys. This gives the game a distinct style. The music is what to be expected 
 from this type of game. Lots of accordion and caribbean tunes. Nothing about the sound in this 
 game should dissapoint anyone.
  
  The game includes a high amount of replayability. As soon as you complete the game for the first 
 time, you will want to play again. On the second go around you are able to choose your characters 
 major skills and which time period to start off in. So even at the beginning of your second go 
 around with this game, its different.
  
  Anyone who hasn't played Sid Meier's Pirates! and claims to be a fan of pirates (down with ninjas!!!) 
 should pick up a copy. Its a great game thats worth playing at least once, but I'm sure once you 
 pick it up, it will suck you down all the way to Davy Jones's Locker, arrg!

Review:  For the game to be truly great it would need to have added several new layers of depth. I have 
 seen this game knocked for being a collection of mini games and it is - just like the original 
 all those years ago. More economy and better AI and strategy would have made this game great because 
 the graphics, concept, underlying structure of the game play and feel of the game are great. Pirates 
 doesn't have much replay value either because it lacks depth and because the AI can be really lame. 
 Sometimes attacking four or five ships directly outside a port still doesn't make them hostile 
 to you!

Review:  As a player of the original Pirates! game, as well as Pirates! Gold, I was very happy to see this 
 great game updated. As soon as I loaded the game, old memories came flooding back of how to do 
 things. But there are also some new things to enjoy too. The first thing that caught my eye of 
 course is the graphics. They are a very good fit for the game, with a very nice animated look. 
 Reminds you of the old pirate movies of the '40's and '50's. The new duel sequences really liven 
 the game up. One of the new area's of gameplay is a good co-ordination challenge of dancing that 
 is also a good memory challenge. Also, strategy does come into play a lot with sea and land battles. 
 Map reading skills also come in handy while searching for kidnapped family, friends and of course 
 other pirate's treasure! A role-playing element also exists as you can upgrade your ship, crew 
 as well as acquire items that make your character better.
  
  The sound is decent, nothing earth shattering here. But that doesn't mean it's bad. The main lacking 
 is actually there is not enough speaking- mumbling is preferred.
  
  Game play is what a fun game should be all about, FUN! This game is enjoyable to sit down at for 
 some relaxing game play that is challenging, not a challenge to learn how to play. And with it's 
 now reduced pricing you get a lot of swashbuckling for your buck!

Review:  The game has an interesting game play that allows you to choose what kind of character you want 
 (no change of looks though) : romantic, gunner, navigator, etc. Each of this 'personalitys' give 
 you a bonus in one of the game areas: If you are romantic you can get girls' love easier, if you 
 are a navigator yo can travel faster with your ship, if you are a gunner your crew shoots better, 
 etc.
  
  You can also get specialist in your crew such as cooks, gunners, etc each of these also give you 
 a bonus. You can buy special items from 'misterious travellers' that you find in the bars, from 
 a lady you are flerting with or from a criminal who doesnt want you to take him to trial.
  
  The variety of items is great! From Ruby Rings and Diamond Necklaces you can give your girl 
 to better swords, pistols and vests to help you fight other pirates.
  
  Your status is rated by your fame points. You get fame points by completing missions such as finding 
 lost treasures, saving your family members, killing famous pirates (top ten ones) , etc.
  
  You can also have good or bad relations with each nation. The more things you do for a nation (sinking 
 their enemies' ships, capturing your enemies colonies and giving it to the nation, etc) the better 
 your relations get. As you make progress you can get promoted, that means gaining 'ranks of noblity'. 
 Each rank gives you a certain bounus (easier crew recruiting, cheaper ships upgrades, cheaper ships 
 repairs...) . You don't get restricted into a single nation though, you can do things for all 4 
 of them (Dutchs, Frenchs, Spanishs and English)
  
  The game also allows you to have a variety of ships in your fleet. You can get a small 'indian 
 boat', brigs, frigates, the famous 'Ship of the Line', etc.
  
  The cons of the game are: the real long times you spend going from one colony to the other - imagine 
 having to watch your fleet slowly moving across the ocean with no way to speed it up! The game 
 should have a speed ajuster for this kind of thing cause it really makes you lose your patience! 
 This way people who want can get straight to the point; another thing is the game can get quite 
 boring after some time since things you can do will always be the same; sacking ships and towns 
 and flerting with the governors' daughters - it could be better if there were different ways to 
 do these things, but there aren't, it is always the same, what gets the game to be really repetitive.

Review:  This is a strategy game in which you sail around the carribean in a pirate ship. You can stop at 
 ports, attack other ships, and look for treasure, but I thought it was a pretty lame experience 
 overall. Problems:
  1) This is basically the same 6 minigames over and over again
  there is a fighting one, a dancing one, a dueling one, a sneaking one and a few others
  2) those 
 minigames get old very quickly
  
  the developers seem to expect you to create many different pirate characters and keep replaying 
 this game forever. I love pirates as much as the next guy, but there truly is not much to do in 
 this game.
  
  You might fall in love wih pirateering, though I think you will not. Either way, if you must pick 
 this up, try to find it cheap.

Review:  The story is ok (just a reason why you become and pirate and look for family)
  The graphics look positivly good (although the only real animation is for the ship battles ) because 
 everything else is scripted.
  The gameplay.............. will make you fall to sleep. it took me 5 minutes to get from one end 
 of the map to the other...... like half a year in game time, this severs the gameplay so you cant 
 actually finish the game.... because youll get bored to death... from the waiting... and waiting... And 
 to top that off the gameplay is very simplistic, just hit a combination of sword moves in the duels, move 
 and shoot in ship battles, the only really tactical part are the land battles which is like a very 
 very dumbed down version of take-your-turn games.
  You can get this game for $20 or less dollars and the simplistic gameplay may be a turn on for 
 some, also if you like conquering things the pillaging feature is awesome.

Review:  I want to preface this by saying I never played the original Pirates game.
  
  Ok. Quick review. You are the captain of a pirate ship. You beat other ships in ship to ship combat, 
 which is fun, but can get repetitive.
  
  You can go on land and talk with people from the govenor (usually to get missions) and recruit help, 
 upgrade ships and even duel with people and dance (which is the most pointless thing in this game) .
 
  
  Your goal (i guess) is to win as many colonies to your countries side. You do this by engaging in 
 a surprisingly fun turnbased combat system. You can also sneaks in land in a really bad system 
 where you have to avoid the guards.
  
  The reason this game misses the boat is that after you start conquering colonies, they are all 
 pretty much the same. There really is no story to drive you. Put in a story and more things to 
 do than conquer colonies (that are extremely similar to each other) and duel and dance, and this 
 could have been something that would last a long time. As it is, its fun for a few days then you 
 realize there is not much else to do. Check out Age of Pirates for a better role playing experience (but 
 wait and read the forums because the game got shipped in a beta stage and has many bugs so wait 
 til it gets patched up)
  
  In the end, I don't know how anyone could play this game for long periods of time like other games 
 with much more depth like the total war series or a great online FPS (like Halo) or a MMORPG (where 
 content is always being added)

Review:  Sid Meiers Pirates is FANTASTIC game. I started playing it and played for 14 hours before I realized 
 how long I had spent. A person can get really wrapped up in it. The graphics are good the game 
 is fun and challenging. The pirate battles are my favorite followed by the land and sea battles. 
 It is fun to go after the famous pirates and destroy them. It is one of Sid Meiers best games. 
 I hope that there is a second Sid Meiers Pirates made. If you dont have this game, go out and 
 buy it! You wont be disappointed. Just make sure your computer has the system requirements for 
 the game.

Review:  If you are looking for a game to capture you urge to live like a pirate this is a great game. The 
 game allow you to earn money in a variety of ways you can fight ships, trade goods from port to 
 port, find buried treasure, or attack towns with all your men against the towns to pilage and plunder. 
 This is a pretty inovative game with a giant free roaming world and a great deal of replay value. 
 Some of the down side could be it takes a while to sail from place to place and there is some repition 
 to how the world works, but it is a great game and will keep you occupied for hours.

Review:  I remember playing the original to death. I picked up the game with little in the way of expectations. 
 It turned out to be all you could want out of a remake of a classic game. It managed to keep the 
 core gameplay intact while bringing it up to modern graphical standards. It moderates repetition 
 by having the story of your family mixed in, and having the balance between the nations change 
 between the ages. Though it does not have a consistent, intricate story it provides addictive elements 
 of collecting items, eliminating pirates, and chasing quests. The easy difficulty is definitely 
 too easy, but it ramps up pretty well from there. Overall a very satisfying experience.

Review:  Pirates! Live The Life is a remake of the original game by Sid Meier. If you like to play original 
 games and no remakes, then this will change the way you play.
  
  Pirates is just an absolutely jaw dropping game. When you look at the box, it would appear to be 
 a kid game, but the immersive story, gameplay, and action keep you playing for more gold and a 
 better ship.
  
  Pirates makes you feel like a pirate. You choose when to divide to the plunder, fight the ship 
 battles, assault towns, and much more. The ship battles are very action packed. They are strategic, 
 like using the wind to your advantage. And, you can try to outwit you already witty oppontents, 
 by firing different cannonballs at different times to give you the upper hand in battle.
  
  This is only a portion of the game, and you should be intrested enough to pick this game up, because 
 it is wel worth your time.

Review:  If you ever wanted to be a pirate, then this is the game for you. It has everything you could thinkg 
 about, form naval warfare to sneaking into towns. Everything is integrated seamlessly so it just 
 feels like a huge game that never gets boring.
  
  Another fun aspect is the 10 most wanted pirates, where you start at number ten and have to get 
 to number one, places 9 to 1 are famous pirates such as henry morgan and blackbeard.
  
  The main quest pits you agains the evil Marquis de la Montalban and his henchman Baron Raymondo, 
 defeating them will give you parts of treasure maps to find you lost family members, and ultimately 
 find Montalbans base, where you get to finish him once and for all.
  
  This game never ends, once you beat Montalban, you get loads of money and get to do whatever you 
 want in the carribean.
  
  If you ever wante to be a pirate, buy this game

Review:  This game was a blast for the first few hours of game play! And when I realized how to play the 
 game it became so simple. So the learning curve seemed to be the entire game. Once I finally understood 
 the game, it became a let down because there was nothing new to discover. The main part of this 
 game is sailing. It is a free world to explore and sail on. The only chain you are bound to is 
 keeping your crew happy or they will mutiny and maroon you and leave you on an island until your 
 a new pirate ship comes to elect you captain. lol. I hate how I have to sell off all my ships and 
 all my spices and lose everything but the clothes on my back and items in my pocket and the ship 
 i use most (you don't get to choose, it is only assumed that you like the ship you control the 
 most) . Pretty much, to keep your crew happy, you have to sell most everything you worked for. I 
 would rather give them all share of gold than to give them all my spices and ships.
  
  I finally realized the dancing mini game was only a timing game. One, two, three, 123, 123, 123, 
 123. On the beat you hit the corresponding button. I don't know about you, but I hate it when my 
 wife leads when we are dancing, its disrespectful and I make her follow my lead by putting her 
 off balance so she follows me. In this game some ugly wench makes you follow her lead. Now I would 
 understand if the dance were exactly the same every time, but its not. And if there were a dance 
 lead, but no you follow the dancing gestures of an fugly girl. Besides, if you keep winning an 
 ugly girl's heart in-game, you get nothing but the same information you probably didn't care to 
 get in the first place. You have to find that 1 of a kind beautiful girl and she will shower you 
 with gifts back. Other than that, I liked the dancing. lol.
  
  The sword fights with a captain or your fugly girl's fiance are the same. You either wait for a 
 simple yet drastic move from your opponent then dodge or you attack using button 4 without waiting 
 to see which move he is winding up for. I was laughing when I told my brother all you had to do 
 to win a sword fight was to press 4. And he tried it and would win pretty fast. Also, this is the 
 most desired out come because your crew gets hurt every time you dodge and gets hurt badly every 
 time you get hit. And just like dancing, if during gameplay, you choose to become journeyman pirate 
 or choose any of the 4 higher difficulties, then you are no longer shown which button to press. 
 Either way, they show you to press the buttons too late anyways. Pressing 4 is the only way to 
 surely win a pirate fight in more advance difficulty levels.
  
  A nice yet simple mini game to take over a town. The more crew you have assembled the easier of 
 a fight it will be. You can only take over wealthy cities or maybe the next lower (of 5 wealth 
 catagories) . I have seen a hefty plunder, but it leaves the city's raped of all its prosperity. 
 The town is now worthless until you bring imigrants to it. Overall the town attacking mini game 
 is pretty cool, but as all the mini games, they don't tell you anything about what you're doing, 
 and you have to figure it all out for yourself.
  
  Spices mini-game. As you are sailing around, you enter port/cities. The cities have the same items, 
 but different prices. The prices don't fluxuate many coins unless a major occurrance happens: such 
 as imigrants; town is attacked and plundered; a new governor; etc. The thing that you will forget 
 about is that the town may not have many of the cheap item, because they are poor. Or, the town 
 may not have enough money to buy all your junk, even though you have tons of it and they still 
 have a high price of trade for it. Which makes mutany really annoying, since they will eventually 
 mutiny while your cargo is full because you can't sell it off fast enough. So they force you to 
 give in to sharing before you could sell that spice for 70 gold which you bought for 2 gold. (You 
 don't have to give in, but it becomes annoying.) The crew doesn't seem to care if you are making 
 a killing on spice profits, which brings us to:
  Openly attacking other ships. First you have to catch up to them, then you can press 5 to choose 
 to attack which ship. If the ship has an escort you will fight both, but which ever boat is beaten 
 first is gone, and you don't get to keep it, so take out the escort first. If you ram into the 
 ship you either get the ship and its resources/spices right off or you have to duel for it. Sometimes 
 some of its crew will ask to join you. If you choose not to board their ship, and attack it from 
 a distance, you will probably sink their ship, and if it sinks, so does its treasures.
  But this mini-game will make you duel if you don't take out a lot of their crew first. If you have 
 a fast ship and can duel good, then you don't even need to read the rest of this paragraph. If 
 you suck at dueling, you will need a high crew volume if you intend to subdue a ship before they 
 are ready to give up when you attempt to subdue them. This means you need a larger ship to attack 
 their ship with. This means your battle could be drawn out 60 times longer than needbe. Instead 
 of a 30 second battle, you may have to fight a 30 minute battle with a medium sized boat, or longer 
 with a larger attack ship. If you fire your cannons with a large ship, you will sink it. So why 
 did you pick that fight. duh. You will have to revert to a medium sized ship for speed and agility 
 reasons, and maybe sell off all your cannons but 10 to 14. Otherwise, a single shot of 20+cannons 
 can sink the enemy. Chain shot is extremely useful to take down the enemy sails and do minimal 
 damage to the ship you want to steal. BUT, if your ship is too slow, you will not get close enough 
 to fire your chains. When you have successfully slowed their ship, fire grape shot till their crew 
 is nearly gone. Then ram them and take the ship. I have always preferred to aquire a mail runner, 
 then dodge all the enemy guns with it and ram them to battle the captain. I refer to this ship 
 as my submarine, since the water flows right over it when ever I turn or speed ahead or slow down. 
 I think this makes the ship unhittable due to game flaw since the cannons can hit the water before 
 hitting the boat. Also, this boat looks similar to a pinnace, and those boats are pretty fast and 
 good to use too. (Easy to dodge, and catch.)
  
  Ok, now for the stuff I really didn't like:
  1. The barmaid and bartender take too long to pull 
 out your map and tell you the same information you already knew, cause they just told you. You 
 can't tell them no thanks and skip it. And the map is a basic 2D greyscaled yellow map and it can 
 take so long!
  2. Even after the patch 1.02, the game has enough bugs and memory leaks to sink your fast gamer's 
 PC!!
  3. After you have gathered all the few items available, there are no more items to gather. Not 
 enough items. 4. Why the hell did they put hippies in this game??? Sure it was a free custom pack, 
 but WTF are the designers all gay 5. The game's guy's are cuter than the chicks! WTF is wrong with 
 the designers! Even black beard is prettier than 99% of the governor's daughters!!!!
  6. It was way too easy for me to take down the #1 pirate, he must have been polishing his nails 
 during our duel.
  7. It was way too hard to fight the first actual villain, even the number one pirate was easier. 
 And I made no changes in game difficulty.
  8. Although easily remedied, the jerk pirates go mutanous way too often, even with cooks and fiddles 
 and a fancy hat. (lol)
  9. It seems most the game sites did not do their home work on this game. One site said it would 
 take about 8 hours to play each pirate's full life out. I think he played it for a few hours and 
 quit. It brings the word bribe to mind. This game isn't the best game out their and in no way does 
 it deserve anything over a 6. 10. The game ends tooooo fast. Once you have taken one pirate to 
 find all the buried treasure, why do it again. The same with romance, families, treasures, etc. 
 Although there are the main staples of this game to play: Sailing, boat battles, spice trades and 
 sales, to become duke, etc. And the rest is merely strategies.

Review:  If you like freedom, hanging around on the sea, find treasures, and have a lot of fun, is this 
 a game for you!
  
  The good: Great entertainment, fun to play, many "missons" and things to to. Great gameplay, Graffic 
 and valute etc! It's really fun to hunt after treasures, beat the crap out of others ship, and 
 become a popular pirate!
  
  The bad: Nothing spesial, some missions can be hard to to, but almost nothing bad about this game 
 at all!
  
  So for the mostly is this a great game, so forget the new "pirates of caribeen" game, this is much 
 better, even its made in 2004. Its not the best game I have ever played, but it's on the toplist! 
 Yust enjoy it!

Review:  
  
  No matter how hard you try, it's difficult to avoid that twenty-third pirate you created. Thats because 
 this game is one of the best pc sim games, and probably the best pirate game, too. Although you start 
 off in the game with the storyline of rescueing your family and getting revenge against the spanish 
 guy who enslaved them, that totally dosen't matter. Just like most of the current mmorpgs, you can 
 do anything that you want.
  You can become a evil, sadistic, murderous pirate who wants to kill everthing in his path, a romantic 
 ladies man, a happy, civilized trader, and more. You can be sailing under the spanish, english, dutch, or 
 french flags, so you would want to be friends with that nation, so in order to get promoted, you must 
 destroy that nation's enemies. You should also have at least one other friend to make promotions 
 easier by beating their enemies too, so for example, my character skalokos is english with french 
 for friends.
  Of course, their has to be at least one problem... and this is it. As the years go on, and your pirate 
 becomes older, weaker, less popular with getting recruitments, so you have to consider retiring. If 
 your pirate was succesful, he might get into the pirate hall of fame, so start looking for blackbeard, who 
 actually is in the game.
  So, consider getting this game. It cost $20 at target now, and any self-respecting sim junkie should 
 have it.

Review:  Good: Variety in minigames, which are always fun; charming; highly polished; terrific presentation; 
 seamless and open-ended; easy to play.
  
  Bad: Slightly repetitive by nature.
  
  Sid Meier's Pirates! is, like seemingly everything with Sid Meier's name on it, incredibly addictive. 
 It's also highly polished and fairly simple by today's standards of big-budget, epic-scoped, and 
 gritty shooters and the like. However Pirates! shows there's something to be said for planning 
 something simple and doing it exactly right. Additionally, Pirates! show's that just because the 
 basic elements of something don't necessarily have to be complex or incredibly difficult to understand, 
 it doesn't mean that it lacks sophistication.
  
  Pirates! is, at it's core, a series of minigames, loosely tied together by the interespersed time 
 you spend sailing your ship at sea and the premise that you're a pirate, and you can do what you 
 want. The game has a loose storyline that sets off the premise, which is mainly something about 
 losing your family, and now you're out to find them. It's fairly weak, and as soon as you get out 
 to sea - minutes into the game - you can choose to pursue it, or totally ignore it. There's no 
 real story-line. Do what you want.
  
  Pirates! doesn't envision the life of a pirate as the probably unpleasant and gritty affair it 
 was in real life, but as the swashbuckling affair that it was imagined to be, so you play a charming 
 rogue. Sure, you can attack any ship you want to on the open sea, but you can also romance governor's 
 daughters, find buried treasure, attack cities with your crew, and engage in swordfights with wily 
 captains. Nearly the entire game can be played with the numpad keys, but it doesn't mean that each 
 minigame isn't a ton of fun. They rope you along in an addictive manner, but it also means that 
 Pirates! can be played in short or long streaks, and still be very fun.
  
  The presentation reflects the attitude to the gameplay. The graphics are charming and colorful 
 and still hold up fairly well today, and the music fits as well, though you'll get familiar with 
 many of the themes.
  
  Pirates! is a one-of-a-kind game these days. It doesn't mess with the success of the original, 
 but ends up being completely unique. Whether or not you've played that one (I personally haven't) , 
 you won't go wrong with Pirates!.

Review:  In it's own way is the best game blending real time strategy and plain adventure fun! This game 
 really worth a sequel there are so many things left unexplored in both the strategic and adventure 
 way. 
  Most of all what's strikes me is the freedom of choices in the game and though that do not change 
 the main plot is the way the player want's to play that makes all the difference.
  This game is really adictive and the different levels of difficulty are really meant to make a 
 change in the way the player deal with it. I think that Sid Meier's Pirates is not only a great 
 come back but an example for all other developers that require to bring in the XXI century great 
 classics.

Review:  This game is one of the best games I have played and it is'nt multi-player so you can play anytime 
 and can pause it if you need to do something without worrying about it. You can also play it without 
 troubles because it is easy to learn and extremly fun to play. You can fight on land and at sea 
 or on a boat. There are goals and other pirates to kill and boats to destroy so you have something 
 to do. Dancing is the hardest part of the game but is fun. The controls are very simple and wont 
 take long to learn.

Review:  I grew up on this on my brother's Amiga, and was ecstatic when I saw it was coming to the PC, only 
 revamped.
  
  Pirates is a simple yet addictive game, that has provided way too many hours of game time. It is 
 based in the 17th century carribean, where you play the role of a ships captain. From there, it 
 is very open ended, which really gives the game a lot of playability. You can follow the prescribed 
 plot and rescue your lost family, or you can scrap the whole plot and just sail around sinking 
 ships. Or you can play as a straight-up trader, sailing the carribean trying to make an honest 
 life. Each method brings an entirely different feel for the game.
  
  Gameplay is more of a series of separate mini-games, united by a real time sailing portion. You 
 sail your fleet around the carribean in accelerated time, and each encounter is treated as a little 
 side game. Ship to ship combat is real time, maneuvering and shooting at the other ship, looking 
 to sink or capture your opponent. Fencing is treated as a one on one contest, trying to out-duel 
 your opponent. Dancing is a rhythm and pattern game, where you have to keep up with the governor's 
 daughter. Sneaking into town involves lurking through the towns streets, trying to avoid the guards. 
 Attacking a town is a turn-based strategy, where you try to eliminate the town soldiers, or flank 
 around them and rush into town.
  
  Each mini-game is simple, and almost all controls are given with the number pad. There is a mock-up 
 of the keypad in the corner of the screen, showing the command associated with each key. The keys 
 are simple to learn, allowing for this game to be enjoyed by just about everyone. And really, who 
 doesn't like pirates?
  
  The graphics are a little dated, and the sound can be cheesy at time (no spoken dialogue, just 
 garbled grunts with subtitles) but it doesn't really detract from the game. Overall, the simple 
 addictive gameplay is what keeps you coming back.
  
  Pirates is everything I remember it to be, with a couple well done gameplay changes that really 
 add to the game.

Review:  Ah yes, another remake of an old classic. This time -- Pirates! Any old-skooler or anyone that has 
 traveled into those old depths know of the original game from wayback, and perhaps the Windows 
 3.1 update Pirates! GOLD (and its annoying copy protection) . This game truly retains the feel of 
 the origial classic with a much more polished presentation, gameplay, features, and fun. No more 
 random sea encounters -- you can see ships on the map as you sail. Choose to sail in, sail away, 
 battle, escourt, shadow and scare, or whatever. Again, you pick the main country you have a "Letter 
 of Marque" for (privateering license essentially, or legal pirating as long as you leave that country 
 and their allies alone) . 
  
  Then, the rampaging begins. Ransack, sink, board, and plunder enemy vessels -- and get promoted by 
 the country you sail for (or any other country, if you hit their enemies) . Promotions aid you in 
 port with recruitment or ship costs. Got a big crew? How about attacking a town if you feel up 
 for it? Maybe install a new country as sovereign?
  
  You can visit many real ports up and down the spanish main and trade goods, visit the govener, 
 maybe get invited by said governer's daughter to the ball (and mayhaps marriage be in the future 
 if you continue to woo said daughter) , repair and upgrade your ship, and visit the tavern to hear 
 the talk of the town, recruit crew, and try and find info on buried treasure.
  
  Bored with plunder? Go look for buried treasure or lost relatives, or you can try your hand at 
 the merchant trade by being saavy in the port good arena (not easy, not successful, and the crew 
 will hate you however...) .
  
  The Carribbean looks beautiful and the sounds are great, complete with singing crew when they're 
 happy, waves, wind, storms, gulls, and hails from ship to ship.
  
  The interface is pretty fantastic, with simple and intuitive keyboard commands that have hardly 
 any learning curve. Or, use the mouse only if you're a 'clicker'.
  
  Some complaints, of course, as with all things. It would have been nice if they didn't re-use the 
 same or similar characters in all the taverns (and the same taverns for that matter at all ports) . 
 The character complaints actually extend to pretty much all character interactions except the 10 
 individual 'top pirates' (including yourself) which are uniqe. Plus, no character customization 
 really except a few 'accessories' you can get. Sailing isn't the most realistic -- good in an action 
 game really, but still tedious and slow when beating hard upwind in a long sail. Also, occasionally 
 a ship that 'struck her colors' (surrendered) may be able to sail away if the wind be not in your 
 favor and ye be damaged (yes, piratical talk begins to set in) .
  
  Now, these be but minor complaints in what otherwise is an amazin' game. Ye may be sittin' fer 
 but a few moments, or plan to, and then spend many turns 'o the glass and find yerself 'ungry, 
 tired, and wonderin' where the time hast gone... addictive this gameplay is, says me.
  
  For anyone with an interest in the old game, or someone with any interest in playing a just good 
 old fun game (arcadey at that) , then this may be for you. Oh, and don't forget International Talk 
 Like a Pirate Day on Sept 19th...

Review:  When I first puchased this game, I was truly unprepared for the kind of adventure that I was getting 
 myself into. I saw the 20 dollar price tag, and I was thinking: "It must be just ok if they sell 
 it at 20 dollars (because it really hadn't been out all that long) ," but I decided to buy it anyway. 
 I installed it with ease and it started with ease. I began playing this, and it really hit me that 
 this game isn't just about finding treasure... it was a treasure itself. Well, the first thing I 
 noticed was the graphics. Absolutely stunning. Even if you put the graphics to the lowest possible 
 settings, they are still acceptable.
  Next, the sounds. While there isn't really a voiceover in this game (probably better) , it still 
 delivers in all the forms of audio I could want... ample sea sounds, yelling from ship to ship and 
 the fighting audio was great too.
  Overall, this game is great for anyone who enjoyed Sid Meier's other games. It is truly addicting 
 and a real treasure in the mess of other PC games... go buy this one if you like adventure, rpg's, 
 strategy or pirate games.... It's great...

Review:  I'm pretty picky about what games I buy. I research and review and generally only buy games rated 
 above the 7.5 range. So why is it such a suprise that a game consistently rated in the 9.0+ range 
 is so great? Simple, Sid Meier made it! Incredible depth in both gameplay and pirate history. The 
 graphical presentation is beautiful, while the music is entertaining. It sort of combines Stategy 
 and RPG elements into a nice little combo. Very easy to sit and say "this will be my last task" 
 and 3 hours later you are finally getting up from your keyboard. Each time I play I have no intention 
 of playing for hours on end, just looking to pass a little time, but that usually isn't possible. 
 Either I'm plundering the coast of some unsuspecting country's ports, or I'm get addicted to chasing 
 the bad guy for one more clue to save my kidnapped and displaced family. Well worth the investment.

Review:  I played the original version of this game while attending college and graduate school. I wasted 
 a lot of time that could have been better spent studying or writing a paper or doing research. 
 Now, around 17 years later, I am wasting time that would be better spent fixing up things around 
 the house or landscaping or spending quality time with the wife and kids.
  
  It is a fun game that maintains a lot of the qualities that made the original addictive while enhancing 
 the graphics and adding a few more features. The new graphics add a lot, of course, and the new 
 mapping and navigating innovations make it less tedious to move about the Caribbean. Watching ships 
 fall apart and seeing the tattered and damaged sails during sea battles is a big plus.
  
  The biggest improvement I would have to say is in the area of land battles. These are a lot more 
 controllable and entertaining. At first I thought the turn based concept for these battles was 
 a little out dated and that a real time approach might be better but after fighting a couple of 
 them I found that they were still enjoyable. The turn base approach allows you to take advantage 
 of maneuvering and flanking attacks in a more calculating manner. The improved graphics are a big 
 plus, of course.
  
  The new aspect that I care the least for is the dancing with governors daughters. I would avoid 
 this all together if I could but this is one of the few ways I have found to gain special equipment, 
 such as pistols, fencing shirts and vests, telescopes, etc. I would prefer to be able to gain these 
 items through some type of combat situation or plundering option but I can appreciate the effort 
 to add variety to the game and another social/political aspect to the game in a time period flavored 
 format.
  
  All in all I find this game enjoyable and fun to play. Time goes by in a hurry while playing this 
 game due to the open ended format and the desire to complete one more quest or capture one more 
 treasure galleon before quitting for the evening. It is definitely worth the small amount of money 
 I paid for it at the local Wal-Mart.

Review:  Sid Meiers Pirates! is a good game, it has a lot of fun quirks and is worth 19 bucks to waste 
 a weekend on. My wife and I picked it up last week and both played it from the same copy. You can 
 use each of the 2 cd's to get the game to run on separate pc's, which was good for us. Overall 
 after a good solid 12-15 hours of playing I'm starting to get bored. Things become very repetitive, 
 but for the time spent it was pretty fun, especially since the game is already a few years old 
 now.

Review:  Sid Meiers Pirates is a fun, addictive game. Being a remake of the 1990s Pirates! Gold, it makes 
 a fitting successor. Anyone who played the older version will right at home. A few differences 
 on how the game plays do come to mind. You need men to run your ships. First, undermanned ships 
 operate at reduced ability. Two, you attack a towns soldiers, not the fort. Three, fighting other 
 famous pirates is more of a quest than before.
  Being a Pirate means attacking and pillaging. The first thing you learn that any ship can take 
 out another, if captained correctly. Two, you have to have a good sized crew and well armed ship 
 to win. Your ship and weapons can both be upgraded. This allows for varied tactics to be applied. 
 Be aware that the ship does handles realistically, especially at the Swashbuckler level. And the 
 AI gets better and much more aggressive as you move up in difficulty. 
  The role-playing part of Pirates is unique. You dont have to play it that way, but you miss out 
 on a lot of the fun. Making nice with the Governors daughter and completing her requests is the 
 easiest way to gain fame points. This is how your performance is graded. Also trading with the 
 traveler in tavern will help you gain information and items to enhance your game. 
  Overall, the game is fun and addictive. You can play for a short time or stay up all night chasing 
 across the Caribbean for Baron Raymondo. The game allows you make up your idea on how to succeed. 
 Do you want to conduct trade to build up your fortune or cruise the high seas chasing pirates and 
 helpless merchantmen alike? For everything you do, there are consequences. If you attack Spanish 
 shipping, expect to be hunted by Spanish pirate hunters. Also the local colonies will attack when 
 you try to enter port. 
  All in all, Pirates! offers a lot to do without getting bogged down in the details. For quick games 
 or that all nighter game that you love, this game will provide for you.

Review:  I enjoyed Pirates very much, and with this remake I enjoyed it even more. The graphics are nice, 
 and the sound is perfect. What I enjoyed the most in this game where the ship battles. Pirates 
 versus whoever, it was fun. The wind factor had to be analized, you crew number was essential, 
 your ammo had to be enough, and which ammo to use at what time could be a turning point. In town 
 you coud d vairous things and the sword fights are great. I can't say I enjoyed much the dancing, 
 but it is all part of the game and it provides variety to it. I'd recomend it to any pirate "wanabee"

Review:  I have played and "beaten" this game like ten times. It is very fun, but really there is absolutely 
 nothing to this game. The story line stinks, and I lost track of how many times I killed Baron 
 Raymondo. Sword fighting really isn't a challenge, and the ship battles really don't do much. All 
 that being said I still really like the game. The Spanish beautiful daughter is the only one I 
 went for. Graphics were good. But if they ever make a sequel, make sure that it is not this open-ended, 
 with a real story line and missions that you can actually finish without traveling in Panama for 
 four months and not finding anything. However for those of you looking for a good pirate game that 
 has some historical backing and a few good laughs definitely pick this up

Review:  This game is incredible! The graphics are superb, and the gameplay is excellent! First of all, 
 I love how they deliver the whole pirate theme. It's really smooth, and the player just gets sucked 
 into it so easily. It's quite addicting actually, but in a good way! All the little puzzle games 
 keep the game going, and there's so much to do, and you have so much freedom, it's really cool. 
 I especially like taking over cities, it's so much fun! If you have the game, or are going to get 
 it, make sure you play as Dutch and take over every city and make it Dutch atleast once! It's quite 
 an accomplishment when it's all done. I've beaten the game once, but have played it many times. 
 That another reason this game is so good, since you can play it numerous times, and each time will 
 be completely different. To me, this game is probably one of the best I've played in a very, VERY 
 long time. And I'm sure you'll like it to. I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to have 
 fun! Peace!

Review:  This is one of the greatest games of all times. The original I probably have more then 300 hours 
 on, this one so far at least 100. They really did a good job of taking what was great about the 
 original and making it modern. The graphics are a little finicky but great, the AI they did a really 
 good job on and the game play is just fun. The only downside I saw with this game was the dancing 
 but you can learn to live with that, you don't have to do it much. Besides that if you just want 
 a game that is fun and you will never get tired of, spend the money on this.

Review:  I really bought this game more on a whim than anything, as strategy games are one of my least favorite 
 genres normally. I am not a big Civ III fan, let's put it that way, rather. But I kept hearing 
 things about this game that sounded interesting, like it might be of a different "flavor," so to 
 speak. Indeed.... it is!
  
  Pirates! actually leaves you feeling like a pirate after playing for a while, and I found myself 
 really REALLY enjoying it! You don't have to be a rocket scientist to play it, like some strategy 
 games (or at least that is how strategy games often make ME feel... like I'm lacking in intellect 
 in some serious manner) . Pirates! is probably on a basic level, a much more simple strategy game, 
 with the capability of BEING as complex as you like.
  
  The graphics are very very nice. The gameplay is light and fun and even funny sometimes. I really 
 enjoyed rising in the ranks of piratehood and gradually becoming more rich and powerful and infamous 
 and defeating my foes and meeting and marrying a beautiful governor's daughter.... lol. (Yes, I'm 
 a girl, and that is funny, but I FELT like a male pirate when I was playing.... hehe!!)
  
  A very good value and just a fun romp on the PC. This is STILL the game I turn to when I just want 
 to have some mindless FUN. I really liked the mini games of sword fighting on deck with other pirates 
 and then looting their ships and stealing them and sometimes, if they were well decked out ships..... making 
 them my own. The dancing was fun and funny sometimes too. 
  
  Really only one word to describe this game: FUN!

Review:  The graphic is truly much better by light years compared to the old classic, but not to a point 
 were Sid is breaking new ground. Featurewise I would say the game should have included more stuff, 
 and the added dancing feature seems like a Korean Jukebox dance competition look-a-like. 
  The quest part of the game is long monotenous, and makes you bored too fast. 
  The whole rank 
 deal does not carry enough consequense. I miss another dimension in the game here, which I would 
 think would be obvious. I don't think the average gamer is sattisfied with the rank only being 
 a symbol of status for the players. Yes you get a house.... a picture to show, but how political 
 influence, army, trade relation/negotiation. Maybe it's only supposed to be a the old Pirates! 
 in a new nicer body?
  
  This game does not warrent endless hours of replay. Sorry to say so.

Review:  I loved the game right from the get-go. I personally didn't find much fun in any of the mini-games, 
 but the boat battles, and just riding around is amazing fun. The only major downside I had with 
 this game (and what ultimately killed my fun with it after a while) is that your crew eventually 
 becomes unhappy and you have to end your game and start a new one. I was hoping this would be like 
 GTA and you could just go on forever with the same crew, not having to worry about the unhappiness 
 thing. In the end, I say that this game is a great game, but it seems to wear out over after a 
 good deal of time.

Review:  I played this game already a zillion years ago on my Commodore 64 (gosh, Im old!) and I was ondering 
 if this game would still be so addictive. And it is! Of course there have been a lot of improvements 
 since then, but the storyline is still the same: sail the Caribbean, attack ships and towns, find 
 long-lost family members and find yourself a good looking woman to spend the rest of your life 
 with. You will spend hours and hours to improve yourself as a pirate until you finally retire. 
 Then, you will choose another nationality, another era and another career over and over again! 
 The repetitive fencing duels and dancing lessons might be quite annoying after a while, but thats 
 easy to get over with.

Review:  I still clearly remember playing the original Pirates! on the Commodore 64, when I actually should 
 have been studying for University Exams. It was one of the best games of its day, and this remake 
 has kept the elements of the original game that made it so much fun, while adding a few new features.
 
  
  You play a Pirate - but how you play that pirate is entirely up to you. It is a very open ended 
 game. There are several quests you can undertake. Whether it be obtain your ranking with the four 
 nations represented (by destroying pirate and enemy ships) , search for lost family, search for 
 lost cities, find you true love, hunt down renowned pirates (and their treasure) - or you can just 
 sail the seas and plunder ships and towns, trade goods and make yourself a small fortune. All or 
 none of these can be done.
  
  The game is very easy to pick up and play. Controls and menus are easy and there is a big 'New 
 World' to explore with new cities popping up as the game progress. Time is the only factor - you 
 grow older and weaker as time goes on and eventually fall of your perch or retire.
  
  You spend most of your time on the seas navigating from city to city. The sea battles are good 
 fun as you attack enemy (and at times friendly) vessels, and once boarding you play a one-on-one 
 duel with the captain. This is essentially a rhthym based sub-game - but don't bite of more than 
 you can chew - you could be winning to fight - but if you men all die in the background - then 
 you lose the lot and start again from scratch. 
  
  You play the diplomat as well - speaking with Governor's (and their daughters - dancing is a harder 
 rhthym-based sub-game) - trading with merchants and shipwrights and visiting taverns to recruit 
 and get information. It is beneficial to get good ranks with some of the nations as this does provide 
 benefits.
  
  Chasing your family is a more difficult subquest but worthwhile, and hunting down the most remowned 
 pirates is good fun. 
  
  The graphics are very suitable. They are cartoon like and bring the game to life in an appropriate 
 way. The sound is simple but effective -there is enough 'Arrrrrr's!' and pirate sounds in the game 
 to keep a smile on your face. It maintains a sense of humour throughout and all of the subgames 
 work well. The only subgame to felt slow and cumbersome was the turn -based scenario of invading 
 enemy cities.
  
  As I said the original premise of the game has been strongly maintained - and that is that this 
 game is FUN to play. You will enjoy the romp through the Caribbean and it really is up to you what 
 quests you play. It's almost impossible to lose on the easiest level, but there hardest does provide 
 a genuine challenge.
  
  While this is only a re-make - it is a remake of a great game and it is a faithful representation. 
 What this game may lack in the intensity and 'realism' that seems to be becoming more the norm 
 - it more than makes up with enjoyable gameplay, humour and an open-ended nature that keeps it 
 on the computer for some time. And you get a score at the end of the game for posterity - not many 
 games like that anymore! Pirates! is worth every penny, no matter what you pay for it.
  
  Come on - we all wanted to be Pirates at one stage in our lives when we were kids - and this game 
 brings back that feeling - and in a good way.

Review:  If you played and enjoyed the old Pirates!, this game is a must have. The old one kept my hands 
 stuck to the NES controller for months. This game takes that formula and updates and improves it. 
 The dancing mini game is challenging at times, though the fencing could have been more so. The 
 ship combat is good, but not as good as Port Royal. Some of the quests are relatively simple while 
 some will have your crew ready to throw you overboard because of their difficulty. Overall, Pirates! 
 is a very fun and challenging game (especially challenging on the higher difficulty settings) that, 
 if you have any interest in being a pirate, will keep you entertained. nyaaarg

Review:  It is a really fun game. u can collect ships and crew. after a while it gets kind of boring b/c 
 your crew starts to leave u. The graphics r really really good and w/ the different ships it can 
 be fun. I think u should still get it though. one more thing, it can get hard to find the ship 
 u want and some ships r REALLY SLOW. The ship battles get boring to because u do the same think 
 over and over and over again. its not as good as Civilization 4 though. over all i like the game

Review:  I love the ship to ship battles and the sword play (especially the sword play) . I really like the 
 plundering of towns and ships, as well as finding lost treasure and ancient lost cities of the Inca 
 and Maya and such. The courting of a lady is great and just that old world feel of the renaissance 
 gives this game a likable and genuine feel. The ransacking of a rival nations cities is pretty nifty 
 to. I do not know if any remember "Pirate's Gold" for the Se ga Genesis system, but this game is 
 in a lot of ways just like it. Like I had said in the heading above, this game could or should have 
 been better. It is like a Sid Meier project... except without Sid. Or at least without very much of 
 his influence. For instance with the courting thing. The developer could also made it to where your 
 pirate could have offspring, that would take over our pirating way of life. Also the developers could 
 have had better trade or just a little more infuses on trade to add more depth to the game in case 
 a player prefer the peaceful way of things ,or life. (not that I am very peaceful) . Another" BIG" 
 issue for me is that they (the developer) should have had an elaborate character creation process 
 where "YOU" choose how the main character looks. Just as well I feel they could have also added 
 a feature where a player could have his own pirate haven or town, and maybe customized ship building. Two 
 other things I have a problem with is that the ball room dancing feature could have ben made easier, it's 
 sometimes hard to actually preform so of the moves in time of the rhythm of the dance. The other 
 is when sailing around the map time passes slow when sailing slow, but if your ships speed up then 
 so does the game time in days... that should not be either. However when all is said and done the 
 game is still pretty solid throughout. Although any of you who have played the many other Sid Meier 
 games would note to that he really did not have much influence in the development of the game..... and 
 if he did shame on him ,because in comparison to his other games Sid Meier's Pirates gets blown 
 out of the water.

Review:  Before you even begin Pirates!, make sure you dont have any where to be, because it will suck 
 you in. Pirates! is probably one of the most addictive games Ive ever played. The first time I 
 sat down to play it, I lost 5 hours of my time.
  
  The game really is just plain fun. Its very easy to pick up. The level the game starts on acts 
 as a tutorial and give you hints to help get the hang of the sword fights and dancing scenarios. 
 As you do better in plundering and pillaging, the game will give you the opportunity to increase 
 your play level. This is a great feature because it lets you increase the difficulty at your own 
 pace. You can stay at the lowest level for as long as you like, although it does pay to jump up 
 a level.
  
  The sound is average. The music is fitting, although it does become very repetitive, especially 
 in the dancing sequences. There are no voice-overs. Instead, the characters use a sort of Sims-esque 
 talk. If you hate that sort of thing, the game can grate on your nerves at points. Luckily, you 
 spend most of your time at sea and not in towns listening to the grunts and nonsense.
  
  The graphics are very good and the ships and oceans look spectacular. Character models are very 
 good, although you will find that the various captains, barmaids and governors all look alike, 
 with a few variations. The exception to this is the detail given to the famous pirate captains. 
 The details on these nine are great. Blackbeard even comes complete with flaming beard.
  
  The game can become frustrating at times. For example, when attempting to hunt down the evil Baron, 
 you may discover that you just missed him, and cant seem to track him down on the seas. I also 
 had some trouble finding a few of the famous pirates, no matter how often I sailed back and forth 
 on their hunting grounds. Finding buried treasure/lost cities can also be annoying, especially 
 if there are several similar landmarks in succession. Its very easy to get turned around and wander 
 aimlessly looking for a dead tree or geyser.
  
  In general, this is a superb game. Its pure, simple fun. Just dont expect to be able to sit down 
 and play for only a little while. The game is addictive and hard to put down.

Review:  Pirates is a great concept. However, the game becomes WAY too monotonous very quickly. You can 
 solve it in a weekend and get the highest score possible. I played it and about 3 months later 
 played it one more time. It just doesn't have any replay factors. I love games of that genre however 
 there needs to be more options than... sail here, fight him... go here.... dance with her.... go 
 here search here. Not one I would recommend for adults looking for depth and strategy. Kids however 
 will probably get a kick out of it.
  It really is just too simple overall. You have fredom to do your own thing, problem is you do the 
 same thing wherever you go. If you do get the game, I do recommend fighting a town for an additional 
 strategy part of the game.

Review:  I was VERY exciting about this game... I RARELY buy brand new games. I will rent... or wait until 
 prices come down, before I buy. But there are a special few that I do not wait for.
  
  Pirates! was one of them.
  
  With that said, I WAS happy with the purchase, I do not regret 
 it at all. Obviously the first thing you notice, is the upgrade in graphics. They are beautiful. 
 I would have liked to have actual talking in the game. The only real gameplay audio that can be 
 heard, is the occasional grunt from either your character or your whining crew. But that is real 
 nit-picking kind of stuff.
  
  Second thing you will notice in the game, is that you WILL lose yourself in it. You'll start a 
 game, and by the time you look at the clock, 3-4 hours have passed. That can be a good thing or 
 a bad thing, depending on your POV.
  
  I like the variety of Pirates you can battle, I find myself going after the most well known ones 
 first... trying to hunt them down... though you can pretty much just mash the buttons to beat them. 
 I like that the game is open ended (unless you choose to retire) & non-linear. With that said, 
 the longer the game moves on, the older you get... once you reach your 40's, you can pretty much 
 forget about dueling anybody.
  
  Which brings me to the game time itself. It's WAY too fast... blink and half a decade has gone by. 
 This means with the many things that you can do in the game (playing the main quest, finding all 
 the pirates, finding all your family members, finding all of the "lost cities") you cannot do it 
 all in one sitting, nor in one game. That is, you are forced to play the game again and again for 
 different things you want to do. That is good for replay value. But it gets repetitive very quickly. 
 Especially during the main quest, where you literally follow a map, and do any number of randomly 
 chosen things in the game. This is another aspect I was disappointed in. Some of the things you 
 are forced to do in the map can be as easy as "acquiring" a specific ship, or finding a "lost city". 
 Or something as tedious as marrying a Governors beautiful daughter (which can take awhile to do, 
 and in game-time... this act can waste years off of game time) . On a personal note I once wasted 
 15 years of game time trying to "steal" multiple Treasure Galleons (4 to be exact, 3 in a row) , 
 for me those were hard to find... let alone waiting for one after another to appear... then getting 
 to it before it docks.
  
  One aspect I found REALLY annoying is your crew. Because the game-time moves very quickly, you 
 have to constantly be plundering, or fighting, or finding, or winning something. Take a trip across 
 the seas to a new port, and your crew gets restless. Sail around an island looking for plunder... and 
 your crew gets restless. It gets to a point, where you find yourself splitting up the crew and 
 booty at least 10+ times a game. This is good, since you take a portion of the booty for yourself... the 
 harder the difficulty level, the higher the portion. But it is very annoying to hit the plunder 
 of a lifetime (find all 3 "lost cities", hit multiple Treasure Galleons, Marry a beautiful daughter 
 and acquire land, Hitting pirate after pirate, keeping everybody fed... blah blah) , just to end 
 up no more than 20 minutes later having your crew whine and threaten to mutiny. So you split up 
 your ships, booty and crew... like you "haven't brought anything aboard"... because you hit everything 
 that was big.
  
  The game itself is enjoyable, not very hard to pick up, and is a breeze to learn. It's fun the 
 first 2 or so times through, after that, if you are interested in continuing to do all of the quests... then 
 it gets repetitive and some cases you find yourself just thumbing through the motions just to get 
 to where you want to go.
  
  It's a great pick up... but don't be sucked into the hype this game got. It's like any new game... it's 
 fun, but once you complete the game, non-linear or not, there is not much reason to pick it up 
 again. It's satisfying to get the highest possible score in the game, and if you choose to retire, 
 seeing your accomplishments (future) .
  
  But far too much of this game is button mashing and repetitive... by the end, you find yourself 
 happy about the game... but you feel there could have been more.

Review:  When I acquired Sid Meier's new game "Pirates," I was unsure what to expect. Minigame collections 
 do not usually appeal to me, and I realized from reaidng the reviews that much of what makes up 
 this game is exactly that - a series of minigames, tied together by one overarching, open-ended 
 "story." 
  However, while these are minigames, they work much better in terms of fitting the context and style 
 of the game than do most minigames, for example the ones in KOTOR or Jade Empire. The graphics 
 are nice, though the animations are a little repetitive (the same four fight endings over and over) ; 
 the sound is nothing to write home about; the story, while fun, is a little frustrating at times. 
 It's the unique gameplay that sets Pirates apart; while that works well, everything else falls 
 a little bit short of current standards.

Review:  Okay, enough of the pirate speak. This game is really pretty addictive. You kick in as child who's 
 family is captured by an evil baron. Several years later you come of age and join a crew only to 
 revolt against the tyrant of a captain. Welcome to the world of piracy as you have just obtained 
 your first pirate ship and crew. This game allows you to plunder and capture other ships, sack 
 towns, fight famous pirates, swoon governer's daughters, and search for your long lost family members. 
 No matter how successful a pirate you may be, you can only keep any crew for so long. However, 
 once you divide the plunder you start afresh with searching for a new crew, and keeping your flagship 
 for the continuing journey...... well, as long as your old crew wasn't too ticked off at you. I 
 found my crew took my flagship and left me with a lower class vessel due to me not having hardly 
 any gold at all when I decided to divide the plunder. All in all this is a good game and well worth 
 playing. While I am not into strategy games, this game is only a fraction strategy, while it has 
 action and rpg elements as well. If you are good enough maybe you can retire a swashbuckling magistrate....... or 
 better.

Review:  Gameplay: Sid meier's Pirates! is a very open ended game. After the beginning cutscenes, the game 
 sets you loose on a little ship in the big Carribean. From Louisiana to Cuba to South America, 
 the game world is huge and offers tons for you to explore. Technically, your character is there 
 to find your family, who was taken into servitude by an evil Marquis, but along the way, you'll 
 be climbing the ranks in colonial navies, dancing with the daughters of governers (you can get 
 married too, if you'd like to) , and finding pieces of maps leading you and your crew to lost treasure, 
 and competing with other famous pirates on the spanish main.
  
  Graphics: Graphically this game is very appealing. The game includes more details then you'd expect. 
 As you sail around the Carribbean, dolphins swim up alongside you, your sails go up or down when 
 you raise or lower them to alter your speed, most of the hsips are bristling with cannons, from 
 which little whisps of smoke appear when they fire. These little details really bring the game 
 to life for you, and immerse you in the life of your pirate.
  
  Sound: The sound deserves recognition as well. Different little tunes play depending on what port 
 you're in (The music will change appropriately from when you're in a Spanish port to, say, when 
 you're in a French one) . The ballroom music that plays when you're dancing with a governor's daughter 
 is also very fitting and helpful for the minigame. The ambient sounds are fitting as well. From 
 when you're soldiers fire their muskets to when two swords clang together, the sound effects also 
 do their part of drawing you into the action.
  
  Value: This game has a grat amount of replayability, as you can play the game a number of different 
 ways. For instance, one play through you can just bombard any ship you see, while on another play 
 through you may want to become a high ranking officer of one nation, and lead that nation to victory 
 against her enemies.
  
  Tilt: I find Pirates! to be a very addicting game that you can enjoy no matter how much or how 
 little time you have. In the span of a half hour, you can hijack another ship, bring it into a 
 nearby friendly port, sell it, and spend the evening dancing with the governor's daughter. I'd 
 highly reccomend this game to just about everyone, as it is well worth the money.

Review:  I really did try to get into this game. I dont like to haul all of the ships around I like to be 
 able to keep them in some port ya know. I thought the only thing about this game that was decent 
 was the on shore battles. Kinda reminded me of CNW by quicksilver. The clock in this game goes 
 way to fast, the world is so small no real nautical miles scale to this game etc.
  
  I thought that the captians combat was medicore at least if not just bad.
  
  The towns really 
 didnt have that much to offer as far as being interactive with the pirates period. Pirates of the 
 Caribean was better than this.
  
  The UI didnt offer many option to play the game left you limited down scale for the game.

Review:  Sid Meier's Pirates! is a game that will provide hours of fun for most. The overall gist of the 
 game, without going into too much detail, is one of a young lad in the Caribbean finds himself 
 missing most of his family and the seas wide open to him. You choose one of four nations to align 
 yourself with: English, Dutch, French or Spanish, and you progress from there. 
  
  As a young man, you have the option of turning to piracy or privateering, the latter being piracy 
 with the endorsement of your patron nation against an enemy of theirs. You then patrol the seas 
 of the Caribbean, seeking out ships that are ripe for the taking. First the sea battles, guns blazing, 
 then should you choose to pull in close, the sword-fighting aboard ship and assuming you are victorious 
 the spoils of war!
  
  Returning to port, you may sell your pilfered goods for a profit and visit with the governor to 
 speak business. On occasion, visiting with the governor's daughter will lead to the dancing mini-game, 
 which requires some hand-eye coordination and rhythm. Depending on the level of difficulty you 
 choose, determines how challenging and how many cues the game will give you.
  
  Woven amidst all the high seas adventure are a series of quests that you, as captain, may choose 
 to embark upon. At the end of each are rewards of various ilk.
  
  Pirates! is definitely worth the time and energy. The open-ended nature and various difficulties 
 provide for many hours of fun and challenge. For fans of the pirate genre, it is a definite must. 
 For those who enjoy a good and generally lighthearted adventure game, I definitely recommend this 
 game to you.

Review:  Let me start by first saying, this is one of the most enjoyable games I've played in quite some 
 time.
  
  You don't have to be a master button masher to dive right in. After installing the game (and patch) , 
 I was able to create my pirate and start a career of plundering within 15 minutes using only a 
 few mouse clicks and the number keypad on the keyboard. Of course there are a ton of things to 
 discover, adventures to play out, and strategies to employ which I feel give the game great replay 
 value. And I've only scratched the surface of the game.
  
  The visuals of the game are gorgeous, especially when you find yourself in ship-to-ship combat. 
 The islands are nicely detailed and the water looks like real water if you have the machine, and 
 your ships are very detailed.
  
  Overall the sound effects are very good while the music is average fare and a bit repetitive.
 
  
  Likewise, visits to the governor, the tavern, the dancing and fighting scenes exude that feeling 
 of sameness. For example, the same characters populate the English ports as do the characters for 
 the Dutch, Spanish, and French. That detracts from the immersiveness of the game a little bit. 
 It would have been nice to have encountered a divergent populace in the various ports and settlements. 
 
  
  The best part of Sid Meier's Pirates is that it is a game for Everyone. My ten year old son began 
 playing and quickly became a Duke (I am still a paltry Colonel) by seizing ships, finding buried 
 treasures, and attacking forts. He picked up on the adventure elements and some of strategy very 
 well. And believe it or not, he's actually learning a little geography too!
  
  Fear not, the game doesn't feature graphic violence, swearing, or blood. There is some swordplay 
 where the enemy captain either jumps from his ship or is booted-off by your swashbuckler.
  
  Sid Meier's Pirates for the pc is a big thumbs up in just about every way.

Review:  When I bought this game I thought it was liek a strategy game but i was in for a surprise. Pirates 
 is a perfect blend between strategy and action, making for a great and fun experiance.
  
  Basically you start of as a young leader of a group of pirates, you can visit various towns in 
 the carribian and take on missions and such. Most of the time it's trading items from one town 
 to another. You can also attack other ships in the sea and even try to catch the heart of one of 
 the towns girls.
  
  It's a fun game and perfectly executed.

Review:  The original Pirates! was a gaming achievement in the amount of gameplay stuffed into such an old 
 package. Swashbucking, naval battles, RTS attacks on towns, sea navigation, exploration, treasure 
 hunting, trading, wooing governor's daughters all in one game. 
  
  All the classic aspects of the game are back, heck there's dancing to boot. The game has a SERIOUS 
 facelift from its old counterpart. Modern graphics look great here, but the gameplay we all loved 
 is still here. The game is not even so much a normal game as it is a cohesive set of mini-games 
 that allow you to do so much. Your goal is to become the most feared, richest pirate in all the 
 Carribean, but it's more than that. 
  
  This game has the same great story as the original, you are a young man who is on the search of 
 his family. You will need to fight some rotten characters to find their whereabouts, and you will 
 fight some rotten characters just for the fun of it. You'll sack towns and capture ships, find 
 treasure and share it with your mates (or watch them mutiny) .
  
  This is a game to buy, I loved every minute of it.

Review:  After the first releases of Pirates! and Pirates! GOLD for the sega genesis I waited for the next 
 edition with great anticipation. Unlucky for me one didn't come out until just recently with Sid 
 Meier's Pirates! for the PC. To say this game lives up to it's name would be an understatement. 
 With it's original style of gameplay and great replayability, it might as well be called Pirates! 
 PLATINUM. This game adds a storyline which lacked in the previous versions and the improved 3-D 
 graphics really bring the game back to life.
  
  Gameplay- This is the game's strong point. When the original Pirates! was released for the genesis, 
 it was a revolutionary truly open ended RPG. This sequel stayed true to it's roots and ran along 
 the same track also. There is one small differences between this and the original, however. In 
 this version, there are no longer ship to town raids but instead a somewhat original buccaneer 
 to town guard strategy type mini-game. There is also a far better battle system and the addition 
 of pirate specialists that help you when in sea battles or when you are just sailing along.
  
  Graphics- The graphics were great to look at when compared to the 2-D Pirates! and Pirates! 
 GOLD but could have been better. Some of the cut scenes are beautiful but the characters are somewhat 
 blocky when compared to games like Morrowind.
  
  Sound- The one let down of this game was that there was no actual talking in the game. You could 
 hear people's voices but most of the dialogue was done with text. Swashbuckling noises, the sound 
 of waves and the excellent music make up for this though.
  
  Value- As I said before, Pirates! PLATINUM.
  
  Sid Meier did an excellent reproduction of one 
 of my personal favorite "old-school" games. It is a great and original game. After all, who wouldn't 
 want to be a pirate?

Review:  Sid Meier's Pirates is one of ship game I had ever played. When you look at the screenshot you 
 might think it looks stupid because it looks childish but your wrong. There is so much to do than 
 destorying other ships, there are dancing, trading, and even land battles. For me it was hard to 
 do the dances because Im slow but it was still funny. The another thing is your not the only one 
 whos moving the whole world is moving by it self. There could be another priates attacking somthing 
 and even Indians attacking a town. Everything in this game is good but it gets boring when you play 
 for a while, but still fun when it lasts.

Review:  For anyone old enough to remember the original pirates, you have to own this one. I have been waiting 
 for a long time, and have purchased many pirates style games, such as Pirates legend of black cat 
 also 1602 and Pirates of the Caribbean. But none have come close to this "Awsome master piece." 
 It's almost untouched from its original story line and game play. Major differences would be graphics, 
 Sid kept everything we loved of the first one and when i thought he couldn't Sid made This game 
 even better. I love this game and i know everyone who plays it will as well. Replay factor is a 
 9 out of 10 which for me to say that its got to be a great game. One of my top 5 games ever.

Review:  THIS is the game we've all been waiting for. Based on the original game Pirates released on the 
 C64, it is a faithful duplication of the essence of the original game.
  
  Sid Meiers has succesfully recaptured everything that made the original game and took it into the 
 realm of modern gaming. The graphics were kept deliberately "cartoonish" but are sharp and detailed. 
 When you are in ship to ship combat on the high seas you can see men upon the deck of your ship, 
 and cannon ports opening up on the side as each connon is made ready to fire... and don't forget 
 the joy as you watch small figures being blasted overboard has your cannonballs strike your target 
 
  
  Sid Meiers: Pirates! is a rich mix of ship combat, fencing, trade, and even dancing to woo a governers 
 daughter. You can choose to either follow the games plot (rescue your family) or simply choose 
 to increase your wealth and land holdings by privateering for any of the 4 nations.
  
  If you have a like for any of those poor imitation pirate games out in the market, then Sid Meiers: 
 Pirates! is the one you have been looking for.

Review:  If you know your games, you probably know that Sid Meier has quite a pedigree. This game certainly 
 does not disappoint.
  
  Sid Meier's Pirates! is set in the Caribbean during the golden age of piracy. The game basically 
 gives you complete freedom right from the start. You can go anywhere, do anything and be who you 
 want to be.
  
  The game does have a storyline, though. You are supposed to be rescuing your relatives, but you 
 can go the entire game without doing that, though you wont get the best ending. Other than that, 
 you can dig for treasure, become a merchant, or just blow everyone up. The game gives you complete 
 freedom.
  
  The graphics are good, considering how much is on the screen at once. The sound, however, is great. 
 You can hear everything from the wind blowing through your sails to the pirate music playing in 
 the taverns.
  
  I would reccommend this game for everyone. It offers good, clean fun and almost endless replay 
 value. This is very close to being the perfect game.

Review:  Pirates! was widely anticipated and following the Pirates of the Carribean craze, hundreds went 
 out to buy this game. I personally enjoyed the gameplay, but the repetitiveness of battles, and 
 time spend sailing along a boring ocean bring the rating of this game down quite a bit.
  The many options you have and places to explore leave this game in the category of a feelancer 
 role playing game, without the full control of the character unless fighting other pirates or battling 
 it on land. 
  For a modern game, i would expect a lot more from the gameplay, and found the game to be rather 
 simple and easy to get bored with. 
  For a quick thrill of being a pirate, buy it a enjoy, but don't expect it to become a classic like 
 the famous Civilization. My advice to one thinking about purchasing this game, rent, or buy for 
 $5-$10 on ebay (thats what i did) , its not worth the money.

Review:  First, let me say that I'm glad I bought this game. There are lots of cool elements to this game. 
 But after spending, oh, a dozen hours or so, the game has essentially shown you everything it has. 
 I'm actually playing the game again at a higher difficulty level, but I find the game way to easy 
 once again. 
  
  The biggest shortcoming I would note is that every town seems to look the same. You have the same 
 generic "town doings" menu everytime you make port, and with the same choices (with governors/mayors 
 being the only exception at major towns) . In other words, this game has a very "console-like" feel 
 to it. It doesn't have the depth of some of the other not-so-graphically superior fore-fathers 
 (take Cutthroats, for example) , although it's quite close at times.
  
  Sound: Great. Ships sails flapping, cannons booming, the yells of agony of from the crew of a ship 
 getting 20 cannon-fulls of grapeshot, even the music is superb.
  
  Graphics: Mixed bag. Combat sequences very good. General sailing around, ok. Cutscenes, extremely 
 cartoonish.
  
  Gameplay: Great first time through. Lots of different types of ships and LOTS of ports to visit 
 (although you can't tell them apart once you land!)
  
  Value: Lots of fun first and even second time through... after that, well, time for something else!
 
  
  Bottom line: If buying this game will bring more quality pirate titles to the PC world, then do 
 it!

Review:  I remember wasting away countless hours on the original Pirates! on my Commodore 64. Even though 
 the graphics were blocky and the sound was bleeps and bloops, I just loved it! It really sucked 
 you in, you felt like you really had a stake in what your Pirate alter-ego was doing. You felt 
 his losses and you reveled in his successes. It was a huge hit for Sid and this updated version 
 is no less engrossing. All of the original's great gameplay is here: sword fights on the gunwales, 
 swooning the young ladies for information or even their hands, crushing ship-to-ship battles, ship 
 and crew management etc... its all here, but better. The graphics are simply stunning and really 
 help to bring that time period to life. The scenery, the ships, the water, everything is simply 
 beautiful. In the original, you had to pass the time while traveling by sea waiting for your next 
 ship-board encounter by looking at blue pixels pass by but with todays technology, you can't take 
 your eyes off the passing scenery. All of the original gameplay has been enhanced in various ways. 
 When traveling by sea, you now can see your entire fleet of ships and you have to travel as fast 
 as your slowest ship. You have to watch the wind, as you did in the original game, and travel with 
 it but now you do it in real time with your entire fleet in tow. Now you have to watch where every 
 one of your ships is lest they crash on a coral reef. You can also see other ships on the map, 
 when they come into view. No longer do you have to sail around in circles looking for invisible 
 ships to conquer. The sword fights have been enhanced too. You have more choices for moves with 
 a little acrobatics thrown in for good measure. You can also combine moves into combos. Ship battles 
 are stunning to look at and just as pivotal as in the original. The tension is still there but 
 made so much more interesting by the graphics. There is nothing like watching little pirates or 
 sailors getting blown off the decks along with wood, ropes, boxes etc.. by a devastating broadside. 
 Now you can tailor your cannon loads, grape shot, chain shot, or cannon balls depending on whether 
 you are looking to take out the crew (especially if your well outnumbered) , the sails (if your 
 ship is slow) , or the ship itself. Sid even added a cotillion dancing sequence where you have to 
 dance with same grace and skill with young ladies to gain their favor so you can get some inside 
 information or even her hand in marriage, but only if you want to. Its all rendered in gorgeous, 
 bright 3D graphics. I could gush on and on about the game and its graphics so I'll move over to 
 the sound. It's great! The music is awesomely nautical and not obnoxious in the slightest. The 
 sounds are just right. The rushes of wind, the waves lapping at the bow, the ringing of the ships 
 bell, and the cry of seagulls while your sailing around is just beautiful. It really makes you 
 feel there. All the intrigue with finding family members, notorious pirates, and burried treasure 
 is all here too. As you unravel these secrets, your pirate develops in his chosen profession. He 
 gains fame, fortune, family and more. Then after hours of personal guidance on the high seas, there 
 is nothing more rewarding to retire and find out exactly how you rank in your "civilian" life after 
 pirating. This is a must have for any fan of Sid Meir, pirates, boats, water, seagulls, computers, 
 small stones..... you get the picture. Now get the game!

Review:  Alright ye sea dogs, Sid Mier is practically a legend in the game industry and one of his most 
 loved creations was definitely the original Pirates! Near the end of last year a remake of this 
 classic came out and was met with very positive reviews from the critics, and it deserved every 
 bit of praise that it got. Now sit down and listen mateys, arrrrrrrrr.
  
  Pirates! is a rather simplistic game, but the simplicity is one of the games strong points. The 
 only real story is that your family was torn apart by some guy and now you want to rescue them 
 and seek revenge. The game is very free form, however; you are not forced to do the main quest. 
 Indeed, you can live a pirates life without even starting the main quest.
  
  Pirates! is for the most part a collection of mini games that are interconnected by a 'world map' 
 like mode where you sail your ship, dock at ports and hunt for buried treasure, arrrrrrrr. The 
 mini games consist of turn based strategy (assaulting a town or stronghold) , real time naval combat, 
 dueling an enemy Captain, dancing, and sneaking through a town where you are not exactly an honored 
 guest. Pirates gives ye some variety ye sea dog. The mini games are solid and for the most part 
 well designed. The bad part about the gameplay is the quests; often times (mostly in the main quest) 
 you'll be chasing the same guy all over the Carribean fifty times to finish that map so you can 
 rescue a relative. Can you say tedious?
  
  The graphics in Pirates! are beautiful. The Carribean is brought to life through brightly colored 
 islands, and a detailed oceans that even contains jumping dolphins. Pirates! contains a living 
 and breathing Carribean that lets you do whatever you wish.
  
  The audio in Pirates! is good. The occasional music is usually heroic or themed towards a particular 
 nation when you're near or in a port. The sound effects sound clear and match where they are placed 
 well (even the singing pirates) . There's no real voice acting, rather there is gibberish representing 
 characters speech and the gibberish sounds... interesting.
  
  Pirates is a superb game and easily recommendable to anyone looking for a fun and addictive adventure 
 on the high seas. Some of the mini games may seem tedious to some (dancing is usually the biggest 
 hair stealer) but the game is overall extremely enjoyable and well designed.

Review:  When I first saw this game I thought "Noob Game". This was as far from the truth as you get. This 
 game rules. I love this game and have beaten it over and over again and still get a different gaming 
 experience each time!
  The greatest thing about this game is that it is something unlike you have ver played before. I 
 have never found a game quite like this. The greatest thing is my parents actually like it (I don't 
 know why they get irritated when I play F. E. A. R. The word may never know) because it is very historically 
 acurate. But to date I really havn't learned anyhting. I don't know about you but if I learn to 
 much while gaming I get a migrane. 
  The duels are fantastic. Fast paced, awesome cut scenes, and weapon choice all add to the gameplay. 
 It never gets old and always changes. When you get to swashbuckler this really gets exciting!
 
  The land battles are even better. you may think that turn based battle may stink but it is far 
 from it. It is so addicting and coming up with new strategies to pone your enemies is always fun. 
 Plus you get a load of cash each time you win.
  The dancing is incredibly hard! OMG! unless you have the dancing shoes you have no chance at all 
 of getting a hot wife none.
  This has got to be one of my all time favorite games. If you havnt played it yet go to your nearest 
 gaming store and buy. Just do it.

Review:  I was still playing! The graphics are not the best, but it is a game now that is one year old, 
 but it is fun. I needed a change from all the FPS I have been playing, and this fit the bill perfect! 
 I usually do not like RPG type games, but this one is SO easy to learn and play, that it makes 
 it so easy to like and enjoy, I am just sorry it took me a year to buy it! Well worth the 30 bucks! 
 
  Nothing like attacking ships, an hearing the helpless screams of the crew as they go down in flames, 
 the sound bites make me laugh... just plain, good fun int his game, it is refreshing!
  
  ARRRRRGGGHHHHHHH..... aye aye Captain!!!

Review:  My little brother bought this game and i was really fond of it just because of what is was about. 
 Pirates? how could they make a good game out of pirates. Many companies have tried and failed. 
 but weeks went by and all i heard was my bro playing so one day i decided to give it a try and 
 ever since i have been hooked on it. Its amazing what u can do. Trade, attack ships, board ships, 
 sack settlements, look for buried treasure, do missions for countries, get ranked, build a fleet, 
 a crew, upgrade your ships, explore lands, own property, sneak into enemy settlements, divide plunder, 
 retire, you even need to buy food for your crew and the food will only last a couple months.
  
  and plus there is a story line which makes this game even better. i never get bored of it.

Review:  Now, I could start this review out with a cheesy pirate quote such as: "Shiver me timbers" or "Ahoy, 
 good game ahead". And that would be perfect for this game! Pirates! is full of all the swashbuckling 
 adventure you would expect. In the game you will sword fight with enemy captains, woo govenor's 
 daughters, and sail your own ship. The world of Pirates! is extremely colorful with swaying palm 
 trees and the blue, open sea. There were a few minus features such as the fact that there are no 
 character voices, also some of the characters look a little bit too blocky and sharp angles. Also, 
 when I was fighting the other captains, my crew didn't show up. This game is great fun for anyone 
 who has always to be a pirate. ARGH!!!!!

Review:  This is a really nice game, if you're looking for a "toy"-game. Because that's what it is. It's 
 like playing in the sandbox again, and I love it! Very atmospheric settings and lots of ships to 
 play with. The dancing mini-game is actually a lot more fun than it sounds. Fencing is ok, but 
 not why I play it. It do get a bit repetitive after a while, but hey, what did you expect from 
 a sandbox?
  
  Buy this game if you are tired of "shot 30 zombies and return for a reward" -games or "Run this 
 errand in less than 2 minutes, and get a super bana cap!" and want to play around for a while.

Review:  I love Sid Meier games. They never are a let down, and Pirates! is surely not a let down either. 
 It has great gameplay, graphics, and innovative features.
  
  However, I found myself shelving the game alot early then the Civ games out there. Of course, I 
 shelved it after 2 months of hardcore playing. It just seemed that after awhile, the indivdual 
 games just blurred together. There never was any new objective other than the main one. Sure, tehre 
 are alot of sub objectives, but they too are all the same. For instance, dating was exactly the 
 same no matter who the girl was. All the pirate capturing was generally the same, etc.
  
  It's a good game, but don't expect to play it too long without getting repetition.

Review:  It was a great remake of a game I enjoyed playing. Everything looked beautiful but there wasnt 
 as much variety as I was expecting considering how long it has been since the first release.
  
  Game play  I loved the addition of upgrades for yourself and ship but it wasnt very complicated 
 getting them. I liked having the little settlements but didnt find them all that useful. Everything 
 was vibrant and fun the first few times you did them but then it got repetitious and more tedious 
 than fun.
  
  Dueling  It was never highly challenging before and besides a few scenery changes not different 
 and even used the same keys. 
  
  Land Battles  Ive played more challenging and fun sequences in lesser games. I was really expecting 
 more from this feature and again it was the same thing every time you raided a place. Also, once 
 you sack a port and change it to someone friendly they no longer generate ships for you to attack.
 
  
  Ship Battles  This is where they excelled and where I got my main enjoyment. This still wears 
 off as being exciting by the twentieth time you do it. 
  
  Towns and Governors  All were basically the same except for a few decorations for the different 
 nationalities.
  
  Sneaking  Pacman is more fun.
  
  Governors Daughter  The dancing feature almost made me hate the game. There was also no variety 
 until you did this once or twice and you had to do it in every town just to get information. They 
 all had the same personality and there were only three different looks. 
  
  Graphics  The world map was amazing and a pleasure to look at. However, everything else lacked 
 variety besides a different hat or color. Every English governor was the same. Every plain daughter 
 looked the same. You could travel for months just to see the same things you left. 
  
  Sound  Ive never bought the soundtrack to a game and ambient noises are nice but nothing to really 
 judge a game on. For me, the main way to gauge this is on the voice acting. Unless you like the 
 sound of Charlie Browns teacher Id say this was a big let down.
  
  Value  While playing with your first character all you do is repeat yourself so I dont know why 
 youd want to play it again unless you got too old to finish the main story line the first time. 
 It definitely outdid the classic on the commodore but so has almost every game that came out for 
 the SNES.

Review:  This game has excellent graphics. Its fun to play for a couple of hours but quickly becomes boring. 
 There are only so many ships you can capture and even though the story keeps expanding and you 
 are given additional missions they all start to seem repetitive after a couplef of hours playing 
 the game. The dancing "missions" are especially bad. The sword fighting quickly breaks down into 
 rapid mouse clicks with no real strategy involved. It was all timing and deterning the attack/defense 
 tactics of the opponent which wasn't hard to do.
  
  As I said the graphics are top notch and the sound is excellent. The only thing holding this game 
 back is the game play which quickly becomes boring.

Review:  I bought Pirates at Target for 7 bucks! Great game, very fun and not too short. One annoying part 
 was the wind direction that always pointed in one direction, but I guess thats just the way wind 
 blows in the Carribean. Only thing is is that the characters dont have a voice, just texts of dialogue. 
 Music sometimes gets anoying. I especially like the way that you can roam around the carribean 
 and attack ships at will. Graphics are pretty good and very colorful. THe gameplay is extensive 
 as you can battle onther ships, figh hand to hand with other captains and pirates, dance with daughters 
 of governors, and even disimbark on land to explore. I reccomed this game to anyone of any age.

Review:  I always post criticism and a wish list with my reviews. It is always my hope that my wishes are 
 at least considered by the game devs, but...
  
  This game is just plain fun! The animation, graphics, and cinematics, as well as the musical score 
 make this an indulgence that can be played for a hundred hours! How can you beat that for $49.99? 
 With all the pleasure I got from it, I figured it was the best .50 cents per hour I'd spent this 
 year! 
  
  It's original, it's immersive, and just plain fun! Oh, sure, it crashed a few times, and that was 
 a tad frustrating, but after the patches, and the experience I got playing, the game grew more 
 and more on me, and I had a blast the whole time!
  
  I think they could use a bit more variety in ships, characters, ladies, and better character customization, 
 though. I'd have scored this game MUCH higher if they'd have implemented that. Plus, what good 
 are toys if we can't actually USE them? I'd like to aim those flintlocks myself, and score a headshot! 
 ARRRRGH!
  
  I think scars and damage should be shown, as well. Here's hoping for a Pirates ] [!!!
  
  Hope 
 you're readin' this Sid, thou gamemaster you! You're really something! If it weren't for you, I'd 
 have a far better social life. To that degree I offer my sincerest thanks! People are no good, 
 anyway! Hahaha.
  
  A swashbuckling, rip-roaring great time... Could use some more features, but the controls, etc... 
 I mean they're great! There's always room for improvement with everything, but overall, my gaming 
 experience with pirates has been addicting, immersive, and just plain fun! I'd like, in the future, 
 MORE THAN ANYTHING!!! To be able to build, and design my own ship (s) . I don't care how obscene 
 the cost! I'd like to paint that sucker myself, and make it as big as the titanic if I want! Cinematics 
 of my ship coming to port, and people either fleeing, or rushing to see the Great Captain Daniel! 
 Also, I'd like to pay my fellow pirates a wage to keep their loyalty up. Not only THAT, but I think 
 battle experience, and sailing experience should be a factor. Most importantly, I'd love it if 
 you let us build our own ships, customize 'em, and to create custom characters with our garbs of 
 choice, and facial features, etc. Let us scar, let us bleed, let us age! Let us have reputations 
 that effect morale of those we fight! Custom flags, the whole bit! Do that, Sid, and you'll have 
 a re-playable series that stands the test of time just like your Civilization series!
  
  Yo ho ho and a bottle of fun is right!
  
  Oh, one last dig...
  
  It *IS* a repetitive game 
 after awhile. Obscenely priced customized ships will keep us wanting more and more! VIVA VARIETY!!!

Review:  First let me say that if you were a fan of the original game then you should already have bought 
 this updated version, and quite frankly I don't know why you are wasting time reading this when 
 you could be playing!
  
  I'm sad to say that even though this game was released last year I didn't get the chance to play 
 it until this week. I'd actually spent the first four months of this year playing World Of Warcraft, 
 and since then I've been working on reducing my debt's and so hadn't been purchasing many PC games. 
 But boy, I realised this week that I have been missing something, because Pirates! is the best 
 game I have played since World Of Warcraft.
  
  Like World Of Warcraft, Pirates! is a nice looking game that is easy to pick up and hard to put 
 down. The controls are brilliant, and simplistic. Simplicity in picking up and controlling a game 
 is a key area for me, and Pirates! is perfect in this respect.
  
  My intitial impression was not good, there was no character speech in either the intro's or in-game, 
 which is downright bizarre in a modern game. However once I had hit the open seas these concerns 
 no longer mattered because the gameplay is perfect, although simplistic.
  
  In fact even though I have been crying out for old-school gaming done with modern technology, to 
 finally see it happening here is an odd feeling. It really is bizzare to be playing such a simplistic 
 game in the days of Grand Theft Auto, but because everything has been done right you forget about 
 all that while playing because this game is FUN.
  
  I actually went back and played the Amiga version and let me tell you that the modern technology 
 makes this new version of Pirates! work. If you had never played Pirates, there is no way you would 
 want to play the older version - yet in a strange twist, even though the new version is essentially 
 the same game, the same person that wouldn't want to play the old one would love this one. I'm 
 sure of that.
  
  What didn't I like? I didn't like the new turn-based method for attacking towns. In the old game 
 I believe you controlled and switched between your groups of soldiers in real-time, and when you 
 made it to the fort you got to sword fight the commander. Well, in this version it's entirely turnbased, 
 with all sorts of attack and defense bonus - it's far too strategic for my liking, and takes too 
 much time. It's kind of like racing a car, and you are having a lot of fun racing it, but then 
 you have to stop to fix a puncture - and in the case of Pirates! the puncture is this turn based 
 method of attacking towns. By the way, this is the only way you can attack towns because they have 
 removed the old sequence where you go to attack the fort with your ship!
  
  On the other hand, this actually shows how much fun the rest of the game actually is. The other 
 thing which I don't think was necessary was having to dance with the Governer's daughter. It's 
 totally pointless, and unfortunately cannot be turned off. It's so pointless that I tended not 
 to do it once I had gotten married in game.
  
  One more change, which may actually be a good one, although I personally found it to be a time 
 waster and found that it distracts you from all the fun you were having, is the new sneak into 
 town sequence. In the old game the sneak was either successful, or it wasn't. But now you actually 
 have to control the character sneaking through the town. I'm kind of biased in this area because 
 I hate stealth mechanics in ANY kind of game.
  
  What totally sold me on this game was the ship battles, they are quite simply awesome. The details 
 on the ships is more than acceptable. You see your crew (an low res 2D) on your ship, you get to 
 see sails getting ripped and masts collapsing. Hell, you even see crew members jumping overboard 
 and throwing barrels (of loot) overboard as well. Your ship casts a reflection in the water, and 
 the colour palette used in the game is brilliant. This game looks fantastic in my opinion. You 
 do get some new options in the ship battles in the form of chain shot and grape shot. Chain shot 
 is my preferred method of attack, and all it basically does is rip the enemy sails to shreds until 
 their mast collapses. Grape shot targets only the enemy crew. This may be a useful option if you 
 don't want to make repairs, but on the other hand your ship will probably take a beating in the 
 process because both Chain and Grape shots require you to be within a certain range of the enemy 
 ship.
  
  You can actually upgrade ships, and towns have their own specific upgrades you can apply. You can 
 make you ship sail faster, turn better, make your shots do more damage and so on. In total I believe 
 there are at least 6 upgrades, and most probably 8 all up. One nice feature is that when you are 
 sailing on the main map you actually get to see all the ships in your fleet, and also unlike the 
 original game the ship you have is what you see while sailing around. The original game had a generic 
 ship for the main view, and maybe some specific looking ships during combat.
  
  Sound is fantastic. In fact the whole game keeps the tradition of the original, but the sound even 
 more so. My favourite sample is the seagulls, and the sound of the waves - oh and the sound of 
 40 guns firing off a chain shot. Hey , I even like the sound made when you switch between different 
 attacks.
  
  I should at least mention that the sword fighting in this new game is very, very well done and 
 the ebb and flow of battle is displayed on screen in a very cinematic fashion. There are a few 
 different animations for disposing of the enemy ships captain, which I wont mention because it 
 would spoil the experience. Even after you have seen them all, you don't get tired of them because 
 of the amount of fun you will have playing the game.
  
  In summary, I don't think it's possible to hate this game unless you only liked action games, ie 
 FPS and their like, exclusively. This is the most fun game I have played for quite a while and 
 you should definitely buy Pirates! if you like games that can be played without having to read 
 a manual.

Review:  Generally I agree with many of the other positive opinions on this game. My kids really like it 
 too... when it doesn't crash or get stuck in a state of gameplay you cannot escape from. For example 
 more than once my son's pirate ship has been stuck in a little inlet simply unable to manuever 
 out back to see. More than once after leaving a port the ship seemed to appear in the middle of 
 a continent according to the map with no way out.
  
  Crashing was random when just sailing around and reproduced on 3 different PCs with different types 
 of video adapters. Also crashes sometimes forced a reboot of win XP! 
  
  Its actually been quite a long time since I've experience such a popular game to have such awful 
 quality and we play many on thee same PCs with for more taxing system requirements like Star Wars 
 Battlefront, Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth and Anarchy Online just to name a few.
 
  
  What a disappointing piece of crap, and it looked so fun too.
  
  Version evaluated is 1.02 (patched from 1.0 CD-ROM) .
  Win XP on machines with 2GHz, 256MB & integrated 
 Intel Video as well as 3GHz Pentium 4 w/nVidia 5200 AGP video.

Review:  I picked this up last week discounted down to 29.95, after almost getting it at release (I've owned 
 pretty much every Sid game since the original C-64 Pirates and F19 Stealth Fighter) . I was not 
 disappointed!
  
  Although the game is pretty easy to learn, and incredibly simplistic in today's age of bells and 
 whistles, it never loses sight of the reason games exist to begin with: to have fun! This game 
 never feels like work at all, not even when you are starting out and learning the ropes. It's incredibly 
 easy to pick up and play.
  
  That's not to say there isn't depth or longevity to the game. Once you get your initial fix of 
 naval combat and swordplay, you'll soon realize there are a whole host of medium and long term 
 goals and missions to accomplish. And a really fantastic feature is the ability to change difficulty 
 settings mid career, after dividing your plunder. Trip not going well? The game gives you the option 
 of moving down in difficulty before you return to the seas. Conversely, if you are mopping up the 
 Caribbean, it will prompt you to move up a setting (which increases your share of the spoils) as 
 you reembark for more plunder and mayhem.
  
  There are a few downsides. The duels and dances become routine pretty fast, with not too much variety 
 to them. Once you recognize your opponent's windup, it's easy to block or dodge his attack and 
 counter it. Likewise, the dances become simple pattern recognition games. But my biggest complaint 
 was the lack of voice acting. All the various governors, villians, bar folk, and ladies all say 
 pretty much the same lines every time. It wouldn't have taken a whole lot to put speech to these 
 lines instead of the "simspeak" with subtitles.
  
  But these are minor quibbles, and really don't detract too much from the game as a whole. Pirates 
 is just plain highly-addictive fun. Even though you accomplish short-term goals almost constantly 
 (ideal save points) , you always find yourself saying "Well, just ONE more trip to Curacao, then 
 I'll go to bed." Six trips and two hours later, you are still going strong. In an age of over-ambitious 
 games with lots of flash and pomp, high learning curves, and in depth micromanagement, Pirates 
 has taken us back to the roots of what games are supposed to be all about: Having fun.

Review:  I bought this game because of all the rave reviews but I must say that this is the most boring 
 game I ever played. You literally do the same thing over and over. I mean, they do'nt even change 
 the characters in each location. Every pub had the same bartender, woman, new recruits, and the 
 same guy sitting in the back. You fight the same battles over and over. What did the reviewers 
 see in this game. The graphics are mediocre, there is no voice acting and the game play is repetitive. 
 I am not a big fan of strategy games , so if you are I would still recommend a rental. Or you can 
 have my copy. I think I will stick with games like Half-life 2 and KOTOR.

Review:  I originally played this game on my Sega Genesis. I used to sit in front of my TV for hours and 
 played this game. I loved it then, and I love this game even more now.
  You first start out by choosing your name, skills and difficulty. They are the same skills as in 
 other Pirates! games, so I was a little disappointed in that. Once you choose your country, you 
 are off to wreak havoc on the Caribbean.
  At first glance this game seems kinda childish, but once you get going, this game can be highly 
 addictive. The gameplay is fantastic. Very easy to learn, but it might take a little bit to master. 
 With the various difficulty settings sword fighting, for example, can get very difficult later 
 on in the game. The dancing sections at the ball is fun, but gets repetitive after a while. Also 
 in the sea battles, once you upgrade your ship, they become very easy. But, as you increase the 
 difficulty level, they can get challenging.
  The graphics are great. Many of the scenes have cinematic interludes that look great. The details 
 of the ships and very noticeable and change based on the ship you have. Also, your character changes 
 as he ages, which is a nice touch.
  Overall, I enjoyed this game. I am a big fan of first person shooters, and this is one of the most 
 fun, non violent games I have played in a long time. I highly recommend this game to all ages. 
 Anyone who wants to have fun time, with an open-ended story should get this game.

Review:  The game looks nice and fun to play... at the beginning. Once you have spent a few hours on it 
 it becomes very repetitive. In about 10 hours I've done everything it can be done and reached almost 
 the maximum score in every category. It's too short, so easy that you can't find almost any challenge 
 playing it and lacks deepness.
  
  You can continue playing as long as you want as has no real end, but I find no reason to continue 
 playing it after a few hours. It's sad that a good game concept like this hasn't been developed 
 enough to get a good game.

Review:  I think the biggest problem with this game, is that despite how fun it is at first, it quickly 
 becomes boring. There is no depth or lasting quality to the initial fun. 
  
  From reading other reviews, you know that the game is a set of 4 mini games, each one is in fact 
 fun in it's own right, however they easily become repetitive and boring, as none of them have any 
 depth. I once read an interview with Sid Meier, where he said something to the effect and I am 
 paraphrasing here that "Designing a game game requires giving the player lots of interesting choices". 
 That design philosophy did not survive during the development of this game.
  
  As someone whose gaming budget is very low, I am extremely disappointed that I spent the money 
 to buy this game.

Review:  Do you like to play games? Do you spend most of your life wasted in front of the computer or Tv 
 eating cheetos and playing videogames? Then why not waste a few hours on Sid Miers Pirates... Pirates.. 
 those rascally people who tend to rape and plunder made all cute and compact for your pleasure. 
 
  
  The gameplay is pretty simple and straight forward, you have the option of selecting which nation 
 you would like to be partnered with and the difficulty, which in duing so is the only way to effect 
 the gameplays difficulty, which it's not hard. Maybe on Hard... But I am a normal kinda player. 
 Anywho, you go from island to island, capturing and fighting ships along the way, getting clues 
 as to where to hunt treasure and how to win the govena's daughter... on Keira Knightly... how I'd 
 like to ... Mmm.. Yeap So pretty fun, entertaining at least. For those more simple minded times 
 in our lives.
  
  I would like a more realist pirate simulation, and I am sure that some are out there. But I doubt 
 they got the treatment this game received. Give it a try when it goes down to $20 dollars for sure...

Review:  Sid Meier's Pirates! is awesome. If you care about presentation more than gameplay, well it is 
 not the best game out there. If you don't care too much about presentation, rather than gameplay 
 you will fall in love with it. Where should I start? Well, lets talk about the combat. When you 
 engage with another ship you go into one on one (one on two if they have an escort) . You can dicide 
 to kill the ship, or to board it. If you dicide to kill it, you need to think ahead with the aiming. 
 If you want to capture it and board it, you have to dodge the other ships cannon fire, get up close, 
 and ram it. You board the ship and fence (sword fighting) . You knock the enemy captain off and 
 get the cargo and the ship, if you want. That is just one thing you do. There is so much more. 
 If you have the money, do yourself a favor and pick up this game.

Review:  Pirates was a game that I cherished as a kid on my Commodore 64. When I found out they were making 
 a new PC release version I was stoked!
  
  Sid Meier's Pirates! makes many many improvements to the old game "system" while naturally enhancing 
 it's graphic and audio capabilities. Included in the game is a sort of "loot system" in which you 
 can acquire specialized items which will help in your buccaneering, which might be won by dancing 
 well with a governor's daughter or purchased from a shady character in a tavern.
  
  Did I mention dancing? Why yes, the courting of governors daughters is now much more elaborate 
 which involves actually dance scenes which you can do well or poorly. Repeated successful visitations 
 will usually prompt your lady to ask for a ring or necklace as a symbol of your love, which you 
 might acquire elsewhere. You move on to dueling her jealous fiance, and all sorts of other fun 
 quests.
  
  But let's skip the mushy stuff, on to combat! There have been several versions of "Pirates!" released 
 since the original commodore game. However none of them have had ship combat with quite the same 
 feel. It is usually too rushed or just seems wrong in some way. Thankfully this new release of 
 Pirates has "hit the nail on the head" when it comes to ship combat. New aspects include grape 
 shot for shearing down crew and chain shot for breaking sails and masts thus limiting manouverability. 
 Ship destruction sequences include explosions and buckles and sinkings accompanied by men jumping 
 into the water to save themselves.
  
  Sword fighting was kept rather simple in mechanic, but now includes fantastic looking cut-scene 
 quality backgrounds with raging fires, pirates locked in combat, pitching decks... it's truly awesome 
 looking. You end up doing alot of sword combat in the game and may grow tired of the intro and 
 out-tro sequences of sword combat, but they are easily skippable right into the action with a left 
 mouse click.
  
  Land combat is improved into a turn based strategy style game. Once you learn the rules you will 
 find yourself conquering numerically superior armies with a little tact. They are the longest combat 
 sequences, but the rewards are almost always worth it. A tip for you town taking swashbucklers: 
 stop in a pirate haven and direct them to attack a town with a heavy garrison. follow the pirate 
 ship in and they will take a good chunk of the militia to Davy Jones' Locker.
  
  The game is relatively bug free. There are 2 that stand out rather plainly, but have workarounds. 
 One may not be a bug, but basically you end up fighting "The Evil Baron Raymondo" over and over 
 for bits of information on your entire long lost family. If you rescue them all expect to fight 
 him about 20 times. Is this the only guy in the entire carribean that knows anything about your 
 family? The other bug is when you are on land looking for treasure and have your telescope out 
 and are returned to your ship, game time slows to a crawl until you go back to land, turn your 
 telescope off and continue your journey.
  
  I give Pirates a 10 for gameplay, since it's fun, easy to learn, and works fantastic.
  
  Graphics 
 I give a 9, they are truly beautiful. I've seen better, but they are awesome
  
  Sound, 9, sounds great but music is a little midi-ish. Nostalgic but could have been better.
 
  
  Value, 7, you get some replayability in this game, but not as much as I'd have hoped.
  
  Reviewer's Tilt, 10, cause I LOVE PIRATES!

Review:  I usually spend my PC gaming time filling Nazis, Demons and Aliens full of lead. So Sid Meier's 
 Pirates! is a bit of a departure for me, but boy was it fun. I spent about 20 hours sailing, fencing 
 and dancing my way around the Caribbean, and had an absolute blast. It is the kind of game that 
 reminds you that the focus of PC Games should be gameplay first, not graphics or sound (case in 
 point, Doom 3) . Note: The graphics in this game are not bad, there are some nice water effects, 
 etc. I have been around long enough that I could have played the original, but unfortunately I 
 missed that one.
  The game gives you the option to increase the difficultly level as it progresses and you become 
 more familiar with the combat/romance/sailing. The difficultly level does get outragously hard 
 on the final "swashbuckler" level, especially since your character ages (and slows down) throughout 
 the game. In frustration I smashed my keyboard, and had to re-glue the Enter key back on -- oops. 
 So DO NOT wait until your character is 41 years old and you made to the last difficultly level 
 to try to beat the main villain. Take it from me and my broken keyboard, you just can't do it.
 
  If you are thinking about picking up this game, do yourself a favor and buy it. Especially if 
 you would not usually play a game like this one.

Review:  Well where do I begin? Sid Meier has constantly created games that strive for real time simulation 
 of the specified enviornment. Examples such as Sim City or The Sims are wonderful examples. Pirates 
 does not steer away from the formula but the problem occurs when the game becomes to tedious rather 
 then engaging in simple guilty pleasure fun. 
  
  You start out this game with your main character who's family has been kidnapped by some pirate. 
 I really didn't care too much about the storyline. You go ahead and name your character, who looks 
 completely generic (you get what they give ya) , pick a difficulty, and a specialty and you're off. 
 
  
  The main point of the game is to sale around, loot other ships and towns, and eventually find your 
 family. Apparently there are quests that you're suppossed to partake in, but I never really understood 
 what I was suppossed to be doing. So I just sailed around and took over other ships. While this 
 was exciting as I enjoy bolstering my characters wealth, I noticed one main problem with the game; 
 your crew's happiness. If you sale for long voyages, or lose battles your crew can become demoralized 
 and eventually leave your ship in an angry manner. While it sounds like an interesting feature 
 it's simply rediculous and I'll explain why as losing crew is generally one of the worst things 
 that can happen.
  
  Okay, so the wind in this game is a major factor, as you're obviously sailing. Therefore, when 
 you're sailing against the wind it takes forever in a day to get somewhere. Well remember when 
 I said that your crew becomes less happy the longer you sale? Yeah, if you want to get to a far 
 eastern town (as the wind blows west) then you're simply screwed. Your crew is going to get upset, 
 leave and that's that. So how do you prevent crew dissatisfication? You simply have to divide the 
 plunder. But yeah, this leaves you with hardly any gold, and you can only keep one ship. Did I 
 mention your entire crew leaves? This is just WAY too tedious for me. It's annyong, you capture 
 the TOP pirates ships, and get treasure maps, and your crew is still upset, so you have to divide 
 the plunder, which causes you to lose everything.
  
  Aside from crew problems, everything else gets repetitive. The minigames are fun, but once you 
 get the timings down it's a piece of cake. I could take down any pirate on the 2nd to last hardest 
 difficulty just by sailing into his ship and battling the captain. Pathetically easy, and as you 
 can see above, I didn't play the game THAT long. Dancing can get difficult, but that's only if 
 you're using a laptop keyboard. 
  
  Overall sid Meier's Pirates! was flat out, a bore. You click here and there to take down a ship, 
 collect gold, watch your crew get unhappy, split the plunder, rinse and repeat. The whole time 
 I was lost as to which quest I needed to complete. I gained ranks multiple times but I was like... 
 "okaaay... now what?" Perhaps I should've visited GameFaqs but I usually go there for tips/hints 
 when I finish the game, not a complete Walkthrough. Also, for all you RPG/'can be proud of my final 
 character' people, forget it. Apparently your main character ages, and must eventually retire from 
 his career, and the game ends. So if you want to keep your character you're going to have to get 
 a trainer. 
  
  6.2 overall rating. Seems okay. Graphics were good (not great) sound is lame (water splashes, same 
 ol generic crappy pirate music, and your lame crew when actually happy goes YO HO HO!!!) , and gameplay 
 is redundant. Wait until this game comes WAY down in price unless you LOVE the simulation.

Review:  By Rijorat-AG, Advanced-Gamer. net
  
  You hear the crack of a whip. One of your fellow crewmates screams out in pain. You and your fellow 
 men have been at sea for six months under the tyrannical leadership of Captain Drake. Row you 
 scurvy dogs! Row! he yells. You constantly find yourself wondering how you ended up working for 
 such an evil man. Supposedly hes doing a good service to the Crown by delivering goods to the 
 New World. But really you know that hes getting rich off you and your fellow crewmates blood, 
 sweat, and tears. Your thoughts constantly turn to the finer points of a pirates life and how 
 you could become rich yourself simply by doing the world a favor and relieving all the Captain 
 Drakes out there of their precious cargo.
  
  You hear footsteps behind you. What are you daydreaming about? The whip cracks. Angry, you make 
 a grab for it. Lo and behold you catch it. Furious you rise up and rip the whip from the captains 
 hands. Shock spreads across his face as he realizes whats happening. You advance on him. The other 
 men see whats happening and they too rise. The captain grabs for his sword. You step in and punch 
 him in the face; you grab his sword and yank it out of its sheath. You place the tip upon his neck, 
 and simply say I think its time for you to leave Mr. Drake.
  
  A few hours later with the former captain and his fellow officers stranded on a small island, you 
 and the men set out to make your fortune in The New World.
  
  Your background in the game is that of young lad whose family had been kidnapped by a ruthless 
 man and carted off to the New World. Once you come of age you book work on a ship headed to the 
 Caribbean so you can begin searching for them. Along the way there is a mutiny and you take control 
 of the small ship. Your destiny lies ahead, and the path you take is up to you.
  
  When you start out you have no real goals, other than survival and eventually finding your lost 
 relatives. Bringing up your information screens will give you an idea of the kinds of things you 
 can strive for as a pirate. Fame and money are pretty much givens, but you can also search for 
 your lost relatives, hunt for buried treasure, gain rank with the four factions, woo governors 
 daughters and hunt down other pirates, amongst a range of other activities.
  
  The primary screen that you will deal with is the overview map. On this map you navigate your ship 
 through the waters of the Caribbean Sea. You will see cities, ships and other interesting locations. 
 Attacking ships just involves getting close to them. Once you decide to attack a ship the game 
 moves into a close-up view of the waters surrounding the ships, and you begin navigating your ship 
 into position to either fire at or board the other ship. Generally youll want to soften up the 
 enemy ship with your guns. Being able to out-maneuver your opponent is a tremendous advantage. 
 So believe it or not, you are probably better off using a small fast ship, and just keeping treasure 
 ships in tow to carry your goods. You can have up to eight ships in your fleet, but generally only 
 the one you are on will enter combat. If you outfit your small ship with some powerful guns and 
 speed modifications, you can often run circles around your opponent as you gradually wear them 
 down.
  
  There are several types of ammunition that you can use. Normal cannon balls will sink a ship in 
 a heartbeat; often you really dont want to do that so instead you use the chain shot or grape 
 shot. Chain shot will destroy a ships masts and make it a sitting duck. Grape shot does less damage 
 to the ship, but is devastating to the crew. You will see the enemy crew shrink very rapidly under 
 a constant barrage of grapeshot. Your decision of ammo should be based on what you want to get 
 out of the plunder at the end.
  
  If theres a named pirate on board, or you havent worn down an unnamed pirates crew/ship enough 
 before boarding, you will have to fight a duel before capturing the ship and its plunder. Swashbuckling 
 is a fairly simple combat system, generally involving the dodging of your opponents blows and 
 following up with your own strikes. Hit your opponent enough times and your opponent either gives 
 up or jumps overboard. Winning allows you to choose what to do with their ship, crew, and goods. 
 Losing will put you to sea on a small vessel with a minimal crew and force you to pretty much start 
 your career over. Personally, I dont recommend loosing.
  
  After winning a few ship battles, you will want to head for a port city. A port city allows you 
 to gather information, hire new crew members, fix and upgrade ships, buy and sell goods, and talk 
 with the resident governor. The resident governor is your ticket to gaining rank with one of the 
 four main factions (English, Spanish, French, and Dutch) . Gaining rank gives you faction specific 
 advantages (i. e. cheaper goods in Spanish towns) . Gain a high enough rank and you can try to woo 
 his daughter. Wooing the daughter involves a rhythm style dancing game. The daughter will give 
 you directional hints as to where to go next (i. e she points left and you should move left) . If 
 you impress her with your dancing, she will give you a gift, and you can continue to woo her, all 
 the way up to marriage if you wish.
  
  Of course, you dont always have to enter a city with peaceful intentions either. Instead, you 
 can take your crew to shore a distance from the city and then assault it via a turn based combat 
 game. If your side out lasts theirs, you will seize and plunder the city. You may even be given 
 the opportunity of installing a new governor belonging to a different faction. (Very advantageous 
 if you are, say, allied with the English and are deep in Spanish territory where there are no friendly 
 ports) .
  
  Assaulting a city isnt the only reason you might take your crew to shore. You also have quests 
 to find buried treasures, lost cities, and of course finding your lost relatives. All of those 
 involve navigating on the land via various landmarks like Aztec pyramids, peculiar shaped rocks, 
 and dead trees. With many different mini-games and side quests, there is a lot of variety in the 
 types of things you can do. All of it is optional, with your fate as a pirate ultimately lying 
 in your hands.
  
  The graphics are definitely a step up from the classic version of this game. Firaxis has done a 
 wonderful job with the art. Dont expect state of the art graphics, but real nice cartoon style 
 images. Some of the sequences look almost like they could be a 3D rendering of the traditional 
 Disney style cartoon. The good looks coupled with the fitting sound track results in a very nice 
 presentation.
  
  While I have yet to have the game crash on me, other individuals have apparently experienced some 
 technical issues where the game occasionally crashes. Fortunately it auto saves constantly so even 
 if it does crash, you should be able to pick up right where you left off.
  
  The game is essentially like writing an autobiography as it happens. While there are several different 
 ways to go about it, many of the in game mechanics will become rather repetitious, such as the 
 sword play. There is only so many times you can enjoy watching a similar series of antics played 
 out on screen. Repetition leads to boredom, which leads to you not wanting to play this game over 
 and over. Expect to play this game a few times through, before putting it up on a shelf, only to 
 be brought out in the event you cant find something newer and more interesting to play.
  
  One more important thing to note is the difficulty level. On the default level, this game is ridiculously 
 easy and will accelerate the effect of the repetitious feeling. If you want to make this game last, 
 do yourself a favor and increase the difficulty level.
  
  Sid Meier's Pirates is a fun game to play. I enjoyed playing the original version, and it was so 
 nice to see a fresh revision of that classic. As a strategy game, this is first rate. The various 
 quests, ship to ship combats and city assaults make for a very enjoyable experience. Unfortunately 
 the action sequences, while entertaining at first, grow very repetitious over time. The dancing, 
 swashbuckling, and even dealing with the governors really drag on after youve played through them 
 a few too many times. Dont get me wrong, they can be challenging if you up the difficulty setting. 
 However, there is only so many times that you can see a felled captain trip, fall into some flames, 
 and then jump overboard to put out those flames. Overall I really liked the game, I just wish they 
 had put a little more variety in the action sequences.

Review:  Yarr Matey! Sid Meier's Pirates! over the starboard side! When I got my hands on Sid Meier's Pirates! 
 I said to myself "Woohoo! a Pirates game... by Sid Meier?" That's right, the master of gaming brings 
 you another game via computer, such as Civilization.
  
  
  
  Sid Meier's Pirates! Offers a plethora of gaming goodies, though some may not like it, personally 
 I loved it. Some strategic games are like Real Time Strategies. Others are like Splinter Cell. 
 This is neither, it's a full-force game that throws you into the seat of a Pirate set on a vengeful 
 quest after his parents are murdered at the hand of, you guessed it, another Pirate!
  
  
  
  That is, basically, the main plot, revenge. You must strategically kill off Pirates and work 
 your way to Top Dog, which may or may not be Blackbeard. Subplots include a standoff between French 
 and Spanish, or English, or any other combination of the three. You can get on the good side of 
 governors
  
  of some islands and then try to "woo" their daughters with a silly dancing minigame.
  
  
 
  
  The gameplay of Pirates! is solid, with a tricky movement system that makes you go where the wind 
 takes you is very unique and quite indulging if you feel like fighting the wind, which I don't 
 recommend. You can try to ransack any number of barges you cross to get booty, yes, I said booty. 
 Not that kind though, Pirates booty! After you load up on some good booty... you can go to local 
 merchants and sell it. Then buy things to upgrade your ship.
  
  
  
  When you attack ships you can fire cannons into the side and puncture holes in it, or try to bust 
 the sails with a chain shot cannon, grape shots are for taking down crew. If you are outnumbered 
 when attacking a ship you will want to do that unless you are good at the fighting minigame. The 
 fighting minigame consists of you fighting the ships captain in a duel. It's like rock, paper, 
 scissors really. One type of block defends a certain type of attack while another defends a different 
 type. If you hit him about 5 times successfully he will fall overboard or surrender and the ship 
 is yours to keep or you can sink it. Taking ships is helpful to having lots of men on board at 
 a time.
  
  
  
  You will need to occasionally stop off in towns to pick up supplies for your crew. While there 
 you can repair your ship, talk to the governor (as mentioned before) , or go to the tavern. At the 
 tavern you will find some men that may want to join you, a crazy pirate who will sell you things, 
 the barkeep, and a local maiden. She will tell you the latest rumors of nearby pirates and their 
 location. If the port you enter isn't a friendly one you will be on foot when you enter town. You 
 can do battle with townsfolk or just leave right away. This part of the game I found extremely 
 tidious because it is so hard to control on foot. The interface is mind numbing.
  
  
  
  The sounds are very authentic to films made about this era, cannon-fire sounds great and the chatter 
 in town, as well as the local music played in town, is also well done. This seems very real and 
 very true to the game's nature. The drunken pirates are good to hear in the local taverns. As far 
 as voice acting... what can I say, there is none. Maybe one or two lines here and there, but that's 
 about it.
  
  
  
  Graphics in this game aren't as good as Doom 3, but then again, what is. They are solid and do 
 what they are meant to do. Some people will think they're revolutionary, but those people have 
 low end computers. It can easily run on a GeForce 2. Do note that's on medium graphic detail.
 
  
  
  
  In the end I will say that having a completely different experience every time you play is also 
 a plus. The pirate list changes every time. Also the warring factions also change every time.
 
  
  
  
  Overall Sid Meier's Pirates! is another great game from Sid Meier. I recommend it to any fans of 
 his other work.
  
  
  
  Graphics - 8
  
  Sound - 9
  
  Gameplay - 10
  
  Replay Value  10
  
  
  
  Final Judgement - 9.0

Review:  Pirates is a masterpiece of game design. As a title, it is both streamlined and deep, and it strikes 
 the perfect note between lighthearted fun and historical observation. In a 10-minute span, the 
 player can sack a city, sink a ship, dance with a governors daughter, recruit new crewman, and 
 then set sail all over again -- and it is somehow refreshingly fun each time out. This is how games 
 should be made.
  
  If you dont know by now, Pirates is basically a collection of mini-games, wrapped together so 
 tightly that it never feels like a collection of mini-games, but like an actual adventure. These 
 mini-games include: ship-to-ship battles, land battles, dueling, treasure-hunting, dancing, sneaking -- and 
 then theres the sailing itself. All of these activities are fun, though a couple are unnecessarily 
 severe on the higher difficulties.
  
  These mini-games are wrapped up in a presentation package that is thick with imagination. The graphics 
 here are adventurous and innocent -- a tune that befits the entire game: these are not bloodthirsty, 
 raping-and-killing pirates, but the storybook kind, who desire only adventure and song. Each mini-game 
 is nicely rendered, and the animation is both inspired and effective, brimming with motion and 
 emotion. 
  
  My favorite graphical piece is the world map -- as you sail across it, every bit is colorful and 
 imaginative, from the billowing sails to the playful dolphins that jump in your flagships wake. 
 Words are emblazoned on the map itself, with Straits of Florida stitched beneath the Sunshine 
 State. The message is clear -- this is a living map, a tattered 17th century parchment brought to 
 21st century life with inspired gusto. 
  
  The sounds gel with the looks. The music is a collection of adventurous orchestra pieces, and theres 
 a theme for each mini-game. The dancing bits are especially well-engineered, as it actually feels 
 and sounds like a 17th century dance floor. The effects are prime, matching the action well.
  
  Pirates is, generally, an easy game -- the default difficulty, which youll have to play through 
 a bit before receiving the option of raising it, is absurdly so. Even on the hardest setting, Pirates 
 is never overwhelming, but strives to grant you whatevers your idea of fun. Its refreshing, the 
 lenient difficulty. After a couple of too-hard console games, such as Ninja Gaiden, and, more recently, 
 Devil May Cry 3, its nice to arrive at a game that doesnt mask poor difficulty implementation 
 with cue words like challenging.
  
  There are some difficulty imbalances, however -- particularly, on the hardest mode. Its the only 
 setting that grants me any sort of competition in sea battles or on the dance floor -- but its too 
 difficult in other areas. Dueling is a pain, especially as your character ages -- hell become dizzy 
 in the middle of fighting, for no discernible reason, and youll suffer blows for it. Worse is 
 sneaking. On the hardest mode, it seems hopeless: the guards are fast and numerous, and seem to 
 possess a sixth sense of where you are and what youre doing. Its frustrating, but thankfully 
 its a minor point, and most of the game maintains the fun.
  
  The wealth of things to do, with free reign to do them, is an excellent form of game design. Pirates 
 was doing it GTA-style before GTA was, and the trend is continued here. Amass fortune, get married, 
 search for Incan and Aztec lost cities, fight the infamous pirates of old, steal the treasure of 
 said pirates, engage in privateering for and against each nation of the world, board treasure ships, 
 harass food convoys, cripple shipping, conquer cities for your favorite nation, and collect the 
 dozens of special items the game has to offer. Its awesome, the amount of choices present, and 
 at the end of it all -- after your pirate has aged to the point that he must retire -- youre presented 
 with a game ending screen reminiscent of Sid Meiers old Civilization one, and it presents you 
 with your total amassed funds, and informs you of your retiring profession after all is said and 
 done. 
  
  A nice inclusion to the game is the politics involved. The four big nations -- England, France, Spain, 
 and the Netherlands -- make war and peace alternately, and who you choose to attack affects your 
 standing with the other nations. The different nations will war and capture one anothers cities, 
 the pirates and Indians will raid and pillage at whim; all of it happens on- and off-screen, and 
 its up to you who to support. A small parchment at the bottom of the screen will inform you of 
 major events: maybe a French grain shipment was sunk, or perhaps Indians pillaged the Spanish city 
 of Havana. The Caribbean truly becomes your sandbox, and you can do as you wish.
  
  To close: I love Pirates. The game knows its strengths, plays them well, and draws you into its 
 world of streamlined fun. Its one of my favorite titles of 2004. Theres a profound lesson here: 
 despite the many advancements gaming has made, a remake of a game over decade old has drawn me 
 in better than almost any other game out there.

Review:  At the risk of being contrary, Sid Meier's Pirates! doesn't deserve the glowing reviews it has 
 received. I might consider this a great game if I was a 10-year-old child, but I'm an adult. Cutesy 
 repetition doesn't strike me as fun and rewarding gameplay. After playing Pirates! for three hours, 
 I was thoroughly bored because I had done everything there is to do, ad nauseam.
  
  Here's the gameplay: Sail around, shoot at another ship, sword fight the enemy captain, land in 
 port, buy or sell stuff, "talk" to people (that is, read the same sparse paragraphs over and over) , 
 sneak through town like the slowest game of Pac Man in history, land and scoot your tiny pixel 
 people to a treasure site, "dance" (stare at the onscreen number pad and pound the corresponding 
 key like a maniac) . Then, perform these simplistic tasks again and again...
  
  By the end of my first play session, Pirates! felt like a chore rather than adventure. Some may 
 find its design and production values delightful, but to me, the game is too cute for its own good. 
 Again, this would make an excellent diversion for children, but grown-ups are better off choosing 
 something that offers more content.

Review:  The original Pirates! was a fantastic game. The new version, while simplified in many respects 
 (I don't remember finding treasure being this easy!) is easily better than the original.
  
  The graphics are quite good but on my modest system (2 GHz Pentium 4 with only 256MB RAM and a 
 fairly slow Nvidia Geforce card) they are choppy. Sound is top notch and game play is stellar. 
 Difficulty can sometimes ramp up quite unnaturally though. When you divide the plunder and increase 
 the difficulty level you often find yourself unable to win battles or keep your crew happy. On 
 more than one occasion I've had to lower it again to a more modest setting.
  
  I find the strategy portion (land battles) the funnest aspect of the game and treasure hunting 
 my least favorite. Sea battles are always a blast and visiting towns to buy items or win the hearts 
 of governer's daughters is never dull.
  
  While the game isn't perfect and I wish it ran more smoothly on my system I still can't recommend 
 the game highly enough.

Review:  A while ago I was in our local game shop in Motala. I was looking for a game, something cheap, 
 preferably. When I was looking in the second hand-shelves, I saw it; Sid Meiers Pirates. twnty 
 minutes and 300 crowns (about $340) later i was playing it at home on my computer, and since that 
 day, I havent stoped playing.
  I love the game and the idea of being a pirate in Carrribean, free to do whatever he wants to, 
 and thats whats making me play it. Despite mediocre graphics, repeating music and nearly one 
 and a half months playing, I cant stop. And its theese things that make a good game, the "just 
 one moore quest"-feeling that cant make you stop. Im sorry, but I cant write moore now (if anybody 
 is reading this) , I have to go back to the game, to my pirate-life

Review:  Sid Meiers Pirates is not a rip-off as long as you understand what it was always intended to be; 
 a remake of a classic game and nothing more. However, it is one damn fine remake. Yes, the game 
 is remake (although it improves vastly one it's predcessors) as it has always been labeled as.
 
  
  The game begins with an intro detailing how your family was abducted by an evil marquis for failing 
 to deliver an owed debt (foul play is most likely involved) . Your character escapes and ends up 
 an orphan. As an adult, you sign up with a particular side, of your choosing, and become a crewmember 
 on a ship. When the captain proves to be tyrant, the crew rebels and you end up as the new captain 
 of the ship. You head out to the Caribbean to gain wealth and to rescue your family.
  
  Your character, unless you download other skins off the Internet, is always the same no matter 
 what you choose. This may be a disappointment to some, but as the game progresses and the character 
 ages and obtains new ranks, he begins to look different; this, IMO, makes up for the inability 
 to customize the character, but seriously, are you really buying this game to try different character 
 designs (I surely hope not!) ?
  
  The game is mostly controlled by the numpad and that helps to make the controls very simple to 
 master. Its ingenious how simple this game is to play; youll be sailing the Caribbean in no time.
 
  
  The games graphics are rather good, particularly the water effects and character animations. You 
 will see things like tiny crewmembers on the decks of ships that go flying into the water (they 
 can actually be picked up and added to the crew) by explosions and what not, see ships catch fire 
 and the sails become ragged during prolonged sea battles. The graphics are, overall, vibrant and 
 colorful, and add to the games lighthearted demeanor.
  
  The sound is also another excellent aspect of the game as you hear howl of the wind and the singing 
 of your crew (when you acquire a violin) as you go sailing around the Caribbean. As you approach 
 certain towns, the game plays different music to display the nationality of its owners. During 
 combat you will frequently hear the firing of cannon, the swooshing of chain shot as it sails through 
 the air, the cheering of the crew when your shots successfully hit enemy ships, and the smashing 
 of wood and wailing of your crew when enemy ships hit their marks. The game is filled with many 
 unique sounds that will constantly grab your attention, and amaze you with their detail.
  
  The gameplay is nothing short of fun, as you will always find something to do; whether its plundering 
 enemy ships, looking for family members, seeking buried treasure, dancing with the governors daughter, 
 sneaking into a town, sword fighting, or sacking an enemy town. Everything is generally well balanced, 
 and there are five difficulty settings to even things out for those who find things too easy or 
 too difficult. Dancing can be particularly difficult (especially without dancing shoes) , but rightfully 
 so, since it provides you with so many special items. Ship combat is actually quite tactical as 
 you try to maneuver you shots and ship through the wind (shots actually move faster or slower depending 
 on the wind resistance) manipulation of the wind can lead to either victory or defeat. Sword fights 
 are particularly fun, but you may end up learning the movements of your opponents rather quickly; 
 on the higher difficulty settings this can be rather difficult thanks to the increased speed. Taking 
 towns is also quite a tactical experience as you maneuver to take advantage of high ground, flanking 
 attacks, and cover from woods. Perhaps the games only fault in the gameplay department is that 
 it may become too redundant for few; youll continually find yourself fighting the same characters 
 and doing the same actions over and over again, and this may be seriously affect the games longevity 
 in the eyes of a few gamers, but that does discredit the fact that this game is ridiculously fun 
 and enjoyable. Besides if you get bored, you can always return at another point and attempt something 
 different. Also, the game is different every time you play it.
  
  This game is exceptional experience, whether youve played the original or not, and shows that 
 Sid Meier and Firaxis know what their doing. I wholeheartedly recommend it to all gamers.

Review:  
  Sid Meiers Pirates is a very different game than your typical strategy or adventure pastimes. 
 Pirates is set during the colonization of the Gulf of Mexico. This is a time when many sailors, 
 pirates, traders and statesmen got very wealthy off the spices, grains and other natural resources 
 reaped from the soil of the new continent. You are a young pirate who has set out to rescue and 
 avenge your familys capture. A statesman has wronged your family and it is up to you to become 
 just as evil as the statesmen by looting towns, buying and selling goods and destroying any ships 
 that give you and your crew suspicious looks. 
  
  The way you avenge your family is by traveling to various cities taverns and asking people there 
 if they have heard anything that may interest you. If a traveler has heard of anything, they will 
 direct you to a location or the last whereabouts of a person you are searching for. When you locate 
 these individuals a battle sequence occurs. The battle system is quite simple, you have options 
 to defend, give a low, medium or high attack and you can also taunt your opponent and infuriate 
 them even further. Treasure maps are also given to you. They show the locations of well, treasure! 
 Here you can dig up various riches that other pirates have buried. Money can be used to sell and 
 purchase goods, or cannons for your ship. Ship battles also occur. You can purchase advanced weapons 
 for your ship to make it the king/queen of the seas. Ship upgrades are mandatory for you to stand 
 a chance against your nemesiss later in the game who constantly have stronger ships then you do. 
 Baron Raymondo, a trader who seems to always have information on the whereabouts of your family 
 is one of these stronger foes that you will encounter. 
  
  Sub-quests are also part of the game. Treasure hunts, looting rampages and defeating the top 10 
 pirates of the seas are optional tasks which you may complete to advance your fleet and give it 
 that extra firepower and intimidation. Each city or port is owned by the Spanish, English, Dutch, 
 Jesuit or Pirate settlements. Each of these settlements offers you different rewards for doing 
 as they please. But you must be careful not to destroy a Spanish ship and then enter a Spanish 
 port, after all, news does travel and the governor will hear of your disrespect. If you constantly 
 run errands for these various cultural groups they will promote you to higher ranks in their service. 
 When attaining a promotion in rank you will be told some interesting business that you may wish 
 to undertake. Grand balls are also held where you must dance with the governors daughter. Your 
 performance on the dance floor may earn you the heart of the governors daughter and this might 
 lead to your promotion, attainment of land or your attainment of various items and goodies which 
 may help your quest.
  
  I wish to mention some negative aspects of the game. There is a small variety of quests you may 
 do. Sure there are small sub-quests that various ports will offer you but the quests are exactly 
 the same for every single port. You will either have to aid a statesman travel to a nearby location 
 to become the new governor there or you will have to lead a merchant ship to a successful passage 
 to a nearby port. You will constantly be traveling from port to port gathering the same information 
 all the time. You will speak with people, they will tell you where they saw some guy and you will 
 have to go after him. When you are done this they will give you parts of a map that show each of 
 your family members hostage locations. Even the battle systems become repetitive; you either stab, 
 back up or block the incoming attacks. The game offers many diverse quests and pathways but they 
 are exactly the same. This does take away from the game experience and may leave you very bored 
 after you realize the repetition. If you get captured or defeated by a pirate they send you to 
 jail where you can try to sneak out or stay for a mild amount of time. This is very annoying because 
 you will lose your ship and all its goods and basically have to start all over again. Luckily you 
 can save whenever you wish so you can just load if this happens to you. Finding a treasure seems 
 fun for the first 4-5 tries but after the 20th time your saying to yourself Are you kidding? More 
 treasure? Please no stop! The game simply becomes a chore and a repetitive boring nightmare. 
 
  
  The gameplay is the best part of Sid Meiers Pirates. The ship is very easy to control and the 
 menus are scrolled through very simply. The game offers a large amount of stats and lists of accomplishments, 
 rewards and items that you have collected during your quest. The battle system requires a push 
 of 4 buttons to attain victory. The ship is also easy to control during battles where you try to 
 aim your cannons at enemy ships. The keyboard is very responsive to this game. The game offers 
 a large map of the South-Atlantic and this is a good thing because you probably would be lost and 
 put the game down much quicker. 
  
  The graphics are well done and can be clearly identified in the glistering waters of the Mexican 
 gulf. You can actually see dolphins swimming in the water and birds flying over the beaches and 
 bays. The characters detail is also well done, especially the main character. You will actually 
 see him attain wrinkles and have changes in hair color the longer you play the game. What is ironic 
 is that you will age but your family members to be freed look exactly the same as they did 15 years 
 ago, before you set out on your adventure. The graphics are a nice addition and help this game 
 get a great rating.
  
  You can hear birds quacking, water rushing and trees brushing in the wind. The game has a nice 
 diversity of sounds and effects. Music is played when you enter various houses and ports. The game 
 does not offer any extraordinary sound innovations but it delivers a solid audible experience.
 
  
  Overall the game delivers an adequate enjoyment of pirate prestige and exploration. The game does 
 lack an online function. It would be cool to trade with various real merchants or sea-hurling junkies 
 on the high seas. Fighting with others in the sword fights and ship sequences could also be quite 
 entertaining. Although the game can get very repetitive and honestly quite boring at times, its 
 small spice of addiction should lure you back and force you to ultimately finish it (if you are 
 a determined gamer) . If you are not a patient gamer and want immediate satisfaction than this game 
 is not for you. The game must be played patiently and should not be rushed. You should also save 
 a lot to avoid ridiculous and unexpected losses in ship-fights or one-on-one duels. All in all, 
 Sid Meiers Pirates delivers a nice innovation in the strategy/adventure field of gaming and will 
 definitely be remembered as a totally different PC strategy experience.

Review:  *** WARNING: YOU COULD GET HOOKED................... FOR LIFE***
  
  That right there pretty much sums up the whole experience. The game as a whole is everything that 
 the classic had, packaged with some good looks, extras and an updated expreriece for the people 
 who missed out on the classic Pirates!. And are to spoiled now to go back. 
  
  Well if you have been waiting for this..... it was worth every second. The game is solid. Thats 
 it, theres no more to write, this is my shortest review so far. The game has great sound, graphics, 
 the value may drop over time but you will come back for more now and then once you go through it 
 once.
  
  My score for score and value are lower for two reasons only:
  
  Sound - Could have had some really impressive pirate tunes to make the game more immersing.
  
 
  Value- Once you go through once, you may move onto other things before you go through again. At 
 least thats what i found, was you do it the first time, there just wasnt a push for me to do it 
 again. But once again i will say... most games are like that, so thats not bad.
  
  Overall, if you pc can handle it, and you can handle it then man-handle it. Argh!

Review:  I cannot be bothered writing a review for every game I play, but I usually try to appraise the 
 ones that have actually something good and unique to offer to all of us. Sid Meier's Pirates! game 
 falls under this rule I guess. 
  
  Whether you played the original game or not, I urge you to give a try this magnificent game. It 
 is simply so enjoyable, that you find yourself attached to your desk chair for hours and having 
 forgotten that you haven't eaten for a while now. But let me explain you why it worths your money 
 and time.
  
  Firstly, the game follows very closely the same rules and nature of the original, and if you played 
 the previous one, then you should know it seems a successful recipe already. So, it kinda a mixture 
 of arcade and strategy game which makes it a sophisticated but also fun to play game too. 
  
  You are a pirate trying to rescue your lost relatives and sail around the Caribbean sea fighting 
 against other pirates, attacking or making alliances with nations, destroying towns, flirting with 
 mayors's daughters, sword-fighting and treasure hunting, etc... It is so cool sailing around with 
 your crew, I feel I am like 'Captain Sparrow' in my 'Black Pearl' ship. 
  
  The sound is pretty good, you can hear various sounds like pirate talking, songs, etc..
  
  
 The graphics are very good but as good as I would expect nowadays, unless they wanted to keep it 
 simple and with a nice arcade style like the original, rather than a heavy 3-D environment. 
  
  Tha game play is amazing and fun with so many levels and characteristics to take care of, which 
 I always love to have in a game. Be careful, the last level of difficulty, is pretty hard I must 
 say, whereas the previous ones seemed to me very easy. 
  
  There are so many things to do in the game and you can always play the game many times since every 
 time you can have different treasures to find (or locations at least) and try different alliances 
 or approaches. 
  
  The only thing that let me down a bit is the feeling that they could do just a bit better on the 
 animations and scripting to avoid some repetitiveness. You tend to kill the same people (names 
 and drawings) , whereas they could easily avoid it by adding some extra figures and animations (clips) . 
 I could also live with a few more extra features from the original, say for example more things 
 to do in a town, multiple ship control in a sea battle and provide your character some more control 
 over politics somehow. 
  
  To sum up, I totally wish that you play this game. It is fun to play and different from the usual 
 land based action/strategy games. Arrrhhh... the winds have spoken, says I.

Review:  The original Pirates! is among the best computer games of all time - open ended gameplay gave the 
 game great longevity; it had an almost impossible number of things to keep you busy; it challenged 
 the player to come back over and over again to complete its seemingly endless number of quests.
 
  
  Sid Meier's reinterpretation of the original classic leaves out nothing. All of the familiar details 
 are there - the tavern with its mysterious men bearing news, and sailors waiting to sign up. The 
 beautiful governor's daughters. The exciting fights on sea and land, and swordfights with cunning 
 captains and devilish pirates.
  
  All of this is recreated in a way that echos the past, but significantly improves the quality of 
 presentation. Pirates! features beautiful graphics and magnificent sound that contribute magnificently 
 to the gameplay. One cannot help but be drawn into the game by the consistently excellent visuals 
 and sounds.
  
  But looks aside, what really counts is gameplay. And this game delivers. There is a stunning variety 
 of play that will interest a wide range of gamers - real time sea battles, turn based land battles, 
 strategic fighting and dancing, trading and commerce. In a game bringing together so many different 
 types of mini-games, it would be easy for the game to lose its focus. But Pirates! pulls all of 
 these together seamlessly - largely because the games fit in so well with your larger quest goals, 
 which largely require you to find maps in order to rescue family members, find lost cities, and 
 finally, to defeat an evil pirate.
  
  For beginners, the easiest levels of the game allow a bit of aimless wandering. But beware - the 
 higher difficulty levels are extremely challenging. Those levels, however, offer greater rewards 
 for victory at sea and on land. There is nothing better than winning a difficult land battle or 
 dancing nearly flawlessly on the higher levels - it is quite a challenge!
  
  Few games offer the replay value of Pirates. Even on the lower levels, it is a challenge to complete 
 all the quests. You'll find yourself coming back for more, if you can ever tear yourself away from 
 it at all.
  
  Adventure, Action, Strategy - all the elements of a great game. One of the best of 2004 and highly, 
 highly recommended.

Review:  Pirates! is probably the best remake of a past game ever made to date...
  Sid Meyer's shows us his genious mind and creates a simple but really fun to play game.
  
  
 The Pirates life is very well achieved in the game and you totally get immersed;
  the sounds are awsome and all the mini-games in the Game, are well designed and really made up 
 for the experience. At first the game gets highly addicted and you will want to play over and over: 
 destroyng other ships, upgraading your's, trading goods, dating the daughter's of every city's 
 Governor.... It really gets you excited doing all the stuff but after some time, the ''flaw'' in 
 the game appears: The Repetitive Gameplay! Since you're pirate get's old and in the end dies, each 
 time you begin a new campaign you'll just go over the same things again, so the feeling -been here 
 done that - really shows up....
  
  Anyways the game can still deliver lots of fun and have you're eyes stuck in the monitor for at 
 least 10-20 hours!! 
  
  Pros:
  . First hours are highly addicting
  . Awsome Remake
  . Definitely worth Playing
  
  Cons:
  
  . Repetitive Gameplay Experience

Review:  I spent most time in 2004 playing the various FPS's out there, Unreal 2004, Far Cry, Doom 3 etc, 
 and so this was a game I picked up just to remind myself there are other generes out there, more 
 than anything else. In all, I am glad I did pick it up, as it's easy to pick up and play, and offers 
 plenty of things to keep you busy, all of which are good fun, if not particularly challanging. 
 
  
  There is a considrable amount of variety to be found here, from hunting down the #1 pirate to plunder 
 his riches, to finding the clues that will lead you to your missing family. These are all good 
 fun, but finding the next pirate will be very much the same as finding the first, and likewise 
 hunting for treasure etc. This doesn't necessary become tiresome, as you'll be doing other things 
 inbetween, but you do get the feeling you've been there and done it before.
  
  When all is said and done, Pirates! is a great game, and well worth playing.

Review:  Sid Meir is an amazing game make and did a great job with Pirates! The game is fun and intriguing 
 for hours. Though there are some flaws in the game.
  
  The game it self is an rpg/stradegy/adventure game. It combines sword fighting in a street fighter 
 fashion, with taking over city as an rts. The game is fun to play and is just cool. I was estatic 
 in becoming a pirate and taking ships and being a general pirate. I played the game for 4 hours 
 over 3 days and became bored.
  
  For those people who like fps (like me) but have a soft side for rpg's once and awhile this game 
 will be tough to stick with. I liked the game overall, but there wasn't enough diversity.
  It is the same gameplay the whole time. After dancing with the govenor's daughter for about the 
 20th time I got bored. The same goes with the ship hyjacking, and taking over cites. It is the 
 same thing, and my short attention span did last long.
  
  You can still enjoy the game though I suggest not playing it on easy. Because easy is toooooo easy. 
 Try it on normal, and as you get better it will ask you if you to go to a higher level. Levels 
 make it harder, but it is still the same thing.

Review:  Fourteen years after Sid Meier first released his rendition of a mix of RPG/Strategy/Action in 
 a game known as Sid Meiers Pirates, he releases a remake of the same name to bring everything 
 that was in the first game to the modern computer community with wonderful graphics, gameplay, 
 and a decent enough story. Sid Meier created a game where the player controls a lone pirate that 
 travels the Caribbean over his life span and over a lot of the players lifespan. This game brings 
 upon the meaning of the word addictive. Pirates! is a game that youll find yourself looking up 
 at the clock every five minutes noticing that hours have past in actuality.
  
  The story in Pirates! is simple and easy to follow. As a child, your family gets kidnapped by a 
 notorious pirate named Montalban and throughout your life as a swashbuckler, you must search and 
 find them across the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Youll find pieces of information here and 
 there in different ports and also while youre trying to court every governors daughter. Thats 
 right, you have the ability to enter each port and go to a few different places including a shipyard 
 where you can repair and update your ship with new defenses. From there, you can go to the local 
 trader where you can buy supplies and also make some money while you sell off your booty that youve 
 collected from other ships or from hidden treasures youve found in ancient ruins inland. If youre 
 in need of information about certain pirates, nice trinkets to make the governors daughter happy, 
 or even more crewmen, you can go to the tavern and converse with the locals. If youve done all 
 that, you have the ability to go to the governors mansion and, depending on how good youve been 
 with his own trading/salary ships, receive promotions from him and even get a dance or two with 
 his daughter to receive special items or needed information about your family members or about 
 the whereabouts of your enemy Montalban. 
  
  This game is filled to almost exploding with different things you can do in-game, but youre not 
 immortal. You have the lifespan of your lone pirate, being till hes reached around the age of 
 55 or so where your actions become slower and everything seems to become too hard to achieve and 
 youre forced into retirement. You have the ability to receive trinkets to prolong your life, but 
 there are also things that take time away, such as being caught in an enemy town and being forced 
 in prison where youll have to wait months to escape. Or when you crew is becoming unhappy with 
 you and would like a share of the loot youve collected, you must stop at a port and divide the 
 plunder, which will take about six months and leave you with only a few men to start your next 
 great adventure with. So, during the game, you have to watch which quests you want to do now and 
 which quests can wait. Some quests take precedence like finding your family and hunting your enemy 
 Montalban. And each time you go through Sid Meiers Pirates, youll find that its different because 
 the quests are randomly generated to provide a great experience each time through. One nice feature 
 of Pirates! is the ability to change the difficultly each time you divide the plunder between your 
 crewmates and yourself. Feeling that its too easy, you may up the challenge now and again, thus 
 giving you more of your booty each time you divide the plunder. Feeling overwhelmed, you have the 
 ability to lower the difficulty, thus giving the player the chance to become the best pirate they 
 can. Add the fact that youre allowed to play in different eras throughout the time of the pirates 
 ranging from the 1600s to the 1700s and you can easily see how Sid Meiers Pirates! has the most 
 replay value, for a single player game, anyones seen for quite some time. There are so many upgrades 
 to find and to buy and so many different ships to sail, that you couldnt possibly collect them 
 all in one game.
  
  Since the first Sid Meiers Pirates, the graphics have definitely been improved and updated to 
 make the Caribbean look absolutely beautiful the whole time you let your sails out traveling from 
 port to port. Whether youre sailing form Trinidad to Vera Cruz, or protecting a ship on its way 
 to install a new governor in one of your ports, youll see the beautiful sanding beaches and straits 
 between different islands and peninsulas. With randomly generated inland maps, ruins and abandoned 
 cabins will be in different points each time you play creating more replay value and making it 
 harder for the player to complete the quests given to him. Each time you attack another ship, and 
 head in for some close combat, the enemy either surrenders or the captain challenges you to a dual 
 deciding the fate of both ships. Youre able to control your pirate, using the number keypad and 
 this can be quite fun toying around with the pirate captain. When youre on the lower difficulty 
 settings, its easier to decide whether to duck an incoming overhead swipe or jump or a lower slash 
 thats aimed at your legs. While you grow older, missing one of your blocks or pushing the wrong 
 button completely can really wear down your pirate, so you must pay much more attention. The same 
 goes for dancing with the governors daughter. On easier settings, the moves that shes about to 
 make are given to you so that its easier to dance, but while on higher difficulty settings, you 
 have only her hand movement to follow. This can make you quite unhappy when youre trying to find 
 a new piece of map that will help you find a lost relative and youre not able to keep up with 
 the governors daughter and she just blows you off at the end of the dance. So, when you up the 
 difficulty, its for everything including sailing, fencing, and dancing making the overall game 
 harder for you. Another small game with Pirates! is when youre at odds with a nationality, you 
 can always sneak into their town looking for the information you seek. This is also controlled 
 by the player where he must either find his destination or be caught and thrown in jail for his 
 troubles. These little games within the overall game help Sid Meiers Pirates! become an even better 
 game for all ages.
  
  The sound was done quite well in the game. While sailing across the endless waves of the Caribbean, 
 when zoomed in youll hear the subtle spray of water role across the hull of your ship and when 
 zoomed out, youll hear more of the music. The thing with the music in Sid Meiers Pirates! is 
 that its done so well, you never truly hear it. What I mean by this is that when its in the 
 background, its done so well that it just seems natural. It just proves that Sid Meier knows how 
 to give the player the full experience of being a swashbuckler of the pre-America days. Whether 
 youre sneaking around an enemy town or dancing with the governors daughter, the music will be 
 constant and seems to be fluid throughout each scene within the game. There isnt any voice-over 
 work done for any of the characters, but this is something that isnt really noticed because of 
 how well the background music is done and how fast the conversations go. Many people tend to read 
 through the dialogue faster than its spoken and just skip the voice-over most times anyway. 
 
  
  In the end, you could look at Sid Meiers Pirates! and call it an instant classic giving the player 
 hours upon hours of replay value and diversity in each game to want to keep them coming back for 
 more. Simply put, the graphics, the sound, and the gameplay make purchasing this game an easy decision 
 for anyone slightly interested in this title. After fourteen years, Sid Meiers return to the Caribbean 
 has been a worthwhile one for any player.

Review:  For everyone who can remember playing the original Pirates many years ago you will enjoy the new 
 version, but only for a while. The gameplay has not changed much, with updated graphics being the 
 major selling point. You will still be sailing the high seas, capturing new ships, trading goods, 
 recruiting more shipmates, and winning the hearts of governers daughters. You will also be looking 
 for buried treasure, dethroning well known pirates, capturing towns and looking for long lost family 
 members. While there may be many different things to do during a game, nothing changes. Pirates 
 gets extremely boring and repetitive after you go through one game and retire. The game does not 
 offer any challenges. It is next to impossible to lose ship combat or a sword fight, and completing 
 all of the side quests is simply a matter of investing the time. Overall I enjoyed the game simply 
 due to my previous experience, but I can guarantee you will not be playing Pirates for more than 
 a few days.

Review:  I am very pleased with the game, a fun story line and other fun features. I was caught playing 
 for several hours, and the its great to see another Port Royale type game! The sound was not of 
 the best quality but pertaining to each situation it was adjusted. The missions can be challenging 
 but a seasoned player would have no trouble. Sea battle sequences are very fun, having different 
 cannonnball rounds being fired. One feature I particullary like is the fencing/ deuling, either 
 boarding ships or fighting a drunken guard. I am not fond of the abilirty to sneak into town, but 
 maybe its just that I am bad at it! A overall fun game!

Review:  I have never written a review before, but I feel compelled to do so in this case.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  
  Why anyone would give this game anything above a 5 is beyond me. It makes me question whether or 
 not the people who wrote those reviews that gave this game a score over an 8 are actually real 
 people and not just paid 'hype' generators. What GS was thinking.... I can only imagine. I wasted 
 $50 on this garbage and I'm gunna tell you exactly what I think about it.
  
  I have been playing games for well over 10 years, and I have bought some rather poor games at times. 
 But this one stands out as having the widest margin from what the review was ---and what the reality 
 was.
  
  Gameplay:
  I can sum it up really quick for you ----  Boring. If you enjoy hearing the same joke over and 
 over, and find it funny every single time, then by all means get this game. But if you are a normal 
 person (and are above the age of 10) you will find this to be just silly. I found it almost impossible 
 to lose a ship to ship fight, or to lose a sword fight. In fact, I never did lose.
  
  The enemy ships will invariable try to ram you, forcing a farcical sword fight that a 5 year old 
 might find challenging and 'neat'. I didn't. I found it to be the equivalent of watching Barney....... sober.
 
  
  BTW the wind never changes..... EVER.
  
  They say it's "open ended gameplay". Uhm, ok. So I guess if I stand in a white round room and have 
 a simple blue ball to bounce.... that would qualify as well? After all I can bounce in any direction 
 I please... unscripted. But that doesn't make it engaging or fun.
  
  Graphics:
  Unbelievably, this game can NOT be played in 1280 x 1024 resolution (you can tweak an ini file 
 to make it do it, but then the graphics are screwed up and there are big black lines on the screen, 
 rendering it unplayable) . What amazes me is that I haven't heard one peep about this, it isn't 
 mentioned in the review at all.
  
  The reason why 1280 X 1024 is so significant is because almost all LCD monitors have a native resolution 
 of 1280 X 1024, and with the popularity of LCD monitors these days it shows some extremely short 
 sighted decision making. Or worse, they just don't care. I think it's the latter.
  
  Besides that, the graphics were generally bland and uninspired. 
  
  Sound:
  Dull, uninspired 
 and repetitive. About as interesting as an add on TV for margarine or something equally pedestrian. 
 I have a feeling this game sounds just as good on a low end mono system as it does on my 5.1 surround 
 system.
  
  Value:
  Worthless. After 1 hour I stopped playing........ I had already seen pretty much everything there 
 was to see and had no desire to see any more.
  
  Tilt:
  I think you can guess.

Review:  I am very upset that I purchased this cruddy title and amazed that most of you gave this piece 
 of junk a review higher than 6. You are nuts, 12 years old or are lacking in any good judgment 
 of what a quality product should be. Lets just set the scale on 1-30 and the general reviews of 
 this product would be inline.
  
  I am not a big gamer and have never written a review but I had to in this case.
  I read the reviews 
 for this game and looking for something fresh and new, went out and purchased it for an outrageous 
 $49.99. Bad idea.
  
  The "general" reviews of this game are way too high or maybe everyone just enjoys playing the same 
 thing over and over again. Maybe I shouldnt be surprised because if trash reality TV shows can 
 make it big, why not Pirates! Thankfully there were a few on here that reviewed this train wreck 
 as poor as I did, so not all hope is lost.
  
  Another travesty of this industry, due to all the game copying, is the lack of ability to return 
 software and try something else or simply demand a return. Is there any other industry out there 
 that doesn't allow you to bring something back if youre not satisfied? I work in the construction 
 industry and can bring back cut beams if I am not fully satisfied with the quality.
  
  If youre looking to buy this cheap, check Ebay because that's where mine will be.
  
  Good 
 hunting and next time, think about the reviews before you give them anything higher than 7.

Review:  I am one of the cult Meier fans out there who has played the original Pirates! on at least four 
 different platforms, loved them all, and awaited this release with a nail biting anticipation that 
 nearly drove me nuts.
  
  This has been one of the biggest let down years for remakes; suffice to say that even though Sid 
 (Meier) was behind this new creation, it was a game like Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown, that 
 had me extremely nervous. I'm about as old school as you can get when it comes to games, I love 
 the older principle of more gameplay and less eye candy.
  
  The best way to put it, Firaxis came through for us Pirates! fans :) . They made a wise move during 
 initial production to keep Sid Meier a major developing force in the game, letting him decide whether 
 or not it fits his vision of what a Pirates! remake should be, and man did it pay off.
  
  First off, the graphics are fantastic. They are immersive and add to the fun of the game. You'll 
 chuckle as your 32 gun Ship of The Line heaves to the side as you loose your cannons on an unsuspecting 
 sloop, watch the cannonballs sail through the air and wreak utter carnage to the ship nearby. The 
 water is beautiful, the characters have the Meier comical touch. The effects are perfect for this 
 kind of game. You really couldn't ask for more from Firaxis. 
  
  Sound is another part of this game that I love with all my heart. Nothing felt cooler than hearing 
 a roaring thunderstorm in surround sound as a deadly black storm cloud was going past my ship. 
 Even cooler, as my men and I were making our way back to Port Royale after plundering a heavily 
 burdened Spanish treasure ship, my crew were singing "Blow the Man Down" in a made up "Simlish" 
 like Pirate language made up for the game. I could not stop laughing. The gibberish speaking adds 
 to the immersion, believe it or not, and lets the imagination do its own thing. Half the time you're 
 adding your own words in and it starts playing out like a movie in your head. Sound is perfect 
 as well.
  
  As any fan of the original Pirates! knows, the graphics don't have to be all that great to have 
 a fantastic game. However, Firaxis has shown the brilliance to bring back the fun and addictive 
 gameplay of old. Though some may see the game as simplistic, it is so open-ended and non-linear 
 that you can literally carve out your own place in Pirate history, and be remembered however you 
 want. The ship battles, privateering for one nation, (or all of them if you're really clever :) ) , 
 everything just adds to one of the most addictive games made in the past 10 years. 
  
  I finally realized what it is about the gameplay that makes Pirates! Live the Life such a wonderful 
 addition to any gamer's shelf for years to come... the High Score! Before you call me insane, hear 
 this out. One of the big objectives of this game is to simply amass as much treasure as you possibly 
 can before you retire. There's a sense of urgency, and you also have something to prove your worth 
 when you complete the game in the form of how much personal wealth you amassed in your adventures. 
 This (like it did for the original Pirates!) will keep you coming back for years to come, wondering 
 if its time to strap on your hook, tie down your peg-leg, and gather a crew for one more wild adventure 
 on the high seas. 
  
  I would recommend this to anyone who has not played the series, and definitely would urge any old-school 
 fans not to miss out (though I highly doubt anyone who was a fan didn't have this game on release 
 day) . There's just something in this game that has been missing from the garbage that many companies 
 call "groundbreaking" games ever since video cards and graphics laden particle effects became the 
 primary concern before gameplay. If you long for that feeling you used to get back in the early 
 90s (what I call the golden age of gaming) where you simply could NOT tear yourself away from a 
 game, where you are ready to give it another go to see what your personal best really is. 
  
  Anyone who wants something new, who have been let down by so many games released anymore, can 
 find solace in the fact that there are games out there that will show you again just why it was 
 you started playing games like a fiend in the first place :)
  
  That's my take, take it or leave it! YAR!

Review:  The gamespot reviews were no doubt written by some very nostalgic people as the game does not deserve 
 a 9+ rating. I played the game and even worse, wasted money buying it.
  
  This game is a remake of the original, so faithful, that is boring. Good remakes are inspired by 
 the original and add new functionality (aka prince of persia: SOT) , this game is a re-hash. Like 
 the original, the game is basically a set of mini-games stringed together. 
  
  All the game play elements are recycled... all the islands, pirate fights, bars, dance sequences 
 are almost indistinguishable. Its the same thing... over... and over and over and over....... and 
 over... and over... .and over.... and over.... and over
  
  
  I am not kidding you, it is that repetitive. [On the plus, will make a great game for those suffering 
 from obessive compulsive disorder]
  
  Don't waste your time and or money on it. There are better games.

Review:  Just when you thought it was safe to get a life after playing Civilization 3, here comes Pirates! 
 In true Sid Meier fashion, Pirates! will most likely take over after you play it and see all it 
 has to offer. It's not just a regular strategy game. It's action, adventure, and role-playing blended 
 perfectly into a Sid Meier style strategy. You are a deck-hand turned captain in the Caribbean 
 Spanish Main. Your family has been pressed into service and kidnapped so locating them is the main 
 goal of the game. At this point in time, the Spanish, the English, the Dutch, and the French are 
 all struggling for control. You must gather a crew and plunder your way to the top. You can raid 
 towns, capture ships, romance and marry governor's daughters, swordfight pirates, and dig up buried 
 treasure. This game has a lot to offer as far as replay value goes.
  
  The graphics are very well done. They are bright and vibrant, giving you a real tropical paradise 
 feel. The cartoon look really adds to the light-hearted, fun feel. Water is one of the most difficult 
 things to render when it comes to graphics, and it looks great in Pirates! The sound and music 
 are also amazing and really get you into the game. The look and sound of the game almost makes 
 you think you are in a pirate movie.
  
  The controls of the game are surprising easy to learn and use. You will be using the number pad 
 for pretty much everything. Ship-to-ship combat involves turning the ship, firing guns, and changing 
 sail height. The ship combat is all in real time. Raiding towns is a bit different. You control 
 a group of invaders, pirates and buccaneers, and must face off against the guards. Pirates are 
 the melee unit and buccaneers are the ranged unit. It plays out in turn based unit by unit movement. 
 Sword fighting involves reading what your opponent is going to do and countering with the appropriate 
 move. Dancing is done pretty much the same way as sword fighting. The controls can be picked up 
 easily and mastered within a few hours.
  
  As I mentioned before, the story involves you finding out where your family has been hidden. You 
 have to get leads on villains and track them down to get pieces of maps revealing each family members 
 location. You can also get promotions from each of the countries, allowing cheaper ship upgrades. 
 Throughout the game you will be on "The 10 most wanted pirates" list and the things you do will 
 determine your position, including fighting other pirates on the list. Countries will also, no 
 doubt, be putting bounties on your head for things you do. Keeping your crew happy is going to 
 be the hardest thing to do. You must keep capturing gold and goods to keep them happy. Once you 
 have built up a huge sum, you will have to divide amongst the crew and get a new crew. Dividing 
 the plunder will seem like a rip-off at first, but that's how it really was done during the age 
 of sail. It also keeps the game challenging.
  
  Pretty much any PC gamer will enjoy Pirates!. It has a huge amount of things to do and it's not 
 the same thing over and over again. Defiantly a must own for strategy and role-playing fans.

Review:  I remember playing Pirates on my Tandy 286 SX with 4mb of memory. Ah, those were the days. The 
 game was an instant classic back then and kept me glued to that pc for hours on end. Pirates is 
 back with a brand new look and it is the same addictive game it was back then with a modern day 
 face lift. This is the type of game that anyone can easily get into in a short amount of time. 
 I enjoy the new updates to the original such as depth of strategy by adding upgrades to your ship 
 that allow you to turn faster, fire more accurately or sail faster. I also love how the real time 
 world of the carribean comes to life now and is constantly changing around you. The upgraded audio 
 and visuals brought a big smile to my face and instead of just hearing the boats cut through water 
 on my 286 pc speaker, I can now enjoy sailors singing pirate songs and the sound of distant thunder 
 storms as they move in closer in full stereo. Instead of seeing puffs of smoke and 8 color explosions 
 on my CGA monitor I can now see full color explosions, masts being ripped off, sailors being flung 
 overboard into the ocean and then floating there during the course of the battle. If you're looking 
 for a game that is accessible when you need a quick fix but don't have time to waste on your deeper 
 games then you can't go wrong with Pirates. Of course, the only problem is this simple (but definately 
 not shallow) game could grab you and never let go.

Review:  After playing for a couple of hours just to see how much "depth" this game has, I was completely 
 let down. The gameplay can be broken down in an extremely simple manner. You start off with a crappy 
 ship, raid other ships to amass resources, visit towns and earn ranks with the four factions: spanish, 
 english, french and dutch. The gameplay starts to become a chore after you've got a decent ship 
 and crew complement, your only worry is how long will it take to get to the next town to collect 
 a piece of map, and you'll be doing alot of that, aimlessly travelling town to town just to talk 
 to the same NPC in a tavern to collect map pieces or to get info about the top 9 pirates. Even on 
 the hardest difficulty the game remains simple, thanks to braindead AI on enemy ships you can make 
 a fortune in the first 30 minutes.
  
  Another thing that really bothered me were the ballroom dance missions, seriously what were the 
 devs thinking? This is a dumbed down version of DDR (dance dance revolution) that you must do over 
 and over to gain "romance" points. Simply put, it plays like an RPG with a superficial "Role Playing" 
 part, since you have no control over the fate of your character, other than the obvious life/death 
 situations. There are however some positive aspects, such as invading towns to plunder them, which 
 is great because it actually incorporates the element of strategy, unfortunatley, this option will 
 disappear once you start gaining ranks with the said factions.

Review:  The traveling time between two far away places is quite OK. It could have gotten a little bit boring 
 when there aren't that many things to do while just traveling between two points besides steering 
 in one direction. It helps though to hear the crew singing and cheering.
  
  The battles feels a little bit to easy but the reason for that can be that I haven't played the 
 game so much yet (Although I am the 5: th notorious pirate on the hall of fame) . So far I'm only 
 a Journeyman.
  There are different types of shots. Standard round shots, grape shots and chain shots. It took 
 a while before I realized what separated the different types. But then I saw that the grape shots 
 drastically decrease the amount of men on the enemy boat and the chain shots rapidly destroyed 
 their sails and hull.
  I could have read about this in the great pirate-o-pedia. The dictionary comes is very handy. You 
 can read about the different ships, famous pirates, the ship upgrades, different unique items etc. 
 In fact I haven't found anything game related that doesn't exist in here.
  Sometimes the battles end up in with the enemy surrendering. Then it is free for you to plunder 
 the ship. Although if the ship isn't damage too bad and if it's big enough it most of the time 
 ends up with you having to grab your sword and head into a swordfight trying to defeat their captain 
 whether it's a pirate, baron or an officer. I suppose it also depends on how famous and frightening 
 you are as a pirate. If you confront pirates it always end up in a splendid time of svrdviftande.
 
  When you have command of the enemy ship you can choose of take the ship or sink the ship. My tactic 
 has been that if the ship is large enough I use it as a barge to the nearest harbor. On the way 
 I plunder as many ships as I possible can and sink them as well. The barge, Trade Galleon or whatever 
 you have conquered, should be able to carry all the goods. I sell the goods, the surplus of food 
 and cannons and then at last the ship. I try not to bump into any larger aggressive ships on the 
 way though. The men on your flagship are smaller when some of them have to sail the other ship.
 
  
  I am glad to see that incline for visiting the towns is conserved. Conserved and even improved.
 
  
  There is a lot do to in the towns. It's not too complicated. The amount of information, access 
 to good men, treasure maps, rumors and unique items you get depends on your wealth, good rumor, 
 how well you have been doing missions and your actions against the enemy.
  When it comes to available men in a town they always come in groups. You get them all or you don't 
 get them at all. I wish that you could choose some of the men but not all of them because now again, 
 if you get too many men the morale is going to drop. You simply have to get out there into a big 
 battle so the morale increase and the amount of your crew decrease.
  One new very nice special thing is when the governor's daughters invite you to become their cavalier 
 on the great ball in town. What can I say? The graphic, music and moves make this to a very beautiful 
 experience. I think the dancing part is the hardest part of the game so far. If the music is fast 
 you have to be lightning fast on the keys and I really think you should look on the girl hints 
 rather than the help in the bottom right. It's more of a game that way. It's a good thing the ball 
 part leads somewhere. You collect romance points as well as you get good information or some useful 
 item if you succeed to make the daughter satisfied and happy with your smooth dancing. If this 
 wouldn't be the case this part would be kind of useless, but even here the legendary Sid Meiers 
 has done the right thing.
  
  The graphic is splendid. They have hit the bulls-eye when it comes to the humor, which should be 
 in a pirate game. The music and sound is nice too, even if the Englishmen and women sound more 
 French to me sometimes. To here the pirates cheer is making me happy.
  Without a doubt Sid Meries Pirates is the best sequel of a game I have ever played. They have done 
 a perfect job conserving the atmosphere that was in the classic many years ago. Greatness for the 
 humanity. Congratulations!

Review:  This is a great remake of the original Parates! for the C64 as far as gameplay but more like the 
 coveted Amiga Version for graphics. Luckily Firaxis removed the often terribly difficult Sea to 
 Fort battles of the previous version oin favor of a much better land battle interface! 
  
  The sound, graphics and overall feel are spectacular, but make sure you have the most current drivers 
 for your computer to avoid dreaded crashes. 
  
  BTW THIS GAME IS NOT VERY PLAYABLE ON A LAPTOP AS IT USES A NUMBER PAD FOR A LOT OF THE GAMPLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
  
  This isn't my opinion , the manual warns you of the fact.

Review:  I was a bit Pirates fan when the game first came out, and I was a bit nervous to see what they 
 would do to the new version. After all, we have seen several Pirates wannabe games over the years 
 that was hugely disappointing as they tried to make some kind of 3D RPGish concept of it that just 
 did not work.
  
  I was happy to see the game is pretty much intact. It takes all the things that works with the 
 original, polishes it with new graphics and up to date everything, then let's you enjoy the same 
 spirit that made the original so compelling.
  
  The game is quite varied, and even though you will find it is also in part quite repetitive, you 
 are given full freedom to do what you want and once you tire with one part of the game, you can 
 simply switch to another.
  
  For example, you can focus on plundering ships, trading, go to war to gain new territory for your 
 homeland, find treasures, defeat famous pirates, romance, discover your family etc. 
  
  The game has a light mood, and some simple humor that makes a great contrast to other recent hit-games 
 out there that focuses a lot on violence and/or horror, like Doom 3, Painkiller, Doom 3, Half Life 
 2, San Andreas etc. What you have is a cartoonish and harmless game, wich is dangerously addictive.
 
  
  The graphics is nice too, with colorful and fresh graphics featuring all the latest effects, like 
 Pixel Shaders. Some physics has also been added to the game, and it looks very polished and attractive.
 
  
  My only criticism would be that some of the mini-games, like fencing, is oversimplified. It is 
 more for visualizing the action, than a real action fencing game. Also, the animation sequences 
 are a bit repetitive and it would be nice if they animated different outcomes from the various 
 battles, but no matter who you fight they will be defeated in one of quite few ways. Still, it 
 does not really matter, as the game is so varied.
  
  Absolutely a great game, I can recommend this to anyone!

Review:  I had been looking forward for this game for many months. As soon as I heard it announced, I was 
 excited about playing Pirates! brought up to date. I previously owned Pirates! Gold on the Amiga 
 CD32. I spent many hours on it, played it time and time again, and wasn't even aware of it's popularity 
 at the time.
  
  It finally arrived. I was worried that my expectations would be dashed by a remake designed to 
 cash in on the name.. even with Sid Meier at the helm. I am relieved to report that it's still 
 the same game that has been enhanced and updated to be even more of an addictive and long-lasting 
 experience. The game hasn't been ruined by any tampering with how the game flows, or what it's 
 about, which is what the fans will no doubt be glad has been kept.
  
  Previous players of one of the games in the Pirates! series should be able to jump right into it, 
 but there's plenty of new sections and features to learn that build upon the original game play. 
 Newcomers won't need to spend a great deal of time getting to grips with the basics of the game.
 
  
  Firstly, you choose which era you wish to play in, each one having different challenges associated 
 with that time period. You'll also be able to select what skills your pirate will have when venturing 
 out onto the high seas, being a skill at fencing, gunnery, wit and charm, navigation or medicine, 
 each giving you an advantage in different areas of the game. Being good at gunnery, for example, 
 will make it easier to dispatch or disable an enemy ship at sea, while medicine means your health 
 won't diminish with age allowing you to fight on well into old age. The last 2 options are difficulty 
 and nationality. Your nationality can a huge impact on how the game will be played.
  
  When you do start, you're introduced to a sequence where your family is captured by some evil-doers 
 yet you manage to escape. Later in the game, you will be given the opportunity to find and rescue 
 them.
  
  For the most part of the game, you'll be sailing the seas of the Caribbean, either trading between 
 towns, fighting off enemies, plundering lucrative vessels, or checking out ports for goods or new 
 crewmen. Each town belongs to either the English, French, Dutch or Spanish, and has a governor 
 to match. He's the dude that'll reward you for aiding their nation, give you a mission to complete, 
 or introduce you to his daughter. His daughter can come most in handy, as if you woo her, she'll 
 offer information or very useful gifts to you that make certain parts of the game easier.
  
  Gaining the affections of a governor's daughter can be got several ways, the most frequent 
 one being accepting an invitation to dance with her at a ball. This is a part of the game fans 
 will be new to. It involves paying a lot of attention to the hand gestures she makes, which will 
 tell you what the next move is. If you screw it all up, she'll think you're a loser, but if you 
 dance gracefully with her, you'll make her heart flutter and willing to help you.
  
  The town's tavern is home to various types of folk: jobless pirates who are looking for a ship 
 to join, barman who knows what's going on in town, barmaid who can provide you with the latest 
 and useful gossip, and finally the mysterious traveler in the corner who might have some information 
 or item for sale.
  
  Each town also has a merchant to trade goods with, and a shipwright, who can repair, upgrade or 
 buy your ship. These folk won't always help you though. If they think you're a filthy outcast, 
 they won't trade with you.
  
  Towns can also be attacked by land, where it kinda turns into a turn-based strategy game. If you 
 don't wish to attack a town, and they won't let you in, you can sneak into town at night, where 
 you have to creep round the streets avoiding the night wardens, hiding behind hay-bales and climbing 
 over low-walls to avoid them.
  
  When you're traveling between towns, you'll encounter ships of varying nations, some friendly who'll 
 hail news, and others who are not so friendly. If you decide to engage in battle at sea, the scene 
 moves to a close-view of your two ships, where you'll fire rounds of cannons at each other, some 
 types of rounds which will tear their sails, others are anti-personnel payloads, or just a barrage 
 or cannonballs to tear through the hull. If you don't destroy their ship, or they don't escape, 
 you collide and a fight breaks out between the two crews. You get to fight their captain in sword 
 fight, which can be done with a choice of 3 swords. Again, players of the previous incarnation 
 will find a lot of this very familiar.
  
  The graphics are pretty polished, and have some great sequences. The attention to detail is astounding. 
 Every ship model shows it's intricate parts when zooming in, the models of the characters are very 
 well designed and animated, and the physics work very well with the buoyancy of the ships during 
 battle, and how they dip deeper when turning.
  
  Sound-wise it's a constant sense of being at sea, with the wind blowing the sails, the sea lapping 
 at the hull, hearing monasteries when passing Jesuit towns and the crew singing when they're happy. 
 All the characters also talk in Firaxlish, a made-up language that could mean anything, but obviously 
 it's meaning it shown in subtitles. I like the Dutch greeting of "Wellin taa!". And when you disembark 
 onto land, you hear the manly grunty gestures from the pirates.
  
  I feel I should mention how excellent the lovely spiral-bound manual is. It's very comprehensive 
 and easy to read. It repeats itself quite a bit, but that's so that overlapping topics cover everything. 
 You also get extracts from the memoirs of the pirate "Sydney" (recognise that name anyone?) about 
 his pirating adventures, which actually give some advise on how to play the game. A lot of detailed 
 information on the ships, towns, nationalities and time periods is also contained in the reference 
 section.
  
  The version of the game I bought was the Limited Edition DVD one, which comes with videos of the 
 animated 3D models of some of the characters, design concepts for the packaging (very impressive) 
 and concept art, which has made it into the game in tact. There are also designer diaries, wallpapers, 
 theme packs, sketches, and most importantly, the original Pirates! Gold game for the PC, so you 
 can relive the game that this all spawned from.
  
  Sid Meier's Pirates! is a unique, enjoyable, addictive, long-lasting and very well produced remake 
 and enhancement of the original Pirates! game that fans will not find disappointing. The amount 
 of work and attention to detail that went into this shows very clearly. And not every game contains 
 action, adventure, fighting, stealth and strategy all in one cohesive game. It caters for a huge 
 range of players as far as difficulty is concerned, and can challenge even the most hardcore player 
 if they want it to. Every time you start a new game, it'll all be different. You really will get 
 your money's worth out of this, and I'll surely play it for many years to come.

Review:  This is an excellent update of the original Pirates! and its original update, Pirates! Gold. That 
 said, there's not much here that really improves on the original game. Graphics are excellent, 
 but they've never been the primary selling point of the game. Sound is better, but the extremely 
 limited voice acting is atrocious; they could have found out of work actors to volunteer their 
 time and it would have been better than this. It's almost like Sid gave his idiot cousin a translation 
 manual and said, "Here! Speak French!" 
  
  One very simple addition that I would have liked to see is a rudimentary experience element with 
 perhaps a progressive skill tree that opens new abilities for your pirate, or at least the ability 
 to improve the skill sets that are in the game, rather than simply picking one talent at the beginning 
 of the game. 
  
  That said, the old formula still works. If you're a fan of the original series and if you have 
 money to spare and you don't want to fool around with making Pirates! Gold work on a modern system, 
 this is worth buying. If you've never played the Pirates games before, pick this up soon - you'll 
 have a blast.

Review:  What a great game. Sid Meier has a long history of making very addicting, fun games. Pirates is 
 no exception. 
  
  Being an "open" game there are many career options to further your privateering booty. Trade, town 
 sacking, ship pirating, buried treasure and even romancing governor's daughters for information 
 to your "lost" family members.
  
  Sea scenes are realistic (water looks great) . Cannon damage shows enemy crew and cargo getting 
 blown off the deck. Capture enemy ships to haul extra trade goods around and find an even better 
 pirate ship for yourself. Ingenious skill level system where you get a bigger cut of the booty 
 for harder skill levels.

Review:  If you are a fan of the original Pirates, and have been waiting for a *good* update that takes 
 advantage of modern hardware, then you will not be disapppointed with this new release. Not a whole 
 lot has changed gameplay wise, which is a good thing. I was able to jump right into playing without 
 reading the manual, as the gameplay was very familiar. They didn't try to muck the game up with 
 too many details and extra sequences, although the ones they did add fit in nicely with the game. 
 For example, swordfighting an enemy captain is still there, but it is much more cinematic, and 
 gives you a little more control with the ability to jump and duck, as well as taunt your enemy. 
 Sneaking into a hostile town has been updated with a sequence that has you avoiding and knocking 
 out guards, and impressing the governors daughter requires you to follow her steps in a dancing 
 sequence. While the dancing sequence is my least favorite of the group, performing well can win 
 you special items to use in the game (and they are quite handy) . While each of the mini-games can 
 get a little repetetive, they all fit together very nicely and make for a quite addictive game 
 of Pirates. Firaxis did very nicely on the graphics, as the ships are nicely detailed, they bob 
 and lean in the wind, and the clouds and storms add nicely to the effect. I'm going to go out on 
 a limb and make a comparison to "the sims" in that Pirates doesn't have an ultimate goal (although 
 there are quests and a storyline that has you rescuing your family) so much as you are trying to 
 make your career as impressive as you can before you finally retire. It's a quite open-ended game 
 where you can make as many friends and enemies as you like. - If you loved the original, then this 
 new version will not disappoint. If you never played the original, but enjoy open ended games like 
 "the Sims" then its quite possible you will enjoy the light-hearted "Pirates!"
