:::Review:::
Versailles 1685 would be at its best teaching 9- to 13- year-olds a little French history. 

 
 When is a game not a game? When its mission seems to be to educate, rather than entertain.   

 
 Cryo Interactive's Versailles 1685 is essentially a series of history lessons about the court of 
 Louis XIV, strung together with a simple plot line and even simpler puzzles. Your first-person 
 perspective is that of Lalande, a valet of the bedchamber who's assigned by his boss, the first 
 valet, to discover who's behind a series of threatening notes found around the palace.  

 As a court flunky, your access to areas and characters depends on what the king is doing at any 
 given time. His day is rigidly structured by protocol, and the game is divided into acts according 
 to his schedule. For instance, while he's enjoying an afternoon stroll in the gardens, you're allowed 
 to wander around in the orangerie and maze looking for clues.   

 Most of the puzzles are extremely easy and feature non-challenges like finding a key and opening 
 a cabinet, using a pool cue to reach a note, and so on. The only times the game becomes frustrating 
 are when other characters order you, a lowly servant, to run errands back and forth (and back and 
 forth, and back and forth) and all you get in return is a tiny bit of help. After a while, you 
 want to ask, "What, are your legs broken?" (Actually, the game's characters are weirdly doll-like, 
 and rarely move at all.) And if you don't have anything to offer them they say things like, "Cease 
 this harassment instantly or I shall have you chastised on the spot."  

 One highlight is the game's lovely sound track of French baroque music. While sopranos trill in 
 the background, the detailed graphics bring the palace to life and allow you to tour many now-demolished 
 rooms. And Cryo's proprietary OMNI-3D engine provides smoothly organic 360-degree panning as you 
 take in your opulent surroundings. You can even zoom in on over 200 paintings to get a better look, 
 though most of them seem to depict such cheery biblical subjects as "Thomiris Plunging Cyrus' Head 
 in Blood" or "Saint Francis of Assisi Comforted After Receiving the Stigmata." Not to worry, parents, 
 the paintings contain the only violence in the game.  

 Versailles 1685 would be at its best teaching 9- to 13- year-olds a little French history. Anyone 
 else will find it heavy on scholarly footnotes and light on engaging gameplay.

Review:  Versailles puts you back in 1685 during the reign Louis XIV, king of France. There are rumors that 
 a nobleman is plotting for the destruction of the Chteau de Versailles. It is your duty to unveil 
 the plot and save the king from his enemies.
  
  The game features an interesting gameplay. The game takes place on a single day divided in acts. 
 Each act takes place in a different part of the castle where you will pick up objects like keys, 
 messages, candles and speak to certain members of the royal court by choosing certain phrases. 
 Unfortunately, you will spend more time listening to their conversations which bring nothing to 
 resolving the game but are rather there to teach some history.
  
  The graic and sound are pretty ordinary. The classical music will get repetitive as you will 
 spend hours in the same areas because some objects can be VERY difficult to find and will involve 
 much clicking. The graphics for the castle are quite nice and realistic but they should have taken 
 more time making the people who appear like plastic dolls.
  
  Despite certain long and boring aspects, this game will keep you busy for hours. If you enjoy exploration 
 and picking up keys, I suggest you try Versailles.
