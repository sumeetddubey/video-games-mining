:::Review:::
Following hot on the heels of Longbow 2, F-15 is, if possible, an even more impressive piece of 
 work. 

 The Jane's Combat Simulations line leaps from peak to peak, with nary a bum title in the bunch. 
 ATF, Longbow, Longbow 2, 688, and now F-15 have secured the company a place as the pre-preeminent 
 developer of simulation software. Following hot on the heels of Longbow 2, F-15 is, if possible, 
 an even more impressive piece of work. By taking on the sadly neglected F-15E Strike Eagle, it 
 fills a crucial gap in the air combat realm.   

 The last true Strike Eagle sim was F-15 Strike Eagle III from MicroProse, also produced by Andy 
 Hollis. That it has taken five years to create another, while we are flooded with Tomcat, F-22, 
 and Falcon sims, is a mystery. The F-15E is an extraordinary, versatile aircraft. It seats two 
 (pilot and weapon systems officer) , carries a heavy payload, and is designed to penetrate deep 
 into enemy territory at low altitudes. In many ways, it's not as sexy as a conventional air superiority 
 fighter, since it engages aircraft from beyond visual range. (That is, if it hopes to survive.) 
 With a full payload it can be sluggish, but shorn of the extra weight it can hold its own in a 
 close-in dogfight. Its mission is to deliver precision munitions to ground targets and protect 
 itself while doing so, and F-15 captures these roles admirably.  

 The first thing that strikes you about F-15 is the amazing attention to detail in the cockpit. On 
 full realism mode, the array of sensors and controls is awe-inspiring in its accuracy. Since the 
 F-15 relies so heavily on these sensors, they are the heart of the game. Their complexity can be 
 reduced to ease gamers into the sim, but that misses most of the point. The multifunction displays 
 for both front and back seats may be custom configured for air-to-ground, air-to-air, and navigation 
 modes, placing five MFDs at your fingertips at any given moment. There are hundreds of potential 
 commands and combinations, which makes the custom keyboard mapping a welcome and essential feature. 

 Full virtual cockpit look-around views and padlock mode are effectively implemented. This goes hand 
 in glove with an assortment of exterior views that enable you to track pretty much everything going 
 on. The flight model adheres to the most rigorous standards of accuracy. It has a terrific feel 
 for weight and motion, and the variations in handling characteristics are spot on. If a flight 
 model can get better than this, I wouldn't be able to tell. Artificial intelligence is strong in 
 both friendly and enemy aircraft, and the laundry list of nested wingman commands lets you issue 
 any order you may need to, to the entire flight or an individual plane. And these wingmen won't 
 run into you.  

 There are myriad ways into missions. The numerous training missions aren't as effective as the Longbow 
 tutorial, but they get the job done. Single missions allow you to hone various skills, and instant-action 
 settings provide basic custom missions. The powerful mission editor puts every element of the game 
 into your hands, enabling you to craft complex missions through placement of assets, waypoints, 
 and event triggers. Finally, the two campaigns (Iran and Iraq) get you to the heart of the sim. 
 The dynamic campaign system keeps missions constantly fresh and diverse and gives the battlefield 
 itself a realistic, alive feel.  

 There are some mild disappointments. Multiplayer support for two to eight gamers is stable, but 
 fails to allow for co-op missions, reducing head-to-head to fur balls. This is silly for an F-15 
 game. One sadly missed feature is an in-flight recorder for mission playback. Visually, the game 
 is striking, but even with a 3D card, full detail requires a Pentium 300 and 32MB of RAM. Other 
 games achieve similar, and in some cases better, results with less hardware. And, even with a huge 
 manual, numerous difficulty settings, and an extensive tutorial, you'll need some serious chops 
 to fly this sucker. Even on easy levels, it is very instrument intensive, and the learning curve 
 is steep. The payoff, however, is a superb, thorough, and vastly entertaining combat sim.

Review:  This game might be old but it is somewhat interesting. The graphics look old, the sound is OK, 
 and the gameplay isn't the best because on many missions you are sitting there waiting to get into 
 the action and I forgot the button to press to skip to the next action area. Also the game makes 
 you complete many missions sucessfully or the whole progress on your campagin is ruined. Also my 
 joystick is broken so what I engaged AP (auto-pilot) and let go of the joystick the plane moved 
 like crazy and I had to manually hold the joystick even with AP online. Now that I'm buying a new 
 joystick though it might get better. I bought this game in a package a long time ago when I lived 
 in FL and I though it was great back then but now I see that it is outclassed by other games today. 
 Buy this if it is on sale or in a bundle like I did.

Review:  This game is one of the top notch games in my mind. The graphics are excellent, right down to the 
 missles on the airplanes. You can fly a few different sorties, or make up your own. The campaigns 
 are also cool too. With different bombing missions or CAS or CAP, you never know what you are gonna 
 get into it with. The aerodynamics are intense. Flying with extra fuel tanks is nice, but they 
 slow you down in a dogfight. Jettison them away, and blow your enemy outta the sky! The cockpit 
 is cool too. Very realistic. You can look around and feel like you are really flying. It has a 
 multiplayer option which is quite stable as well. You can choose your map and even your plane decal. 
 There is nothing like blowing another gamer outta the sky and listening to him complain about how 
 he'll get you the next time. The learning curve depends on if you choose realistic flight or not. 
 Overall, its an awesome game.
