:::Review:::
Playing this spooky game might have you sleeping with the lights on - at least for a little while. 
 

 Several pleasantly creepy experiences await the adventurous in Amber: Journeys Beyond. If you're 
 fascinated by poltergeists and unexplained phenomena, or simply enjoy sitting alone in the dark 
 and listening for things that go bump in the night, playing this spooky game from Hugh Forest Entertainment 
 might have you sleeping with the lights on - at least for a little while.   

 Set in a house in the North Carolina mountains, Amber is a modern-day ghost hunt where merely observing 
 poltergeist activity has expanded to include interacting with it. Amber gives players an intriguing 
 paranormal experience. What begins as a response to a friend's concern develops into a journey 
 to rescue souls.   

 As you explore the house and the surrounding property seeking clues to your friend's plight, you 
 realize quickly that you are not alone. Strange things are happening and as you figure out how 
 to use your basic equipment, things get stranger. Without giving too much away, I can say that 
 you will learn the history of the souls haunting the house from an up-close-and-personal point 
 of view. Each died a tragic death and is trapped in a purgatory-like state. To help them move into 
 the afterlife, you must solve a series of well-integrated and moderately challenging puzzles. The 
 souls in and of themselves are plenty intriguing - watching the gardener's lifeless body swinging 
 slowly from the rafters, all because he couldn't get a date, makes your life seem a whole lot better. 
   

 While it may look like a Myst-ical experience, Amber's graphics and sound effects transcend the 
 typical point-and-click static screens encountered in so many adventure games. The richly textured 
 environment is sprinkled with eerie video segments of supernatural activities, like objects flying 
 around in the house and talking bees. It all combines into an engrossing, captivatingly wicked 
 time.   

 Sadly, the game is not without disappointments. It's simply not long enough. With a few more spiritual 
 encounters and puzzles, Amber could have been a great game, not just a good one. Worse still, the 
 final sequence is pathetically anticlimactic compared to the rest of the game. Even so, if you're 
 looking for a few hours of torturous fun, Amber is definitely worth considering. If anything, it'll 
 keep you wondering what really does go bump in the night.

Review:  AMBER: Journeys Beyond is a great game. I would say it could have been one of the best adventure 
 games created, except it ends too quickly. It is definitely worth playing; I would recommend it 
 to anyone. I have compared it to other highly rated games, such as Syberia and The Longest Journey. 
 This game is better than both, even by today's standards. It does an excellent job of storytelling 
 and creating atmosphere. There is very little music and sound in the game. This adds greatly to 
 the feeling of isolation and draws your attention when you do hear something. The result is a very 
 spooky game. No doubt, some will like some parts better than others, but that's not a bad thing. 
 Note: Does not run natively in Windows XP.

Review:  Amber is a great game for those of you who like mystery/solve puzzle games. It is alot like myst 
 but with a much more simple concept. The graphics are very nice throuout the game and the layout 
 of the gameplay area is very basic making the gameplay eaiser. With just the house and a couple 
 of other areas in the game to explore... it makes remembering where things are at and figuring 
 out what you need to do easy. I personally found the game captivating and enjoyable for a rainy 
 afternoon where you are wanting something fun to do. The average person can complete this game 
 in a few hours but I love to go back and play it again and again as it just seems to have that 
 draw to it. There is very limited objects in the rooms of the house and other areas to manipulate... 
 which on one hand makes figuring out the goals of the game easy... but on the other hand can make 
 it a little less exciting like other mystery/solve games.
