Alcatraz is a short, ugly, boring first-person sneaking game with a thick topcoat of bugs. 

 
  Alcatraz: Prison Escape is a short, ugly, boring first-person sneaking game that would at least 
 be sort of average in its awfulness if it were satisfied with being just short, ugly, and boring. 
 Instead, as Alcatraz rolled off the assembly line, someone at the budget game factory added a thick 
 topcoat of bugs. There are game-killing bugs, bugs that are merely annoying, inexplicable events 
 that we'll call bugs for lack of a better explanation -- pretty much the entire species of computer-game 
 bugs is included at no extra charge other than whatever you're asked to pay on top of the zero 
 dollars that Alcatraz is worth.
 
 Your goal in Alcatraz is to escape from five different prisons. The packaging implies that you're 
 going to have to use some deep problem-solving skills to enact these daring escapes. In reality, 
 all the problems that need to be solved are of the strictly linear  
 variety. Granted, sometimes you have to find the object that will unlock the stationary nonplayer 
 character who will then cough up the actual key, but that's really just another find-the-key task. 
 
 
 Most games that use this raggedy old puzzle structure at least use it mostly to supplement a more 
 compelling gameplay element, like some form of combat. Alcatraz, on the other hand, has nothing 
 else going for it. Well, technically, you're supposed to tiptoe around, avoiding the few guards 
 who patrol each prison. Somewhere along the line, "sneaking" got the reputation for being a thought-provoking 
 alternative to fighting. While that argument may have some validity in a much better game, the 
 deep strategy involved in defeating one of Alcatraz's robotic guards is to wait until his back's 
 turned before walking over to him and punching him in the head. There isn't much to it, and since 
 the guards have absolutely no reaction to the sight of fellow guards sprawled out unconscious on 
 the floor, you don't even have to think too much about  where  you're going to take guards out -- the 
 middle of a well-lighted cellblock is as good as anyplace else.
 
 Alcatraz's bugs actually present the biggest challenge to your escape. For instance, guards will 
 often get stuck walking in place. They're not stuck  on  anything obvious; they just become mysteriously 
 rooted to a wide-open spot, moonwalking for all eternity. Unfortunately, this curtails their normal 
 patrol routes and can make it tough to get behind them to administer a traditional head-punching. 
 On the other hand, since they can't chase you, you can usually just dart right past them and find 
 a safe place to wait out the brief period of extra guard alertness that accompanies their alarm 
 cries. 
 
 As you play, Alcatraz will crash to your desktop frequently. Saved games appear to work more or 
 less at random. You never can tell if one of your saves is ever going to load again, which is significantly 
 more nerve-wracking than any obstacle in the game proper. In fact, the statement that Alcatraz 
 is short is really just an educated guess. Each of the first four levels takes about an hour to 
 complete. Just at the beginning of the fifth level, we encountered a new bug that corrupted all 
 of our existing saves. At that point, replaying the first four levels became a requirement for 
 attempting the fifth and final level. That requirement was not met. So in the spirit of full disclosure, 
 level five might be 10 hours long, bug-free, and incredibly fun. But don't count on it.
 
 In the past, the LithTech graphics engine has generally proven to be an obstacle to a game's success, 
 though good games such as No One Lives Forever and Aliens vs. Predator 2 have somehow managed to 
 succeed in spite of it. Alcatraz has no such luck. It doesn't look good. It also doesn't play well, 
 and it barely even works. A few tired deathmatch and capture-the-flag multiplayer modes are included, 
 but after a week of searching at different times during the day and night, not a single server 
 or even another player was ever found on the matching service. Alcatraz is a lonely, grim experience.

Review:  And this is their weapon. This is a hellstruck game that game from the deepest pits of hell. A 
 piece of Satan is included with this game. Somebody made at least a million dollars over this game 
 . The next anti-christ will be named Alcatraz: Prison Escape . After looking at the horrid graphics 
 of this game, two daggers suddenly apeared in my eyes and I was so happy because I did not have 
 to look at the garnish visuals anymore. Then, when I heard a sound, my ears started bleeding and 
 I went deaf. i didn't have time to take my hand off the mouse before all of my fingers were mysteriously 
 severed from my hand. If you like this game, please kill yourself. You are the next Hitler I couldn't 
 even type this, my friend Jerry had to and he is typing right now because I cant see. But the doctors 
 reattached my fingers. Please, if you ever see this game, run. Run away and never return. And if 
 you see it again, then burn it. And then launch it into space. Launch it directly into the core 
 of The Sun. This game should be Rated AO for Anti-Christs Only.

Review:  When I was at BestBuy with my friend Jacob he came across this... Since I had blown all my money 
 on CDs he decided to buy it.... for around 20 bucks (i think i cant quite remeber) he thought it 
 might be an OK thing to play afterall he had just beaten HL1, Opposing force, and Blue Shift. We 
 needed something to pass the time.... IT WASNT OUR FAULTS!!!! So we pop it in his Disk tray and 
 a quite load time follows then we start to play.....
  We give some Ciggerettes to a guy ( we got the Cigs from the Freakin Guards table) and he showed 
 us a way out through a toilet.... Already we mastered the game! We snuck from building to building 
 try to find out where to go.... We only got caught 1 time from the time we started to the time we 
 beat the game.... The idiot didnt even shoot us.... He maced us! 
  Controls are easy enuff move collect stuff thats basically it. Graphics sucked, everyone looks 
 like they were sliced from a cookie cutter and given different clothes. I didnt pay attention to 
 the sound I was too busy laffing with Jacob about how much it sucked.....
  So lemme make this clear to u.... You buy this game I will hunt you down
