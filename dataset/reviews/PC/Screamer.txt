:::Review:::
Screamer shuns the pit stops, personnel moves, and car equipment upgrades that have become familiar 
 to racing fans in favor of colorful, straightforward, hard-driving action. 

 As computer games become more advanced, and consumers more sophisticated, the trend has been toward 
 higher extended play value through immersive, painstakingly realistic simulation. These days, comprehensive 
 statistics and piles of information to digest seem to be the only way to Get Your Money's Worth. 

 In response, the makers of this hot racing title simply say Let's race! Screamer shuns 
 the pit stops, personnel moves, and car equipment upgrades that have become familiar to racing 
 fans in favor of colorful, straightforward, hard-driving action. I, for one, am happy to see it. 
 All you need to do is choose your car, choose your track, and hit the gas.  

 All this fun is not without its weak points. The graphics are good (despite the lack of apparent 
 car damage and some polygon cutout in the tunnels) , but the game slows noticeably in SVGA mode, 
 where it looks best. In addition, the manual transmission cars perform noticeably better than the 
 automatics, requiring you to master the more complicated driving style to succeed. Not a huge problem, 
 but it's ironic considering that the game prides itself on its simplicity.   

 So where's the extended play value? It's in the variety of courses and it's in the four modes of 
 play: the championship mode, the time trial mode, the cone mode (where hitting cones adds seconds 
 to your time) , and the slalom mode, where you have to drive between gates to add time. Each of 
 these can be played on three difficulty levels.  

 But none of this is the point of this game. Screamer is for people who don't have five hours to 
 spend analyzing which struts perform best in the snow on mountain terrain. They've got ten minutes, 
 they're on the run, and they want a race. Whether it's against the computer or up to seven networked 
 friends, a race is exactly what they're going to get.

Review:  Screamer captures the heart of racing better than most games. The speed, the adrenaline, the twisted 
 metal and the rubber on the road. Not filled with many options, not much in the way of challenges, 
 but lots of racing spirit.
  
  In this game you have a few imaginary cars, each with a rating in speed, acceleration and grip. 
 These cars race on five or six tracks, with inversion thrown in to add numbers. The main event 
 in the game is the championship, where you score point to advance. With this you unlock new tracks 
 to compete on. The competition is brutal and just fast enough to make the race interesting. The 
 driving itself is beautiful, the handling easy, the cars fast, you slide just enough...
  
  But the thing that got me the most pleasure was racing to beat the records. Once you finish the 
 challenge you get a super car. It's a rocket car, aptly named the Bullet. It takes about 2 seconds 
 to get it from 0 to top speed (about 350 km/h) and it does not slide. Ever. All you have to do is 
 find the ideal line, know when to brake and when to hit the gas and then practice. I was competing 
 with my friend for months, shaving hundreds of a second of my times ever day. It was a great experience.
 
  
  This was also the first game in the Screamer series and while the other games lost much in quality, 
 it's beginnings were glorious. You have to try it.
