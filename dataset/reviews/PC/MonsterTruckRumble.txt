Despite that it doesn't play terribly, Monster Truck Rumble really has nothing to offer. 

  Though there are exceptions, budget-priced games don't stack up well against full-priced games 
 because of their generally lower quality in all aspects of their design. Unfortunately, Monster 
 Truck Rumble only perpetuates this pattern with its uninspired single-player modes, poor course 
 design and graphics, and terrible sound effects.           Monster Truck Rumble is bland and boring. 
    

  Monster Truck Rumble offers four single-player modes, including a free run, circuit race, wreck 
 'n' crush, and lance race. The free run mode doesn't include any objectives, so you're free to 
 roam around any course to take a look at the monochromatic terrain, as well as the animals, which 
 look and act as though they're made out of Styrofoam. In the circuit race mode, you'll choose from 
 any four of the six courses available (the remaining two are lane race tracks only) and race through 
 checkpoints scattered around the area. The wreck 'n' crush mode hides a series of small car piles 
 around the circuit-style courses, and the truck that wrecks the most cars within the given time 
 period wins the mode. Lastly, the lane race is a basic track race in an enclosed area filled with 
 various obstacles and a few tight turns. Three of the four modes that involve competition actually 
 use a helpful radar system, indicating the location of checkpoints, car piles, and opponents. There 
 is also a damage meter that indicates the amount of damage your truck has sustained before it's 
 completely wrecked. Monster Truck Rumble offers no championship-style mode that rewards you for 
 a good race, so when a race ends, the main menu screen reappears. There's nothing particularly 
 wrong with any of the available modes of play -- it's the fact that other aspects of the game are 
 so poor that it makes these other modes suffer.   

  Monster Truck Rumble's visuals are one of its weakest points. For somewhat obvious reasons, the 
 developers based courses on areas such as the Mojave Desert and other similarly desolate locales, 
 but regardless of the course name, they all pretty much look the same. Granted, one course may 
 have a canyon area while another may have a small farmhouse or a set of train tracks that lead 
 to nowhere, but they all use the same brown textures, the same Styrofoam objects, and the same 
 general structure. They're so lifeless and unappealing that they make the game feel like a chore. 
 It's also worth noting that what appear to be buffalo and chickens aren't really animals at all, 
 as they flip and roll through the air like small rocks when they make contact with your truck. 
 Also, special effects, such as rain that happens to be black and headlights that don't actually 
 illuminate the surrounding area, provide further evidence of the general lack of effort put forth 
 to create convincing environments. To top it all off, the fact that there's slowdown at higher 
 resolutions is completely unforgivable considering the simplistic low-polygon 3D models used for 
 the environments and trucks.   

  Along similar lines, Monster Truck Rumble's sound effects just don't make any sense. Whenever you 
 collide with a chicken, a buffalo, or even tumbleweed, the game produces the same sound effect 
 used when two trucks collide. Unless Monster Truck Rumble is trying to make some strange environmental 
 message, it's obvious that sound effects weren't exactly the highest priority. As for music, there 
 is one song that plays during the menu screen and nothing more, which is another missed opportunity 
 to give the game some much-needed character.           There are plenty of budget-priced driving 
 games that are much better.    

  Control is just about the only area of the game that isn't a complete disaster. For the most part, 
 Monster Truck Rumble's controls are quite responsive, so you shouldn't have any problems navigating 
 each track. There are moments when you can lose complete control of the car, particularly during 
 spinouts or collisions with various objects, but that's to be expected. Also, slowdown tends to 
 affect the control at times, but after a while, you'll learn to compensate for it.   

  In the end, all of the racing modes in Monster Truck Rumble, including its two-player split-screen 
 mode, are ruined by the bland, poorly designed environments. Despite that it doesn't play terribly, 
 Monster Truck Rumble really has nothing to offer -- it's impossible to recommend despite its low 
 price tag, as there are plenty of other similarly priced racing games that are much, much better.
