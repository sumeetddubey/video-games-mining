:::Review:::
Virtual Stupidity is a refreshing exercise in moronic humor. 

 "Listen up, dillhole, don't be alarmed, 'cuz like Beavis and Butt-head will control the vertical, 
 they will, um, adjust the horizontal. Heh, I said horizontal. Cool."  

 Parents beware, the two relentlessly infantile voices of a lost generation have made the jump in 
 screen resolution from MTV to your computer.  

 What's funny is that they don't look any better. In fact, the crudely-drawn stylized artwork of 
 the television series is accurately reproduced on the jagged lines of a computer screen. To complete 
 the effect, Viacom New Media borrowed the original voice talent from the series, which creates 
 a very smooth transition from linear to interactive, and in the process one very funny game.  

 
 All you'd expect from the eternally juvenile duo is here: fart jokes, painfully obvious sexual 
 innuendoes, glorification of anything illegal or immoral, and the fruitless pursuit of girlfriends 
 with one-liners such as, "Hey, um, do you like to do, like, stuff?" As with the show, the writers' 
 satirical genius puts these antics into a perspective that makes everything undeniably funny.  
 

 You appropriately control the two half-wits with a simple set of commands, using a mouse-driven 
 interface that looks and operates suspiciously like a LucasArts adventure game.   

 In fact, Virtual Stupidity is largely unoriginal in its approach to interactive adventures, and 
 even some of the puzzles are secondhand fare. But that's just not the point here. What makes this 
 game so entertaining (and I gleefully played it through to the end) are the actions and reactions 
 of the intelligence-challenged duo to the people and objects around them. Imagine the two as they 
 interrogate patients on a mentally-deranged ward at the local jail. Or picture the look on Beavis' 
 face as he inflates his shorts with a gas station air hose. Priceless.  

 Some adventure games test your cunning, your skill, and your MacGyver-like aptitude in building 
 a flare gun from toothpicks and oily cloth. Virtual Stupidity does none of the above, but instead 
 thrives as a refreshing, contemporary, relaxing exercise in moronic humor.

Review:  Long before there was South Park, folks tuned in nightly to watch Mike Judge's prodigy of two typical 
 teenagers growing up in the 1990's. Beavis and Butt-head started out as a animated short on the 
 MTV warped variety show, "Liquid Television". It was not long after such legacy shorts that appeared 
 such as Frog Baseball, that the indie mini-cartoons would get a home of their own. Things looked 
 good for Judge and his creation, and we all know what happens after you hit it big: market the 
 sucker! As a long time fan of the show, I admit that over the years there has been plenty of worthless 
 garbage released by MTV to milk currency out of the B&BH name, just look at the game "Beavis and 
 Butt-Head Do U." for a great example. However, Virtual Stupidity is well worth it's weight to the 
 critical adventure gamer, and captures an interactive experience of the show in it's finest hours.
 
  
  You play the role of the moronic duo, and as the game opens we find them doing what they lack the 
 most - class work. After an interruption from outside the school between the boys' hero Todd and 
 another hooligan, we see them both speed off in different directions. It is in that awe inspired 
 moment for B&BH, as they believe they should start out on yet another quest to join Todd's gang. 
 This is where you the player comes in with full control over B&BH. The intro is a typical one you 
 would expect from a TV episode, and really gets you in the mood to watch some toilet humor.
  
  The UI is pretty straight forward and reading the (lack of) instructions should be trivial. 
 The player is presented with a number of icons that act as verbs for the main characters, including 
 such ones as "walk", "look", "speak", and "take". All commands are switched by right-clicking the 
 mouse and choosing the appropriate command from a pop-up window. Inventory is also attached to 
 the pop-up, and provides the player with an option to view their stash of adventure goods. Almost 
 every action sequence can be bypassed if you press the ESC key, which is nice for when you end 
 up repeating dead-ends. The other such commands that are expected in an adventure game are present 
 via a drop down menu for things like save and restore. The complete UI is simple, easy to use, 
 and gets you to where you need to go almost instantly.
  
  Gameplay is an array of puzzles, item manipulation and mini-games. The puzzles are decent if yet 
 sometimes too easy as long as you pay attention to the clues. I did get stumped a couple times, 
 which lead to me backtracking my progress, but never a bad thing to have a challenge. Sometimes 
 the combination of items can be a hit or miss and may involve some random attempts at solving the 
 puzzle, but most are straight forward in design. The mini-games are a great added value and all 
 except one are optional to complete the main storyline. You get to play little arcade games such 
 as "burn the ants", "shoot tennis balls at yuppies", and the hilarious "Air Guitar". I'm not much 
 of a fan of arcade games in adventure games, but I'm willing to make an exception here as they 
 are almost purely optional.
  
  Virtual Stupidity combines a great mix of puzzles and humor into one package. The game is quite 
 old and frankly I don't even think it's possible to get anymore unless you eBay. If you can however 
 find this title, it is with great recommendation that you play it at least once, twice to make 
 sure you don't forget any of the jokes. Beavis and Butt-head comes alive in this adventure game 
 classic.

Review:  This game was great fun when i had first played it. It accurately portrayed the show into a video 
 game which game developers today still have trouble trying to do the same thing. The game has many 
 things to interact with and has some great mini games like spitting on the principals head from 
 a rooftop. This game is hilarious and it has excellent voiceovers, graphics that are similar to 
 the show and some video footage so this game plays out like an episode in a way.
  
  I recommend this game if you are ready for some cheap thrills or are bored because it is a great 
 timewaster.
