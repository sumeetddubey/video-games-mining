:::Review:::
This is the perfect game for kids 6 to 66 who want platform gaming at its finest. 

 Last year, Donkey Kong Country showed the video game world just how good a Super Nintendo game could 
 look. Shortly afterwards Sega countered by licensing a Disney Interactive title for Genesis based 
 on their hit movie, Toy Story. Just like DKC, it had the kind of 3-D rendered graphics that took 
 16-bit games to their next (and final) level. It also had innovative, compelling gameplay and a 
 pretty decent soundtrack, at least by Genesis standards. It was lauded by press and gamers alike 
 and became one of the highest rated Genesis games in the last few years. Now, Toy Story is available 
 for the home PC as one of a group of 16-bit-to-PC ports that Disney is calling the Power Play series. 
   

 The game remains thematically true to the movie. Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll, is a little boy's 
 favorite toy until the little brat gets an electronic talking Buzz Lightyear with arm-mounted laser 
 and karate-chop action for his birthday. Under the bed goes Woody and so starts a rivalry between 
 the loyal cowboy and his egotistical, somewhat delusional nemesis that lasts the whole movie and 
 the whole game. Each level, with the exception of the bizarre Buzz Nightmare level, depicts a scene 
 from the movie, and while most are in the standard platform style, some succeed in escaping from 
 the tired norm. In addition to the mission completion levels, the beat-the-clock speed dash levels, 
 and the head-to-head fighting levels, the game also offers an aerial view driving level and a behind-the-shoulder 
 view driving level. The spacing of the levels here is key, and it is done well, keeping the player 
 interested for hours.   

 Perhaps the best thing about the game, and certainly the only difference between it and the 16-bit 
 version, is the soundtrack. Besides the excellent sound effects, which, incidentally, were just 
 as good on the Genesis, Disney has included a CD-quality soundtrack that features instrumental 
 versions of two of Randy Newman's whimsical ditties from the movie. It really brings the package 
 together nicely and is a pleasant change from the usual anemic game music.  

 Unfortunately, not all is well in the Magic Kingdom. Toy Story, just like the other Power Play titles, 
 suffers from a few problems that arise within the Windows operating system. Windows, especially 
 Windows 95, doesn't handle keyboard entries quite as well as it should. For example, when you're 
 trying to run and jump simultaneously using a keyboard, the combination of two keys may not register 
 immediately, sometimes making it impossible to navigate some of the tougher obstacles. Less detrimental 
 but still a nuisance is the Windows sound set-up. Every time the CD loops to restart the track 
 it seizes the system for an instant, creating a noticeable pause in the gameplay. Also, almost 
 all Windows games use the incredibly inefficient WAV format for their sound effects, and Toy Story 
 is no exception. Unhappily, the result is sound effects that occasionally hit a full second after 
 they should. These flaws, though relatively annoying, are minor, and they really don't detract 
 too much from the back-to-basics gameplay, which is what makes Toy Story shine. This is the perfect 
 game for kids 6 to 66 who want platform gaming at its finest. If you want something even better 
 that's just for kids, though, stick with Disney's Toy Story Animated Storybook.

Review:  The Toy Story game came out in 1996. And it was one of the most awesome games I had to my snes (Let's 
 hope it comes out for the VC) The game was complicated it was long and frustrating, especially 
 when you missed up Woody's jumps. The game follows up after the game Toy Story 1. The graphics 
 were pretty neat when they got out. The music of the game is pretty alright some of the songs were 
 from the movie and you could of kept on listening to them over and over again hehe.. If you have 
 a snes go buy this game immediately. It may not be perfect today. But it wasn't far from before! 
 If you liked the movie Toy Story you DEFINITELY! have to play this game if you haven't tried it 
 yet.

Review:  Toy Story is a milestone in animation history. Well if this game out in 1996, then it most have 
 been a cross-over promotion with the video and laserdisc release. Well, it has the look and feel 
 of an old side-scrolling game. This PC version is a port of the Genesis and SNES versions.
  
  The story is just like the movie, but a bit changed around (like most video game adaptations) . 
 The graphics are pretty nice looking, and the design of the game is a lot better and has the feel 
 of the movie. The movie itself is a masterpiece, and this game is very fun to play. Some levels 
 have some nasty controlls, like the RC car levels. When you are stuck on a level, the next level 
 automatically becomes available.
  
  The music score and sound effects/voice over work is pretty good, a bit different from the movie, 
 but still worth it all. The game is full of small challenges. I wouldn't be until the game based 
 on A Bug's Life where the Pixar-based computer games would go to 3D consoles.
  
  Overall, this a fun title that has a lot to offer. It'll live up to fans of the film and the series 
 as well. Pixar is amazing, and this game is very good, unlike newer THQ adaptations like Finding 
 Nemo and The Incredibles. Toy Story is a fun retelling of the movie through a video game.
