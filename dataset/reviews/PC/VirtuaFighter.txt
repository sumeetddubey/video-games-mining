:::Review:::
If you have even a passing interest in 3-D fighters, Virtua Fighter PC is not to be missed. 

 
 When I first got word that Sega Entertainment was about to release Virtua Fighter on the PC, I 
 must admit that I greeted the news with skepticism. With very few exceptions, console games rarely 
 survive the conversion to the PC with their graphics, control, and playability intact. Surprisingly, 
 however, Sega has managed to overcome most of these traditional obstacles, and has delivered a 
 solid beat-'em-up in the process.  

 For those unfamiliar with the game, Virtua Fighter pioneered the concept of 3-D fighters when it 
 was unveiled to a stunned arcade audience in 1993. The revolutionary game engine took the complex 
 polygon engine of a flight simulator and placed it into a Mortal Kombat-style fighter. While the 
 gameplay remained basically the same as that of its two-dimensional predecessors (pummel the other 
 person until he is rendered unconscious) , the three-dimensional environment delivered a degree 
 of realism that the two-dimensional titles could not hope to match. The result was that Virtua 
 Fighter has become one of the most successful arcade games of all time.  

 Since the heart of Virtua Fighter resides in realistic motion - rather than realism - the AM2 Design 
 team captured the moves of actual martial arts experts as they executed more than 700 attacks. 
 These moves are accessed by performing combos or multiple sequential hits to the three action buttons 
 - block, punch, and kick. For example, to perform Pai's whirlwind kick, hit punch, punch, and kick 
 in a rapid sequence. This may seem a bit awkward at first, but after a few hours it becomes second 
 nature. A secondary benefit of this system is that it overcomes the PC's hardware constraint, which 
 allows a maximum of four buttons on any joystick port. Unfortunately, the use of three buttons 
 on the first controller forces a second player to use the keyboard for head-to-head play. While 
 you cannot blame Sega for the hardware limitation, the harsh reality is that the player with the 
 joypad always wins, and the player with the keyboard always loses. This reduces the best feature 
 of the arcade game to a simple contest of who can say dibs the quickest.   

 While the graphics fall short of the beautiful Saturn version, they still command respect. Players 
 can choose the classic untextured polygons of the arcade model, or the more realistic 
 remix version developed for the Saturn. Regardless of which version you prefer, the 
 graphics remain crisp and the colors vibrant (without the washed out look that typically 
 plagues console ports) .  

 In conclusion, Virtua Fighter is unquestionably the best 3-D fighter published to date on the PC. 
 While not as fast or graphically appealing as the Saturn version, this is as close as a standard 
 PC is likely to come. If you have even a passing interest in 3-D fighters, Virtua Fighter PC is 
 not to be missed.
