:::Review:::
The big news is that the game now includes multiplayer options. 

 This quasi-sequel to Jagged Alliance is one game everyone here at GameSpot HQ has been anticipating 
 for a long time. In this day and age - when everyone and his uncle is developing a real-time strategy 
 game - some good, old-fashioned, turn-based combat is a much-needed refreshment. Sirtech hasn't 
 added much to the great formula of the original JA, but what has been added makes the game a little 
 more modern and a great deal more fun for old players and new players alike.   

 For those who haven't had the pleasure of working with the mercenaries of A. I. M., here's a little 
 background. Deadly Games works much like your typical turn-based strategy game. You have units, 
 each worth a certain amount of "action points." During each of your turns, your basic goal is to 
 use the points to kill as many bad guys as possible. But what made Jagged Alliance such a treat 
 to play, and what makes Deadly Games even more of one, is that each of your units has personality. 
 Not in some abstract, Close Combat way - but real personality. You hire from a huge pool of available 
 mercs, but you must pick and choose carefully. Some won't work together, some will scream at you 
 if you ask them to do something they don't want to, and some won't stop doing something they really 
 enjoy - such as shoot at an enemy, even when taking heat from all sides.   

 Sirtech has added some nice touches to make the single-player game more enjoyable. For one, you 
 no longer have one huge map to tackle. You can either play single scenarios or take them on, one 
 by one, in campaign fashion. Unfortunately, the most frustrating aspect of the game is also directly 
 related to this new, mission-based style. In the original release of Deadly Games, each mission 
 has a very limited amount of turns allocated for completion. Not only did this make some missions 
 next to impossible, it made gathering items from the battlefield out of the question. Thoughtfully, 
 Sirtech has released a patch which allows you to alter the time allotments by adding more turns 
 or doing away with the limit altogether, a must for anyone who wants to truly enjoy the game.  

 For each completed scenario, you get a nice sum of cash, which you can then use to hire more mercs 
 or buy equipment from Micky, an arms dealer who sporadically appears to offer you items. In another 
 great improvement, you can now also buy equipment (even if the quality is questionable and the 
 prices sky-high) ; even better is the fact that you can sell excess equipment. Also new are several 
 new types of weapons, dozens of new mercenaries, and a few subtle touches, such as trails of blood 
 behind wounded soldiers, that give the game enough originality to keep it from being just an add-on. 
   

 The big news (which Sirtech has been shouting from the rooftops since the day Deadly Games was announced) 
 is that the game now includes multiplayer options. Up to four players can play against one another 
 - or against the computer. And while the action can get kinda slow as you wait for three other 
 people to manipulate each of their units, the multiplayer game has some nice new options. Each 
 player must select the mercs he wishes to employ, and if two desire the same hired-gun they must 
 outbid each other. Same goes for equipment - when Micky comes around, the goods go to the person 
 with the fattest bank roll. In combat, your mercs will react rather vocally when attacking someone 
 they admire, and even more vocally when attacking someone they dislike. The only questionable feature 
 is the ability to have your mercenaries taunt your opponents - fun at first, but rather tiresome 
 in a matter of minutes.   

 Of course, this review wouldn't be complete if I didn't point the one major problem with Deadly 
 Games: the graphics have not been updated in the least. Expect the same blocky, VGA imagery used 
 two years ago. Of course, not everything can be beautiful, and Deadly Games manages to get by on 
 its multiple personalities alone.

Review:  Ok so everyone that I have talk to about this game says it has no depth and substance. I beg to 
 differ, this game is very fun, and there are some hidden fun character interactions that make this 
 game what it is. This is a game that is about the tactics, but more over it is about the characters 
 themselves. Some of them wont be on the same team as others, some are attracted to others and will 
 over-react if the other one is KIA. Some are spies within your own ranks. It is fun to see what 
 else you can find. I love this game also because you can sit and play for 10min or 10hrs. Plus 
 after you have played all the scenarios then you can make your own. There are also websites that 
 you can download other player-made maps and campaigns. Sometimes you just need to dust off your 
 DosBox and get some good old-school low-res, top-down, shoot-emup, whoop-ass action!
