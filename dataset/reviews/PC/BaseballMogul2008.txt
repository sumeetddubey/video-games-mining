:::Review:::
Combining the stats demanded by baseball gearheads with great ease of use, Baseball Mogul 2008 hits 
 the ball and touches 'em all. 

  Baseball Mogul has come a long way in the nine years since its opening day. The game started in 
 1998 as a straightforward economic simulation of what it would be like to run a big-league ballclub, 
 with a focus on winning the World Series  and  setting the perfect price for stadium suds. It isn't 
 quite like that anymore. Competition from more involved sims, such as Out of the Park Baseball, 
 has tilted the diamond, forcing designer Clay Dreslough to move from simplicity to stats. Thus, 
 Baseball Mogul 2008 is a snapshot of evolution in progress, a sports management sim in transition 
 that gives baseball gearheads lots of numbers to crunch while still maintaining the fantastic pick-up-and-play 
 playability, which made this franchise such a hit in the first place.  

          Being able to watch the key pitch in each at-bat really livens up those tight playoff games 
 in October.     

  If you haven't played a Baseball Mogul game in a while, chances are you'll be amazed at how much 
 has been added to the series in recent years. Where fans once rightly complained that the game 
 didn't even track such core baseball numbers as lefty-righty splits, the game now lets you look 
 over everything. Eighty player stat categories are now available for your perusal, so you can check 
 out everything, including obvious biggies, such as home runs and ERA; more intricate stuff, such 
 as OPS and GIDP; and flat-out esoterica, such as isolated power and RTO percentage. Stats for your 
 entire baseball universe can also be examined in the new online encyclopedia, which tracks team 
 and player stats, as well as financial records from the minors to the majors. All of these numbers 
 allow you to pick apart your rosters and spend hours tinkering with batting lineups and pitching 
 rotations. Scouting reports have also been beefed up, giving you the ability to give youngsters 
 a once-over, as well as check out such stats as DICE and ground-ball percentage.  

  Even though Baseball Mogul 2008 has become something of a stat-heavy showcase, the game retains 
 its simple charm. You don't have to embrace your inner Bill James to enjoy running a ballclub. 
 Success can be had by sticking to the same old principles that have governed the series since its 
 beginning. So if you want to stick to the basics, you can field a winning team and make a few bucks 
 by just signing players. You can also order up the odd trade and set a sensible going rate for 
 tickets, beer, hot dogs, or ice cream.  

  Also, the game isn't all about the numbers. Unlike all of the other baseball management sims, Baseball 
 Mogul 2008 has a strong visual element. Although the interface comprises largely generic Windows 
 menus and boxes that give the game too much of a spreadsheet vibe, a new ticker bar rolls by along 
 the bottom of the screen at all times, keeping you current on league stats and standings. A full 
 graphical engine also lets you watch the key pitch from each at-bat when manually simming games. 
 Hits are mixed up by a new physics engine, so you never see the same play twice. And the artificial 
 intelligence manages a smart game against you, adroitly pulling pitchers and inserting pinch hitters. 
 It even plays a conservative, station-to-station game and favors the bunt to move runners in the 
 later innings of tight games. Aside from one annoying problem with audio syncing that has the sound 
 of the ball smacking into the glove while the ball is still in flight onscreen, the presentation 
 really brings games to life. It's certainly a big improvement over the bland stat screens and repetitive 
 textual play-by-play commentary in other sports sims.  

          Babe just what he's worth in 1927 thanks to a revamped historical financial system.    

  Another plus is enhanced support for historical leagues. Even though Baseball Mogul has used the 
 Lahman Database to let players start leagues in any season from 1901 to current day for a few iterations 
 now, it has always seemed like an afterthought because of problems with teams not moving when they 
 should and such weirdness as modern salaries in the dead-ball era. However, these issues have been 
 fixed this year, so you'll see Babe Ruth making a historically correct $50,000 or so instead of 
 $15,000,000. You'll also see the Brooklyn Dodgers automatically pick up and head west in 1957. 
 But cities don't change over the years, so you're stuck with 2007 populations and wealth no matter 
 what year you choose to start building your baseball empire.  

  With Baseball Mogul 2008, this franchise is moving back to the top of the order. After a few years 
 where it seemed out of date when compared to more high-powered simulations, such as OOTP, the game 
 is clearly improving. It still isn't quite all things to all baseball fans, because its online 
 component is little more than an ad for the separate Baseball Mogul online game, and hardcore stat 
 fans will continue to find everything a little light for their tastes. But the game remains a great 
 everyman sports sim, now with a little something extra.

Review:  Gameplay. This game is amust for every baseball fan.
  The rosters are as accurate as they could get. From 1901 to present day .Every players stats are 
 inluded. I was impressed by the amount of stats. In the game I played the 1954 Orioles. Every player 
 from that year was included. I even found a way to import original team logos and players photos 
 from that time period which was great. 
  Graphics. The stadiums are good . It would have been better to use real photos of the stadiums. 
 The dimensions , the names are all real. but real photos would really add to the game.
  Sound. the sound is OK , there is no play by play, but it could have been better. The ball and 
 strike calls or voices from vendors and fans could be improved. 
  Learning curve. easy. The game isn't that difficult, provided you keep an eye on your players stats. 
 
  Vallue is good 20 dollars isn't expensive mainly if PC games go for 50 dollars. 
  In all this is a very good game. If you like baseball ,than you must have this game.
