:::Review:::
Featuring 12 games total, Atari Anniversary Edition contains more games than your average retro 
 collection. 

  As the game industry matures, the market for older game content grows. People who grew up with 
 pioneering arcade games such as Defender, Xevious, and Missile Command find themselves longing 
 to replay these old favorites. Realizing this, Infogrames, the current owner of the Atari name 
 and catalog, has put together a collection of Atari's classic arcade games, seasoning it with archive 
 materials including interviews and photographs. The collection, handled by the perennial retro 
 compilation developers over at Digital Eclipse, contains some classic Atari games from the late 
 '70s and early '80s. The ports are nearly arcade-perfect for the most part, though a few of the 
 games suffer from control issues. Still, at a retail price of less than $20, Atari Anniversary 
 Edition can be worthwhile if you're feeling nostalgic.           Atari Anniversary Edition features 
 classic games like Millipede...    

  Featuring 12 games total, Atari Anniversary Edition contains more games than your average retro 
 collection. The package contains Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, Battlezone, Centipede, Crystal Castles, 
 Gravitar, Millipede, Missile Command, Pong, Super Breakout, Tempest, and Warlords. Additionally, 
 an aftermarket level replacement add-on for Tempest, called Tempest Tubes, is also included. It 
 would have been nice to see some other game variants, such as the rare version of Battlezone that 
 Atari produced for military training purposes, included in the pack. Games with strictly digital 
 control -- Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, and Battlezone -- all control just fine, though Battlezone 
 forces you to use a simplified, one-stick control scheme unless you want to use keyboard controls, 
 which offers the arcadelike two-stick setup.   

  The rest of the games originally used some sort of analog control scheme. Centipede, Crystal Castles, 
 Millipede, and Missile Command all relied on trackballs for precise analog control, and you can 
 use your mouse to control these games. Unfortunately, the mouse isn't ideal, as it never really 
 works as quickly as a trackball could. Crystal Castles suffers the most from this, as you can't 
 move poor Bentley Bear around fast enough to avoid the wicked trees and gem eaters on the game's 
 higher stages. Warlords and Tempest used paddle-style spinners, originally. Fortunately, Tempest 
 works well enough without any analog support whatsoever, and using the mouse for Warlords works 
 great.           ... and Asteroids, complete with authentic cabinet art.    

  Graphically, the game tosses in a lot of extras, such as full-on cabinet artwork and background 
 images that make the games look more like the original arcade machines. However, you'll usually 
 want to turn these extras off so you can have more screen area devoted to the actual game. Additionally, 
 each game has an alternate graphics mode that does little things, like adding color to Battlezone's 
 vectors or totally redrawing all the characters in Crystal Castles. The games all sound reasonably 
 close to their arcade counterparts, though a lot of the music, particularly the high-score music 
 in Battlezone, sounds like it was recreated.   

  If you're looking to play these 12 classic (OK, maybe Gravitar isn't a classic) games again, your 
 best bet is, of course, to hunt down the original arcade machines. However, if you don't have an 
 empty garage or a pile of money to spare, Atari Anniversary Edition emulates the 12 games well 
 enough.

Review:  Atari Anniversary Edition is a great pack of games containing only 12 games. It also includes  
 covers, and ect, it only requires the cd and then go into the Atari Anniversary Edition and click 
 achives and you will get all of that stuff. My most favorite game was tempest and crystal castles. Playing 
 those games made my day when I finally got the package working after a couple of years. I recommend 
 getting this, ALSO this includes 2 asteroid games, asteroids and asteroids deluxe, so your gameplay 
 in each game will be great within both, also again, you can have an option of enchanting the games 
 to make them look better if you want, no patches or anything needed, just within a click of a mouse 
 you can get enchanted games on the Atari Anniversary Edition. There are a lot of games to choose 
 from, even the angry video game nerd I bet haves these games, he probably think their good, just like 
 the doom series! I recommend getting this package!

Review:  This game is basically a mush of your basic old-school games. Centipedes, Tempest, pong to name 
 a few. Heck, it even has asteroids. Sure, i would rather Hemm/ster - roids then asteroids, this 
 game still has a corpuconia of old-school delights. The first thing to say about this is that i 
 am a HUGE Centipedes fan. Tempest is the only other game, i really like that is arcade, but centi/millipedes 
 are the coolest games ever. And for free, try to beat the sacred.... errr... i forgot the color but 
 hard centipede. Past 20,000 pts. is good. Well, there really isn't much to say for this game except 
 it houses a bunch of old-school arcade classics that can be played anytime, anywhere, any anything. 
 I have no idea how to get it anymore, in fact i don't even know how i got mine.... well, sorry, 
 i guess your still limited to going to Michael Jackson's neverland to play the arcade.... but if 
 you have it, bust it out some more :) -Skalokos
