:::Review:::
Got a few minutes? Strap yourself in, marvel at the flight-simulator feel, fly up into the clouds 
 or down into the earth, and most of all, engage in some high-adrenaline air-to-air and air-to-ground 
 combat. 

 Read the manual carefully. Watch closely as the opening screens tell the story of a fighter pilot 
 on a mission to save the known universe. Follow along as the computer outlines which type of enemy 
 craft attacks by air, and which by ground. Study your targets carefully... and then go out and blast 
 anything that moves, drives, flies or tries! That's the basic premise behind this shareware favorite, 
 and basic is the key word here.  

 Basic isn't always a bad thing, though. There's no reason that you should have to stop and play 
 a game of puzzle logic with the alien commander to make a game complete. In some cases, the fun 
 of the game is in the sheer mindlessness of it. Got a few minutes? Strap yourself in, marvel at 
 the flight-simulator feel, fly up into the clouds or down into the earth, and most of all, engage 
 in some high-adrenaline air-to-air and air-to-ground combat.  

 While Terminal Velocity definitely isn't the only game of its type, it does set itself apart in 
 a couple of areas, most obviously the graphics. From the shadows of the flying planes to the final 
 huge explosions, the graphics make you feel like you're right in the middle of some futuristic 
 dogfight. Whether skimming just above land or way up in the clouds, you get the sensation of high-speed 
 action.  

 The second area which sets TV apart is the sheer size of its levels. While other 3-D shooters may 
 restrict you to an underground maze, in this game the sky is, quite literally, the limit. Each 
 world extends beyond the scope of your individual mission, letting you veer off occasionally to 
 go search for hidden power-ups and tunnels.   

 All told, Terminal Velocity is the proverbial quick fix. You'll never spend twenty hours straight 
 playing, but you will never be disappointed when you're looking for a few minutes of high-speed 
 excitement.

Review:  Terminal velocity is a straight forward, uncomplicated, sci-fi flight combat game. And it's really 
 fun.
  There are a couple drawbacks. Many levels are without much variety on the feel of the terrain. 
 They attempt to mix it up by making worlds of lava, sand, rock, snow, and water, but it's really 
 just a different bitmap, with no real sense of texture. If you enjoy an in depth story to drive 
 you, it won't be here. The plot is uninspired, and although you get a detailed briefing at the 
 beginning of each level, mission objectives are always the same: kill everything. These are minor 
 issues to me, when I take the rest of the game into scope. A key plus is that the ship is just 
 fun to fly! You're even offered multiple camera angles to do so with. You get a good sense of speed, 
 particularly when you drag the crafts belly close to the ground and then pull up just before slamming 
 into a mountain. The controls are smooth enough to allow for some clever maneuvering, and there's 
 lots of real estate to fly over. The worlds are quite large, and designed like a world. That is 
 to say, spherical. There are no barriers or invisible walls, or warnings that you're leaving the 
 battlefield. If you fly in a straight line, you'll eventually end up back where you started. Mind 
 you, your enemies and targets typically stay within the same radius of land.
  
  And there's lots of enemies to fight. Each level is packed with a hefty loaf of baddies, and each 
 world has enemy models specific to that world. And there are lots of world's to get through. When 
 I played the game the first time, I remember thinking how it just seemed to keep going! In a good 
 way of course. And at the end of each world, there is of course a boss battle. A big boss battle. 
 The bosses in this game were large in scale. I don't recall having seen bosses in a game at that 
 time that were that size. To take on all these adversaries, you'll need some heavy weaponry. and 
 Terminal Velocity offered a fine selection of energy and projectile weapons.
  
  Terminal Velocity provides a large game experience in a fast paced arcade style flight shooter. 
 For a bundle of fun, and straight forward fire fights, pick it up.
