:::Review:::
You can build any kind of theme park you want -- so long as it's SeaWorld -- in this budget strategy 
 game that's a bit thin on content. 

  When Chris Sawyer and MicroProse published RollerCoaster Tycoon in 1999, virtually no one could 
 have imagined the impact it would have. While there were earlier games built around the idea of 
 constructing roller coasters or theme parks, Sawyer brilliantly merged the two ideas into an addictively 
 simple game that sold a gazillion copies. It also launched a wave of competitors, from Microsoft's 
 Zoo Tycoon to the latest takeoff, SeaWorld Adventure Parks Tycoon. It's probably a good thing that 
 SeaWorld is published under Activision's budget label, because it comes off as an extremely lightweight 
 imitation of the original.  

          You must monitor the mood of your visitors to identify potential trouble spots in your 
 park.     

  If you've played any of the recent games with "tycoon" in the title, you'll instantly recognize 
 the interface and mechanics of SeaWorld Adventure Parks Tycoon. Your job is to create a moneymaking 
 theme park, from scratch, by designing everything from the layout of the park to which rides and 
 amusements are available. You control everything from ticket prices to concession prices, and you 
 can even charge customers, known as peeps, to use the bathroom. Once it's all set up, just sit 
 back and watch the peeps enjoy your park while you tweak and fiddle along the way.  

  It turns out that it's a good and bad thing being the only game to bear the official SeaWorld Adventure 
 Parks license. While you get to use most of the rides and attractions found at SeaWorld's three 
 main parks, including Shamu Adventure and Shipwreck Rapids, that's  all  you get. You can't design 
 your own coasters, and, as SeaWorld has a limited number of rides and attractions, there's not 
 a lot to choose from. After a few levels, it begins to feel like you're reconfiguring the same 
 park again and again. To paraphrase Henry Ford, "you can build any adventure park you want, so 
 long as it's SeaWorld."  

  The game comes with 12 levels that are split into three groups of varying difficulty, so it's easy 
 for new gamers to ramp up to more difficult challenges. Most of the levels have objectives that 
 are fairly easy to reach, though some of the latter levels put you under considerable time constraints 
 to accomplish your goals. These time limits can be frustrating, as you've got to build an almost 
 perfect park to reach your objectives. There is a sandbox mode that allows you to build to your 
 heart's content without worrying about objectives or time limits, though, once again, the limited 
 amount of content doesn't allow for a lot of variation in park design.  

  SeaWorld Adventure Parks Tycoon retains the traditional 2D look and feel of most tycoon games, 
 and it does look very pretty. There's an excellent level of detail in the graphics, though there 
 are some maddening omissions. You can't rotate the map in 90-degree increments -- a feature that's 
 almost standard in every other game in the genre. This makes it almost impossible to fine-tune 
 construction behind large buildings because you can't see what's going on. In addition, you can't 
 rotate certain buildings at all during construction, so you're forced to place them as they are. 

  Some of the animation is well done; for instance, you can actually see the dolphins leaping out 
 through hoops. The peeps, however, don't exhibit the same amount of emotion and interaction as 
 they do in other games. Like a virtual person in The Sims, an individual peep just walks around 
 looking to satisfy a current need, whether it be going to the bathroom or finding something to 
 eat. Additionally, it's hard to tell your customers apart from your park staff since zooming in 
 is of little help, as the graphics are a bit pixelated up close.  

          Make sure to keep enough staff on hand or else rides will start to break down.     

 
  Musically, the game's soundtrack seems to consist of a few colorful tracks that capture a nice 
 Caribbean/nautical mood. The sound effects are adequate, though there's a lot of background chatter 
 as your peeps walk around. Overall, though, they're par for the genre.  

  SeaWorld Adventure Parks Tycoon packs about 15 to 20 hours' worth of gameplay, and it's not a bad 
 game for younger gamers. And with the slim amount of content, it's a good thing that Activision 
 is only charging $20 for it.

Review:  At first this game might seem appealing to gamers who love the ocean and the creatures along with 
 it, but in truth there isnt much to this game. Basically all you do is build onto your seaworld 
 park, and your goal is to.... there really isnt much of a goal. : ( The music is kinda nice and the 
 graphics are so-so. The tourist that come to visit your theme park are either fat or skinny. In 
 other words, none of the tourist seem to have any mind of their own. All in all, this game is good 
 for about an hour and then you get bored of it.
