At its heart lies a fun little platform game that truly does justice to Bugs Bunny. 

 Cartoons know no boundaries. They're not limited to laws of physics, they don't have to be believable, 
 and they don't even have to be linear. As long as it's funny, you've got a good cartoon. Bugs Bunny 
 has played many roles in his 50-year career, such as a knight of the Round Table, a space-faring 
 astronaut, a cave bunny, and a present-day rascal. His first 3D game, Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time, 
 is an action-adventure that tries to capture the humor and spirit for which he's so well known. 

 The plot of Lost in Time is extremely simple, just like most Looney Tunes skits. Bugs has taken 
 another wrong turn on his way to Pismo Beach and ended up in a mysterious shed containing a time 
 machine he mistakes for a carrot-juice dispenser. He pulls a few levers and soon he's lost in time. 
 Soon into his history-spanning travels, he comes across Merlin, who explains that Bugs has to fetch 
 numerous clocks and golden carrots to return to his present day. This adventure will lead him through 
 all the important time periods: the Stone Age, the Medieval Period, the Pirate Years, the 1930s, 
 and of course, the future. While collecting clocks and carrots, he'll run into all his famous adversaries 
 including Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, Witch Hazel, and Marvin the Martian. More importantly, you'll 
 be able to relive some of your favorite Looney Tunes routines, as the game features numerous re-creations 
 of classic cartoon scenarios.  

 In Lost in Time, Bugs must jump all over history in a truly nonlinear fashion in order to get himself 
 home. While you start in the Stone Age, you'll quickly move forward onto Planet X, then back to 
 the 1930s, then back to the Stone Age again. But the beauty is that you don't have to go in that 
 order. Lost in Time is made up of five different time-period hubs, which act as the staging area 
 for all the appropriate levels contained within. From the hub, you'll be able to visit the different 
 stages you've unlocked after collecting the appropriate amount of carrots or clocks. So if you're 
 having trouble with one stage, you should be able to simply move somewhere else to get the carrots 
 or clocks you need. Of course, to completely finish the game you'll have to visit every level and 
 get all the carrots and clocks, but having the option to choose your path through the game makes 
 doing so quite bearable.  

 It's too bad the graphics aren't really that great. Everything still looks rather choppy even in 
 3D-accelerated mode, and the frame rate suffers considerably on certain levels. When you position 
 Bugs close to things, you'll notice tons of polygonal overlap and breakup. And be prepared for 
 quite a bit of pop-up on the horizon. Fog conveniently hides unimportant things, such as the background 
 scenery, while important structures will simply show up in front of you. However, the graphics 
 that you do see all look decent, though rather simple.  

 All the characters in the game have unique voices, but all the voices sound somewhat off. However, 
 the voices are close enough to the real thing, and they're a nice touch. Lost in Time's music is 
 fairly bland but changes depending on which period you happen to be in. However, there's really 
 not a lot of variety in the sound, and you'll quickly tire of the few speech clips that continuously 
 play back at you, such as Merlin's debriefings or Bugs' reaction when he gets a clock. Also, there 
 were a few problems with the sound - sometimes sentences would get cut off, and a few times the 
 audio played too quickly, as though it were the Chipmunks instead of Bugs Bunny.  

 The control has some major problems as well. Namely, Bugs only moves on an eight-point axis. Hitting 
 a direction on your joypad or keyboard will make Bugs immediately move in the indicated direction, 
 which makes turning around and negotiating tight turns somewhat difficult. And while the default 
 joystick setup is fine, you can't reconfigure it. However, at least the game is forgiving enough 
 to eliminate the use of "lives" altogether. You'll just restart at the last save point whenever 
 you lose all your health.  

 Fortunately, Lost in Time stays interesting. Instead of just making you hop from one platform to 
 the next, Lost in Time does its best to stump you with puzzles and levers, and it even lets you 
 reenact several classic Bugs Bunny skits. This is truly a Looney Tunes game - you'll be dropping 
 anvils on Witch Hazel and dodging Marvin's Subspace Thermal Modulator. There are several cool deviations 
 from the standard "jump and find" fare of platform action games, such as a drawn-out chase scene 
 in which you drive cars, ride unicycles, and even straddle sheep in your attempt to escape.  

 
 Though Lost in Time is purely mediocre in presentation, at its heart lies a fun little platform 
 game that truly does justice to Bugs Bunny. If you're willing to put up with the game's flaws, 
 you'll be rewarded with unique gameplay and at least a good laugh.

Review:  Bugs Bunny Lost in Time is a 3D platformer based on the "Wascally Wabbit" Bugs Bunny , who finds 
 a time machine and gets lost in time. 
  
  You travel to different timezones like the stone age, the 30's, Planet X etc. You'll also meet 
 lovable characters like Elmer Fudd who appears as a caveman in the stone age, Daffy Duck as Robin 
 Hood in the medieval period, Yosemite Sam as Red Beard the pirate and so on.
  
  The comic relief makes a good change after all those FPSes and TPSes. Being a fan of platformer 
 games I'm happy with what this game offers. I'm sure you would like it too.
  
  Sure, the game has issues but it can be overlooked and enjoyed. Like for example, the camera. The 
 camera can make you feel dizzy if you're not used to it. There are also some clipping issues.
 
  
  Overall Bugs Bunny lost in Time is a cool and funny game. You can enjoy playing it.
  
  "Eh, what's up doc?" WABBIT STEW!
