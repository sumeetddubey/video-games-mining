:::Review:::
Disney's Meet the Robinsons is a fairly satisfying movie tie-in that borrows heavily from a number 
 of classic adventure and action games. 

  As video games go, Disney's Meet the Robinsons probably won't be mentioned very often in the same 
 breath with such games as Jak &amp; Daxter, The Legend of Zelda, or Tomb Raider. Nevertheless, 
 it borrows heavily from those and other classic games, with generally solid results. It also does 
 exactly what it's supposed to do, which is let players immerse themselves in the movie's futuristic 
 world. The game revolves around the character of Wilbur Robinson, who uses a time machine to travel 
 into the past and inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that alters the future. You'll 
 spend the majority of the game in that alternate future, using Wilbur's space-age gadgets to deal 
 with the robot enemies and puzzles contained within each massive environment. You won't be impressed 
 by the graphics, and the action will seem formulaic to you if you've been playing video games for 
 at least a few years. But through sheer variety and a mother lode of charm, the game ultimately 
 manages to be satisfying.  

          In the game, you use Wilbur's gadgets to solve puzzles and defeat enemies.     

  Structurally 
 speaking, Disney's Meet the Robinsons is an action adventure that borrows heavily from genre-defining 
 games (such as the aforementioned Zelda and Tomb Raider franchises) . There are eight main environments, 
 including the Robinson mansion in the year 2037, the science fair in the year 2007, and various 
 twisted renditions of places in an alternate 2037. Each environment has multiple floors and areas 
 that you have to get through, and each area has its own set of puzzles and enemies. Puzzles involve 
 a fair amount of jumping, climbing, and sidling your way around the environment, as well pushing 
 and pulling heavy objects. You'll also find yourself constantly using Wilbur's gadgets to manipulate 
 objects in the environment. While you're doing all of that, you'll frequently encounter enemy robots 
 that are programmed to attack Wilbur. Each enemy robot is vulnerable to a specific gadget. Some 
 robots require that you use one gadget to reveal a weak spot, then another gadget to finish off 
 the robot. Boss battles involve the same sort of gadget swapping, but they're more time consuming 
 and visually more elaborate.  

  In all, you'll collect five different gadgets. The two gadgets that come into play most frequently 
 are the disassembler ray, which can break apart certain doors and manhole covers, and the charge 
 glove, which hurls electrical balls that can obliterate certain enemies. The disassembler ray and 
 charge glove also have alternate uses. You can use the disassembler ray to reduce furniture and 
 other decorative objects into spare parts that can be fed into a transmogrifier machine to build 
 gadgets and upgrades. Meanwhile, the charge glove's electrical balls can activate distant switches 
 that provide temporary power to machines and elevated walkways. Rounding out the list of gadgets 
 are a scanner backpack that lets you scan enemies and structures to find weak spots to uncover 
 hidden areas; a pair of havoc gloves that let you launch sonic shockwaves and dive underground; 
 and a levitation ray that lets you lift enemies and heavy slabs into the air for short periods. 

  Minigames are thrown into the mix where you roll through obstacle courses in a protectosphere (think 
 Super Monkey Ball) , dig through underground mazes using the havoc gloves (think Dig Dug) , and play 
 a futuristic game of Pong against family members using the charge glove. These minigames are good 
 diversions, but they're not forced on you so often that they wear out their welcome. You can replay 
 them anytime you want. You're also free to hitch a ride on the monorail train and backtrack to 
 areas you've already solved. Even though the layout of each dungeonlike area is straightforward, 
 there are secret doors and chests hidden all over the place. Some secret areas can't be accessed 
 until you acquire the havoc gloves or the levitation ray. Chests contain concept artwork, viewable 
 action figures, and blueprints for building permanent health or energy upgrades using the transmogrifier, 
 which means that the rewards for returning to "earlier" areas are actually significant.  

  You don't need to know anything about the movie to understand what's going on in the game. You 
 play the part of Wilbur Robinson, a precocious teenager living with his family in a high-tech mansion. 
 Wilbur and the other major characters are introduced in short order, while various minor characters 
 make brief appearances throughout the course of the game. Incredibly, the game manages to present 
 a story that's similar to the one from the movie without actually giving away the movie's major 
 plot twists. In both the movie and the game, the mysterious Bowler Hat Guy steals the Robinsons' 
 time machine and goes back to 2007 to bring about an alternate future. In the movie, a boy named 
 Lewis is brought to the future, meets the Robinsons, and subsequently uses the time machine to 
 undo some of the changes that the Bowler Hat Guy caused. The game tells the other half of the story 
 and reveals what Wilbur was doing when he wasn't with Lewis. With the story put together in this 
 fashion, the game stays true to the movie's story without recycling every single scene exactly 
 as it was depicted in the movie. So, even if you have seen the movie, the game will still seem 
 fresh to you.  

  The game also does a great job of copying the movie's attitude and style, even though the graphics 
 don't push the hardware capabilities of any of the systems for which the game is available. On 
 the one hand, the characters and environments often look just like they did in the film; the bosses 
 are massive and the draw distance is such that you can see everything for miles in any direction. 
 Locations like the Robinsons' mansion and the Ant Hive are larger than life, exhibiting some outlandish 
 architecture. It's fun to watch furniture and chests shatter into multiple pieces after using the 
 disassembler ray on them. You'll even notice some snazzy use of cel-shading in the clouds and streams, 
 if you take a minute to observe them in motion. On the other hand, the quality of some visual details 
 tends to vary, which means that some locations look like they were taken right from the film, while 
 others look more like something taken out of a generic PlayStation 2 game. But more often than 
 not, the game resembles the movie, which is ultimately what matters.  

  As for the audio, the catchy guitar music and the realistic atmospheric noise help keep the player 
 immersed in Wilbur's world. However, what you'll probably remember most are all of the whimsical 
 dialogue exchanges featuring the voices of the same Hollywood actors who voiced the characters 
 in the movie. The nervous tone of comedian Harlan Williams makes him perfectly suited for the role 
 of Carl, the stressed-out robot that's constantly badgering Wilbur over the radio. Tom Selleck's 
 charming tone and gravely delivery totally sell his brief appearance as Wilbur's dad. And Adam 
 West, who is best known as TV's Batman, turns in a masterful performance in a pair of cameos as 
 Uncle Art, the galactic pizza-delivery driver.  

          Minigames, such as charge ball and protectosphere, Super Monkey Ball knockoffs, give you 
 something else to do besides exploring.     

  Like so many movie-based games these days, Disney's Meet the Robinsons is available for a multitude 
 of different systems. The versions available for the PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, and the Nintendo 
 GameCube and Wii consoles are all similar in terms of content. The Xbox 360 version lets you earn 
 1,000 achievement points for your gamerscore. It also flaunts an extra, self-contained bonus game 
 that involves blasting away at flying bowler hats from a first-person perspective using the security 
 turrets situated inside different rooms of the Robinson house. You won't feel much desire to play 
 it after you've collected the 200 achievement points associated with it, but it's a fun little 
 diversion nonetheless. The Wii version makes modest use of the controller's motion-sensing and 
 infrared-targeting capabilities. Mainly, you can use the infrared sensor on the Wii Remote to position 
 the camera and to aim your gadgets. You can also tilt the Nunchuck attachment to cycle between 
 targets when the lock-on cursor is activated. The waggle controls get the job done, but they're 
 not worth the extra $20 in price compared with, say, the GameCube version. In terms of visual quality, 
 the different versions of the game all look the same with regard to environmental detail, textures, 
 character models, and overall graphical complexity. However, the Xbox 360 and PC versions look 
 cleaner and sharper than the others because they render everything at higher resolutions. The gap 
 in quality isn't huge, but it's worth keeping in mind if you have your choice of systems to play 
 the game on and intend to pick up the game.  

  All things considered, Disney's Meet the Robinsons should satisfy anyone who has the urge to explore 
 the Robinsons' futuristic world. The game won't blow you away, but Wilbur's gadgets are fun to 
 use. There's also plenty to do between gathering blueprints, playing minigames, and getting through 
 the puzzles and bosses in the dungeonlike environments.

Review:  Meet the Robinsons is a game inspired by the same name's movie. While it bears no resemblace with 
 the plot at all, the way you solve puzzles and all the stuff you use to complete the game are well-thought 
 and very funny.
  
  The gameplay is not that simple, but it is not complex: it is as it should be. There are mastermind 
 environments to play into, which offer many puzzles to solve as Wibur, the youngest member of the 
 Robinsons family. To suceed, you must use some of the hundreds of gadgets you can chosse from. 
 However, sometimes the puzzles you have to solve and the enemies you face are too easy to get rid 
 of, and after a while it gets a bit boring.
  
  There are also some minigames you can play, wich are funny and interesting and they do be innovative, 
 but it is a pity that multiplayer mode is supported nowhere in the game.
  
  The visuals of the game are dissapointing and they are not as good as they could be. They carry 
 a few bugs and glitches, while the frame rate is unexplicably poor.
  
  But make no mistake. Meet the Robinsons is a funny good game, and you should have a try with it.

Review:  The Gamespot review for this game was well done and I agree with most of what it said. However 
 the reviewer underestimates the fun factor. This game is just plain fun. I did not expect much 
 from a game based on a movie, but was pleasantly surprised. The reason it succeeds is that it strikes 
 just the right balance in several ways.
  
  Firstly, the puzzles are just tough enough to keep you happy. While many are straight-forward, 
 a few will have you wondering. Thankfully if you give it enough thought and time, you can figure 
 them out without referencing a FAQ.
  
  The same goes for the mini-games and the battles. Some can be tough requiring numerous do-overs, 
 but not enough for you to lose interest or get frustrated.
  
  And lastly, for fans of the movie, the game gives you just enough of a within-the-movie feel without 
 repeating stuff. The story runs in parallel with the movie, and gives you a chance to see the world 
 from a different but consistent perspective.
  
  Since this game is now selling for a bargain price, there really is no excuse for passing this 
 up if you liked the movie and want a little fun.
