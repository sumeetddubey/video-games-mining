:::Review:::
Though Beam Breakers does provide a few visceral thrills, it's hard to recommend it to anyone other 
 than someone who is desperately hungry for some futuristic racing. 

 Of all the vivid and colorful imagery presented by French filmmaker Luc Besson in his flashy 1997 
 sci-fi film  The Fifth Element , one of the most memorable sequences involved a high-speed chase 
 through the futuristic skyways of New York City, where vertical space between towering skyscrapers 
 allowed for layers upon layers of hovering traffic. Drawing inspiration from this bit of cinema, 
 German developer Similis has created Beam Breakers, a mission-based futuristic racing game that's 
 occasionally intense but lacks the personality and polish of its source material.           Beam 
 Breakers draws inspiration from the sci-fi film  The Fifth Element .    

 Since the game isn't officially affiliated with the motion picture, you won't see Bruce Willis in 
 Beam Breakers. Instead, the game puts you in the shoes of an anonymous pizza delivery boy working 
 his way up through the ranks of a Neo York City crime family. Your boss starts you off with the 
 simple assignment of delivering a couple of pies, a task that gives you some room to become familiar 
 with the geography of the city and the controls of your futuristic ride.   

  Control of your flying car's forward and backward motion is mapped to the A and Z keys, and horizontal 
 and vertical movement are mapped to the arrow keys. Auxiliary controls are limited to the S key 
 for actions, such as firing off pizzas for delivery, and the space bar to tap your turbo boost. 
 If this default setup isn't to your liking, you can customize the key configurations or simply 
 use a joystick. Unfortunately, there's no support in Beam Breakers for in-game mouse control. In 
 general, the controls are a bit loose, but still fairly responsive, perhaps like what you might 
 expect from a hovercar. And you can get moving at a pretty respectable clip, especially with some 
 of the higher-end vehicles you'll earn later on in the game.   

  Once you've delivered enough pizzas to hungry Neo Yorkers, your boss will start giving you assignments 
 of greater import to the family, such as trashing a competing restaurant and stealing cars from 
 and defending territory against rival gangs, all the while avoiding police interference. The cops 
 of futuristic Neo York City are incredibly adamant about law enforcement, and once they make visual 
 contact with you, they'll quickly apprehend you unless you put yourself in the thick of the traffic 
 and jam on the turbo button. After about a half dozen of these subversive assignments, you'll go 
 through a series of checkpoint-based races in order to win newer and faster cars. These racing 
 levels are the most enjoyable, as the sensation of speed in Beam Breakers is at its best during 
 the races and the control scheme seems to favor constant forward motion over the stop-and-go pacing 
 of the objective-based missions. Once you reach the end of a stage, this cycle basically repeats 
 itself, and though the game has 57 total missions in the main story mode, the lack of variety in 
 the mission types becomes quickly apparent.   

  Aside from the mission-based story mode, Beam Breakers features three other modes of play. The 
 championship mode puts you through a series of 30 races against a pack of computer-controlled opponents. 
 The fierceness of the AI in the championship mode increases much more quickly than in the mission 
 mode, and you'll need to unlock some of the faster vehicles in the mission mode to stand a chance 
 here. Survival puts you in the middle of the city with a hostile police force gunning for you. 
 The objective is to simply keep from getting caught for as long as you can. Beam Breakers also 
 includes an online multiplayer race mode with support for up to six players, though the game lacks 
 any sort of in-game server browser.           The game's different areas don't look very distinctive. 
    

 The task of rendering a futuristic cityscape with layers upon layers of moving traffic is a daunting 
 one, and Beam Breakers isn't quite up to it. For starters, the traffic is neither as thick nor 
 as manic as it should be. The geometry of the city is adequate, though you'll regularly see some 
 questionable textures. The only really notable special effect in Beam Breakers is the translucent 
 guide that marks the path of the races, which is a nice touch. But the biggest mark against the 
 game's presentation is its distinct lack of personality. Each level is supposed to take place in 
 a particular district of Neo York City, such as Chinatown, Downtown, or Little Italy, but it all 
 just looks vaguely futuristic and nondescript.   

  The visual presentation of Beam Breakers may occasionally be a bit sterile, but the sound design 
 even worse -- to the point that it seems unfinished. Ambient city sound effects are rare, and there's 
 no music in the game, save for a few fleeting seconds' worth in between stages. The hum of your 
 hovercar and the few other ambient sounds that are present are passable, but the game's voice acting 
 is so awful that it almost negates any positive qualities. All the speech in the game, which is 
 limited to begin with, sounds as though it was recorded at a very low bit rate by people who don't 
 speak English very well. Of course, the limited amount of speech just means that you'll be hearing 
 the same few expletives over and over again. Fortunately, the game doesn't put much importance 
 on audio cues, and gives you the option to just turn off the in-game sound and throw in your own 
 music.   

  Beam Breakers starts off with a solid concept, but it doesn't quite deliver on it. Though the game 
 does provide a few visceral thrills, it's hard to recommend it to anyone other than someone who 
 is hungry enough for some futuristic racing to look past the game's mediocre production values.

Review:  This is a good game, dispite a bad rating. It bring the New York city high sky line, with new anti-gravity 
 technology, which has brought flying cars and busses ans so on. You get to race in gangs against 
 other gangs, with speed and aggression. Dillevering pizzas as quick as possible, for Tony. This game 
 is like the 5th element or similar to it in terma of the sky line and flying cars, this games brings 
 gaming to a slightly diffrent level in its own way. The graphics are good, but a bit slopy, its good 
 value for its money, sound is perfect or great really, at least its too mixed up or terrible sounnding 
 it goes with the game or gamesplay fine enoung. Racing around is a bit difficult, so you have to 
 be conncentrting and not running into other cars, so you can keep pace with the other cars, also 
 running aways from the cops. The amont of levels from my point of view are too much and it gets 
 hrder as you go up. But at least you get to choose you drivers and car you want wich is good. So 
 i wouldt 100% recomend it to anyone but its a good or decent game to play.
