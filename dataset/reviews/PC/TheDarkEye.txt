:::Review:::
The Dark Eye is without a doubt one of the most original computer games ever created. 

 The Dark Eye is without a doubt one of the most original computer games ever created. Missing are 
 all attempts to re-create interfaces or settings from earlier games, which, in the end, both harms 
 and benefits the overall game. In its attempt to redefine the computer entertainment experience, 
 The Dark Eye never adequately explains the on-screen action as it skips from one point of view 
 to another, and from story to story. This schizophrenic behavior begins in the introductory sequence, 
 an artfully constructed series of visual montages with a bizarre voice-over that is literally hard 
 to understand and continues throughout the game's winding story. In its own weird way, the sequence 
 sets the scene for your arrival at a mansion, The Dark Eye's launching pad into the numerous interactive 
 Poe stories housed within.  

 As you roam through the house, you are approached by a number of eerily animated stop-motion puppets 
 who address you and divulge information about people and situations that never seem to have significance 
 in the game. Little attempt is made to help you understand exactly who you are, how your character 
 relates to the others, or even what your final goal is. Through a series of stumblings and aimless 
 clickings, I found myself in the role of another character, in a different time and place, and 
 immediately encountered yet another set of confusing people, conversations and circumstances. The 
 skimpy manual supplied only a few clues to my goals in the game, and even fewer on how to attain 
 them.   

 Behind this chaotic content lie some of the most incredible graphics and artistic offerings I've 
 ever seen in this medium. The animated characters are painstakingly seamed into ornately dilapidated 
 3-D computer rendered environments, creating an effect that must be seen to be believed. Also included, 
 and just as beautiful, are graphic novel versions of Poe classics with grating readings by Mr. 
 Burroughs. If you have the patience to complete the trying steps required to reach these gems, 
 you'll be duly rewarded, but if you're the kind of person who doesn't enjoy or understand impressionist 
 films, then The Dark Eye isn't for you.

Review:  Like Poe, this game seems to evoke a response which is both forboding and haunting at the same 
 time. While it stays true to his work, the game seems to push you down a path of insanity without 
 making you gamble your life away with card games and drugs. The animation at the the time of release 
 may have been advant garde, but now it just seems like Yogi to today's animation in recent game 
 genres. Once you start the game, if you know the Tell Tale Heart you will be impressed with how 
 the game closely resembles the story. I would recommend reading Poe's masterpiece before going 
 on this long-strange-trip, but get it for the nostalgia!
