It took just a few hours for Pompeii to be destroyed. Unfortunately, that's also the approximate 
 length of time it'll take veteran adventure gamers to finish Timescape. 

 When Mt. Vesuvius erupted in A. D. 79, it took just a few hours for the adjacent city of Pompeii 
 to be destroyed. Unfortunately, that's also the approximate length of time it'll take veteran adventure 
 gamers to finish Timescape: Journey to Pompeii, one of the latest historically inspired games from 
 the dedicated adventure-game publisher Dreamcatcher Interactive.          Click for full size image 
    

  Timescape was originally published in Europe by Cryo Interactive, whose many adventure games often 
 lack an entirely coherent premise. Timescape is no exception. You play as Adrian Blake, presumably 
 an archaeologist "on a mission for the crown" at the end of World War I. While exploring a cave, 
 Adrian comes down with a fever and is approached by the goddess Ishtar, who offers to cure him 
 in exchange for his love. Adrian refuses because he insists he loves only his fiance Sophia, 
 and so Ishtar decides to punish him for not believing in "love incarnate." Consequently, the night 
 before Adrian's wedding back home, Sophia vanishes without a trace. Adrian returns to the cave 
 region in search of Sophia, but it turns out his beloved is much farther away than he can imagine; 
 she's been sent back in time to Pompeii and to the previous life she lived there. Ishtar sends 
 Adrian back to the same time and gives him three days to locate Sophia and convince her to leave 
 the city before the eruption occurs.           Click for full size image    

 One of the first things you discover as Adrian is an amulet, which can be used at any point during 
 play to access an extremely thorough encyclopedia. Here you'll find information on a myriad of 
 topics about Pompeii, from its foundation and history to family life, religion, prominent citizens 
 - even cooking, eroticism, and much more. None of the puzzles require you to dig through the encyclopedia 
 for clues or answers, but the reading is interesting enough that you'll probably want to return 
 to it even after you've completed the game.   

  Journey to Pompeii uses the same sort of first-person perspective and interface popularized by 
 Myst and employed in countless other adventure games: You move between different preset points 
 and can use the mouse to scan each of these scenes for clues and objects. The system works well 
 for the most part, but it has its shortcomings -- there are several points where you can overlook 
 a necessary object because you forgot to look down at your feet or didn't move your mouse cursor 
 over the exact hot spot. Exploration can be a little confusing at first because many streets have 
 a similar appearance, which forces you to check the map constantly, not only to verify your location 
 but also to ensure you're moving in the right direction.            Click for full size image 
    

 Because of the interface and the fact that Timescape was developed by Arxel Tribe -- the company that 
 created such nonsensical and poorly designed adventure games as Ring: The Legend of the Nibelungen -- you 
 might initially expect Timescape to contain a few ridiculous puzzles scattered throughout barren 
 environments. Fortunately, that's not the case at all: Timescape is definitely a traditional adventure 
 game, with an emphasis on collecting inventory items and figuring out where and how to use them 
 to overcome obstacles and to convince others to aid you in your quest. Though the streets of Pompeii 
 seem a little deserted for a city of 10,000 to 15,000 inhabitants, you do get a chance to meet 
 and interact with a decent number of characters. Conversation is handled via dialogue trees; most 
 of the time you can simply click through each available subject until you've gleaned all possible 
 information from a character, but other times your life depends on your choice of words. Death 
 can come quickly in those cases, but afterward you're usually told where you went wrong, and it 
 only takes a second or two to load a saved game.   

  While you'll appreciate the ability to interact with the denizens of Pompeii, you'll be greatly 
 disappointed at the lack of character animations. Timescape certainly isn't the first adventure 
 game to date in which the characters' mouths don't move when they speak; but what's more troubling 
 is that most of the characters don't move at all during dialogue sequences. These frozen characters 
 really detract from any sense of immersion the game manages to build up, especially when you juxtapose 
 the stock-still characters and the energetically thick British accents of many of the actors who 
 did the vocalizations.           Click for full size image    

 Of course, it probably isn't reasonable to expect cutting-edge graphics and animations in a budget-priced 
 game like Journey to Pompeii (it lists for $19.99 direct from Dreamcatcher) . What's harder to understand 
 is why the game is so short. It's not so much that the puzzles are too easy, though admittedly 
 only a few will prove truly challenging for experienced players (and two of those are timed) ; it's 
 that there simply aren't enough of them. Considering there are entire areas of the city that will 
 remain unexplored by the game's finale, it seems only reasonable that the developer could have 
 crammed a few more cardboard-cutout characters into those sections and given you a little more 
 to do and see.   

  Timescape: Journey to Pompeii won't go down as a major achievement in the annals of adventure gaming, 
 but then again it never really aspires to. What it does manage to do is keep you interested from 
 start to finish, and if you can overlook the decidedly spartan production values, then that's probably 
 enough to make it more than worth the asking price.
