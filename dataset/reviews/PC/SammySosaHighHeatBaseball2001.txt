:::Review:::
Though the latest version of High Heat suffers from a number of minor flaws once again, it's still 
 the early favorite to capture best-of-breed honors in PC baseball sims this year. 

 As another baseball season approaches, another impressive-but-flawed version of 3DO's High Heat 
 Baseball is upon us. Now sporting a big-time celebrity endorsement, Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 
 2001 is a very solid effort that improves upon last year's version with a series of subtle enhancements. 
 Though the latest version of High Heat suffers from a number of minor flaws once again, it's still 
 the early favorite to capture best-of-breed honors in PC baseball sims this year.  

 The game's basic design hasn't changed very much. You can still play exhibition games, full seasons 
 of varying length, play-off tournaments, and a home-run derby. A new batting practice mode lets 
 you step into the box for practice swings against a fully adjustable computer pitcher. For example, 
 if you're having trouble hitting a curve ball, you can set the pitcher to fire nothing but curves 
 while you try to make contact. Additional multiplayer options now let you tackle season and play-off 
 games against fellow High Heat fans, whereas last year's version only supported exhibition games 
 in multiplayer mode.  

 The graphics engine has been tweaked, but only slightly. The most notable improvement is in the 
 additional variety of player models. Now, big guys like Glenallen Hill and Frank Thomas actually 
 look much larger in the game than smaller players like Craig Biggio and Pokey Reese. Yet though 
 the visual variety is a welcome change, the overall quality of the player models is still less 
 than stunning. The players in High Heat 2001 don't look nearly as good as those in previous baseball 
 games like Triple Play 2000 and Microsoft Baseball 2000. Some players in High Heat 2001 have their 
 real faces mapped to their player models, but most of them still have that one same face, and the 
 same enormous eyebrows, from the original High Heat. At least High Heat 2001 now supports night 
 games as well as day games.  

 Fortunately, the game now offers a wealth of new player animations that help liven up the on-field 
 action. Players take extra steps as they make running catches, which introduces the concept of 
 momentum to the game. This can actually affect gameplay, as it now takes longer to throw the ball 
 after making a running catch, and players will even occasionally run into the outfield walls and 
 drop the ball as a result. Other new animations include players pumping their arms after roping 
 a double or triple, umpires who punch out strikeout victims in varied and elaborate fashion, and 
 diving fielders who hold up their gloves to show that they made the catch.  

 Of course, any true High Heat fan knows that graphical quality is a secondary concern. The thing 
 that's always set High Heat apart from its competitors is the realism of the on-field action, and 
 in this important regard, High Heat 2001 maintains the series' sterling reputation. Each individual 
 game played in High Heat 2001 unfolds realistically, as dramatic pitcher-batter confrontations 
 and crafty computer moves will leave you scrambling to find the right pinch hitter and bullpen 
 ace. Just when you think you've figured out the computer's style, it stumps you with a surprise 
 move. Getting caught flat-footed when Mark McGwire bunts for a suicide squeeze in the bottom of 
 the 11th inning should be enough to teach any player how sneaky the High Heat computer opponent 
 can be.  

 But the realism in High Heat 2001 goes beyond good artificial intelligence. For the most part, players 
 in the game perform as they would in real life, as they hit for power when appropriate and even 
 register accurate win-loss records on the mound. Better still, the realism generally carries over 
 to season statistics, where 50-homerun hitters and 20-game winners are as rare as they should be. 
 The game does seem to have a few glitches in the statistics engine, such as during a time when 
 Sammy Sosa himself played in 159 games despite a midseason injury that sidelined him for 34 contests, 
 but the errors seem few and far between. Other bugs and flaws in the game aren't quite as inconsequential. 
 For one thing, High Heat suffers from a serious bull-pen bug once again this year. The game has 
 problems when you try to perform a double switch; it sends your pitcher back to the bull pen, and 
 it also drops his "warmed up" rating to zero and leaves a hole in your lineup. Any attempt to put 
 the pitcher back in his rightful spot results in a crash. The bug doesn't crop up every time you 
 attempt a double switch, but it occurs more often than not.  

 In addition, the pitching interface seems downright unfair at times. While the computer pitchers 
 seem to be able to hit their corners regularly, it's almost ludicrously difficult for human players 
 to do so, even when controlling a pitcher with a control rating of 85 or higher. As a result, you 
 often throw a lot of balls when you try to throw strikes. In real life that may not be too unrealistic, 
 but the situation doesn't improve on the game's two easiest difficulty settings, and that's a problem. 
 Also, your pitchers have a nasty habit of throwing fat, juicy home-run balls right down the middle 
 of the plate when you attempt to throw garbage pitches outside or down. Many of these problems 
 seem to stem from the game's erratic or at least imprecise controls. Not only can the pitching 
 be frustrating, but often when fielding you'll find the ball winging its way to third when you 
 thought you threw it to second. This control problem cropped up with more than one player using 
 several different game controllers on multiple systems.  

 Furthermore, the sound in High Heat 2001 really needs an overhaul. The play-by-play vocal tracks 
 seem virtually unchanged since last year's version - and for that matter, since the first version 
 of High Heat. The commentary is lifeless, repetitive, and in desperate need of improvement. Still, 
 it sounds brilliant next to High Heat 2001's horrendous "ambience" clips. For some reason, the 
 developers saw fit to include a bunch of celebration/taunt sound bytes that erupt in a variety 
 of game situations. For example, after a strikeout a voice might chime in with a regretful "Aw, 
 man!" while a pop-up might elicit an unseen heckler to yell, "Your shoe's untied!" at the last 
 minute. All of these clips are poorly recorded and sound like the work of programmers who had too 
 little sleep and too much access to sound equipment. Worst of all, each of these clips plays at 
 a much higher volume than the rest of the game's sound effects, which makes them even more jarring 
 and annoying. The celebrations and taunts aren't necessarily a bad idea, but they should be much 
 more refined for future versions of High Heat.  

 Aside from its occasional flaws, High Heat 2001 is essentially an improved version of High Heat 
 2000. The latest version offers just enough new features and graphical enhancements to entice fans 
 of the series to upgrade. High Heat 2001 is at least as good as it was last year, and it will certainly 
 contend for the PC baseball crown once again this season.
