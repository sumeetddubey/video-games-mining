While it may not be the world champion of team-oriented multiplayer games, Clusterball is an unusual 
 and enjoyable addition to the genre. 

  Real. com is probably best known for its popular RealPlayer streaming media software, but the site 
 is also taking part in the burgeoning field of Web-based and downloadable games. In Clusterball, 
 one of the featured games, you pilot nimble futuristic ships through outdoor arenas, trying to 
 gather as many colored balls as quickly as possible from platforms dotting the landscape. As you 
 pick up balls, they dangle in a string from the back of your craft. After you've gathered a number 
 of them, you race back to a stadium filled with cheering spectators and zip through a round goal 
 to score. An arsenal of exotic "equipment" (nonlethal weapons) lets you bare your teeth while trying 
 to outscore opponents.           Clusterball may look like a shooter...    

  Each of the five arenas in which you compete has a distinct theme. One is set in the Nile Valley 
 and will have you swerving to avoid pyramids and the Sphinx. In another, you'll soar through narrow 
 "concrete canyons" of skyscrapers, weaving around bridges and navigating sharp turns. Each map 
 differs in visual style and gives a sense of scope through varied elevations. Unfortunately, the 
 differences between levels are sometimes more cosmetic than structural. A larger number of more 
 varied maps would have given the game greater replay value.   

  To help you navigate levels as smoothly as possible, you can tweak your flight model from "steady 
 as a rock" to "nimble but almost twitchy." Still, Clusterball isn't a flight simulation, and the 
 flight modeling will feel strange to anyone used to realistic flying games. Inertia is poorly modeled, 
 and ships can take an outrageous pounding before running out of "health."   

  Each level has equipment depots where you pick up clever devices that can affect your opponents' 
 ability to fly. For instance, the gravitator weighs their ships down, while another gadget reverses 
 their normal controls. Equipment respawns according to the game style you choose, and the same 
 holds true for the colored balls you have to pick up. While the game may initially look like a 
 shooter, you don't really engage in combat, but rather just try to interfere with your opponents 
 by employing your equipment. Most devices automatically target and track other fliers, so you only 
 have to pull the trigger. Nevertheless, it's fun to use the various devices to interfere with your 
 opponents.   

  These gadgets are also visually exciting. Swirls of smoke and vivid color flare between ships, 
 and when ships collide, they do so with a brilliant flash, leaving only a charred frame when the 
 dust settles. The levels are also nicely rendered. Colors are vibrant and shadows are deep, though 
 draw-in, pop-up, and grainy skies mar the scenes somewhat. In a clever nod to sporting-event realism 
 (and perhaps a concession to economics) , you'll rush past small signs with real corporate logos, 
 like Swatch and of course Real. com.   

  While the graphics are pleasing, the sounds are almost all muted and bland. It's also odd that 
 an announcer shouts things like "Play ball!" and "Strike!" as if the game has something to do with 
 baseball. Still, there are some decent touches like the sound of the wind in your ears as you pick 
 up speed and the cheers of the crowds in the stadiums.           ... but it plays more like a competitive 
 team sport.    

  Clusterball comes with an offline training mode, where you compete against computer-controlled 
 flyers. The artificial intelligence is adequate, but by the manual's admission, the game is really 
 designed for online play through an integrated server browser. Game modes include free-for-all 
 and team-based options for up to eight players. The basic goal and gameplay remain the same for 
 each mode, which forms Clusterball's big stumbling block: lack of variety and replay value. The 
 planned release of more arenas should help to some extent.   

  Clusterball's simple gameplay can be a lot of fun -- it takes skill to swoop down to the ball platforms 
 at the proper angle to avoid damaging your ship. The game also provides a real sense of speed and 
 energy as you race above the landscape, trying to beat your competitors. The gameplay dynamic is 
 interesting because you have to constantly weigh your options. Do you collect as many balls as 
 you can before you return to the goal, risking the loss of your catch to an opponent armed with 
 a ball-snatcher device? Do you go out of your way to hinder opponents with your equipment, or do 
 you try to avoid them while scoring as quickly as possible? This freedom keeps the ball in your 
 court and gives Clusterball its appeal. While it may not be the world champion of team-oriented 
 multiplayer games, Clusterball is an unusual and enjoyable addition to the genre.
