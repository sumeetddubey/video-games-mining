:::Review:::
It's so much better than any of the previous Microsoft Golf games that the only way you'd know it 
 had anything to do with the previous versions is from the name. 

 If there were an award for most improved game in a series, my vote for 1998 would go to Microsoft 
 Golf 1998 Edition. It's so much better than any of the previous Microsoft Golf games that the only 
 way you'd know it had anything to do with the previous versions is from the name.  

 How was Microsoft able to make such a quantum leap from the ho-hum Microsoft Golf 3.0 to this beauty? 
 The answer is simple: a new developer. All the earlier incarnations of MS Golf were created by 
 Access Software, and the stuff it did for Microsoft never came close to reaching the level of excellence 
 Access achieved with its own Links games. Perhaps there was some sort of contractual deal whereby 
 Access demanded that certain features of Links couldn't be incorporated in the MS Golf games; whatever 
 the reason, though, MS Golf's trailing-edge graphics and ho-hum gameplay meant it was always several 
 steps behind the Links games and Accolade's Jack Nicklaus line.  

 But with MS Golf 1998 Edition, Microsoft and new developer Friendly Software have changed the game 
 substantially. The biggest area of improvement is in the graphics department: The difference between 
 these visuals and the ones in MS Golf 3.0 is downright staggering. Friendly Software obviously 
 took its cue from the Links engine, and the results are impressive indeed - not quite as good as 
 what you'll find in the latest Links and Jack Nicklaus games, but pretty darn close.  

 One of the strong points is the interface, which has been designed so you can get to almost any 
 area of the game with only one or two mouse clicks. Want to change your swing type from two-click 
 to a mouse swing without exiting to a configuration screen? A nifty little menu bar at the bottom 
 of the screen lets you do that in seconds, as well as adjust game settings (flybys, commentary, 
 graphic detail) , change the height of your next shot, get statistics on your current round, and 
 more.  

 With a slew of options for customizing your player character, MS Golf 1998 makes it possible for 
 you to create a virtual version of yourself out on the course. Ten player models are included (though 
 you won't get access to all of them unless you do the full 418MB install) , and naturally you get 
 to pick the color of your shirt. But you also get to choose from three ball types, set your strength 
 in ten different categories (such as driver, fairway, woods, sand) , and set distances for each 
 club. It takes some time to plow through this stuff, but when you're through you should be able 
 to create a character that plays pretty close to your own real-life skill level.  

 Other nice features include the ability to alter pin placement (from moderate to hard, and there's 
 a randomizing feature) , four swing types (two-click, three-click, mouse swing, and sim, which lets 
 the computer do the actual mechanics of the stroke) , five game types (stroke, match, skins, scramble, 
 and bingo bango bongo) , and extremely smooth play over Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone (which 
 now supports Netscape Communicator - hooray!) . All in all, this is a very sweet package, and perhaps 
 most importantly the screen redraws are fairly fast (though not as quick as Links LS and Jack Nicklaus) . 

 MS Golf 1998 Edition does have some weak points, to be sure. There's no offline tournament, a feature 
 of Links LS that really gets competitive juices flowing. The commentary by CGS golf analyst David 
 Feherty isn't particularly humorous or helpful (you can turn it off, though) . But the biggest drawback 
 is that there are surprisingly few courses to play here. The game ships with only three full courses 
 - The Bay Harbor Golf Club, The Links at Casa de Campo in the Dominican Republic, and Teeth of 
 the Dog (also at Casa De Campo) - and one nine-hole course, The Preserve 9 at Bay Harbor. The courses 
 are beautiful, no doubt, with plenty of waterside vistas and lush wooded areas, but 63 holes at 
 two resorts is a letdown compared with the stunning lineup of championship courses available for 
 Links LS or all the user-created courses that are being passed around for Jack Nicklaus.  

 MS Golf 1998 hasn't quite caught up with the big boys just yet, but if the next edition shows as 
 much improvement as this one, it's only a matter of time before it seriously challenges Links LS 
 and Nicklaus. And if you're an MS Golf 3.0 owner who's a little leery about shelling out dough 
 for a golf sim when you've already got one, a $10 rebate should take some of the sting out of moving 
 up to the next level.
