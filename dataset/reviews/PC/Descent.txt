:::Review:::
No exploding body parts or fireball-vomiting demons here -- Descent puts an industrial spin on the 
 genre by taking you into the bowels of huge factory-like space stations to fight mining robots 
 gone mad. 

 Doom didn't just introduce the masses to a first-person, action 3-D shooter, it spawned a variety 
 of first-person clones. Some of these clones, like Dark Forces, were welcome additions to the genre. 
 Others were just more of the same. Only one 3-D shooter adds a whole new dimension to the field: 
 Descent. No exploding body parts or fireball-vomiting demons here -- Descent puts an industrial spin 
 on the genre by taking you into the bowels of huge factory-like space stations to fight mining 
 robots gone mad.  

 Consider this: in space, there is no up or down. Descent uses that concept to hit you like a 9G 
 turn with a labyrinth environment and free range of motion on the x-, y-, and z-axes. Nudge your 
 spaceship into a room, and watch outattacks can come from your left or right, from above 
 or below you. You'll spin your ship around while firing missiles and lasers until vertigo isn't 
 just an Alfred Hitchcock movie, but a way of life. Surrounded by this chaos you must rescue scattered 
 human hostages and gather powerups while trying to keep your firepower and shields at their max. 
 A 3-D rotating map is available for those who can't handle the bewildering turns of each level. 

 With addictive action, network multi-player play and Descent level editors available everywhere 
 you turn, I say without hyperbole that Descent is destined to be a classic. Don't believe me? Download 
 the widely available free demos (while you're at it, check out Descent II as well) and judge for 
 yourself. Just remember to keep your airsickness bag handy.

Review:  Back in 1995, Descent was the game that spawned the genre of Six Degrees of Freedom games, games 
 that enabled the user to fly on all three axis rather than planting the user on the ground, forcing 
 the user to utilize two axis and only occasionally the third. The genre has not been taken advantage 
 of, as the only other game to utilize all three axis was Forsaken, another commercial flop. However, 
 Descent, though not a commercial success, was, and is, a superb game.
  
  Descent puts you in a small ship called the Pyro GX. You play as a mercenary hired by the Post 
 Terran Minerals Corporation, a megacorporation, to destroy mines infected by a computer virus which 
 turned the robots there into deadily killing machines. The story contains zero twists throughout, 
 but then again, Doom never really had a story, either. Descent, however, offers small explanations 
 of every mine you are about to enter, as well as every robot, which is a little bit of something.
 
  
  What Descent lacks in story, however, it makes up for in its offering of compelling gameplay in 
 both its singleplayer and multiplayer modes.
  
  The singleplayer game is excellent. Except for the first level, the mines you are thrown in are 
 filled with deep, dark areas, as well as countless robots. The game also has a good sense of balance, 
 as though you will battle hordes of robots in every level, you are also given just the right amount 
 of powerups, and though a very small number of the powerups don't feel like they remain tactically 
 useful throughout the game, they actually do. To top it off, every robot you destroy offers a satisfying 
 explosion. :)
  
  The multiplayer also offers a great amount of moments, though it's best with eight players. There 
 is a substantial amount of variety in the multiplayer modes, all of which are fun. The only problem 
 is, nobody plays it anymore.
  
  Graphically, the game looked great for its time. Descent was one of the first games to offer both 
 3 dimensional levels and objects. And though the texturing doesn't live up to today's standards, 
 and is occasionally unaligned, the robots, powerups, and levels look great.
  
  The game offers some very memorable sound effects and music. Though the music is MIDI, it still 
 sounds impressive and in-line with each level.
  
  Finally, with so many levels and easy to use level editors available, the game's replay value is 
 infinite.
  
  To sum it up, Descent is a game you just have to play before you die. Though it may not work on 
 a modern computer, you can easily download a port such as D1X or D1X-Rebirth to make it work. If 
 you didn't play it back then, download an abandonware version or buy it off of eBay and play it 
 now. You won't be disappointed.

Review:  The Descent series was my first experience as a gamer so I have some bias towards the title. Even 
 still I can to this day remember 8 years ago when at my school the Typing teacher installed Descent 
 on all the computers and we would have Descent Frag Fest Lunch Hours. It was truly beautiful. This 
 game has yet to be matched for game-play or innovation. Truly a feat in itself as the game doesn't 
 even work on computers now-a-days.
  The single player is great and the multiplayer contests even Halo for me. I would buy a remake 
 of this game in a heart beat and without a question asked. I'm still waiting for for the rights 
 to get away from Interplay and for that next gen Descent to hit the shelves.

Review:  Descent was the first fully three-dimensional, 360 degree space shooter available for PC. You were 
 a mercenary pilot hired by a mining corporation to destroy robots that went berserk due to a virus. 
 The game took you through mining tunnels in nearly 30 various moons throughout the solar system 
 . You had access to a variety of energy weapons and missile systems scattered throughout the levels.
 
  
  The game was developed by Parallax in 1995 and bridged the gap between Doom and Quake. The unique 
 aspect of the game was the ability to move in three planes along x, y, and z axis. The artificial 
 intelligence of the bots was also top-notch at the time. Bots waited to the side of doors, dodge 
 fire, strafe, and follow intelligently.
  
  Descent is really a completely different game in the single-player and multiplayer. In the single 
 player game, you fly through the mine rescuing trapped workers throughout the maze of tunnels, 
 destroying robots and picking up powerups. You find a number of keys in each level to gain access 
 to a reactor that you (naturally) must destroy. After the reactor is destroyed you need to fly 
 out of the mine within a certain period of time, kind of like the Death Star. Any robots you neglected 
 to destroy will impede your escape. Multiplayer was a step above Doom. For the first time players 
 were able to join multiplayer games already in progress. Unique to Descent was the weapons treatment. 
 Weapons did not respawn. Instead, you had to destroy the other players to take over their arsenal. 
 Depending on your point of view, this was either really cool or really frustrating.
  
  Graphics: The game is presented in full 3D via a software rendered, as dedicated graphics cards 
 were few and far between at the time. There were 256 colors and the maximum resolution was 320x200. 
 At the time, it was pretty good considering everything from the environment to enemies were in 
 3D.
  
  Sound: The sound was good, supporting Sound Blaster's new 16-bit cards (wow!) . Lasers and missile 
 make sufficiently satisfying sounds, engines sound appropriate, and the ambience is good. Today 
 everything would be in surround sound, but that was not yet possible.
  
  Gameplay: Both the single-player and multiplayer aspects of Descent are highly replayable. Personally, 
 I found the long, dead tunnels of robots less appealing than taking out zombies or enemy soldiers, 
 but this is personal preference. Playing with a mouse is a handicap, but the game can still be 
 fun with proper keyboard controls. I spent hours lost in its labyrinthine levels, and enjoyed every 
 minute. Except when I exploded.
  
  If you have an older PC, are feeling nostalgic, or just want to play a great old-school flight 
 sim, check out the Descent series.
