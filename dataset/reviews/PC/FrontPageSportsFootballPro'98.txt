:::Review:::
Given how long Sierra's been refining this series, you'd expect the '98 editionto be the best ever. 
 

 It's more than a little ironic that Sierra On-Line chose Dan Marino over Barry Sanders to appear 
 on the box for the latest edition in its Front Page Sports: Football Pro series. Think about it: 
 Sanders, the man who graced the box of the two previous Football Pro games, had his greatest season 
 ever this year. On the other hand, Marino, for whatever reasons you choose to believe, had the 
 most mediocre campaign of his career.  

 And so it goes with FPS: Football Pro '98. Given how long Sierra's been refining this series, you'd 
 expect the '98 edition to be the best ever - yes, this year's Barry Sanders of football games. 
 Instead, in a case of life imitating endorsements, FPS: FP '98 turns in a Marino-like performance: 
 There are definitely some high points, but not as many as you'd expect from a seasoned veteran. 
   

 Why does FPS: FP '98 improve so little on its predecessor? There's no way of knowing for sure, but 
 if you consider the state in which the game was shipped it's hard to avoid the conclusion that 
 it's because it was pushed out the door before it was ready. In the few weeks since FPS: FP '98 
 started shipping, three patches have already appeared (Sierra's officially supporting only one 
 as of this writing) . The problems in the shipping version addressed by these patches are numerous 
 and vexing - but what's even more troubling is how some of these managed to get past the QA department 
 in the first place. There's some pretty obvious stuff here: a mix-up in the second-half kickoff 
 if the coin-toss winner chooses to kick, game crashes with certain camera angles, and even turf 
 instead of grass at Jack Kent Cooke stadium. Out of curiosity, I started counting the number of 
 problems that were addressed in the 1.04f patch (the version I wound up playing) , but after I'd 
 reached three dozen I didn't feel like going any further.  

 Of course, every PC game will have a few bugs, and the FPS: FP '98 development team deserves credit 
 for working hard on these patches. But FPS: FP '98 falls short of expectations in other categories, 
 too. The absences of a built-in player ratings editor and new team-specific playbooks come immediately 
 to mind. It's true the latter was fixed with the second patch (a beta version, not officially supported 
 by Sierra) after the game shipped, but Sierra seems to have taken a cavalier attitude toward the 
 player ratings editor issue - the explanation on its web site goes something along the lines of: 
 "Ours wasn't ready, and besides, there's a shareware tool on the game CD that does almost the same 
 things." What the explanation doesn't say is that Sierra doesn't support any of the shareware programs 
 that come with the game, which means you'll have to deal with a third party for answers to any 
 problems you might encounter using it. (Sierra is working on a player ratings editor for FPS: FP 
 '98 but hasn't indicated when it'll be ready.)  

 So if the player ratings editor is gone from FPS: FP '98, what's new in the game? The biggest enhancement 
 is global: The interface has been totally revamped, and the good news is that it's much easier 
 to use than before. Instead of forcing you to clunk through a "quick start setup" just to play 
 an exhibition game, for example, FPS: FP '98 now takes you immediately to team selection and setup 
 screens for every outing. Team and league menus are modular, with buttons always present for every 
 function - you can skip from the league schedule screen to your team's front office menu with just 
 a couple of mouse clicks.  

 Beyond that, though, little has changed. Naturally, FPS: FP '98 has new rosters (now with player 
 photos) and new logos (Bus and Broncos) . But many of the other new features - arcade play over 
 the Internet, a full-screen mode, better chat interface, information on whether your opponent's 
 running a special teams or regular play, audio play-by-play (it's boring) , more camera angles, 
 the inclusion of non-NFL stadiums and cities, more precise weather information, and others - are 
 either things that should be expected in a top-rate football sim or are of little importance when 
 it comes to actual gameplay. In short, nearly all the things that made the Football Pro games so 
 compelling - impressive simulation results, a robust play editor, incredibly detailed coaching 
 profiles, and the ability to guide a team over consecutive seasons by utilizing the draft, free 
 agency, and trades - can be found in the '98 edition.   

 Retaining the good parts of a previous game doesn't exactly deserve a standing ovation, though. 
 What would earn my applause is if Sierra had spent more time improving what historically has been 
 the weakest part of the Football Pro games: the action mode. Sadly, that hasn't happened. To my 
 amazement, FPS: FP '98 still supports only two gamepad/joystick buttons - Madden NFL '98 supports 
 four and ABC Monday Night Football '98 supports eight. That might not sound like much, but the 
 truth is that four- or eight-button support makes the passing game much easier to handle, allowing 
 you to concentrate on play-calling and execution rather than trying to figure out if you've selected 
 the right receiver. And extra buttons mean greater control over ball carriers and receivers; in 
 FPS: FP '98, about all you can do is jump up and dive ahead.  

 And that's not the only facet of the action game that's been passed over for improvement. The graphics 
 in FPS: FP '98 don't look any better to me than the ones from the '97 edition - or even '96, for 
 that matter. Active players are still identified by a huge number hovering over them, instead of 
 a subtle circle or star at the players' feet. The tackle animations we've seen for years are still 
 here, slightly smoother but essentially unchanged. In fact, all the player animations remain pretty 
 much the same as they've looked for the past couple of years, which wasn't very good to begin with 
 - this despite the addition of an option to view the players from 16 different angles. Though you're 
 treated to artwork for all 30 NFL stadiums, it doesn't make up for the flat, untextured field graphics 
 (I once played on a grass field and mistook it for turf) .  

 One area of FPS: FP '98 that Sierra did improve upon was Internet play. Besides the aforementioned 
 chat and arcade-play enhancements, the game now recognizes that two leagues can be identical even 
 though they have different names. With FPS: FP '98 Leagues popping up as more people buy the game, 
 it's becoming much easier to find opponents - just make sure you're using the same version of the 
 game and the same league files (unless you don't care if someone's loaded his team with all-stars, 
 of course) . And while Sierra doesn't support all the shareware utilities that come with the game, 
 their inclusion is still welcome. Particularly useful is the schedule maker. It gives you the ability 
 to re-create the 1997 NFL schedule for a custom league, something Madden NFL '98 lacks.  

 Once Sierra releases the definitive patch for FPS: FP '98, then, about the best you can say for 
 FPS: FP '98 is that it'll be somewhat better than the '97 edition and will cost less ($29.95 with 
 a $5 rebate for FPS: FP '97 owners) . For gamers who revel in the challenges of play design, draft 
 and trade decisions, game plans, and even practice-camp priorities, FPS: FP '98 is still the only 
 game in town. Whether or not a slightly improved version of "the only game in town" is worth $25 
 or $30, though, is up to you.
