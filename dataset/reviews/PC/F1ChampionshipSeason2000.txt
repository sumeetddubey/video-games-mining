:::Review:::
It enhances a number of the original game's features, adds a handful of new ones, and, ultimately, 
 it will undoubtedly please racing enthusiasts and interested beginners alike. 

 Seven months after its release, EA Sports' F1 2000 remains one of the most detailed and visually 
 spectacular Formula One racing games available for the PC. Interestingly enough, it was also the 
 only F1 PC game to be released in 2000 to feature teams, drivers, and all 17 circuits from that 
 same year. All told, F1 2000 had only a few minor problems, most of which were easily overlooked 
 by die-hard Formula One fans. Regardless, EA Sports quickly went back to the drawing board to address 
 some of the game's issues, and the end result is F1 Championship Season 2000. It's a stand-alone 
 follow-up to F1 2000 that enhances a number of the original game's features, adds a handful of 
 new ones, and, ultimately, it will undoubtedly please racing enthusiasts and interested beginners 
 alike.   

  Even though F1 2000 prides itself on being the first Formula One game to feature the tracks and 
 teams of the 2000 FIA season, the game was released in March of this year, when the race season 
 hadn't even reached the halfway mark. Therefore, there were some variables - like the starting 
 grids for each race - that were impossible for the developers to account for. Perhaps the most 
 glaring of these problems was Monza's first chicane, which was revised by track officials and FIA 
 representatives hours before the actual race. This discrepancy is fixed in F1 Championship Season 
 2000, and a number of other tracks, such as Indianapolis and Spa-Francorchamps, received minor 
 facelifts and tweaking so that they would accurately reflect their real-world counterparts from 
 the 2000 season. Other season-sensitive changes even include the helmet styles for all 22 drivers, 
 as well as running commentary from ITV's Jim Rosenthal. Your pit chief now gives you constant feedback 
 on your car's performance and warns you of trackside situations, such as accidents and spinouts. 
 You can even choose the amount of dialogue that you wish to be subjected to, and you aren't just 
 given the choice between turning speech completely on and completely off. The computer-controlled 
 drivers' behaviors have also been revised to mimic their respective performance during the season, 
 and the drivers will no longer rear-end you as you go into the first turn. At times, it seemed 
 as if F1 2000 played more like bumper cars than a Formula One game, so the more realistic and conservative 
 driver behavior in F1 Championship Season 2000 is certainly a step in the right direction.   

 
  In addition to enhancing many aspects of F1 2000, F1 Championship Season 2000 introduces some 
 new features. The most notable of these is the new driving school mode, which puts you in the driver's 
 seat of the unique Arrows two-man F1 trainer. Designed to introduce novice drivers to the intricacies 
 of F1 racing, this mode uses five visual aids and a variety of audio cues from an instructor to 
 guide you through various driving dynamics such as braking, accelerating off the grid, cornering, 
 and following the optimal racing line. Even seasoned veterans will find this mode useful since 
 it has lessons for every turn and every notable straightaway for all 17 of the tracks in the 2000 
 season. Depending on your performance in each lesson, you're awarded a bronze, silver, or gold 
 star - you might even be asked to retake the lesson altogether if you fail to impress the instructor. 
    

 The addition of varying weather conditions is another welcome change, and one which vocal racing 
 fans were disappointed not to find in F1 2000. Before any race, you can choose between dry, overcast, 
 wet, or random conditions. In rainy weather, each car's reflection is clearly visible off the rain-soaked 
 asphalt, and you can see beautiful "rooster tails" trailing the cars as they blast down straightaways. 
 There's even the ability to choose the same conditions of the actual practice, qualifying, and 
 race sessions from each race weekend of the 2000 season. Unfortunately, the weather effects aren't 
 dynamic, so it isn't possible to mimic the effects at Gilles Villeneuve (for example) , where conditions 
 are dry at the beginning of the race but are at a steady downpour by the end.   

  The audio in the game has also been enhanced. The sound effects are quite better than those in 
 F1 2000 - the cars' engines will smoothly go from a deep and hollow rumble when they're idling 
 to a high-pitched scream at 14,000rpm. Downshifts in the game make the same jarring crunch that's 
 emitted by the real cars when they decelerate. Additionally, the bands Fear Factory and Headrillaz 
 have provided new techno and industrial music for the opening movie and the menu interface. The 
 graphics have also been improved, albeit only slightly. From the first-person perspective, the 
 only notable difference is a thicker steering wheel, which now has a more defined carbon fiber 
 look. Externally, each team's cars look completely unique, a feature that Formula One fans will 
 really enjoy. Ferrari fans will immediately notice their car's distinct high-mounted nose, while 
 McLaren enthusiasts will appreciate their car's muscular look and sharp lines. Even the wooden 
 plank mounted underneath each car's belly is clearly visible (although the only time you'll get 
 a good look at it is after a horrific accident) .   

  There are still some residual problems from F1 2000 that aren't addressed in F1 Championship Season 
 2000. Namely, the game still lacks an online player matching service, and its arcane multiplayer 
 feature requires you to know the IP address of the host computer you wish to connect to. Furthermore, 
 the game still demands a lot of system resources, so while its system requirements may seem low, 
 you'll need a Pentium III and a high-end video card if you want to play it at a halfway decent 
 frame rate. This is especially true when you race in the new wet-weather conditions, when the reflections 
 off the pavement can bog down even the fastest of gaming rigs.   

  Despite these problems, the game is clearly an improvement upon an already great Formula One game. 
 Since the 2000 F1 season ended a few months before its release, F1 Championship Season 2000 is 
 currently the only game that accurately delivers a complete racing experience for the 2000 season, 
 and it's one that no F1 fan should be without.

Review:  Beyond the training, the other most noticeable change from F1 2000 is the inclusion of full wet 
 weather racing and advanced environmental effects. While F1 2000 always had you racing in sunny 
 conditions with full visibility, in F1 Championship Season 2000 you can choose to experience dry, 
 overcast or wet conditions, or even not make the choice and subject yourself to a random weather 
 condition. These weather effects are quite convincing and really change the way you race, rather 
 than just being visual eye candy. However, this climatic improvement still cannot compare to the 
 implementation in Grand Prix 3, where the weather varies both across parts of the track and over 
 time
