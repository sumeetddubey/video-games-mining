Devo has gone digital and the result is utterly devastating. 

 Devo has gone digital and the result is utterly devastating. Despite the fact that in the 80's this 
 New Wave band managed to instill in our collective consciousness the uncomplicated lyrics of their 
 ditty "Whip it," Devo has never been what you would call mainstream. Which isn't to say that Devo 
 is good, bad, or ugly, but merely that they, like all things riding off the beaten path, are at 
 once palatable to a few (and here those few usually insert the word "select") individuals who, 
 despite - or in defiance of - the sour, turned-away expressions worn by the masses, gobble this 
 stuff up wholeheartedly. Nevertheless, it is hard to believe that even the hungriest of Devo fans 
 will dig the band's noisome new CD-ROM release, Devo Presents Adventures of the Smart Patrol.  
 

 The game is hardly a game at all, but rather a haphazardly stuck-together collection of sounds, 
 pictures, crude animations, and slipshod segues in want of a working plot, pointless or otherwise. 
 The premise, in a nutshell: Future mayhem,  puzzles to solve, 
 save the world. These elements comprise the goods that all great adventure games are made of; however, 
 in Devo's case any sense of normality, of practical interface and order from an adventure gamer's 
 point of view, is flushed down the toilet. Which is ultimately where the game's endless stream 
 of scatological humor belongs. And these smart-less stink bombs are not merely of the  
 sitcom/zany-buddy-film variety, either. Sinking to an absolute low, players in Devo's stomach-upsetting 
 world must in one scene endure a painfully carried-out act of inanity that involves spoonfuls of 
 creamy chocolate pudding - a once-wholesome foodstuff that, after watching Devo's force-feeding 
 of, players will likely never look at in the same way or have an appetite for again.  

 All of this wasted effort aside, there are numerous dispassionate reasons to discount Devo's Adventures 
 as well. Take the game's skewed internal clock. In each of the game's half dozen locales, players 
 have 12 "hours" to figure out what is going on, what has gone wrong, and how to correct it in order 
 to move along. While captivating adventure games encourage exploration, wandering, and experimentation, 
 Devo's Smart Patrol follows a strictly unforgiving path that once deviated from is impossible to 
 get back on track with without starting over where you last left off (assuming, of course, that 
 you saved your game) . Hours are not really hours, but are made up of an indeterminate number of 
 ticks, for each move or mouse click you make. In no time a double-edged feeling of helpless anxiety 
 sets in, this fear of making the wrong move, taking the wrong step; at the same time you start 
 to wonder and worry if maybe you just aren't cool enough to get what's going on (for the game constantly 
 reminds you how cool you are on account of your hanging with the Smart Patrol) .  

 This is fun? This is cool? These out-of-lip-sync diatribes are somehow worth the time to listen 
 to, to even try to care about? To what end? It's impossible to say, since reaching the end is mercilessly 
 impossible. To think of the trees felled for this game's packaging, the miles of videotape run 
 through, lines of dialog written and hopelessly rewritten, code keyed in and compiled and recompiled, 
 marketing hype worked up and spun out, and raw energy wasted in producing the however many thousands 
 of CDs Inscape agreed to permanently burn this trash into, one can only walk away feeling pity 
 for all of the resources, human or otherwise, that were inexorably drawn into the band's distressing 
 foray into computer gaming. For better or worse, we still have the lyrics to "Whip it" to conjure 
 up a Devo that so many years ago managed to ingratiate themselves into our hearts and minds, those 
 crazy days of summer. Sadly, those lyrics have new meaning now, prescribing in the band's own words 
 the punishment they deserve for getting themselves, and unsuspecting buyers, caught up in this 
 awful mess.
