Allow me to make one crucial point: NASCAR 2 is not a toy. 

 Before I begin reviewing Sierra's NASCAR 2, allow me to make one crucial point: NASCAR 2 is not 
 a toy. I thought I was fairly adept at your average brake-accelerate PC racer, but NASCAR draws 
 a thin line between exhilarating action-racing and strategic planning. This is a game where every 
 track must be considered individually when tweaking the design of your car, where you need to know 
 where and when to pit, all while staying aware of your competition's position on the road. After 
 a few hours of roaring around the oval, taking cues from your spotter through a headset (let's 
 assume you're wearing headphones during your game) it becomes startlingly clear: NASCAR 2 is so 
 realistic, it's scary.  

 First of all, NASCAR 2's graphics are top-notch. Sierra has improved on the frame rate of the first 
 game, making for fluid car animation, and realistic body damage. Simply put, this is as close as 
 most of us are going to come to participating in an actual televised race. As an added bonus, Sierra 
 has included a paintshop-style program where you're given the opportunity to customize the artwork 
 of any car on the track. Slap your dog's name on the hood, a smiley face on the bumper. The association 
 doesn't care: In NASCAR 2 the car is your canvas.  

 I don't mean this wholly in an artistic sense. Half the fun of NASCAR 2 is making the ever-so-slight 
 adjustments to your vehicle's tire pressure, foil height, camber, and gear ratios to achieve optimal 
 performance for a particular track. Experienced racers - whether they're the real McCoy or just 
 veteran desktop competitors - will know what all these arcane terms mean from the start. However, 
 before hitting the first NASCAR track, most of us are going to need an quick learner's course. 
 An easy to understand  diagram made it all clear, and in 
 no time at all I began to experiment until I felt I had a firm grasp on exactly what I could tweak 
 to make my V-8 the finest machine on the track.  

 The AI in the game is pretty incredible. When you accidentally blindside another vehicle (or even 
 on purpose, if you don't believe in good sportsmanship) , the other cars realistically slow down 
 or cautiously slide out to avoid a collision. It's funny, but although NASCAR 2 doesn't purport 
 itself as being the kind of body-casualty ride that Psygnosis' Destruction Derby 2 is (with its 
 incredibly realistic incremental car damage - fenders mashing in, hoods flying off, wheels tearing 
 from their axles, bouncing down the track, requiring a tow into the pit-stop) , it certainly rivals 
 that game damage-wise. . If you collide with another vehicle because you performed an action contradictory 
 to your spotter's directions, he'll remind you of your ineptitude with a reprimanding "What kind 
 of bone-headed move was that!" And at that point, you're probably so absorbed in the race that 
 you'll want to go back and apologize to him personally.  

 That's the kind of complete immersion NASCAR 2 offers. It's a completely professional game, both 
 in its execution and in its dedication to the NASCAR tradition. In fact, it's so that Sierra and 
 NASCAR have teamed up to bring the game to TEN (the online Total Entertainment Network) to allow 
 players to compete and achieve "official" NASCAR standings in an Internet roster. Now how cool 
 is that? People who played and worshipped the original NASCAR already own this game. I'm writing 
 this review largely for gamers out there who are intimidated by realistic sims. Games like Grand 
 Prix 2 and now NASCAR 2 have converted me: I can now rest my rocket-launcher temporarily to carry 
 on some in-depth racing.

Review:  This game is one of the greatest racing sims of all time. With difficulty enough to send you running 
 home to your mommy, fantastic sounds to delight your ears, and decent visual effects, this is one 
 of the best Nascar games of the decade, coming close to even Nascar Racing 2003 Season.
  
  It takes quite a while to start getting good results in this game, or to even feel comfortable 
 racing in it, but it is easy to have fun with, even if you're in last. The vidual can be a bit.... bad, 
 especially when someone rear-ends you and they take off the back of the car. And right there is 
 a huge block. It's like a shadow of the actual car.
  
  
  The sound effects aren't stunning or anything, but they meet the need. It's hard to explain how 
 you are just kind of sucked into the game, even when you're running 5 laps down at Bristol. 
  
  The AI is just right. The occasional spins, and then occasional stack-ups. The funny thing 
 is, even if the AI has a straight away to avoid the wreck, they just slow down a little, and go 
 plowing through there.
  
  Nascar Racing 2 will entertain for years to come.

Review:  NASCAR Racing 2 may not be a videogame packed with a lot of action and excitement, but it can be 
 truly immersive.
  While playing NASCAR Racing 2 you have to play as the driver, but also as the crew chief, and do 
 it in an entire racing weekend. from the practice to the final race. As you get into the track 
 and drive, you have to control almost every single technical aspect of the car, like water and 
 oil pressure, tire temperature, and so on. That while you drive taking care of traffic, the ammount 
 of fuel and not burning out the tires, just like any pilot on the real NASCAR races. That certainly 
 is not easy to learn, but after you get all the concept, the game can be really addictive.
  Before racing you can choose between running a single racing weekend or doing an entire championship. 
 After choosing that you have to setup the car. You can practice freely and make adjustments to 
 the car while on practice or warmup, you can also save those setups to use them later on the qualifying 
 or in the sunday race.
  NASCAR Racing also offers an almost unlimited possibilities to customize the player team, from 
 the car paint scheme, the color of the uniforms of the crew, even the driver photo. That adds a 
 lot of fun to the game.
  The tracks include almost every event on the 2006 winston cup calendar, except for the daytona 
 500. These tracks are very well designed and correspond to every detail to the real ones.
  This is a very well designed racing simulator that covers every aspect of the racing in an excellent 
 way, but be warned, it is very addictive.
