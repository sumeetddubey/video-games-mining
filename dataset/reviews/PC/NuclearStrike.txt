:::Review:::
Nuclear Strike is the PC port of the extremely successful console Strike series, and a brilliant 
 port it is. 

 It seems that in every medium, be it movies, videos, or computer games, people moan about a lack 
 of a compelling story in action titles, which makes about as much sense as complaining about the 
 lack of a nailgun in a football sim. Quit your griping about Starship Troopers, Con-Air, or Spawn; 
 these are called action movies for a reason, people, and as such they deliver all the things that 
 make action great: million-dollar pyrotechnics and ultraviolence. People couldn't care less if 
 the story was written by Steinbeck or Stymy the Hack, as long as they get to see THX-rattling fireballs 
 and bad guys bleeding from every orifice.   

 Similar sentiments can be echoed about computer games. Action lovers still want to revel in wanton 
 destruction with little regard for morality, all in super-duper VGA (come on, how much ink has 
 been spilled detailing Unreal's killer plotline?) . This isn't to say that a computer game should 
 be entirely devoid of motivational plot elements. But for all the talk about "the stories" in Daikatana, 
 Half-Life, and SiN, I'm happy to say that the much-maligned action-heavy, plot-light genre has 
 received a solid kick in the pants from the wonderfully fun Nuclear Strike. You want earth-quaking 
 explosions? It's in there. You want the ability to mow down defenseless enemies with your helicopter-mounted 
 machine guns? It's in there.  

 Nuclear Strike is the PC port of the extremely successful console Strike series, and a brilliant 
 port it is. You're an elite commando who can pilot just about any piece of military equipment thrown 
 your way, and you're heading up the task of stopping those ubiquitous nuclear-armed terrorists 
 before they can do their bad-guy thing.  

 The graphics are about as good as it gets. From your isometric point of view you start out in a 
 Super Apache, mowing down tanks, enemy hideouts, and the lone rocket launcher-toting extremist 
 with your customizable arsenal. While it looks decent without hardware acceleration, with a 3Dfx 
 card, it looks downright wonderful - approaching Extreme Assault-quality blowouts. The terrain 
 is highly detailed with rolling landscape and undulating water (though for "the steamy jungles 
 of Indocine" it sure doesn't have a lot of trees) . And of course nearly every man-made object blows 
 up real good. All this and superb MTV-style full-motion video cutscenes to boot.  

 There are five huge campaigns with several missions throughout that include taking out an enemy 
 radar station, escorting important cargo, and rescuing tortured POWs, piloting fifteen different 
 vehicles along the way from an experimental A-10X to a hovercraft to a Russian T-90 tank, all armed 
 to the teeth.   

 A quick glance at the interface usually is enough to tell you what you're low on, be it armor, weapons, 
 or fuel, and by using your ever-present compass, you can quickly find where the closest supplies 
 are to be had; don't worry, the mission will wait while you quickly dash off to restock. Also, 
 if you find your sidetracking has taken you off course, the compass also can quickly point you 
 in the direction of your current objective, highlighting the things that need to be taken care 
 of or simply taken out.  

 But Nuclear Strike is not defect-free (we are talking the military here) ; you can only save a game 
 after you've successfully completed an entire campaign, which can take easily an hour even if you 
 know what you're doing. Another gripe is the ability to view all the missions in a campaign at 
 once, allowing you to take out enemy factions and supply lines before you're supposed to, making 
 the killing all too easy when the time does come to finish off the primary forces. And while the 
 campaigns are large, having only five missions makes this game shorter than it should be. Oh, yeah, 
 and there's no multiplayer.  

 Still, these minor pet peeves shouldn't be enough to scare off the action-loving fan who's tired 
 of the incessant parade of first-person slayathons or ultrarealistic military sims. If you've found 
 the recent crop of action games pretty dry, you'll find plenty to slobber over in this extremely 
 entertaining title.

Review:  Nuclear Strike followed the mediocre Soviet Strike. The game began with the player piloting an 
 Apache attack helicopter in a tropical setting, destroying boats, anti-aircraft guns, and other 
 ground targets. The player could target (a relative term, as the targeting ability of the weapons 
 was spotty at best) and engage anything standing higher than a blade of grass. Interspersed with 
 laying waste to enemy resources were missions to rescue POWs (which was odd as the Apache can only 
 hold two) .
  
  Later missions focused on thwarting a North Korean invasion of the south. This game was quite difficult, 
 especially the later missions when the player had to contend with North Korea's elaborate air defense 
 network.
  
  Throughout Nuclear Strike the player had the option to trade the Apache for other vehicles including 
 hovercrafts, tanks, and fixed wing aircraft.
  
  The gameplay became repetitive very quickly, especially the later levels when the player had to 
 contend with numerous North Korean forces.
  
  After the player had beaten the game, a playable demo of an unreleased game in the Strike series 
 became available. Instead of flying a helicopter, as in all the previous titles, the player took 
 control of what could best be described as an AT-ST Imperial Walker from Star Wars. Needless to 
 say, this demo never saw a full-scale release.
  
  This game was enjoyable for its time, but I would recommend renting it first before laying down 
 any ducats to purchase it.

Review:  An interesting addition to the old Strike series, this game revolutionized the series shortly before 
 its conclusion with the cancellation of Future Strike. The new ability to not only fly the AH-64 
 Apache helicopter, but also the fabled Huey, the Cobra, an AV-8B Harrier II, as well as an AH-6 
 little bird news chopper. Also, the Abrams battle tank and a hovercraft hop into the action as 
 drivable vehicles. The story spans a new, not surprisingly given the title, nuclear threat to the 
 whole of civilization.
  
  The gameplay is fairly action packed and is definately fun, while the mission variety keeps things 
 interesting and keeps you on your toes as you span from Crimea to Pyongyang. The mechanics of the 
 game are efficient, and the graphics and animations are enjoyable to watch. Watching a tank shatter, 
 having flown some hundred feet in the air after receiving a Sidewinder missile (isn't that an Air-to-Air 
 weapon, oh well) to the behind, can be almost a giddy-laugh-inducing act. 
  
  A short game and thus decidedly deserving a short review, an isometric helicopter title never got 
 better than this game. Enjoy.
