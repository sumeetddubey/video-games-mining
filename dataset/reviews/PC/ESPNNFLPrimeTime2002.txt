:::Review:::
Feeble gameplay makes PrimeTime unappealing, and the number of serious bugs that have come along 
 for the ride make it completely unacceptable. 

 PC sports gamers have been largely ignored for a long time now. Aside from EA Sports, nearly every 
 other major publisher of sports games has moved its efforts to the current generation of console 
 systems. So while Xbox, PS2, and GameCube owners get to enjoy three or four different games representing 
 each of the four big North American professional sports, computer owners have to make do with one 
 baseball game, one football game, and so on. Such a lack of choice has caused a lot of die-hard 
 computer-sports-game buffs to feel neglected. A cure for that feeling can be found in FarSight 
 Studios and Konami of America's ESPN NFL PrimeTime 2002. Unfortunately, being stuck with only the 
 Madden series depicting football on the PC doesn't seem so terrible after a bout with this game, 
 which is every bit as awful as its release date more than a month after the Super Bowl might suggest. 
 If having a choice means that you have to endure poorly designed, ugly, bug-ridden shovelware like 
 this, better then to have no choice at all.           PrimeTime has some serious crash bugs and 
 plays bad anyway.    

  Actually, NFL PrimeTime 2002 isn't a choice for many of its prospective victims. Bugs have been 
 widely reported, and our test system -- more than a match for the recommended system requirements 
 and equipped with a GeForce3 Ti 500 -- experienced frequent crashes. Playing games in 32-bit color 
 at video resolutions above the default 640x480 was impossible, as every attempt resulted in an 
 immediate crash that not only shut the game down, but also rebooted our machine. Switching to 16-bit 
 color enabled us to play above 640x480, though random drops to the desktop continued to be a problem. 
 In all, the game probably crashed at least twice for every game that we successfully completed. 
   

  Even when you can get the game to run, playing just isn't worthwhile. While the list of available 
 options is solid -- with the inclusion of a thorough franchise play mode offsetting the absence of 
 an Internet multiplayer option -- the gameplay is a pastiche of everything that people complained 
 about in computer football games a few years ago. The computer is far from astute as a coach, no 
 matter which of the four difficulty settings you're using. Play-calling choices are often straight 
 from the Bizarro World's Pop Warner league, complete with running the ball repeatedly in long-yardage 
 situations and throwing repeatedly when stuck in a situation where running out the clock is advisable. 
 Get the computer club back on its heels inside its own five-yard line, and it will do nothing but 
 throw long, no matter how much time is left on the clock, no matter what the score. We've come 
 back to win more than one game because the computer chose to go for an unnecessary first down instead 
 of just letting the clock expire.   

  The game also does a subpar job of general clock management. Computer plays are called instantly, 
 leaving a minimum of 25 seconds on the play clock, meaning that you'll be able to get off many 
 more plays than would be possible in a real NFL game. This makes it hard to keep scores close to 
 their real-world equivalents, even when you're playing with five-minute quarters. Playing with 
 full 15-minute quarters is impossible, unless you want to see scores in arena football territory. 
   

  The play mechanics are equally disappointing. Compensating for the second-rate artificial intelligence 
 is the computer's uncanny ability to pull off long bombs and make interceptions at opportune times. 
 Because of this, scores typically remain close when they shouldn't, and you begin to feel like 
 the game is cheating. Control issues also make you feel like some cheating is going on. Players 
 glide across the turf as if they were skating, making it hard to make precise moves and cuts. Animations 
 appear to skip frames. Tackles happen with all the suddenness of a bolt of lightning -- one moment 
 the defensive player is three yards away, the next he's got the ballcarrier on the ground. Additionally, 
 there is no gray area with tackling. If an opposing player gets close, the ballcarrier is going 
 down, no matter how well he uses the speed burst, juke, spin, stiff-arm, or other specialty moves. 
 This works both ways, of course, though it still seems like the game is compensating for unsatisfactory 
 AI with these magic tackles. After all, if players weren't taken down so easily, the game would 
 be even more of a wide-open scorefest than it is already.   

  The visual quality is at the same low level as everything else here. The player models are rough, 
 with blocky faces and knees and elbows so sharp that every tackle should result in a dozen stitches 
 for everyone involved. The models also seem incomplete. Close-ups shown between plays often let 
 you look through players' helmets to the sky above or peer through their shoulders at the sidelines. 
 Players also frequently shudder during play, causing a strobe-light effect that makes it difficult 
 to keep your eyes on the screen, and they sometimes flicker when standing on the sidelines. The 
 weather effects exacerbate the latter problem, with snowflakes and players often flashing as much 
 as a broken neon sign. But NFL PrimeTime 2002 isn't all bad visually. The stadium art is pretty 
 good, particularly the animated crowds and textures used for the grass and turf. Team-specific 
 banners are used to further customize each club's home field. Also, the player models get dirty 
 as games go on. Mud and grass stains show up on their uniforms and helmets when playing on natural 
 turf, a subtle touch that reinforces the "down in the trenches" feeling that football is all about. 
           The play-by-play commentary is pretty good, but that's about it.    

  The audio quality is also spotty, though it is better overall than the game's visual components. 
 Much of this edge is due to the ESPN signature voices of Chris Berman and Tom Jackson, who provide 
 all the play-by-play and color commentary. Berman's contributions are particularly welcome, as 
 they do a good job of describing the on-field action with a minimum of hyperbole and a good sprinkling 
 of players' names among accounts of what's happening. Jackson isn't quite so useful. Most of his 
 lines consist of catchphrases like, "The offensive coordinator didn't have that in mind when he 
 drew up that play." The only saving grace is the sheer number of these bland comments. In-game 
 effects include the standard thumps and smacks, though a number of expected effects are missing. 
 It's odd that penalties aren't announced and that audibles are called without a peep.   

  Which is in some ways fitting, because "without a peep" is exactly how ESPN NFL PrimeTime 2002 
 should disappear. Feeble gameplay makes the game unappealing, and the number of serious bugs that 
 have come along for the ride make it completely unacceptable. The idea of having an alternative 
 to EA Sports' award-winning Madden series is apparently superior to the reality, at least if this 
 is the only choice available.
