... and Terminal Velocity begat Fury3, and Fury3 begat Hellbender, and Hellbender begat Monster 
 Truck Madness, and we saw them and said, "Enough already!" 

 ... and Terminal Velocity begat Fury3 (or FuryFuryFury) , and Fury3 begat Hellbender, and Hellbender 
 begat Monster Truck Madness, and we saw them and said, "Enough already!"  

 Terminal Reality was one of the up-and-coming 3-D action companies when they released Terminal Velocity 
 a couple years back as shareware. Microsoft, who can't stand it when something that they don't 
 own succeeds, snapped them up and had them revamp TV as one of Microsoft's first true games, Fury3. 
 (The "3" stands for the third dimension in gaming, as in 3-D.) For its time, Fury3 was good enough 
 at delivering some pretty fast space-shooting action in a well-rendered environment. It slapped 
 you in the cockpit of a space fighter and set you loose on a planet with plenty of stuff to blow 
 up. Good enough, except for the unforgivable sin of failing to put in any multiplayer capabilities. 
   

 Well, Hellbender is more of the same, with the addition of some features that belonged in the first 
 game. It's Fury3 with a few tweaks and not much more, and it's not even as fun as Monster Truck 
 Madness. Let's start with one of Hellbender's more touted new offerings : a more elaborate story. 
 It's here alright, with plenty of lovingly rendered cut scenes and big name narrative (which you 
 can read at the MS link below) . Story's good. Story's nice. But what does it have to do with flying 
 a spaceship around really fast and blowing stuff up? Anyway, the tale picks up after your fellow 
 pilots are wiped out by terrorists, leaving you as the sole pilot left to defend the galaxy. The 
 prototype Hellbender fighter is all that's left, and you have to pilot this series of missions 
 to take out fighters, ground structures, power plants, sensors, arrays, and so on. Along for the 
 ride are the voices of Russell Johnson (of Gilligan's Island) and Gillian Anderson (of The X-Files) , 
 which add some novel amusement for a while.  

 For the most part, gameplay is all you could expect: fast and fiery. There are plenty of targets 
 to shoot at, and missions tend to have several goals to keep things interesting. You can zoom in 
 close to the ground without fear of crashing, since the Hellbender levels itself out at ground 
 level. Or you can fly above the clouds to avoid ground fire and take on other fighters in the peaceful 
 serenity of a black void. Much of this will be familiar to Fury3 players. In its bid to become 
 Descent, however, Hellbender has made its tunnel missions more complex. These are missions in which 
 you fly into underground bunkers and tunnel networks, doing many of the same things you did on 
 the surface, except in a more confined space. The tunnels in Hellbender are more twisting and complex 
 than the ones in Fury3, and the action on the whole is more tense. This doesn't necessarily make 
 it more enjoyable, though: I found the cramped spaces merely annoying and the confusing tunnel 
 networks hard to navigate. More often than not, I wound up lost, confused, and not very happy - 
 but then again, I didn't like Descent, either.  

 The last big change in Hellbender is the inclusion of network play for up to eight people, including 
 full Internet play. This is the feature Fury3 should have had and didn't, so it's good to finally 
 see it in place. Unfortunately, the way it's implemented now, Internet play really only works well 
 with about four people, and then only after a good deal of wrestling with configurations and other 
 technical matters.  

 Even with these new elements, as well as the expected new arsenal of weapons and enemies, Hellbender 
 is beginning to creak with age. The graphics tend to be blocky, and are often more bland than those 
 found in Fury3 or Terminal Velocity. Frame rates are pretty poor on most systems even in low-res, 
 and in hi-res they're just appalling. Some new effects, such as rain and lightning, clutter the 
 screen without being effective. This game engine is getting old, and it's about a year overdue 
 for retirement. Microsoft should have let it fade into the sunset - maybe get it a nice condo in 
 Boca Raton - but instead we get another tired retread of a system that's outstayed its welcome.

Review:  A land once peaceful for all has now turned into death trap for all. 
  
  It is a no man's with hostile air borne and cave borne predators. Hostile enemies from all angles, 
 it takes the fastest brains to unsettle them and take them out.
  
  Huge and mini hostiles on coalition patrol with the same purpose and intention to eliminate you 
 on your encroachment. It is a very dirty game, the taught of it is even haunting than the attempt 
 to actually play it. The hostiles in the caves are like worms on a free rotten apple. 
  
  With speed and precision one wins against the worms, but it is very difficult to take out the air 
 borne predators.
  
  It is a trail of the unknown path in cyber space which traces itself without your knowledge, where 
 ever the ease may arise.
  
  With full chain reaction sequence initiated, it takes only the adjustment of the control rods to 
 increase or decrease speed. It is best you don't waste your fuel or they will take you out once 
 their fuel are down, there is no telling of where they are coming from.
  
  Navigational aid of high calculations in cyber space ot just mere movement at will, is installed. 
 No invitations are given but just in case you drop in, in self derailment don't forget your navigational 
 aid when going out, or you might just be in a state of Brownian motion with no cause under bombardment 
 at all angles.
  
  When your locus is reached be sure to clear out all coordinates, like the DNA, each locus has its 
 own unique scenery of the same predators and worms.
  
  With views at all angles and cutting wings to dodge waves, with blistering heat of flames at each 
 fall and hit.
  
  Armed with what to do and where to go missiles and launchers which you reload onwards at each locus 
 with coordinates checked.
  
  The music sounds will take your mind of all things but to concentrate on a kill. Nukes give a free 
 fast flow of movement between coordinates at locus, the fuel holds you down to think, the faster 
 you go the faster the rate of fuel consumption, you can use the nukes to cover up when fuel drops 
 down.
  
  It is peaceful at last at coalition patrol waiting for assistance, all is yours for the taken.

Review:  If Microsoft hadn't bought Terminal Reality what would have happened? Would Fury3 have made Terminal 
 Velocity the biggest seller of the year? Would Hellbender have happened?
  
  Hellbender is an example of what happened in the early days where Microsoft got involved in things 
 it maybe should not have. Featuring the voice of (then hottie) Gillian Anderson (Scully of The 
 X-Files fame) the game promised better environments, badder enemies, and an easier navigation system.
 
  
  The game did all that. It just wasn't supplied with an updated graphics subsystem. The game was, 
 quite literally, the ugliest piece of trash I've ever played. Dark environments with funky stretched 
 (too far stretched in my opinion) textures, an overlaying of female voice announcements, and the 
 same gameplay as featured in Fury3 (or Terminal Velocity) .
  
  Nothing was terribly landmark about the game. In fact, had they just made the levels brighter and 
 released it as an expansion pack to an already decent game, I probably would've been much happier.
 
  
  But at this point, I digress. This game is 9 years old and not many people care anymore. I've written 
 this review to just lay down the facts so that someone may look back and avoid quite possibly, 
 the worst game ever.
