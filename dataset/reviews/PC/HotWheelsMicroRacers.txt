It takes the classic playtime activity of racing toy cars and adds 3D-accelerated graphics and artificial 
 intelligence to create a fun arcade-style racing game. 

 Hot Wheels Micro Racers takes the classic playtime activity of racing toy cars and adds 3D-accelerated 
 graphics and artificial intelligence to create a fun arcade-style racing game. Everything about 
 the game is straightforward and easy to use, from the menu interface to the controls.   

  The gameplay consists of racing against up to three other cars on one of three tracks. Three racing 
 modes are available: single race, championship mode, and pursuit. Single-race mode, as the name 
 implies, lets you choose a track and race once. In championship mode, you must race through all 
 three tracks but must come in first place to advance to the next track. Pursuit mode is a somewhat 
 brutal option; it consists of a single three-lap race, and the car in last place for each lap gets 
 eliminated (it explodes) until only the winner remains. The two-player split-screen mode lets you 
 and another racer compete head-to-head on the same computer.   

  The controls are easy to learn, as they simply involve turning right and left, and using the gas, 
 brake, and the turbo boost. Each car has different handling characteristics: acceleration, top 
 speed, grip, and turbo recharge rate. These characteristics are clearly displayed in the car-selection 
 screen. The turbo boost adds a small element of strategy to the game; it should be used as often 
 as possible, but since turbo takes a moment to recharge, it should also be used in the most advantageous 
 locations in order to maximize its effectiveness. A super-turbo boost is also available after you 
 find the three hidden stars on each track. After you locate a star, your boost will become more 
 powerful, and it will last longer.   

  Only two cars are available at the beginning of the game, but after you win the championship mode 
 on the novice and amateur levels, you'll get access to new cars. You can also unlock additional 
 cars by finding the three hidden stars on each track. These additional cars add to the limited 
 replay value of the game. While the game's car-handling physics aren't realistic, it's still fun 
 to switch between cars with contrasting strengths and weaknesses since they handle the tracks differently. 
 Unfortunately, aside from unlocking the hidden cars, there's no way to make a record of your racing 
 success - there's no Hall of Fame to let you record your name on a high-score table or anything 
 of the sort. As it stands, the only reward for winning at the pro level is that you get dumped 
 back to the main menu. It's a disappointing anticlimax, especially after sweating through that 
 last lap, hoping not to get hit by an electric train or get passed up by one of the computer-controlled 
 cars hot on your tail.   

  The three 3D tracks included in the game are well detailed and full of jumps, turns, obstacles, 
 and hazards. The beach-themed Wave Watch track takes the race around a sandcastle and features 
 a randomly bouncing beach ball that can destroy your chances at winning a race if you aren't careful. 
 The At the Office track features a treacherous course across desks and tables littered with office 
 supplies, books, and other items. An electric fan on one of the desks turns on and off periodically, 
 and it can blow the cars right off the table. You must be careful not to let your car slide off 
 the edge of a table or desk, or you'll fall to the ground and explode. Exploding won't necessarily 
 cost you the race, but it'll hurt your lap time since your car will take a few seconds to respawn. 
 The last track, Slumber Summit, takes place in a child's bedroom littered with toys. The racetrack 
 crosses an electric train track, and drivers must avoid colliding with the train. A greater number 
 of tracks would have been a welcome addition, but to the game's credit, its few tracks do feature 
 a number of interesting shortcuts and secret areas.   

  The graphics in Hot Wheels Micro Racer are good. The game occasionally slowed down at higher resolutions 
 when there were multiple cars on the screen, but aside from that the game ran smoothly. The third-person 
 overhead view could have been slightly wider to give a better view of what is coming up on the 
 track, but the game makes up for this by including warning beacons that pop up at the top of the 
 screen to notify you of upcoming turns and obstacles.   

  The game's sound effects are optional, and they don't add much to the experience overall. Each 
 of the cars has a slightly different engine sound, and the cars have unique sound effects for their 
 turbo boost. You'll also hear some simple crashing sounds when the cars bump into one another. 
 The background music is pleasant and upbeat, but it gets old after a few races. Fortunately, you 
 won't get tired of the tracks as quickly.   

  Hot Wheels Micro Racers provides a fun and enjoyable arcade-style racing experience from a toy-sized 
 perspective. While the game would have benefited from additional tracks, its few racecourses are 
 well designed and detailed enough to make the game a modest value.

Review:  Hot Wheels Micro Racers is a fun and at the same time a challenging game. It really never gets 
 boring ever even I still and I got it 8 years ago! With it's 3 tracks it still dosen't get boring 
 unless you get tired of playing games easily. In the game there are 7 cars Semi Fast, Tail Dragger, 
 Track T, Screamin' Hauler, Deora 2, Turbo Flame, and Whatta Drag. It's no wonder Mattel made this 
 game all there PC games are extremly fun! This game is kinda hard but kinda easy making it just 
 right. Altough it is really hard to find the car part areas when you first get the game which was 
 very hard for me it took me a while to find them all so I could get new cars. This game is a great 
 game that you should really buy if you like racing games although they might not sell it anymore 
 so you might have to bid on eBay. This game was made in 2000 and is made by the company Mattel 
 and is rated E for everyone.

 bargain bins and you will probally find it.

Review:  This game is Very easy if you do the trick where you back up a little from the finish line, then 
 go to it, you can have a lap passed without even going through the entire racetrack. I used to 
 have two of the toys that are in this game. Even though it's too easy, it's still pretty decent. 
 You start with only 2 Cars to choose from. My favorite Hot Wheels toy in this game is the Semi 
 Fast (Red Truck) . I used to be thinking that this would be far too hard until I found the major 
 trick that makes things just easy, just easy I say.
