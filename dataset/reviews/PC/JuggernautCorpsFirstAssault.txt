The best that can be said about it is that it's an adequate 2D shooter with an attractive price 
 tag. 

 I've never had a problem with cookie-cutter games - provided the cookie dough isn't stale and the 
 mold wasn't cast 20 years ago. Unfortunately, those are precisely the things you get with Juggernaut 
 Corps: First Assault, a 2D space shooter that resolutely follows the formulaic guidelines of the 
 genre like a radar beam tracking invading extraterrestrials.  

 The alien menace du jour is Species CAN-8932, and its ships have started popping through wormholes 
 located in the space controlled by the Alliance (the good guys) . Although we're not told if these 
 wormholes were created by the Alliance or were simply annexed by it in a typical show of "might 
 makes right," the wormholes nevertheless are the key to the Alliance's survival - and the alien 
 ships are causing them to become unstable. As per usual when repelling alien invasions, only one 
 brave pilot will get a chance to battle the wormhole-usurping hordes because the force-field access 
 code that will allow Alliance fighters past the enemy's outer defenses can only be used by a single 
 ship.   

 On the back of the jewel case it says that Juggernaut Corps can run at resolutions of up to 1280x1024, 
 so after finding the standard 640x480 display too cramped for effective maneuvering I began scouring 
 all the game's menus for an option to resize the display. No luck there, so I checked the README 
 and HELP files - and again came up empty-handed. Turns out the only place this little tidbit is 
 revealed is at the Juggernaut Corps web site. It's nice that the info is online, but that doesn't 
 make up for the absence of such basic instructions in the game manual or help files.  

 Once you do set the resolution to your liking, you'll discover a standard space shooter with all 
 the usual features: nine weapon types (one is the Armageddon weapon, which takes a while to assemble 
 by collecting hidden pieces) , seven ship types, power-ups for shields and hull, and seemingly countless 
 waves of enemies to destroy over the course of the game's 35 levels.   

 You've probably heard that space is curved, but in Juggernaut Corps it's square and enclosed: The 
 sides of the display are walls in this 2D world, and hitting one sends you careening back into 
 battle. While you might get a brief kick out of ricocheting shots from your crystal cannon off 
 the walls and into an enemy base, chances are you'll soon tire of the closed play field. An option 
 to toggle this on and off should be in the game options (along with a way to change the resolution) , 
 but instead you have to use a "cheat code" to bring down the barriers.  

 Gameplay is simple in the extreme - you can move forward, backward, and laterally (strafing) as 
 you keep up a near-constant stream of fire in the face of scores and scores of enemies on each 
 level. There's no "hyperwarp" to jump out of trouble and no "smart bomb" to destroy all enemies 
 at once - two features that would go a long way in making this game a little less frustrating. 
 Instead, about the only things you can do to even up the odds are grab new weapons and ammo and, 
 most importantly, pick up those shield and hull power-ups if you hope to stay alive.  

 That probably sounds fair enough, but you might feel differently after you see a shield power-up 
 disappear just as you're about to grab it. And grabbing new weapons isn't always such a good idea: 
 Your ship automatically arms itself with whatever weapon you grab, and often you'll have to switch 
 from the weak, newly acquired weapon to the one you had selected before you picked it up. One solution 
 would be to avoid grabbing weak weapons, but that can be pretty difficult considering how small 
 the weapon icons are and how much space you're covering in a frantic fight to avoid destruction. 
 The real solution would have been to put in an option that would let you choose whether new weapons 
 should be armed immediately  

 Juggernaut Corps runs smoothly enough even at very high resolutions, and while the graphics aren't 
 anything special, they're more than good enough for the task at hand. But after just a few levels 
 all the action and enemies begin to look and feel the same, even when you face new types of ships 
 and bases. This is a tough nut to crack even on the medium difficulty level, thanks largely to 
 the inclusion of scores of tiny, swarming enemies that'll bring you down faster than you can say 
 Asteroids. I found them incredibly frustrating to deal with because you should use your weakest 
 weapons against them, conserving ammo for the high-power stuff to use against more resilient enemies 
 - which means you wind up either fumbling around to constantly switch weapons or using a sledgehammer 
 to crush an interstellar mosquito.  

 Multiplayer options are pretty limited, with play over a LAN the only way to compete against friends. 
 That's too bad, because judging from the single-player mode it looks like flying against a bunch 
 of friends would probably yield the most satisfaction. Then again, maybe it wouldn't: Multiplayer 
 games can only be played in the stifling 640x480 display, and things would get pretty crowded with 
 six or seven players trying to navigate and fight in those tight confines.   

 The best that can be said about it is that it's an adequate 2D shooter with an attractive price 
 tag. I'm sure there are some folks out there who've still got a jones for this stuff, and for them 
 Juggernaut Corps could be a lot of fun. But if you feel like you've already saved enough 2D galaxies, 
 Juggernaut Corps doesn't offer enough new features - either in gameplay or eye candy - to make 
 it worth more than a passing glance.

Review:  Juggernaut Corps is a Asteroids clone that doesnt deliver. The game is a shooter were you have 
 a little plane and you bounce around in a room in space shooting aliens trying to invade. The game 
 hasover 50 levels were you must defeat different aliens. 
  
  Graphics: The graphics are noot good. The ships are tiny and its look more like a blomp than a 
 ship. The space look Ok though
  
  Sound: The Music is Ok, The voices are crap
  
  Control: The ship is Very very very very hard to control, its almost impossible if you dont want 
 to train for 20 hours and belive me you dont. The buttons are ok. 
  
  Value: like i said the game has 50 levels and its hard to beat the 10 first so if you like the 
 game you have much play time in front of you. But the replay isnt there and there isnt much more 
 than the campaign to do. 
  
  Tilt. The game is fun for about 1 minut then it gets frustrating, hard to control and you bounce 
 in to everything. In my opinion this is totally Rubbish. Look Out dont play this game !!!!!

Review:  Yes, this is nothing but an Asteroids clone in a new disguise. Admittedly, the number of enemies 
 and obstacles to overcome is interesting enough to keep you going for a while. A number of power 
 ups is fun too, but at the end of the day it is just another clone game. Each level throws the 
 same formulaic enemies at you and ultimately your interest will start to wane. Pick it up if you 
 like the challenging gameplay of a small thrusting ship bouncing around space obstacles and shooting 
 at anything that moves. If you like Asteroids, this should be a suitable variation on the theme.
