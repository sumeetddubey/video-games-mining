:::Review:::
As a logical extension of the show, Harbinger hits the nail on the head: it's low-key, very pretty, 
 and ultimately kinda boring. 

 Okay, Deep Space Nine is rather a slow, dragging show, but a game based in that world could have 
 been cool. Someday one probably will bebut this isn't it. Players take the role of an envoy 
 whose shuttle hard-lands at DS9 after being attacked by rogue drones of unknown origin. Your stay 
 at the station ultimately involves the murder of an ambassador; I won't spoil the ending by giving 
 away any major plot points. Harbinger is a very good-looking, terrific-sounding, high-gloss parade 
 of missed opportunities. The method of navigation, like the one used in Buried in Time, is counter-intuitive. 
 Your brain really starts to bend when you try perimiter navigation, which takes you not forward 
 or backward but sort ofaround things. Never mind. To make matters worse, however, DS9 is not fully 
 navigable, and with this level of graphic detail, you'll instinctively want to go exploring. Of 
 course, even if you could, there's no map. Asking a computer for directions to an area and getting 
 instead a rote, vague description of what that area is can give you a headache. The charactersjust 
 as emotionless as they are on TVare computer-modeled bodies with textures mapped onto them, 
 which you'd think would make them more realistic and human. Not so; with their bulbous heads, unblinking 
 eyes and undersea movements, they actually seem surreal and sort of spooky.   

 Some pluses: this photorealistic game keeps you awake with some pretty tricky arcade sequences; 
 you don't have to wait long before somebody sticks a phaser in your hand; and time spent at Quark's 
 bar has certain rewardingly illicit undertones. As a logical extension of the show, Harbinger hits 
 the nail on the head: it's low-key, very pretty, and ultimately kinda boring.

Review:  This was one of my favorite games back when I was still using DOS and Windows 95; one of those 
 games that I still have sitting on my shelf, making me think about finding an old Pentium 100 to 
 load DOS up on and play. It's not that this game will ever be remembered as "remarkable" or "ground 
 breaking" but probably more as "atmospheric". If you're a Trek fan, and even a little bit of a 
 DS9 fan, you'd do well to play this - assuming, of course, that you can get it to run on today's 
 machines.
  
  The first half of the game, that is to say the part that actually takes place on DS9, is fantastic. 
 The station has been evacuated because of a plasma storm, so you'll only find a few stragglers 
 and the crew left on board. Of course, most of the cast members are here, sucking you deeper into 
 the "DS9 feel" of the game. One of the great things about this game is that the cast members that 
 are missing aren't represented in the game at all, so there are no horrible voice overs from fill 
 in actors.
  
  You'll get to do several things during the course of the action/adventure (the main parts be adventure) 
 game, such as defend the station from attack, solve a murder, engage in diplomatic missions, get 
 drugged by Quark and chase a few murderers around the station in tandem with the crew. All of this 
 is entertaining and only somewhat tedious. The action sequences are mostly scripted so if you die 
 you'll know where the guy is hiding the second time. The puzzles are all pretty easy, so if you 
 tend to be turned off by high level puzzles you won't find that here.
  
  The second part of the game puts you out on an alien homeworld where you'll use most of the skills 
 you were introduced to during the first half of the game... while this part is still fun, I always 
 missed being on the station. In the end, you'll make it back to the station just in time to jump 
 in the gunner's chair of the defiant and defend the station against the final threat.
  
  Make no mistake - this is a pretty short, pretty easy game to play, with beautiful backgrounds, 
 excellent voice overs and some downright terrible character animations. However, the game does 
 more right than wrong, if you overlook the easy puzzles - it's draws you in and gives you a great 
 "DS9" experience where you feel like part of the crew, and is fun to play, and during some scenes 
 with Quark downright funny.
  
  If you like Star Trek and DS9 and can run an old DOS app like DS9: Harbinger, you'd do great to 
 pick this up on Ebay from from a friend.
