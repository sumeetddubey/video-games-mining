:::Review:::
If you're not patient, or aren't particularly interested in the Aztecs, you may quickly lose interest. 
 

  That's the extent of gameplay you get in Maxis' 
 The Crystal Skull. Like many other video-intensive adventure games around nowadays, most of the 
 game requires you to sit patiently as the game's characters go through their motions on screen. 
 Fortunately, the premise of the game is interesting enough that the miles of video you watch won't 
 leave you with your eyes glazed over. And unlike many other games similar to this one (Under a 
 Killing Moon, Wrath of the Gods, Daedelus Encounter) , the acting is actually well done, with Edward 
 James Olmos from Miami Vice leading up the cast.   

 Set in ancient Central America, the game explores the mystic world of the Aztec empire. Shamen, 
 High Priests, and Aztec warriors interact with and assist or attack you as you click around, looking 
 for the crystal skull. While the game itself is sparse on true Aztec culture, a separate section 
 acts as a multimedia textbook, providing a light Aztec education - a nice touch. Breaking away 
 from most of the other cookie-cutter video adventure games, The Crystal Skull is not completely 
 linear. While you usually end up in the same place, there are a few different ways to get there. 
 And believe it or not, what you say to characters actually does make a difference, and affects 
 your progress.   

 Even with the extras, though, unless you're fascinated by Aztec and Mayan culture, you're likely 
 to get bored quickly. You can waste hours simply watching your character saunter from one end of 
 a scene to the next - the mindless video clips can't be skipped. And the puzzles that usually spice 
 up this type of game are nowhere to be found; here, the puzzle lies purely in where you go and 
 what you collect. The game does provide a refreshing change, however, in the role of the Shaman, 
 who gives you hints when you ask for them, keeping you from wandering around aimlessly for hours, 
 clicking on everything, and waiting to see what happens. But be careful: Text-based clues from 
 the Shaman are all clumped together, so many of the hints you'll see will be for tasks you won't 
 yet have come up against, and reading the questions may spoil it for you.   

 When you get into certain areas of the game, you'll be thankful if you have a multi-disc CD-ROM 
 player. The three-disc switch gets tedious in particular areas of the game. Also, make sure you 
 have plenty of video RAM and a kickin' processor. Even on a Pentium 120 with 16MB of RAM and a 
 4x CD-ROM drive, we suffered from some serious lag time for video clips to start, and some video 
 frames dropped out from time to time.   

 If you liked The Crystal Skull's predecessors, you're going to love this game. The video quality 
 is great, offering a lot more than just talking heads. But if you're not patient, or aren't particularly 
 interested in the Aztecs, you may quickly lose interest.

Review:  It's been a long time since I've played the Crystal Skull, so bear with me if the review seems 
 vague and sloppy. If I remember correctly, I bought this from one of those stupid catalog things 
 that was at school... not sure if every school had them, but that's where I bought it... from school. 
 Sounded cool, The Crystal Skull. Dark, scary, and educational... I was down with that, at long as 
 it was fun.
  
  Which is where the problem is: The fun factor. In that there wasn't a fun factor. The game was 
 boring, and I happen to find ancient cultures such as the Aztecs and Mayans to be fairly interesting. 
 Really, the main thing I remember about this game was getting to a point where it seemed that I 
 would die no matter what I did. Maybe I was too young to know what to do (I played this when I 
 was like 10 or 11, I think) , but I have no desire to play it again. In fact, I can't even manage 
 to get rid of my copy... it's like a curse. The curse of the Crystal Skull.
