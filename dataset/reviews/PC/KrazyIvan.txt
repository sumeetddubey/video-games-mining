:::Review:::
Unfortunately, even if this game had drop-dead graphics and sound, it couldn't mask the fact that 
 it is way too easy, shallow, and short. 

 There is something inherently cool about the concept of Krazy Ivan: You control a nutty Russian 
 guy encased in a 40-ton, armed-to-the-teeth robot in a battle to save the Earth from aliens. Sound 
 a bit like a Russkie adaptation of "Independence Day"?   

 Superfluous plot points aside, Krazy Ivan amounts to a dumbed down MechWarrior II or the like, which 
 wouldn't be such a bad thing had it been better executed. Instead of having you complete mission 
 objectives and battling hordes of enemy mechs, Krazy Ivan places you in what amounts to a series 
 of one-on-one mechanized match-ups.   

 Each level in the game is basically the same: scamper around a small, 3-D landscape in order to 
 destroy a shield generator complex, thus freeing that sector. Predictably, before you can annihilate 
 the generators on each level, you must individually fight and destroy different robots (who sport 
 suave names like "Raptor" and "Deadlok" ) that protect the generators from harm. As you travel 
 to each battle area you are afforded the opportunity to pick up a few power-ups, weapons, and other 
 abilities that are jettisoned from exploding carcasses of pesky aliens in small, armored air or 
 ground vehicles. Your robot's firepower ranges from the basic dual, huge Gattling guns to powerful 
 cannons. Other extras include scatter grenades, missiles, and lasers.  

 The trick to Krazy Ivan is learning your opponent's weaknesses and battle patterns. Once you've 
 done so, defeating each mechanized menace will be relatively easy. Snippets of full-motion video 
 will give you a few vague hints, but other than that you're on your own. That's not to say that 
 learning the attack patterns is very hard. Even if you don't know exactly which weapons to use, 
 or where to aim them, the simple tactic of "sticking and moving" usually works pretty effectively. 
 In a game where one-on-one combat makes up the bulk of the action, there is little excuse for Krazy 
 Ivan's incompetent adversaries.   

 Graphically, Krazy Ivan holds its own, but the game certainly isn't going to set any new benchmarks. 
 The low-resolution graphics make the large, 3-D textured-mapped mechs and other vehicles appear 
 a little messy sometimes, but the opposing robots move about pretty realistically, and some of 
 them look "interesting," to say the least. A light fog effect adds to the mood, but mostly serves 
 as a veil to mask the polygonal breakup in the background. When you add to all this a techno-funk 
 soundtrack that might make you want to shoot along with the beat, Krazy Ivan is a game with an 
 effective if not stunning atmosphere.  

 Unfortunately, even if this game had drop-dead graphics and sound, it couldn't mask the fact that 
 it is way too easy, shallow, and short. Although Psygnosis' fast-paced shooter might offer PC gamers 
 a taste of console arcade action, the only thing really big about this game is the size of Krazy 
 Ivan's robot.
