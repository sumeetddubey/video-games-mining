:::Review:::
The game's well-designed levels and novel game types make it a fun alternative to its more visceral 
 inspirations. 

 Nerf ArenaBlast has an interesting concept. Ostensibly a family-friendly version of multiplayer 
 combat games like Quake III: Arena and Unreal Tournament, Nerf ArenaBlast replaces rocket launchers 
 and chain guns with foam-rubber-firing alternatives and trades the darkened hallways and desolate 
 space stations of its unabashedly violent counterparts for serene forest settings and brightly 
 lit corridors. But the designers obviously wanted to make something more than just Gibbing for 
 Junior. While it won't meet the criteria of either concerned parents or frag-hungry gamers, the 
 game's well-designed levels and novel game types make it a fun alternative to its more visceral 
 inspirations.  

 There are three game types in Nerf ArenaBlast. PointBlast is similar to a standard deathmatch, sans 
 the death. Your goal is simply to accumulate more points than your opponents. To do this, you must 
 shoot them with your arsenal of Nerf weapons. However, unlike in typical deathmatching, in PointBlast 
 your victims leave behind point tokens, which you must collect to get a high score. Anyone can 
 grab a point token, so this lets even the worst shots do well, as long as they keep on their toes. 
 You can also gain bonus points through skillful marksmanship; shooting targets hidden throughout 
 levels will add to your point total just as direct hits to the opponent's chestplate will give 
 you bonus points.  

 The second game, BallBlast, combines PointBlast with a strategic element. Seven balls are strewn 
 about a level, and your objective is to collect these balls and fire them into one of the goals 
 on the level. You can still earn points by taking down your opponents, but you can only win when 
 all seven balls are in the goal. SpeedBlast is the last game type, and it requires you to race 
 your opponents through a level to seven flag points. The first to hit all seven flags wins. To 
 progress through the single-player game, you must score in the top three in all three gamfes in 
 an arena. At this point, the next arena will become available.  

 The weapons in Nerf ArenaBlast are based on the popular Nerf toy guns. While the names and ammo 
 are certainly Nerf-like, they almost directly correspond to the typical arsenal of most first-person 
 shooters. For instance, the Triple Strike is just a rocket launcher, the Ballzooka is a dead ringer 
 for a grenade launcher, and the Whomper is a superweapon that looks and fires suspiciously like 
 Quake II's BFG. Each weapon also has an alternate mode of fire, which uses more ammo but causes 
 more damage. Nerf ArenaBlast is based on the impressive Unreal engine, and it shows. The game plays 
 fast, and the levels look good. But you won't mistake ArenaBlast's computer opponents for Unreal's 
 quick-moving Skaarj warriors. These guys and gals are surprisingly easy opponents. And while you 
 might expect this, considering the game is intended for all ages, the fact that your opponents 
 will often get stuck in ridiculous little two-steps, moving back and forth without firing or even 
 responding to your repeated foam poundings, is disappointing at times. This is especially problematic 
 in SpeedBlast games, where merely running in a straight line often seems like a huge problem for 
 the computer.  

 The lack of challenge provided by the computer wouldn't be too much of a concern if playing online 
 were an easier task. That's not to imply it isn't easy to connect - so long as you have your Internet 
 connection active, selecting a server and joining a game is simple. But actually finding servers 
 may prove a problem - as of this writing, only a few servers are ever available at a given time, 
 and these are mostly demo servers unavailable to players who actually own the full game. Hasbro 
 Interactive should have set up more servers to make finding online competition less difficult. 

 However, the biggest problem with Nerf ArenaBlast is that the game isn't all that family friendly. 
 While it is certainly less gory than other games, it still displays semiviolent success messages 
 whenever you defeat an opponent. Simply because there isn't any blood doesn't mean that the gunplay 
 isn't aggressively competitive.  

 As such, Nerf ArenaBlast walks a strange line. It tries to appeal to both shooter fans and a society 
 concerned with violence in games, but it falls a bit short on both fronts. But despite this problem, 
 it's a really fun game. Only overly concerned parents will find fault with the game's good-natured 
 combat, and only those who need to see their opponents explode again and again will find it too 
 childish. If only the game had better artificial intelligence and better support online, it would 
 really be a blast.

Review:  This is a fun game. If you want a fun shooter which is really different, stop reading this review 
 and just go buy it. It's a lot of fun. If you really aren't sure about my word, then keep on reading.
 
  
  This game features numerous levels, events, wepons, and courses throughout the entire game, so 
 you will probably be entertained throughout the long lifespan that the game features. Now don't 
 get the wrong idea, the game isn't ideal for a lengthy game, but the replay value makes up for 
 it.
  
  The gameplay is great, the levels are VERY well designed with really neat twists, and the events 
 are really fun as well, so chances are, there will be something that you like in this game.
  
  There are a lot of different guns. All of them are completly different and are a lot of fun 
 to use and discover for the first time. I highly reccomend this game to anyone really. It is more 
 of a kids game than an adult game, but adults could still find some amusement in it. 2 thumbs up! 
 Highly reccomended!

Review:  Well this game is a joke to me because i am used to blood and more action. If you want a tuned 
 down version of quake this is good because it replaces all quake guns with like nerf guns, nerf 
 guns were fun in real life when i was small so this game is also good for young people. I used 
 to have fun playing this game but now that i look back it seems quite funny. If you are an adult 
 and dont want your children to see blood and guns then get this for them, they will still have 
 just as much fun but without the viloence.
