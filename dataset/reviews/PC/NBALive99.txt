:::Review:::
When you strip away all the great new graphics and new season play, the core of the game is still 
 great fun. 

 So you're sitting on your couch, trying to will the regular season rematch between the Bulls and 
 Jazz into existence by staring at the television set. Well, I have news for you, it's not going 
 to happen. The 1998-99 NBA season is all but dead. But I have one thing to say to that: So what? 
 You can start your own NBA season. Who needs greedy players and owners? EA Sports' NBA Live 99 
 lets you simulate as many seasons as you like of fast-paced, all-out hoops action, without the 
 whining, the high-priced players, or the strangled coaches.  

 EA Sports' NBA Live series has always been a winner, and this year is no different. The game isn't 
 fundamentally different, so if you've played previous NBA Lives, the 99 version will be a familiar 
 experience. However, that's not to say that NBA Live 99 isn't full of surprises and improvements. 
 Live 99 takes the series to the next level, with great new graphics and more gameplay options. 

 This year's NBA Live looks better than ever. The 3Dfx graphics are incredible, and the new 3D faces 
 and facial animation are uncannily similar to the players' real faces. You'll recognize each player 
 instantly: Shaq looks like Shaq, and Sprewell looks like Sprewell. Players also sport new facial 
 animation. You'll see players yawning, wincing in pain after an injury, screaming during a big 
 dunk, or wagging their tongue on the way to the basket. Players also liven it up after a dunk or 
 nice layup, jumping up in celebration, pumping their fists in the air, or even pointing at the 
 opposing players for some "trash" pointing. You'll also notice more differentiation between players 
 when you play the game. I played a game between the Golden State Warriors and LA Lakers and saw 
 that Shaq was nearly twice the size of Muggsy Bogues. I played as the Lakers against the Utah Jazz 
 and saw that Hornicek was a virtual stick next to Shaq's wide body. These new facial expressions, 
 3D faces, and the varying body types make this NBA Live the most visually realistic and impressive 
 of all basketball games.  

 The graphics aren't perfect though. While the animation and player motion is for the most part smooth 
 and lifelike, there are times when players stutter or get caught against each other. After a brief 
 moment of shaking, the players will again move into their regular patterns and movement, but the 
 momentary lapse is jarring to the otherwise beautiful virtual reality this game's graphics create. 
 During replays, I was a bit bothered by the inarticulate hands, which don't show enough motion 
 during the dunk. But this is really a very minor point and shouldn't detract from the game's great 
 graphics.  

 There are some new features for NBA Live 99, the most prominent being a new practice mode and multiple-seasons 
 play. The practice mode is a pretty cool feature, but it could stand much improvement. I would 
 have liked to see a button list like those furnished by today's fighting games like Tekken 3. With 
 all the new fakes and dunks, it's hard to read a manual, memorize everything, and then try to perform 
 the moves. An option to see a move list onscreen with appropriate buttons would have been invaluable. 
 I also wanted to be able to practice with a teammate for passes, assists, and two-player moves. 
 A practice mode with a player on defense (like a one-on-one game) would also have been great for 
 testing out those fakes and dekes. It's easy to fake out nobody, so how do you know if your fakes 
 will really work on an actual player in a game?  

 The new multiple-seasons play allows you to build a team completely from scratch through the draft 
 and then play for ten seasons. You can build a dynasty by trading for players and try to outdo 
 the Bulls. Players will age during those ten seasons, either improving with experience or declining 
 in old age. I don't know that I would play ten seasons of 82 games each, at the full 12 minutes 
 per quarter, but the option is there. Of course, you can also specify 32- or 54-game seasons and 
 adjust quarter time from two minutes to 12 minutes, just as you could in previous NBA Lives, so 
 even those of us with less time can try our hand at dynasty building.  

 As always, NBA Live allows you to play in arcade mode, where all the rules don't apply, and simulation 
 mode, where the game takes on the intensity and challenge of the real game. However, this year's 
 arcade mode is even wilder, with high-flying, slow-motion dunks and even faster-paced play. There 
 are no flaming basketballs, NBA Jam-style, but this is a good mode for a fast arcade fix. Simulation 
 mode seems to have toughened up this year. Playing on superstar difficulty was a great challenge. 
 As the LA Lakers, I lost to the Phoenix Suns by 30 points, and that was in a 16-minute game. The 
 computer makes better use of the clock, takes advantage of mismatches on defense, and really moves 
 the ball between players a lot better. It also steals and blocks more aggressively, and successfully, 
 in superstar mode. Of course, there are two, less masochistic, difficulty settings. They aren't 
 quite as tough as superstar mode, but they have all the rules of the NBA and pose a challenge. 
 Teams and players will perform as you'd expect. There might be the odd occurrence, like Hornicek 
 missing two free throws, but I chalk those up to the randomness of the game's calculations. For 
 the most part, teams that suck will suck, and players that rock will consistently post MVP-like 
 numbers. Gameplay has also been tweaked some so that losing AI players don't constantly foul in 
 the final minutes, which essentially gives the already winning team a chance for two more points. 

 When you strip away all the great new graphics and new season play, the core of the game is still 
 great fun. NBA Live 99 is a fantastic game to play with others, especially on the same screen, 
 where you can trash-talk after a monster dunk (hotseat, modem, and LAN play are supported) . The 
 game is still fast and fun basketball action, with some coaching options for making substitutions 
 and calling play guidelines, but when the rock is in your hands, it's just you, the basket, and 
 your hoop dreams. Like the NBA says, "I love this game."

Review:  The previous games of the NBA series were pretty good, but having their own minor ifs and buts. 
 While 99 is not an exception, this year it adds many new crucial features which changed forever 
 basketball sims. First of all it is the brand-new, amazing NBA season. You can select a team, adjust 
 some options and launch it, playing each game you want, and leave the others to be simulated by 
 the CPU. In Live 99 there is also a better graphics machine, which makes animation smoother, and 
 now the players are almost the same as in real world. However, these animations and 3D features 
 won't last for long, unless you are very lucky or you havean extra-powerful machine to play NBA 
 Live 99. Added to the game are the practice mode, which will help newbies to get to the beat of 
 NBA, and a multiple-season mode, which won't live up to your expectations after the first season. 
 Apart from new features, NBA has improved the AI shown into the court. The CPU takes advantage 
 of all the statistics on defense and offense so simulation mode is toughened a bit. Finally, there 
 is a significantly improved multiplayer mode, where online play is even more easy to get into. 
 All these make NBA Live 99 not to be core-different from the previous titles, but it seems that 
 the revolution has just started.

Review:  The game is a nice and familiar ride in the basketball world which has been done three times before 
 and now another 10 times more. the game it self tries incredibly hard to stick to what real basketball 
 is like and does a good job of it. The great create a player and create a team modes make the game 
 very easy to navigate and the easy to access rosters are changable and tradeable. the access to 
 phone lines and instant NBA scores coupled with a pretty much infinite amount of save slots make 
 the game a very fun really interactive experience. a great multiplayer which is made better by 
 joystick support is a really nice additiion too. the game is an incredibly fun time in any mode 
 with one, two, three or four player modes. The game is just plain great in a disc and box.
  
  The Good. --
  Great graphics, good sound, really great multiplayer, instant phone and score 
 access.
  
  The Bad. --
  The graphics and controls can sometimes stuff up.
  
  Graphics: 9/10
  Sound: 9/10
  Controls: 8/10
  Real Score: 9.7/10
