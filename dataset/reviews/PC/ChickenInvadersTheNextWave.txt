-------------------------------------------------
:::The Good:::
 Plenty of levels and weapons.
 Colorful, cartoony graphics.
 Solid controls.
-------------------------------------------------
:::The Bad:::
 Repetitive--and not in a good way.
 Some occasionally stupid issues, like enemy fire blending in where it oughtn't.
 For being as goofy as it is, it isn't a very funny game.

:::Review:::
Because the first Chicken Invaders was so great, it needed a sequel, right? Right? Hello? 

  Tired of blasting alien invaders? How about a twist of the poultry variety? Chicken Invaders: 
 The Next Wave makes no bones about its inspirations. This game takes the concepts of all the great 
 old-school arcade shooters like Space Invaders and Asteroids and wraps them into a colorfully designed 
 shooter that feels like it could have just as easily been a free flash game.  

  Your mouse controls the trusty little ship, and the two mouse buttons launch your primary weapons 
 and extra-special missiles. You'll find yourself fighting Space Invaders-like waves of hostile 
 chickens, periodically shooting down asteroids, bosses and other craziness in the process. It's 
 a goofy game, but an occasionally challenging one -- sometimes because it actually shows flashes 
 of understanding of what makes a good shooter, and other times because it opts to make the color 
 of the enemy fire (white, because they're eggs, get it?) blend in with all the other kookiness 
 going on onscreen, thus making it stupidly difficult to actually see where the fire is coming from. 

  Shooter fans will likely garner some amusement from Chicken Invaders: The Next Wave, but they won't 
 want to pay full price for it. It's a legitimate distraction that wears pretty thin pretty quickly, 
 and there just isn't a compelling enough product here to really make it worth your time.

Review:  It's a simple game but very addictive. I found myself unable to stop until I beat the whole thing. 
 After that, I had to see how high a score I could possibly get. The controls are functional and 
 can be configured to taste. When I first discovered the original game, I thought it was fun and 
 with a good sense of humor. When the next wave cam out, so did my credit card. I bought both the 
 original and the Christmas edition for myself and my wife (also addicted) . It's not a game that 
 you will play for months on end or even weeks, but it is a welcome distraction from the Guild life 
 in virtually any MMO. I still find myself going back to this game on a regular basis. In fact, 
 that's what inspired this little review. I opened up the laptop last night and low and behold, 
 it still hasn't made it to the unused icon's folder. Sometimes it's the simple things that can 
 allow for some of the greatest pleasures.
