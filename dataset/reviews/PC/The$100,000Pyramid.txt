:::Review:::
Sierra's PC adaptation of The $100,000 Pyramid seeks to recapture the heyday of television game 
 shows, yet only as a four-player party game is it successful. 

  In the beginning, there were shows like What's My Line? and I've Got A Secret. Today, we have ratings 
 dynamos such as Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? and ageless wonders such as Jeopardy!. Yet one of 
 television's most successful game shows wasn't there in the formative years of the medium, nor 
 is it with us today. Originally airing in 1973 as the $10,000 Pyramid and culminating in the inflation-ridden 
 early 1990s as the $100,000 Pyramid, it garnered no fewer than nine Emmys during its 18-year run. 
 Now, Sierra On-Line seeks to recapture the glory days of TV game shows in its own virtual replication 
 of the program, aptly entitled The $100,000 Pyramid. It succeeds, but only if you have enough friends 
 gathered together to take advantage of its multiplayer element.           Only four characters 
 are available to choose from.    

  The concept behind the original Pyramid was simple. Each game featured two civilian players, both 
 of whom were paired with a celebrity partner. The two-part process began with the basic game, wherein 
 the two combating teams would alternately choose from six unrelated categories, each of which contained 
 a total of seven "answers." With the clock running, one partner was asked to supply verbal "clues" 
 to the other, who would in turn attempt to guess the correct answer. The team with the most points 
 at the end of the basic game was then granted access to the winner's circle, where six substantially 
 more challenging answers awaited. If you gave a half-dozen correct responses in the winner's circle, 
 you'd walk away with a mighty large jackpot.   

  The PC version of Pyramid opens in much the same manner as its televised predecessor, with rotating 
 cameras peering down on a flashy but darkened stage and garish graphics cascading across the screen. 
 Music blares, the announcer barks out his preamble, and the studio audience goes wild. Yet as exhilarating 
 as the opening sequence is, the bulk of the game is not nearly so visually impressive.   

  With the exception of an occasional interlude where the camera pans across a barren stage, Pyramid 
 is a flat 2D world. You'll choose from one of just four generic personas, each of which is merely 
 a minimally animated head positioned in the upper corner of the screen. Answers and clues appear 
 on the monitor without much flash, and you don't get the sense that you're in the studio. This 
 simplistic presentation does little to inspire images of the original show.   

  The game's audio fares a bit better. Crowd noise ebbs and flows realistically throughout, and the 
 music evokes memories of Pyramid's post-disco heyday. Unfortunately, the unseen announcer is often 
 way off the mark. He'll spout such lines as "Don't worry, I'm sure you'll bounce back next time" 
 or "Don't blame yourself, that was a tough category" after a near-perfect round. And his weak attempts 
 at humor are as repetitive as they are unfunny.   

  None of the above would really matter if the gameplay were truly stimulating, yet Pyramid simply 
 doesn't reach the heights of its television counterpart. The game's biggest downfall may be its 
 faithfulness to the original formula. As you play, you'll soon realize that the television program 
 generated much of its excitement through the distinct possibility that ordinary people could win 
 obscene amounts of money. As there's nothing here to compensate for the lack of real prizes, the 
 game itself comes across as being somewhat ordinary.   

  Single-player and two-player Pyramid are particularly disappointing. In these modes your imaginary 
 celebrity partner offers verbal clues, pausing and thinking in much the same way a real person 
 would under the same circumstances. Thusly, you are compelled to continually play the part of the 
 designated answerer, and as such must suffer through your virtual partner's preset speech patterns 
 and the game developer's preprogrammed series of clues. If you don't like the clues, there's nothing 
 you can do about it.   

  Worse still, the game forces you to manually type in your answers one letter at a time. This is 
 a daunting task for anyone unfamiliar with the keyboard, especially with the added challenge of 
 a constantly ticking clock. Granted, it will automatically correct some spelling errors and finish 
 particularly lengthy responses for you, but it may just as likely reject a perfectly plausible 
 answer. That it doesn't accept keystrokes for a full second after you've entered an incorrect answer 
 causes even more problems.           The game follows the formula of its TV counterpart a little 
 too closely.    

  Conversely, Pyramid's four-player party mode does away with virtual partners and typing altogether, 
 and as such is quite enjoyable. One human teammate faces the screen and provides verbal clues to 
 another human teammate who faces away from the screen and supplies verbal answers. The process 
 continues until all six categories are done and the victorious team heads to the winner's circle. 
 In this mode, Pyramid works like a virtual board game, and a very good one at that.   

  With four players, The $100,000 Pyramid is a light but entertaining diversion. But if you don't 
 plan on having this many contestants at a time, you'd be well advised to steer clear of Pyramid 
 and pick up the latest copy of You Don't Know Jack instead.

Review:  WHy is this is my list of games.. Well cause it was one of many I got free with a magazine.
  
  PLay it, not much, why, cause game shows suck and I can't be bothered with games that are predictably 
 random..
  
  Graphics, well ported from C64 presumably.
  
  It would keep some people entertained, but then there's Microsoft's Mine Sweeper which .... mmmm 
 .... okay ..... maybe not.... Shouldn't complain about a free product... It would also be advisable 
 to grab 3 friends as they can help you thru the 5 minutes or so you'll be playing this for, or 
 you can play by yourself and try and beat your imaginary friend, Harvey the rabbit.
