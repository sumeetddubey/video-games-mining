:::Review:::
The excellent story, unique puzzles, and addictive swordplay help make Redguard an immensely rich 
 and enjoyable adventure. 

 With Redguard, Bethesda Softworks set out to create the "swashbuckling action-adventure epic of 
 a lifetime." While technical glitches and clunky controls prevent the game from attaining such 
 a lofty goal, the excellent story, unique puzzles, and addictive swordplay help make Redguard an 
 immensely rich and enjoyable adventure.  

 You play Cyrus, a battle-scarred mercenary on self-imposed exile from his home in Hammerfell. After 
 hearing that your sister Iszara has vanished from the war-torn island of Stros M'kai, you are determined 
 to find and rescue her despite the long-standing friction between you. Attacked by pirates on your 
 way to the island and faced with an Imperial occupation force upon your arrival, you begin to realize 
 that things are not at all well on Stros M'kai. Even worse, you eventually discover that Iszara 
 was caught up in the recent troubles on the island, and you become embroiled in a well-developed 
 plot involving rebellion, revenge, and, of course, lots of good old-fashioned swashbuckling bravado. 

 The game is played from a third-person perspective and, as a result, suffers from the ever-problematic 
 floating-camera woes. For most of the game the camera angle is just fine, but on more than a few 
 occasions I found my view completely blocked because I happened to be too close to a wall. This 
 problem was especially annoying during two of the game's most important conflicts (one with the 
 dark elf Dram and one with the wormy N'Gasta) . To its credit, Redguard does allow you to customize 
 the amount of camera glide and the camera combat angle, but this only helps a little when you have 
 to fight your way out of a tight corridor.  

 While you do have to draw your sword and fight quite a few blackguardly knaves in this game, it 
 is still very much an adventure game. The heart of Redguard lies in its intricate and often unique 
 puzzles. For example, that sword won't help much when you run into the springy mushrooms of the 
 goblin caverns or the revolving hallways of the catacombs. A few of the puzzles - the dwarven scarab 
 in particular - are exceptionally challenging, while others are fairly basic. For the most part, 
 the puzzles are very well integrated into the plot. Some are based almost solely on your agility, 
 and these are the ones that are most likely to cause frustration.  

 Simply put, the controls in this game are poor. You can use a gamepad or joystick to play the game, 
 but neither is very intuitive. Unfortunately, your only other option is the keyboard. Why there 
 is no mouse control is beyond me. Timing and executing even the simplest of jumps with the keyboard 
 is quite a challenge, while a number of necessary tasks (jumping onto a rope, climbing on top of 
 objects) are more difficult than they should be in several areas. Worse, sword fights often degenerate 
 into a key-mashing mess as you try to sidestep, defend, and attack in quick succession. If nothing 
 else, Bethesda should have included separate keys for sidestepping left and right.  

 For much of the game, however, you'll spend the bulk of your time talking to the island's residents 
 about the strange goings-on and inquiring about your sister's whereabouts. This is where the game 
 both shines the brightest and disappoints the most. On the positive side, the game offers a slew 
 of NPCs to talk to, each with an exhaustive list of topics to discuss. Fortunately, the game tracks 
 any important comments in an automated log because you'd be hard-pressed to remember even one-tenth 
 of what these folks tell you. Each NPC has a distinct personality and conversational style, and 
 that helps convey a sense of immersion in the gameworld. The dialogue is well written, with a few 
 conversational gems here and there.  

 Unfortunately, a great many of the NPC voices are horribly annoying - or just plain goofy. One guy, 
 Favis the bell ringer, sounds as if he stepped out of the old Fat Albert cartoon, while the blue-bonneted 
 Mariah is certain to be remembered as one of the most hated computer game NPCs of all time (perhaps 
 in recognition of this, Bethesda built in an Easter egg method for venting your feelings towards 
 Mariah) . Don't even get me started about the Daedra Lord.... During sword fights (which are a lot 
 of fun, even with the control problem) , your opponents will taunt you and react to your attacks. 
 Most of these comments are pretty good (I still chuckle at the guy who yells "Damn your eyes!") , 
 though they can get repetitive in a hurry. The big bad governor is the worst offender of repetitive 
 taunts, as he basically just tells you to "Reconsider your options, knave" over and over.  

 By far the most annoying aspect of NPC conversations, however, is the fact that the game tends 
 to distort all speech when you use a PCI sound card. Most likely, this has to do with Redguard's 
 use of a dated DOS core inside of a Windows 95 "wrapper." Whatever the cause, the result is a stuttering 
 sound similar to an old elementary school film projector that's acting up. The problem comes and 
 goes unpredictably, and, although I honestly didn't really mind it much once I turned on the subtitles, 
 it is certain to annoy the hell out of some gamers. As I wrapped up this review, Bethesda indicated 
 that they may have discovered the source of the problem, but that it still may not be patchable. 

 Though the graphics in Redguard do not compare to those in games like Half-Life or Heretic II, the 
 3Dfx-enhanced XnGine looks awfully good. The software renderer, on the other hand, is not very 
 impressive, but it is the only option for non-3Dfx users. Since the game still relies on DOS code 
 for its renderer, a Direct3D version or patch is unlikely.   

 Still, the level of detail in the game is impressive. The port city, the surrounding countryside, 
 and the various other sites you'll visit are all well designed and immersive. You are free to wander 
 wherever you choose, and, except for a few key plot points, you can visit important locations in 
 just about any order. Also, the game locations are nicely varied, and some, such as the Dwarven 
 Observatory, are simply breathtaking. The game does suffer from clipping problems, and I did find 
 a few "black hole" spots (the infamous areas from Daggerfall where players fell through the floor 
 into a black abyss) , but overall the world of Redguard looks very good. Nice lighting effects, 
 ample and good-looking foliage (so often overlooked) , and stunning architecture are some of the 
 game's graphical highlights. NPC models and textures are decent but pretty plain on the whole. 
 One character - the Boba Fett-like Dram - stood out as being particularly cool looking.  

 The ultimate game of swashbuckling adventure? Not quite, but Redguard is an impressive adventure 
 game and one that ranks among the year's best. While the sound problems and the awkward controls 
 will turn off a number of players, patient gamers with a penchant for puzzles and Errol Flynn movies 
 will find a lot to like in the intricate world of Redguard.

Review:  An Elder Scrolls fan? Hey, even if you have justplayed Morrowind and Oblivion this game is crying 
 out for your attention and you should be gagging for it! It sweeps you into the world of Tamriel 
 (Hammerfall to be precise!) , immerses you in an adventure wher already know a little about the 
 world and the races and the history and does not let go until the end!
  
  For a game that is over 5 years old the graphics will astound you. You will need a 3fdx wrapper 
 as you need to see the game in it's 3dfx glory (dgvoodoo works for me!) and a CD slowdown for your 
 fast CD drive (cdspeed 2000 did that for me!) , but having got the necessary accessories, you will 
 be able to play this game in upto 1280x1024! 
  
  Now don't ge me wrong. The graphics are astounding for the time. Theya re not Far Cry 2004 graphics 
 or anywhere near it, but when you see your ship sail into harbour and walk off the ship to see 
 a gigantic statue looming over you with the sun glaring behind it you will be pleasantly surprised 
 that this will not be an old old game with old old graphics! Yes, everything is a little blocky, 
 especially the NPC's, but because the story is so could the puzzle so capitvating and the conversations 
 so well done the blockyness goes away and it becomes a town on an island witth great characters, 
 politcs and intrege! You will be drawn in an all will become real, just like in any great game, 
 book or movie.
  
  The game doesn't support a mouse, but I managed okay with the keyboard, standard arrow keys and 
 left hand keys for actions did the business for me.
  
  To say, as many reviewers have, that you should think 'Tomb Raider' is to say thatyou should think 
 'The Good The Bad and the Ugly' when your reading 'War and Peace'! Yes, you jump, climb rope and 
 hang from various outcrops, but you also have great swordfights, deal with hstory level politics 
 and intrege (if you floow the Elder Scrolls myth!) and the baddest of bad Goblins and undead and 
 the nicest of Khajits and Argonians! :)
  
  You are out to find your Sister who has not be seen for three months. Has she been dealt with for 
 being friends with the conquered Prince? Or has she got involved with shady pirates? As you follow 
 the clues to her whereabouts so you get drawn into a story that will captivate you in the Elder 
 Scrolls mythos.
  
  All the NPC's are voice acted and they are done very well. Cryus, the main character (you) is one 
 of the few black male characters in video gaming that is not a characture. He sounds very much 
 like a future blade who will end up protecting old Kings and new Kings in other parts of Tamriel! 
 :)
  
  The music does the business, being 'swashbuckling' when needed and softer in the sadder moments. 
 It all works very well. As does the sound effects with the seagulls and sloshing water in the port 
 area to very weird noises from a graveyard at night (if you dare go there at night!)
  
  The game is quite hard but not impossible and with 30-60 hours pf play, I can highly recommend 
 it !
  
  This game has the looks, the sounds and the story to take you even further into the Elder Scrolls 
 story and if you have played Morrowind or Oblivion (or indeed the earlier Elder Scrolls games) 
 you will feel right at home with the Island, the history and the characters. It will fill out the 
 Tamriel world that little more!
  
  The game is quite hard to find, but you do occasionally find it on online auction sites. If you 
 do find it, snap it up - it will take you back into the world of Tamriel and give you a rollicking 
 ride on the Island of Stros M'kai!
