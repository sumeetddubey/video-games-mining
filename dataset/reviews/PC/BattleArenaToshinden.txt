News flash: The PC version of Battle Arena Toshinden isn't as good as the PlayStation version.

 News flash: The PC version of Battle Arena Toshinden isn't as good as the PlayStation version. Go 
 figure. But even if you're using a run-of-the-mill graphics card, Battle Arena has some of the 
 best 3-D graphics around. Unfortunately, to really play the head-to-head fighting game you either 
 have to work the keyboard faster than a receptionist on speed, or give up some serious maneuvering 
 action if you go with a standard game pad. Either way can leave you fumbling for power when the 
 battle gets heated.  

 Fans of the PlayStation version will feel right at home with the storyline and characters. All the 
 same characters are here, all with the same missionbeat the crap out of everyone. Like several 
 other fighting games, each of the eight characters brings his or her own special weapons. Mondo, 
 an ancient Japanese warrior, wields a big spear. Rungo, an American miner, bumbles around loudly 
 and carries a big stick. But the coolest feature of each character is their secret powers and desperation 
 moves. With the PlayStation version, using a secret power only takes a couple of pad and button 
 clicks. On the PC version, it's nearly impossible. For instance, one of Mondo's moves is to fly 
 up in the air and shoot down fireballs, laying waste to whomever is underneath. The special key-combination 
 for his move is: d, sd, s, sa, a+rlet's see you remember that the next time you're in the 
 heat of battle. And if you use a gamepad, you can't use the special power at all.  

 Battle Arena Toshinden's one saving grace is that it's completely networkable, either through directly-networked 
 computers or modem, so you can beat down people around the world. While the graphics and music 
 to Battle Arena are great, actual play could be vastly improved.

Review:  Battle Arena Toshinden is a fighting game similar to Soul Blade and Virtua Fighter but with horrible 
 graphics. The fighters look well designed and even has a hidden fighter Earthworm Jim! To me the 
 Earthworm Jim fighter was a pretty good suprise with his weapon which is a Cave Man's stick but 
 he just doent fit in an anime game dont you all think? The gameplay is not really good from what 
 I expected from the PS1 version but the sound was satisfactory. This game will recieve a poor rating 
 because it will dissapoint the PS1 fans from playing this horrible conversion of this game.

  come on!, can a game could be so bad? i hope so but not, this game is totally bad, it doesnt have 
 the minimum requires to be an acceptable game, you cant win at any moment, because the opponent 
 always know the special tricks and hits, and you only can beat him with "k" and no more. this game 
 really is a waste of money and time, if youre thinking about buying this game, first: i hope you 
 will find it, second: if you found it, its gonna be a copy, and third: the game wouldnt cost less 
 than 15 dollars, and really, i wouldnt pay this price for a game like this.
