:::Review:::
The gameplay in Conquest of the Underworld is very formulaic, despite the generally high quality 
 of the map designs. 

 Heroes Chronicles: Conquest of the Underworld is the second of four planned commercial installments 
 of an episodic, story-driven series based on New World Computing's successful fantasy-themed, turn-based 
 strategy game, Heroes of Might and Magic III. As with other Heroes Chronicles, this one features 
 a campaign of eight successive missions that make up one of the adventures of an immortal hero 
 named Tarnum. And similarly, Conquest of the Underworld recycles most of the same exact graphics, 
 sound effects, and gameplay elements from last year's Heroes of Might and Magic III and its subsequent 
 expansions.   

  In Conquest of the Underworld, you play as the proud barbarian king, Tarnum. However, the immortal 
 hero has returned in the guise of a knight; he's pledged to the queen that he will travel down 
 into the underworld and rescue her father's soul, which was literally kidnapped from paradise - 
 as portrayed in the game's introductory cinematic. But Tarnum is reluctant to help the queen, because 
 her father was actually the man who slew the barbarian in his previous life. During the course 
 of the game, Tarnum must come to terms with the fact that he's helping the man who killed him - 
 just as he must discover why the queen seems so familiar. It's an interesting story, but unfortunately 
 it's revealed simply through static text windows that appear after every few game turns. Nevertheless, 
 these first-person narratives do successfully tie the game's eight missions together, and the story 
 does provide a suitable incentive to keep playing the game until you finish it - which should be 
 no more than 20 hours after you've started.   

  You must play through the eight missions one after another, and they're designed to be manageable 
 for beginners yet still challenging at higher difficulty settings for more-experienced Heroes of 
 Might and Magic players. To the game's credit, each mission does have its own distinctive style 
 and layout - but each still retains the same basic objectives: You must gather resources, build 
 new structures in your town, recruit more troops, and vanquish any enemy heroes that stand in your 
 way. This all should be very familiar to anyone who's played a Heroes of Might and Magic game. 
 Still, a few notable aspects of the Conquest of the Underworld campaign help make it more enjoyable 
 than you might expect. For one thing, Tarnum retains all his experience levels and spells as he 
 proceeds from mission to mission, and this gives the missions a fairly strong sense of continuity. 
 Typically he'll also carry over with your two second-strongest heroes, and during the course of 
 the campaign, Tarnum has the option to assemble an extremely powerful artifact. Finding the six 
 pieces that make up this device will become at least as much of an incentive to keep playing as 
 anything else. Having assembled the device, Tarnum's armies will seem practically invincible toward 
 the conclusion of the game.   

  Part of the reason Tarnum seems so powerful is that, in most missions, he will start with a castle 
 town and have access to its troops. The castle town is one of the strongest of all the various 
 town types featured in Heroes of Might and Magic III: Sturdy units such as pikemen and archers 
 make up the lower ranks, while monks, cavaliers, and the all-powerful angels will become available 
 later - but they won't render the relatively weaker units obsolete. You'll lead armies of these 
 against the evil forces of three other types of towns that you'll find scattered through the underworld: 
 the inferno, necropolis, and dungeon towns. You'll find that the undead units of the necropolis 
 will be particularly vulnerable to you, as later in the game, you'll probably be powerful enough 
 to smite huge groups of them with just a single destroy undead spell. On the other hand, the cursed 
 terrain that usually surrounds necropolis towns prevents the use of high-level spells, so you won't 
 be able to rely on your magic all the time.   

  However, you'll constantly rely on the same sorts of skills, strategies, and tricks, all of which 
 you will pick up on early in the game or will already know if you've played Heroes of Might and 
 Magic III before. That is to say that the gameplay in Conquest of the Underworld is very formulaic, 
 despite the generally high quality of the map designs. In addition, Conquest of the Underworld 
 offers no real replay value once you finish it, and it doesn't have much to offer players who are 
 new to Heroes of Might and Magic, since it's just as accessible and easy to play as every other 
 game in the series. Instead, this second Heroes Chronicles game is most suitable for those who 
 liked the story in the first one, Warlords of the Wasteland. These die-hard Heroes of Might and 
 Magic fans will enjoy Tarnum's journey through the underworld, if not because it's a fairly good 
 story, then because it's an addition to the Might and Magic canon.

Review:  Conquest of the underworld is a unique gaming experience it has some strategy elements as well 
 as some rpg elements. In one part of the game you are building in your castle so you can recruit 
 more monsters to fight along side you in battles. I wish there was more freedom in how you built 
 inside of your castle ( the game chooses where to put all of your buildings) .
  Also I wish there was more battles inside of your castles because I found that to be one of the 
 better parts of the game. 
  
  Your character ( or characters) can explore the map finding gold mines, crystal mines and other 
 stuff like that however I found the layout of most maps a bit tedious because you would have to 
 backtrack just to get to a new area thats right beside you. Your character can also learn some 
 spells but I found them to be quite useless.
  
  The battles are quite fun but can get a bit repetitive. It might have helped if you didn't have 
 to battle the same group of monsters to get into almost every different area of the map (there 
 are different types of maps) .
  In the battles you have to place your monsters where you want them and then basically move them 
 up until you can attack the other monsters. You can also buy extras for battles such as catapults 
 and a medical tent. But as I said the battles can get quite repetitive really fast.
  
  This game is great if you can find a budget pack with all four of the heroes chronicles game but 
 if your going to spend more than 10 dollars on this one game go out and find another budget game.
