Full Tilt! 2 Pinball, regardless of its minor flaws, hoots and dings with the best of them. 

 
 It is a daunting choice: Do you save the planet, build a monster, or capture humans and abduct 
 them to an alien world? Well, if you're handy with a flipper, you can do all three.  

 Play Full Tilt! 2 Pinball's Captain Hero table and save the day, win the girl, and repair damaged 
 city buildings, battling bad guys all the while. Fight for right against Quake, Slime, Mystman, 
 Mr. Pling, and the Mad Scientist with the Midas touch (he turns your balls gold) . In Alien Daze 
 the pinball flies up off the table and somehow manages to trap unsuspecting humans in Han Solo-esque 
 carbonite casings - if you play your flippers right. And if you aim your ball squarely into the 
 special hole in Mad Scientist, you win a brain (and later arms, legs, etc.) for your poor, monstrous 
 creature. These are not new themes, or even particularly exciting ones (in fact, the Mad Scientist 
 comes replete with the stereotypical German accent - aren't there ever any mad scientists from 
 Brazil or Canada or Gambia?) . What these games are, however, is good, old-fashioned, campy fun. 
   

 Each table has the usual complement of bells and whistles, entertaining sounds, and short monologues 
 ("You're my hero" - sigh) , and excellent and realistic ball physics. A few, simple keystrokes 
 accomplish most flipper/ball functions and the gameplay is definitely good. Bonuses are plentiful, 
 and varied enough to keep you entertained for a significant amount of time. From a gameplay point 
 of view, Maxis' pinball sim really works.  

 This is not to say that the game is perfect. As guiltily admitted in the manual, the sound sometimes 
 causes a freeze in the gameplay. Maxis' recommendation is to turn the sound off; mine is to leave 
 it on and deal with the occasional glitches - pinball isn't pinball without the noise, and the 
 occasional freezes are few and far between (only Captain Hero froze on my system) . The truly bothersome 
 flaw is the tilt. Hit one key to nudge the table left, another to nudge it right. Hold it too long 
 and you tilt. Hold it too short and you lose your ball. Too long and too short, however, are arbitrary 
 terms in this game. Tilting either happens in the blink of an eye or so long after you've been 
 nudging that the whole table should have been knocked over ages ago.   

 But when the gameplay is good and the physics are real (and they are here) , what separates a good 
 pinball sim from a great one is the table character: what the bonuses are, who the characters are 
 - basically how the bells ding and the whistles hoot. Full Tilt! 2 Pinball, regardless of its minor 
 flaws, hoots and dings with the best of them. And there's not much you can add to that.
