:::Review:::
Longtime flight-sim fans will take to the realism of A-10 Cuba! like ducks to water, and forgive 
 it its shortcomings. 

 It's one thing to create an ultra-realistic flight simulation, but it's quite another to design 
 it so that novice to intermediate pilots won't feel intimidated. And while it's great for a sim 
 to be as realistic as possible - it would be slammed by every serious flight sim fanatic in the 
 world if it weren't - that doesn't mean there's no place for options that allow newbies to fine-tune 
 the degree of realism, or for a well-organized manual to help them understand the myriad weapons, 
 gauges, and controls on a modern attack jet. And for it to qualify as a first-rate product, it 
 also needs features such as a mission editor, wingmen you can communicate with, and a campaign 
 mode, to name a few.  

 A-10 Cuba!, which bills itself as both an "ultra-realistic flight simulation" and "the most realistic 
 flight combat simulator ever," is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. Without question, 
 A-10 Cuba! employs a very realistic flight model, and the air-combat action - which ranges from 
 tank-killing sorties and escort missions to a bridge-busting assignment and a strike on an enemy 
 commander's home - is fast, furious, and very satisfying.   

 The cockpit display is one of the most impressively detailed I've ever seen, and what's more, it 
 is actually interactive: You can toggle switches and turn knobs via the mouse. And while gamers 
 accustomed to texture-mapped extravaganzas might sneer at the polygon-based graphics here, they 
 do make for a stunningly impressive frame rate - even running at 1024x768 - and the planes look 
 pretty good, especially from an external view.  

 But in several crucial areas, A-10 Cuba! falls short of the competition. Its most glaring deficiency 
 is the lack of a printed manual; the only documents you get with this game are the registration 
 card, a layout of the keyboard commands, an order form for ThrustMaster flight sticks, and an almost 
 worthless jewel-case insert that's woefully thin on useful information. The latter contains a screenshot 
 with captions describing various cockpit flight instruments, but the picture and text are both 
 so small you'd need a magnifying glass to get any real use out of it.  

 To be fair, A-10 Cuba! does come with online Help, but there's just too much information here to 
 be covered adequately in this format - and if you stay in the Help file too long while the game 
 is running, you'll be kicked out by a demo that you can't disable. This simply doesn't cut it for 
 a flight sim, especially one that boasts how "ultra-realistic" it is. Novice and even intermediate 
 flight-sim fans need a manual they can keep at their side for quick reference, and novices especially 
 would benefit from a "basics of flight" type tutorial - the kind that's found in the manual of 
 many PC air-combat sims.  

 Other common features are missing, too. There's no specific support for popular four-button flight 
 sticks such as the CH FlightStick Pro or the Microsoft SideWinder 3D Pro - or if there is I couldn't 
 find it in the Help file. (Then again, the numerous keyboard commands almost dictate using some 
 type of programmable stick or throttle.) While the 12 combat missions are varied and exciting, 
 and the game's AI routines for enemy forces guarantee that no single mission will pan out the same 
 way twice, that doesn't change the fact that there are only 12 missions - a pretty sparse amount 
 for a flight sim. The situation is made even worse by the lack of a mission editor.  

 There's no way to communicate with wingmen; no way to change your waypoints; no campaign mode (except 
 to play the 12 combat missions in order) ; no way to access a mission briefing during a sortie; 
 no "auto-navigate" feature to guide you to a waypoint; no toggle for stalls; no variable difficulty 
 modes; and no option to skip take-off and start in the air (though many targets are so close by 
 you might want to take off just to make the experience last longer) .  

 It's true that A-10 Cuba! carries a very low sticker price - and if you trade in a copy of A-10 
 Tank Killer, Silent Thunder: A-10 Tank Killer II, ATF, AH64 LongBow, F-22 Lightning, SU-27, or 
 EF2000, Activision will send you a check for $15, which means you could get this game for as little 
 as $14 or $15. Considering the fun to be had dogfighting over a LAN or modem, that really boosts 
 the value rating.   

 Longtime flight-sim fans will take to the realism of A-10 Cuba! like ducks to water, and forgive 
 it its shortcomings - easy to do with a sim offering such an authentic flight model and intense 
 combat missions. But if you're relatively new to the genre, you might want to try a sim that allows 
 graduated levels of realism and more features, and includes a printed manual.

Review:  Excluding the bad graphics, this game is brilliant! I bought it in 1997 and I still prefer it to 
 every other flight sim I have played on. Most of the features this game contains are very realistic. 
 The games difficulty is just right because of the option to turn invincibility and infinite cannon 
 ammo on and off.
  The game has 4 training and 12 'proper' levels which cover everything from air to air combat to 
 strafing annoyingly small tanks and dropping laser guided bombs. The missions vary in difficulty, 
 some easy, others like the last level, are annoyingly hard.
  The damage your A-10 'Tankbuster' can take is realistic (as far I as I know) . You can activate 
 a checklist thing which tells you what is Okay and what has been damaged (if you can't see it already) . 
 The visible damage is good and your plane can lose engines, wing tips, tails and landing gear. 
 The only thing I haven't got to the Malfunction setting yet the the gun (i think it's impossible) . 
 If you ever get this game, I highly recommend you read the instructions (which install with the 
 game) as some of the controls are quite advanced. It took me over a year to work out that F1 to 
 11 arm the weapons. The game is a masterpiece in my opinion but there are probably modern flight 
 sims which I haven't played on which are just as good.
  To conclude, If you get a chance to play this game, take it. It won't cost more than a few pennies.

Review:  I enjoyed this game simply because it lets you fly a plane that hasn't really been used at all 
 in flight sims, the A-10. You'll fly missions against tanks, airfields and much more, using quite 
 a wide range of customizable weapons and settings. It takes a little bit to figure out how to turn 
 on the engines and figure out all the controls but once you get the hang of it, its pretty fun.
 
  Don't get me wrong though, I mean its fun if you live in the 90's. The game was good back in the 
 day, but now theres so much more out there.
