:::Review:::
It's a great idea for an expansion pack that unfortunately doesn't breathe enough new life into 
 Zoo Tycoon to appeal to anyone but die-hard fans. 

 Dinosaur Digs is a great idea for an expansion pack. What better way to make your zoo bigger, more 
 fantastical, and more dramatic than to give it a Jurassic-sized infusion of new life? What could 
 be more exotic than a fern-choked exhibit with a pack of crafty velociraptors behind electrified 
 fences? What could be more disastrous than a tyrannosaurus rex on the loose, chowing down on screaming 
 guests? There are almost two dozen new creatures (including some Ice Age mammals thrown in among 
 the dinosaurs) , a new set of buildings, and a few new staff members to handle it all. And while 
 these are all well and good, they unfortunately don't breathe enough new life into Zoo Tycoon to 
 appeal to anyone but die-hard fans.           This isn't what the guests had in mind when feeding 
 time was announced.    

 With so many new additions, Dinosaur Digs' graphics are certainly different, but they aren't any 
 better. Zoo Tycoon still looks atrocious at the closest zoom level. With 2D artwork for only eight 
 directions, the bigger dinosaurs look all the more conspicuous snapping from one direction to another 
 instead of smoothly turning. And unfortunately, Dinosaur Digs barely changes the way Zoo Tycoon 
 is played. In the absence of any sort of hard numbers, building your zoo still calls for a lot 
 of guesswork. You have no way of knowing whether your guests will like the dinosaur cinema better 
 than the pteranodon house. Will they be happier with a lava archway or a triceratops skeleton? 
 This is particularly true with the exhibits, which required a lot of trial and error in the original 
 game in order to figure out how to make your animals happy. But with the expansion's new prehistoric 
 foliage, new kinds of rocks and shelters, and a menagerie of creatures with bewildering Latin names, 
 piecing together the right combinations seems more arbitrary than ever.   

  One nice change that Dinosaur Digs makes is how dinosaurs are raised rather than merely adopted 
 as fully-grown adults. You buy an egg, which has to be tended by a scientist. The egg hatches into 
 a juvenile dinosaur that eventually grows up. This gives Zoo Tycoon's creatures a sense of being 
 nurtured that you didn't get in the original Zoo Tycoon until your animals started breeding. Instead 
 of zookeepers, dinosaurs are fed and tended by scientists. The dinosaurs themselves are a bit different 
 from regular animals in that many of them require the more-imposing fences included in the expansion 
 pack. The reinforced concrete and especially the electrified iron bars provide a nice visual sense 
 that there's something very powerful on the other side. Some dinosaurs will trample trees and bushes 
 in their exhibits, so you have to arrange foliage behind rocks and water. However, these details 
 are minor. In the end, the dinosaurs don't play differently enough from the conventional animals. 
   

  The new content is threaded nicely into the original game. There are six new scenarios and a tutorial 
 specific to Dinosaur Digs. There are new filters to remove guests, foliage, or buildings, making 
 it easier to pick animals and staff members out of a crowd. A new screen on the main zoo status 
 display lets you track the profitability of commercial buildings like restaurants, theaters, and 
 gift shops. Although you can't use any of the dinosaur stuff in the original Zoo Tycoon scenarios, 
 you can load saved free-form zoos and add dinosaurs.           Less-than-optimal cage-mates.   

 One disappointing aspect of the game is how escapes are handled. Dinosaurs will eat people, but 
 only behind Zoo Tycoon's family-friendly puffs of smoke. You'd also think a dinosaur might accomplish 
 some Godzilla-level damage on buildings and landscaping, but instead they can just smash a few 
 of the smaller decorative items and structures around your zoo (there's a nice nod to  Jurassic 
 Park  when a dinosaur knocks over a rest room) . You can build a dinosaur recovery team that sets 
 out in a helicopter, carrying a sniper with a tranquilizer gun. But these guys seem superfluous 
 considering that you can also just pause the game, fix whatever fence was broken, and then pick 
 up the errant beast and drop him back in his cage. Rather than the catastrophe you'd expect, escaped 
 dinosaurs are more of an inconvenience.   

  Finally, Dinosaur Digs isn't nearly as visually or audibly rewarding as it could have been. Some 
 of the new decorations, such as dinosaur skeletons, erupting volcanoes, and steam geysers, look 
 great. The sound effects include some suitably menacing snarling, huffing, and roaring. But the 
 dinosaurs themselves aren't that interesting to watch. The spinosaurus, the huge dinosaur from 
  Jurassic Park III  with a sail fin on its back, is an imposing fellow, as are the stegosaurus 
 and brontosaurus. The tyrannosaurus is a little anticlimactic since he's so similar to the allosaurus. 
 The problem with these dinosaurs is that they just don't do very much. The caudipteryx, a distant 
 relative of the peacock, makes a nice show when flashing its colorful tail fan and arm feathers, 
 but the expansion doesn't offer anything as charming or lively as the tumbling pandas or rolling 
 tigers from the original Zoo Tycoon. Big lumbering beasts only provide so much visual excitement, 
 which is perhaps why many of the dinosaur exhibits aren't as attractive to the crowds as you might 
 expect, not to mention the gamers who shell out 20 bucks hoping to turn Zoo Tycoon into a lively 
  Jurassic Park  sim. Instead, they'll find what essentially amounts to a prehistoric face-lift.

Review:  those not as good as the original, (which you will need to be able to play dino digs) this game 
 is rather additive! It just about as fun as the first zoo tycoon, but you get way more animals 
 including cool dino dudes, and new extras. Some animals (dinos) are to hard to please, but you 
 just learn to stay away from those. Anyway the cheats make this game much more fun once you have 
 played for a while, like the $100,000 cheat, you can make the most coolest zoo with that kinda 
 money. Anyway if you get tired of it then you can always let loose a t-rex onto your gests!!
 
  Overall a different game that is good for anyone, any age.

Review:  You get to build your zoo, pick and take care of your animals and hire staff so you can run a zoo 
 and try to get the best ratings. It is pretty much like all the other zoo tycoons out there but 
 in this one you get dinosaur. They start out as eggs unlike most of the animal babies in the zoo 
 and you need more then just zoo keepers to take of these little guys. Some of the Dinosaurs are 
 a little harder to take care of and keep happy so keep and eye on that. The graphics are good and 
 so is the sound and the game play is great as well! A must Have!
