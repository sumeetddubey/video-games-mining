:::Review:::
Worms Blast can give any modern puzzle game a run for its money. 

 While it's changed publishers many times over the years, there's one thing that UK-based developer 
 Team17 has not changed, and that's been the formula to its critically and commercially successful 
 action strategy series, Worms. Now, after producing no fewer than seven Worms games using the same 
 basic premise, Team17 has applied the fun Worms style to a fast-paced puzzle game. The result is 
 a solid puzzler with an almost impeccable presentation.           Worms Blast has a clean, colorful 
 presentation...    

  Keep in mind, this is a Worms game only in name and appearance, but is the game itself has much 
 more in common with Taito's long-running Bust-A-Move puzzle series. In Worms Blast, you'll be presented 
 with a vertical playfield with an assortment of different-colored blocks along the top and your 
 character floating in a little canoe on the surface of the water below. Armed with a bazooka that 
 produces randomly colored ammunition, you'll want to launch ammo at blocks that match the color 
 of your blasts, which will make those blocks fall. The control is extraordinarily simple, giving 
 you horizontal movement across the surface of the water, vertical aim with the bazooka, and a single 
 fire button, all of which can be customized on the keyboard to your liking. Unlike in the Bust-A-Move 
 series, which has always maintained a very straightforward puzzle-game goal structure -- clear all 
 the blocks and win -- the goals in Worms Blast are not always simply to clear the field. In fact, 
 in many of the game's modes, clearing blocks is the byproduct of other, more-specific goals, and 
 in certain game types it's actually undesirable to clear them.   

  Worms Blast features single- and multiplayer modes, both of which can be a lot of fun. In the single-player 
 puzzle mode, you're presented with a world map, marked with different location points. Traveling 
 from point to point, you meet with a series of challenges, each one unique in its own way. Some 
 are as simple as clearing all the blocks in the field before time runs out, while others charge 
 you with clearing only certain colored blocks or clearing specific blocks using a limited number 
 of shots. Some don't involve clearing blocks at all, instead giving you the task of avoiding falling 
 objects or dodging a big stone snake that's slithering around the playfield. The puzzle mode presents 
 you with constantly changing goals and an extreme level of challenge. The difficulty is pretty 
 unforgiving from the beginning and can verge on being keyboard-smashingly frustrating. The game 
 gives you unlimited continues in this mode, but considering its otherwise kid-friendly presentation, 
 it's doesn't make much sense that the puzzle mode doesn't ramp up the difficulty more gradually. 
   

  The single-player tournament mode in Worms Blast is basically a collection of unconnected minigame 
 challenges, like shooting falling targets or clearing falling lines of blocks. Instead of giving 
 you a specific goal to reach, the tournament games just keep on going, with your aim being the 
 highest score possible. The tournament mode is more a diversion than anything else, and it isn't 
 really as compelling as either the puzzle or versus modes.   

  The multiplayer modes in Worms Blast are actually a bit more straightforward than the wild single-player 
 games. Each has its own objectives, like a rising water line or a goal of collecting more stars 
 than your opponent. But, this window dressing aside, the versus mode in Worms Blast comes down 
 to clearing more lines than your opponent and using offensive bonus power-ups, which you'll find 
 lodged among the colored blocks, to trip up the other guy. It's set up like a standard split-screen 
 puzzle game, with two separate playfields split down the middle. Interestingly, the dividing line 
 between the two fields will open up, presenting a gap through which you can launch attacks on your 
 opponent or on your opponent's blocks. This all makes for some good, competitive fun, which is 
 why it's that much more disappointing that Worms Blast only supports two players on a single computer, 
 with no LAN or online support. But if you happen to be playing the game by yourself, the AI will 
 put up a good fight in the versus mode.           ... and some of the best puzzle gameplay that's 
 been seen in a long time.    

  Worms Blast is the first game to render Team17's spineless heroes in three dimensions, but the 
 result, while certainly different from past Worms endeavors, retains the unique Worms style. The 
 characters look great, and though they're relatively small on the screen, they retain a fair amount 
 of detail, and the limited animations you'll see are also well done. All of the characters have 
 a flat-shaded look to them, which helps them to blend in with the game's otherwise two-dimensional 
 presentation. The backdrops for the action all appear to be hand painted, and their watercolor-inspired 
 look complements the lighthearted feel of the game nicely. The sound design is equally upbeat and 
 fun, sporting a catchy soundtrack and plenty of squeaky, high-pitched exclamations from the characters. 
 The weapon fire is decent and sounds as though it were lifted directly from a past Worms game. 
 It's doubtful that you'll marvel at the technology that powers the game, but what Worms Blast lacks 
 in raw technical prowess it makes up for with a clean, polished look and a very cohesive sense 
 of style.   

  Don't go into Worms Blast expecting another turn-based Worms strategy game. The gameplay is almost 
 fundamentally different in Worms Blast, but it maintains the bright and colorful style of a Worms 
 game, and fans of the series may enjoy Worms Blast on these merits alone. It may look cute and 
 innocuous, but Worms Blast can give any modern puzzle game a run for its money, so if you're a 
 fan of puzzle games, you should definitely give this one a try.

Review:  Blast? Again? C'mon. With the failure of Sonic 3D Blast, lets hope this is good - yes, it defently 
 is over-medicore.
  
  Multiplayer feels awful, so is the hard, annoying single player. For years you will be finding 
 out the puzzles, but they do defently look easy.
  
  Graphics. Very well done. Worms has done a great job at graphics. The colours feel all nice and 
 perfect, but what gives the crazy character designs? It's like they were doing a colour sketch 
 and publishing it into the game.
  
  Value. Good, like I said, fun, hard, looks easy.
  
  Sound - 2WYDHKDEDIUEFK. That means a  Mary Poppins' way 
 - poor. Just the annoying sounds make you quiver. gurgle.
  
  This isn't in my bad games list, it is in my decent games list. Worms Blast brings you the best 
 it can bring you in the GC version, which makes Worms Blast a essetial rent. Only for 3.90. Also 
 includes a Worms Pinball game.

 shoot stuff on each other... but after all its a nice game. . .
  even that its preaty lame and not have really somthing close to the game worms... just the bazooka 
 that you play with . . .so . . . . . . . . . but if you really want this game you can RENT it not 
 buy it . . .i think its to much waste if you buy it . . .
