Semper Fi is basically a platoon-level, turn-based, hex-based wargame depicting modern land warfare. 
 

 For over two hundred years the United States Marine Corps has had a number of duties, from functioning 
 as a continental landing force and a deterrent against mutiny aboard United States Navy vessels 
 to working as a wide-ranging global amphibious force meant to handle any mission thrown at it. 
 Today's turbulent world may have a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) conduct an amphibious landing 
 in hostile waters, rescue downed military personnel behind enemy lines, airlift civilian personnel 
 from a dangerous location, provide humanitarian support to those in need, or even provide security 
 or ground forces for larger purposes. A Marine commander must reflect the flexibility that is required 
 by his men - and it is this that developer Stanley Associates hopes to create with Semper Fi, published 
 by Interactive Magic.  

 Semper Fi is basically a platoon-level, turn-based, hex-based wargame depicting modern land warfare. 
 Each turn is roughly the equivalent of seven minutes in real time, with a hex on the game map equaling 
 about 300 meters in diameter. You take control of either the US Marine forces or the OPFOR, Opposing 
 Forces. Instead of utilizing the basic "I go, you go" method of turn-based gameplay, the designers 
 instead use an action phase system where initiative - based on morale, troop readiness, and so 
 forth - determines when one side goes. Once you decide to end that phase, the next action phase 
 begins, where initiative is determined again. In this case the same player may play several phases 
 in a row. Since a combat unit can only be activated or used a certain number of times per turn 
 - moving or firing typically - special care and thought to determine the best avenue of approach 
 is required in most situations. Once each player cannot (or will not) take any more actions and 
 hits the End Turn button, then the next turn begins, and the process starts all over again.  

 
 Graphically, Semper Fi is unimpressive at best. Map and unit graphics are uninspiring and somewhat 
 blocky, with Semper Fi mostly resembling a 640x480 SVGA rendition of Norm Koger's Tanks! more than 
 anything else. Elevation is handled only by contour lines. The good news is that the interface 
 is simple and easy to use with only a little practice. Unit health and hex stacking is displayed 
 graphically on the icon, and everything else is shown as a series of tabbed menu bars on the right-hand 
 side of the screen, reserving the rest of the screen for the map. Moving a unit simply involves 
 clicking on it (if applicable during the action phase) , which activates a surrounding field of 
 blue hexes the unit can move to. An overlaying field of red hexes indicates where the unit can 
 fire. Every command in the game is accessible with the mouse.  

 Combat, the heart of the wargame, works pretty well in Semper Fi. The game rewards concentration 
 of fire, combined assault, coordinated movement, use of off-board assets like artillery and naval 
 fire, artillery, hidden units, terrain, and proximity to the command units. Morale, unit firepower, 
 ammunition, and leadership are all tracked and could mean the difference in a battle.  

 Then there is the artificial intelligence. It works and does a nice job at times, but of course 
 one could wish for something much better. One of the coolest things about Semper Fi is that you 
 can have something better using the AI editor. This way you can alter how the AI behaves by altering 
 how it perceives all of the varying game conditions like "victory hex value" or "anti-tank value." 

 Another nice aspect of Semper Fi is the scenario editor, which allows you to create any number of 
 different scenarios. This is particularly good since the scenario and campaign selection for Semper 
 Fi (15 and three, respectively) is less than stellar. Scenario victories are based on casualty 
 rates and mission objectives. The campaigns themselves are a series of linked scenarios that do 
 have some unit crossover but offer little else. Unfortunately the instructions for the scenario 
 and AI editors are on Adobe Acrobat format on the CD-ROM, but the rest of the 100-page manual (with 
 some handy unit tables in the back) is more than adequate.  

 So what is Semper Fi? For the wargame aficionado it has customizability and replayability along 
 with a pretty usable user interface and a decent combat system. For the regular everyday player 
 who may have an interest in the game, it doesn't offer much. The graphics and sound are poor, as 
 is the immediate selection of scenarios. There is the feel that perhaps Semper Fi was trying to 
 appeal to the mass market, but crashes in the attempt. The truth of the matter is, if you can take 
 the "Semper Fi" slogan and the USMC logos and replace them with pretty much anything else, you'd 
 still have hothing more than an OK game struggling to be something much better.
