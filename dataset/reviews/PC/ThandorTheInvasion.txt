:::Review:::
The problem with Thandor: The Invasion is that its lack of creativity extends into every single 
 part of the game. 

 Real-time strategy games have undergone many significant improvements over the years. Different 
 games have individually helped make advances in the genre, through their unique style, story, unit 
 design, interface, or multiplayer features - or even with some or all of these at the same time. 
 Some exceptional real-time strategy games from several years ago, such as Starcraft and Total Annihilation, 
 are still enjoyable even today. You'd think that with such a rich tradition to build on, game designers 
 working on new real-time strategy games would almost instinctively gravitate to game elements that 
 work well and discard those that don't. Unfortunately, that's not the case with Thandor: The Invasion, 
 a forgettable real-time strategy game that has practically nothing to offer.   

  The story behind Thandor: The Invasion revolves around the reconstruction of the Alliances of Avares, 
 and it is completely forgettable and irrelevant. This fact by itself doesn't condemn it: Total 
 Annihilation is a perfect example of a game that has a negligible backstory but nevertheless has 
 such good gameplay that it has become a classic in the genre. The problem with Thandor: The Invasion 
 is that its lack of creativity extends into every single part of the game. Even after days of play, 
 you'll still need to refer to the manual to remind you that the two resources in the game are xenite 
 (for building) and tritium (for power) . The 3D terrain engine is decent, but it still suffers because 
 of the drab and uninspired artwork throughout the game. The game's few graphical details, such 
 as how your units leave imprints in the ground or how they can knock down trees, are only interesting 
 on first impression. The unit graphics are clean but unremarkable, and many of the units look the 
 same. The enemy units are just mirror images of your units. In short, there's absolutely nothing 
 in Thandor to draw you into the game. If you take the plunge anyway, you'll encounter another set 
 of problems that affect how the game plays.   

  Thandor: The Invasion allows for build queues and waypoint movement but neglects to include any 
 kind of unit formation options. What's worse is that the unit pathfinding and the computer's artificial 
 intelligence are also both lacking. The pathfinding is adequate until units get in each other's 
 way, which is when accurate pathfinding is particularly important - and this is where it breaks 
 down completely in Thandor. There is a slider for the difficulty of the game's artificial intelligence, 
 which apparently only adjusts the degree to which the computer cheats, since at the highest setting 
 it churns out units at unbelievable speed - although it's still quite beatable.   

  Thandor's graphics engine tries to use 3D to enhance the gameplay, by letting you zoom and rotate 
 the isometric perspective at will. But as real-time strategy games like Force Commander have shown, 
 having to adjust the zoom level during play can be a hindrance, and while the units may look prettier 
 up close, it's impractical to play the game that way. In fact, the biggest problem with the camera 
 view is that the farthest zoom still isn't quite back far enough, given the ranges of the units' 
 weapons. In a real-time strategy game, the ability to zoom out properly is much more important 
 than the ability to zoom in.   

  Units and buildings can be upgraded through research, and investment in things like improved armor 
 and range can give weaker units considerably more punch. New structures can be researched and built, 
 and this makes new units available throughout the game. But since none of the units are very interesting 
 to begin with, it's difficult to get excited about this. There is only one single-player campaign, 
 and it's very short. The individual maps are uninteresting, and the gameplay is entirely linear. 
 There are several multiplayer campaigns, and a perfunctory diplomacy function in the multiplayer 
 mode, where you can make and break alliances, but the basic gameplay remains the same. The game 
 has some minor technical problems, such as how it autodetects your graphics driver, but it doesn't 
 choose it as the default setting when you first start the game. If you experience constant crashes 
 to the desktop, you should make sure that you have not mistakenly selected the default glide mode, 
 if you aren't using a 3dfx video card.   

  In a genre that has had some truly groundbreaking games in the last couple of years, Thandor: The 
 Invasion doesn't even bother to borrow the best features of those games. Instead, it omits some 
 basic conventions and has a totally uninspired presentation. It's really not worthwhile unless 
 you've played every other real-time strategy game available and need another fix.

Review:  
  Thandor could be enjoyed if you are a GAMER and not a CRITIC... I mean, some guys focus their reviews 
 in many factors, that sincerely sometimes I just don't care... so if you like RTS games, this one 
 will be good enough for some time 'til the end of it... not too short, not too long.
  
  Gameplay is good and could force you to play for hours. Variety is good, you may have a whole screen 
 filled with different units to build (as the game progresses) ... and you have to build up a good 
 strategy to keep your production running without being smashed by one superior unit.
  
  the overall attention you have to keep during a level keeps it interesting, because when you finish 
 the level, you want to go for the nex one... fairly that simple...
  
  ... just don't expect to find 2006 graphics here, though.
