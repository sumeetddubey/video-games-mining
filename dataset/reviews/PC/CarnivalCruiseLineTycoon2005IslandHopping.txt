:::Review:::
Though pretty, this tycoon game flounders due to lackluster gameplay and a lack of variety. 

 
  After theme parks, zoos, marine parks, ski resorts, Las Vegas, airports, malls, fast-food joints, 
 and railroads, you'd probably wonder what subject is left for tycoon games to cover. Apparently, 
 the answer is cruise ships, or specifically, Carnival Cruise Line Tycoon 2005: Island Hopping, 
 the latest tycoon game from Activision Value to be based on a licensed franchise. In theory, making 
 a tycoon game out of a cruise liner is a potentially interesting idea; cruise ships have begun 
 to resemble floating cities. However, in practice, Island Hopping is beset with problems that leave 
 this tycoon game out to sea.  

          You have to outfit all cruise ships from scratch, which is tedious, to say the least.  
    

  Island Hopping follows the traditional tycoon building formula: You have to design and operate 
 a series of successful cruise liners, each bigger and more expensive than the previous one. This 
 is done by laying out the interior of each ship, from the number, type, and placement of passenger 
 cabins to the locations of the bathrooms, restaurants, bars, casinos, and other improvements. Once 
 everything is in place, it's time to accept passenger bookings and then cruise from port to port, 
 watching as your guests spend money on board your ship.  

  On first impression, Island Hopping appears promising. Your liner is rendered in solid detail, 
 and you can see the gleam of the ship's side reflecting in the water. And when you're under way, 
 you can see the ocean passing by. Aside from the fact that your peeps (the virtual people in the 
 game) occasionally walk through solid objects, Island Hopping looks pretty good for a budget game. 
 However, it doesn't take long to discover that it falls short in pretty much every other category; 
 chiefly, there's a distinct lack of features that you would expect to see in a tycoon game.  

 
  To start off, there's a disappointing lack of variety in Island Hopping. There are only five classes 
 of cruise ship, four of which are based on actual Carnival cruise liners. Furthermore, while there 
 are several categories of improvements you can build (restaurants, bars, shopping outlets, and 
 so on) , there are only a handful of options in each category. More often than not, you'll have 
 to reuse the same gift shop over and over again simply because there are only four gift shops to 
 choose from in the game. The same goes for decorative objects, such as plants or lamps, of which 
 there are only two of each. You can try to fill the empty spaces on your cruise ship, but they 
 end up looking repetitive, and you can't tinker with carpeting or wall color, so you can't create 
 distinct-looking themes.  

  Island Hopping also suffers due to the nature of its setting. Cruise ships have only a finite amount 
 of space packed inside a narrow hull. This is reflected in the game, where much of the space on 
 each deck is restricted (represented by cordoned-off areas of the ship, such as engineering spaces) , 
 leaving you with a lot less room than expected and with no ability to expand. In real life, cruise 
 ships are meticulously designed to maximize every square inch of deck, but due to the arbitrary 
 and generic improvements that you plop down, you never get a sense of cohesiveness in Island Hopping. 
 The larger improvements, such as the arcade and dance club, eat up valuable deck space, making 
 it difficult to place anything else around them and limiting what you can do with the environment. 

  Yet at the heart of the matter is that Island Hopping is simply not an interesting game. Once you 
 have your cruise ship decked out, there's not much to do other than sit back and watch as your 
 liner goes from port to port. Since you often need to amass a sizable amount of cash in order to 
 purchase and fit out the next cruise ship in your fleet, that translates into a whole lot of not 
 being able to do much other than watch the cash pile slowly accumulate. Island Hopping also lacks 
 basic financial analysis tools to let you measure the effectiveness of certain improvements as 
 well as your overall fiscal health.  

          It doesn't seem to take much to keep your guests happy; all they do is eat, shop, and sleep. 
     

  While Island Hopping looks good, it sounds rather poor. Aside from the otherwise forgettable music, 
 the sound effects in the game are practically nonexistent unless you zoom in to the closest level. 
 Only then do you hear the cursory sound effects, such as the generic sound of people talking and 
 laughing, the clinking of dishes in the restaurant, and so on.  

  Judging from the title, there's a possibility we could see future versions of Carnival Cruise Line 
 Tycoon down the road. If so, the developers would be wise to give players more power and control, 
 as well as more options. As for now, you should probably steer well clear of this game.

Review:  Good Game, but no perfect. This game is good, really, the idea of a guests on cruise lines.
  
  But, the space of cruise lines is small. The pool is giant, but the space is small.
  
  
 More space, I approving.
  
  No perfect, but good. In the japanese restaurant, no one guest go on the restaurant!! Is impossible, 
 I tested a lot of cruise lines and, no!!! The guests no note the Restaurant.
  
  The Game no is perfect, but no too poor.
  
  The Pool and the Hot Tub are my preferid attractions.
 
  
  But Tycoon is really a great factory of games... For example, the RollerCoaster I really like play. 
 The games of Tycoon is of really good value.

Review:  Carnival Cruise Line Tycoon 2005: Island Hopping is on the bad side of the games I've played over 
 the course of my life, and I've played some pretty bad ones. The game doesn't sound too interesting 
 to begin with due to its title, and it proved that within the first ten minutes of playing it. 
 The game -does- look nice... but, really, what is the entire point of the game? You build carnival 
 cruise liners. I like building games, but even this game just wasn't entertaining. It lacks luster. 
 It lacks... value. It lacks... fun. The game, to me, is far too tedious and boring, and is nothing 
 short of "okey-dokey" eye candy.
  
  And, if you all you care about in a game is graphics, there are far better games to look at than 
 this one.
  
  If you want to spend a few hours and a few dollars, and don't have anything better to do, then 
 you can play this game... but, if you're looking for an eye-catcher that's entertaining beyond 
 an hour, look elsewhere. This game won't provide it for you at all.
