:::Review:::
As a single-player game, it's outdated, and as a multiplayer game, it lacks the variety to provide 
 long-term enjoyment. 

 Why would a game publisher release two sequels to an armored combat simulation that didn't have 
 much going for it in the first place? Did it hope the third time's the charm? Or is it three strikes 
 and you're out? When NovaLogic's original Armored Fist came out five years ago, it wasn't a bad 
 game, but it didn't really deserve a sequel. Nonetheless, in 1997, NovaLogic followed up with Armored 
 Fist 2, which received a lukewarm response. They've now released Armored Fist 3, a game that claims 
 to be a simulation of the US Army's M1A2 main battle tank. Aside from 50 new scripted missions, 
 four new linear campaigns, the inclusion of foot infantry, and the souped-up Voxel Space 32 graphics 
 engine (which doesn't use 3D hardware acceleration) , it's difficult to see how Armored Fist 3 is 
 much different from its predecessor. It certainly offers little in the way of improved gameplay. 

 Having played the first two games, I can't help but wonder why NovaLogic bothered with the third. 
 It appears that little, if anything, has been done to improve the game's AI in the past five years. 
 Armored Fist 3 retains problems that dogged the original game, such as an autotargeting system 
 that locks on to the least threatening targets at the worst possible times and attack helicopters 
 flown by pilots with death wishes.   

 In the second game, NovaLogic attempted to appease those who hated the autotargeting system by including 
 a more realistic gunnery option that let you select your own targets, then lay and fire the gun. 
 That was great, except that as campaigns became more difficult, it was less and less practical 
 to use manual gunnery. Amazingly enough, the same unworkable manual targeting option that was in 
 Armored Fist 2 is also in Armored Fist 3 with no changes whatsoever. No matter how much you want 
 to avoid using the lamebrained autotargeting method, you're practically forced to use it when you 
 begin facing the hordes of enemies thrown at you to mask the game's horrid AI. It's the only way 
 you can target and kill enemy units fast enough to remain alive.  

 Considering the lack of 3D acceleration, what is achieved with this graphics engine is surprising. 
 However, since the game runs at a maximum resolution of 640 x 480, it makes you wonder how much 
 longer NovaLogic can ride this aging horse. It's not as if this engine lets slower computers play 
 the game. With all the detail settings maxed out, my Pentium III 450 slowed noticeably when the 
 action became intense, forcing me to turn off some options to maintain a smooth frame rate.  

 
 Perhaps NovaLogic is banking on the game's multiplayer support to give the Armored Fist series 
 new legs. Up to 32 players can participate in a mission over the Internet via NovaLogic's free 
 NovaWorld game servers. Unfortunately, this is the only multiplayer option available. There's no 
 support for LANs, modem play, or one-on-one Internet play. You can either play against the AI or 
 play on NovaWorld. Period.  

 At least there are plenty of multiplayer options on NovaWorld. You can play games either cooperatively 
 or against others individually or as a team. You can host a public game or one locked with a password. 
 NovaWorld provides deathmatches, team deathmatches, platoon-versus-platoon battles, and capture-the-flag 
 matches. Currently, the preferred styles of play on NovaWorld are team deathmatches and capture 
 the flag.  

 There are two advantages to playing multiplayer games on NovaWorld. NovaLogic says that its system 
 provides for smoother and more reliable play. While this appears to be mostly true, I did see occasional 
 problems with lagging and warping. There were also instances in which I could not reconnect with 
 NovaWorld after temporarily leaving it minutes earlier. Gameplay can slow to a crawl when you operate 
 your tanks' smoke generators, which most players do to help avoid being hit.  

 The second advantage of NovaWorld is the ability to use Armored Fist 3's Voice-Over-Net technology. 
 If you have a headset equipped with a microphone, and your computer has a full duplex sound card, 
 you can play while talking to other members of your team. But many Armored Fist 3 players avoid 
 using this feature and seem to prefer sending messages the old-fashioned way - by typing.  

 As someone unfamiliar with voice communication over the Internet, I found it somewhat difficult 
 to get my system properly configured to take advantage of this feature. And once I could send and 
 receive voice messages, sometimes what I heard was unintelligible because players don't always 
 bother to properly adjust their microphone levels.  

 Of course, not everyone will appreciate online battles that consistently degenerate into wild tank 
 melees, whether they can talk to each other or not. In multiplayer mode, there's little time for 
 planning strategy or devising tactics. You simply throw your tank into the fray and blast away 
 at point-blank range. In fact, the online version of Armored Fist 3 is a simplified version of 
 the single-player game in which you have no choice but to use autotargeting.  

 NovaLogic calls Armored Fist 3 an "action-oriented simulation," but it's really just an action game 
 disguised as a simulation. As a single-player game, it's outdated, and as a multiplayer game, it 
 lacks the variety to provide long-term enjoyment. Not even the cool Voice-Over-Net feature can 
 rescue this game from mediocrity.

Review:  I just recently copied all my old CD-Roms that I had, and this is one of the titles I was specifically 
 looking for.
  Armored Fist 3 immersed the player in a fairly realist tank battle realm. I enjoyed the game immensely 
 when I first played it in 2000. After about a year of not playing the game, I returned to it in 
 June 2002 after a deployment to Kosovo. Using the Map Editor, I was able to quickly develop battle 
 scenarios from my (then) recent experiences and translate the what ifs into digital reality, battling 
 on a front that I had just left.
  Armored Fist 3, for me, remains on of my modern day classics, that helped form what I do in the 
 gaming world. For that reason, even when compared to games of today, it still receives playable 
 marks from me.

Review:  This game is fun if you like more or less realistic controls. So mabye this isnt your arrow key 
 general game, you need to use more than 10 buttins, God forbid... 
  But if you enjoy playin games with a little more thinkin involved around a bunch of senseless shooting, 
 this ones for you.
  I love this one because you can control the tank from every crew position, the driver, the gunner, 
 the commander, and almost the loader. You can go into the machine gun, the CITV (the lil spinney 
 periscope on top) , or just an outside view. You have artilery support, warthog and chopper assistance, 
 and bradleys and infantry. I like how in this game, infantry is an actual threat, unlike other 
 tank games, where their immoble or nonexistant. Also, the enemy has its own goals and fire support, 
 so it isnt a turkey shoot. I think its great for the price.
