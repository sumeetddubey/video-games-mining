:::Review:::
If you're going to have fun with this game, you've gotta get online. 

 Boggle CD-ROM is a faithfully computerized and expanded version of the board (cube?) game, enhanced 
 with new variations on the basic theme of spelling words from a random assortment of cubes with 
 different letters on each face and expanded to allow multiple players to battle each other across 
 networks.  

 Boggle 101: You and one or more of your literate friends stare at a 4x4 or 5x5 matrix of letter 
 cubes. You all spend the next two minutes ferreting out and writing down what long and hopefully 
 hard-to-find words can be spelled legally from the letters in the grid. To spell a word legally, 
 you must by able to place a mental finger on its first letter and move your finger through the 
 grid, traversing the letters that make up the word in order, and always moving from one letter 
 to another that is adjacent to it, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. After a couple 
 of minutes of spelling words, all players stop and compare their lists, crossing out any words 
 that appear on more than one player's list. Then, scores are tallied; longer words score more points. 
 Winners are determined, and fortunes are made and lost.  

 On the computer, Boggle changes a bit. Hasbro has provided word gamers with the classic Boggle game, 
 as well as five variations. Since a computer has but one keyboard, two or more human players cannot 
 play seriously on the same computer. (The CD-ROM does allow multiple players to use the keyboard 
 sequentially and play a game that way, but so much of the pace of the game is lost this way that 
 I cannot recommend it at all.) Those who will enjoy this game will enjoy playing against a computer 
 opponent, bettering their own high scores, and competing with players connected to the Internet. 

 Boggle across the Internet is great. Of the five different games one can play off the CD, three 
 can be played on Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone (http://www. zone. com) , and they've all got their 
 merits. While I think I have to claim Classic Boggle, with the simple 4x4 or 5x5 letter grid, as 
 my favorite, I had some tense matches online playing a more head-to-head variation called Battle 
 Boggle. In this variation, you and your opponent take turns placing letters from your letter stashes 
 on a small grid and spelling as many words as you can from the letters there before letting the 
 other put another letter down. Since the game starts with only one letter on the grid, the first 
 few rounds are mostly spent analyzing your own and your opponent's letters, but after a few more 
 letter cubes have been placed, one player or the other will always burst through with an exciting 
 flurry of words. You both play on separate three-minute timers that only tick while you are on 
 your turn, so you can conserve time and have a lot to play with when the words in the grid are 
 more plentiful. Of course, you never can tell when there's a nine-letter bibliographic behemoth 
 lurking amidst the J's, G's, K's, and Z's; that's what makes the game so tense.  

 At the end of any of the game variations, you and your opponents (human or computer) have your scores 
 tallied and your word lists displayed onscreen, often spurring a bit of self-reflection as you 
 spy obvious and familiar words on your opponents' lists and curse yourself for your own intellectual 
 shortcomings and sometimes calling up perhaps a moue of incredulity on your lips as you notice 
 something on someone's list that you've never, ever heard of before, and which quite possibly looks 
 like a misspelling of "syzygy" or worse. Here's where a nice touch by Hasbro pays off - every word 
 on every list is clickable and will call up a dictionary-style definition for it, with pronunciation, 
 usage, and multiple definitions. No more arguments!  

 Solitary word-gamers will enjoy the CD, but most will treat their solo forays into the game as practice 
 for online competition. Computer opponents provide some motivation, but as we all know by now, 
 there's no substitute for the kind of inspiration that can be provided by a sneaky, nerdy 15-year-old 
 bookworm who's kicking your butt from Aardvark to Zygote. If you're going to have fun with this 
 game, you've gotta get online. Whether you do it with a modem, on your local LAN, across the Internet 
 head-to-head, or through Internet Gaming Zone, head-to-head play against human opponents is where 
 Boggle shines.

Review:  Boggle for the PC is better than the loud board game type. Boggle for the PC has a dictionary build 
 into the game so you don't have to look up words, and you can even add words to the dictionary 
 its self. Although the game lags a bit the game is still fun. There are 4 modes in boggle, which 
 include the classic version itself. There can be up to 4 players and the computers have about 5 
 modes they can be set at. I advise that you do not play multiplayer, because it can be very boring. 
 There are also points in the game where you can get frustrated that the letters that you want to 
 click on aren't. Other than that, this game is a good puzzle game that can be played for hours.

Review:  There's really not much that you can say about this game. It's good old Boggle. Sure, they try 
 to gussy it up with new play modes that could only be done in a computer-generated environment, 
 but really you end up playing just the basic game. It does include both the original 4x4 grid and 
 the 5x5 "master" grid. Sound and graphics are certainly nothing to rave over, but there's only 
 so much to do with letter cubes and the only sounds are for making words and an opening sound simulating 
 the Boggle cube being shook, admittedly a nice nod to the original game. The only real problem 
 the game suffers from is the startling lack of plural recognition for several words. Luckily you 
 can add these words to the dictionary as you make them. Overall a pleasant, but not ground-breaking, 
 version of a board game classic.
