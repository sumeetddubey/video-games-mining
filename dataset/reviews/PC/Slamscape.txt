:::Review:::
Slamscape is a great concept, poorly executed. 

 Combining the vehicle mechanics of a hovertank with the strategy elements of a puzzler, Slamscape 
 is a game that can best be described as "eclectic." In fact, the gameplay is so unusual that I'm 
 not sure the publisher even knows what this game is all about. For example, in the online manual, 
 you will find this entry under the heading "Game Goals in Plain English":  

 "In each Region, there are four glittering Orb-Ids. Blast, jump, smash, and shoot into anything 
 and everything to somehow find and then touch the Orb-Id to set it free from the Regeneral so it 
 can go back to the Orbhead in the center of the Region."  

 "Plain English." Right. What this essentially means is that each level in Slamscape is populated 
 with a wide assortment of everyday items gone bad - like teddy bears with steel claws and ferris 
 wheels with cannons. While the lesser denizens are more of an annoyance than anything else, the 
 larger (and seemingly unstoppable) creations require more brainpower than firepower. Fortunately, 
 each of these boss "puzzles" has an Achilles heel, and it is your job to find the trick necessary 
 to defeat it. Some merely require excellent timing, while others require you to employ the residents 
 of each land to do some of the work for you. Once all four boss "puzzles" on a level have been 
 solved, you move on to the next world.  

 Unfortunately, this exciting and innovative premise is spoiled by the game's poor play mechanics. 
 In particular, the "Slamjet" is almost impossible to control. Just a quick tap on the joystick 
 will send the hovercar careening about the playing field. Since Slamscape simulates inertia, steering 
 becomes a nightmare of rotating and thrusting to control your momentum. To make matters worse, 
 you are constantly being rammed by other objects - which starts the whole process over again. Adding 
 to the frustration, the frame rate randomly dives into the single digits. If you happen to be spinning 
 around when this happens, the resulting slide show can leave you totally disoriented on the generic 
 levels.   

 Speaking of frame rates, be warned that you will need plenty of computing horsepower to drive the 
 visuals at a decent rate. A Pentium-90 with a 2 MB VRAM video card is the bare minimum. Oddly enough, 
 even with this hefty requirement, the visuals served up in Slamscape are composed of pedestrian 
 polygons on a bland, two-dimensional playing field - hardly the cutting-edge graphics one would 
 expect. In conclusion, Slamscape is a great concept, poorly executed. Encumbered by sloppy controls, 
 substandard graphics, and annoying sound effects, Slamscape is best left on the shelf.
