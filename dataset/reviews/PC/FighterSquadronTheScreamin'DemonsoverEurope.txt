:::Review:::
Despite the lack of a full campaign, the physics models and top-notch AI make this one of the best 
 dogfighting experiences yet. 

 On the crowded field of World War II sims, there's a player who stands alone. He's not a jack-of-all-trades 
 like the others, but he has some swift moves, he looks good on the field, and he definitely plays 
 well with others. This upstart player is Activision's long-delayed Fighter Squadron: Screamin' 
 Demons Over Europe. It definitely stands apart from other WWII flight sims. Whether that's good 
 or bad depends on what you're looking for.  

 Fighter Squadron doesn't try to replicate the entire WWII air combat experience. Instead, it concentrates 
 on the meat of the experience - the dogfight. You won't fly a real-time air campaign here or spend 
 an hour flying to the target. The action, like the combat arena, is concentrated and intense.  
 

 That's not to say that Fighter Squadron is a "lite" action/arcade sim. The sim was created by Parsoft, 
 the developer that brought us A-10 Cuba. Like that game, there are very detailed physics and flight 
 models here. Damage a plane, and the parts come off and take on an aerodynamic life of their own. 
 Knock out an engine on a P-38 and it will want to pull to one side; blow off a wingtip and it will 
 spin toward the ground.  

 While the damage models are excellent, the flight models are mixed. In many respects, the planes 
 have a feel closest to that of a real aircraft that I've ever encountered in a sim. This is particularly 
 evident when flying in windy conditions. Unfortunately, the flight models seem somewhat neutered 
 compared with the ones in beta versions. General handling is good, and the planes' relative performance 
 to each other is well represented. But stalls have been dramatically toned down, and spins are 
 nonexistent. When a plane loses speed, it usually reacts as it would if a skilled pilot were riding 
 the edge of a stall, instead of actually departing from controlled flight. This takes a bit of 
 challenge out of dogfighting.  

 Fighter Squadron offers ten flyable planes, and is the only sim in the current crop that lets you 
 fly bombers. You can jump between any of a bomber's gun positions; there's also a bombardier station, 
 but the bombsight is so simplified it's of little use. Alas, only one person can man a bomber in 
 multiplayer mode. Aircraft cockpits are decently modeled, but they can't compare with those in 
 Jane's WWII Fighters. The default view practically places your nose against the gunsight, especially 
 in padlock mode, but this can be easily zoomed out to a more comfortable level. The padlock view 
 works very well, although it could use more target selection options. You can use the fixed keypad 
 views to snap the view to any direction to check for bogies or make sure you're not flying into 
 the ground; the view will then snap back to the padlocked target.  

 The sim has 30 single-player missions, set in three theaters - Dover, Africa, and the Rhineland. 
 Each of these missions can be flown from the perspective of any squadron. You might fly escort 
 in a P-51, then as a bomber in a Lancaster, and then as the enemy in a FW-190. The terrain looks 
 superb, with rolling hills to dogfight over and around, nicely done textures, and detailed buildings. 
 Big cities are missing, though, and ground targets are all stationary. Terrain areas are fairly 
 small, so you'll never spend more than a couple of minutes flying to the target. A very easy-to-use 
 mission editor lets you create both solo and multiplayer sorties.  

 While you won't find huge furballs here like those in European Air War, the missions are still quite 
 challenging. This is largely due to the fact that Fighter Squadron has pilot AI that's way above 
 average. Aircraft fight well in all three dimensions, and they fight using appropriate tactics 
 for each plane. If you're looking for the wiliest challenge available, of course, you'll want to 
 take on human opponents. It's here that Fighter Squadron truly excels. LAN play is a blast, and 
 modem play is smoother and more reliable than any other boxed WWII sim. Activision also provides 
 a number of free Internet servers to play on. The Connect dialogue doesn't tell you how many people 
 are playing on each server, but you can generally count on the California site being the most active. 

 Fighter Squadron has numerous nice touches. It features the most realistic clouds yet seen in a 
 PC sim, vapor contrails give away planes at high altitude, and puffy flak bursts knock your plane 
 around the skies. An optional heads-up display - not realistic for WWII planes, but a good compromise 
 given the limited view afforded by a monitor - helps you keep track of your orientation. On the 
 downside, the HUD can be a necessity at high altitude, where heavy hazing makes it difficult to 
 judge your plane's attitude.  

 If you're looking for ultimate realism and accurate historical missions, Fighter Squadron probably 
 isn't the sim for you. But if the dogfight is the thing - especially against human players - it's 
 worth a close look. Despite the lack of a full campaign, the physics models and top-notch AI make 
 this one of the best dogfighting experiences yet. If Parsoft can add a working toggle to enable 
 stalls and spins, this may just be the sim of choice for pilots looking for free online play.
