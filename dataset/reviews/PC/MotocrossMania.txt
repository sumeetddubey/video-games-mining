:::Review:::
If you're a fan of motocross, then Motocross Mania would make a great addition to your collection. 
 

 Take your pick: Microsoft's Motocross Madness 2 or Deibus Studios' Motocross Mania. The games are 
 similar in almost every respect, which is evident before you even open the box - so why would you 
 go with a copycat game from an unknown developer like Deibus? Games like these typically end up 
 in the bargain bin after a week or two - if you can even find them there. Deibus and its publisher, 
 On Deck Interactive (a division of Take Two Interactive) , must be trying to fool unwary players 
 into buying their product instead of Microsoft's. Or, they must have played Motocross Madness 2 
 - and they've decided that they can do better.   

  While it's apparent that Deibus and On Deck are trying to bank on the success of Motocross Madness 
 2, what's less obvious is that the game is actually on par with Motocross Madness 2 in terms of 
 visual quality and is arguably even better in its controls and exciting track designs. However, 
 Motocross Mania does have some bugs and performance problems, and this is what prevents it from 
 completely measuring up to Motocross Madness 2.   

  Also, Motocross Mania requires a powerful computer to run well. You'll probably need twice as much 
 as the required 64MB of RAM to get the game running smoothly. While it will run with only 64MB, 
 you'll probably have to suffer through frame-rate slowdowns while the game uses up virtual memory 
 on your hard drive. You can tweak the game's graphics settings to help smooth the frame rate at 
 the cost of some visual detail, but even then, you might still encounter other performance problems 
 during play.   

  Once you get it running well, Motocross Mania offers a lot of value in its exciting gameplay and 
 fun track design. In Microsoft's Motocross Madness games, bikes are quite difficult to control 
 competitively, especially on the tight Supercross tracks, in which jumps will often catapult you 
 past a turn. In addition, the berms are too low to keep you on the track. On the other hand, in 
 Motocross Mania, the jumps are set at strategic distances to make riders either have to get up 
 to speed to clear the span or slow down enough to potentially overshoot the next turn. But because 
 the bikes are more responsive than they are in Motocross Madness, it's easier to compensate for 
 miscues. The game sacrifices some realism in the interest of making the game more enjoyable to 
 play - for instance, you can stop the bike on a dime against a high berm if the weather isn't dry 
 or snowy. But in general, the game seems realistic enough that it's challenging to stay competitive 
 throughout a race.   

  Motocross Mania offers four different play modes, including motocross, supercross, baja and freestyle. 
 The baja tracks are probably the most enjoyable of these. Besides having interesting settings, 
 the tracks are designed to take you over some breathtaking elevation changes. You'll hold the throttle 
 wide open as you climb up the side of a steep hill and then wind through a few turns and over a 
 couple of short jumps - just before you dive down the other side and have to slam the brake near 
 the bottom to slide through a hairpin turn. Then you throttle up again to climb up the next steep 
 incline. It definitely takes some practice getting used to the bikes and learning the tracks in 
 Motocross Mania - but the game is easy enough to get into, so getting used to the gameplay doesn't 
 take any real time commitment.   

  You can perform more than two dozen tricks on your bike by holding down one of the trick buttons 
 and pushing the controller in a combination of two directions for the easy ones, and three to four 
 directions for the more advanced tricks. You get points for performing tricks during a competition 
 but not during a practice session. If you accumulate enough points, you'll unlock the more advanced 
 trick sets. Tricks are pretty forgiving in Motocross Mania - for instance, you can land successfully 
 from a hundred feet in the air with your hands off the handlebars. But you still have to be cautious, 
 because it's very easy to twist the bike around in midair, land awkwardly, and then crash. And 
 if you lose positions during a race, it's hard to catch up. You'll find it's rewarding to try and 
 master the various tricks in the game.   

  Overall, Motocross Mania is an enjoyable racing game. It has a variety of high-quality tracks, 
 and it controls well and looks good. If you can afford only one motocross game, then Motocross 
 Madness 2 is still the best first choice. But if you're a fan of motocross, then Motocross Mania 
 would also make a great addition to your collection.

Review:  This game is, after todays standards, quite poor on the graphic-side, but on the other hand, the 
 amount of joy you can get from it is enormous!
  After installing the game, you should make yourself a profile with the cheat for money activated 
 (alternatively the one for all maps aswell) , you then rename it to your choosing, tweak the bike 
 all the way to Level 4 on all aspects and get ready for some awesome freestyling!
  
  The amount of trick combos available in this game is awsome!
  You should start out at Boulder 
 Dash, with Baja Points race enabled.
  (If there is several people playing create a LAN-server and rip its tracks together!) This is the 
 best track to get from a low to a medium stunt-list.
  start out at the huge gap all the way to the right of where you start.
  doing backflip, 360's 
 and even frontflip combos there aswell as out the little mountain-lip to the right is the best 
 way to gain points, its in places like these where you can time your jumps with your friends jumps 
 and live a little on the edge!
  
  After unlocking a few stunts you can move on to other tracks like the Above Gravity track and start 
 pulling No Footed Nac Nac 360's, No Handed Frontflips, and Double Superman Seatgrab Backflips.
 
  On tracks like these you should crank your Gear Ratio all the way DOWN to get the most out of 
 the jumps. After creating awsome amounts of stunt-points here, you should unlock crazy tricks like 
 The Mechanic , where you crawl under the bike on one side and back up the other midair.
  
  Now is the time to move on to tracks like Cliffhanger , or find awsome landscape-jumps outside 
 the marked track on any other track. The main point is to find a place to shoot of that allows 
 the landing of &uuml; ber-tricks like
  Double Backflips with Double Superman Seatgrabs, Cardova 720 or even
  a Double Backflip 1080! 
 It's when you find a place to do that, together with 7 of your gaming-friends that the opportunity 
 to gain some bragging-rights shows itself! Keep in mind that tweaking the brakes, gear ratio, gyro 
 and
  suspension might just help you land the trick otherwise impossible.
  
  On the downside, the graphics are a bit edgy on max, the sound effects could be better, and well, 
 the tricks can get a bit unreal for the picky one!
  Overall: a game for pure fun and enjoyment, but to old and simple for people that craves high end 
 graphics and real feel to the physics.
