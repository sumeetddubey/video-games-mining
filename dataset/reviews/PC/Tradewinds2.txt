 Fast-paced, addictive design lets you easily travel, trade, and do battle.

 Simplistic structure sacrifices complexity and depth for ease of use.
 So-so presentation might grow on you but doesn't give a good first impression.

:::Review:::
Sail the Caribbean in search of wealth and high adventure in this breezy, simple, and entertaining 
 game of trade and ship combat. 

  Tradewinds 2 is a whimsical take on the life of a privateer who sails the high seas, trades broadsides 
 with pirates, and makes friends and foes in the Caribbean at the turn of the 18th century. The 
 game is quite simple to play, and it's easy both to buy low and sell high throughout the Caribbean 
 isles, as well as to sink opposing ships seeking to do you in. Despite the relative lack of challenge 
 and a fairly plain, cartoonish presentation, Tradewinds 2 succeeds at being surprisingly fun and 
 addictive. Clearly inspired by the classic Sid Meier's Pirates!, Tradewinds 2 is briskly paced 
 and delivers the satisfaction of the process of earning enough money to afford bigger, better stuff. 

  You'll gradually upgrade your ship while going on dozens of different quests that will send you 
 all around the Caribbean every which way. New isles and stronger foes gradually reveal themselves, 
 and you can also find special items that can aid your travels. The game's missions can be fairly 
 amusing, and though combat in Tradewinds 2 happens almost automatically, it's still fun to watch 
 hundreds of cannonballs sailing through the air, smashing into hulls or splashing harmlessly into 
 the sea.

Review:  HI
  I can't believe the great reviews this dud has recieved.... I bout it based on the time limited 
 demo...... The problem is that unless you've never played any type of strategy game at all, this 
 one is way to easy....
  
  It's sort of a simplifed pirates.... You trade.. do missions.. And buy bigger and better ships..... the 
 problem is that once you get ships that can sail over land the game becomes way to easy to win....
 
  
  You can buy special magic items but they really don't seem to add anything to the basic game play 
 folks.... All characters play the same and even the unlockable character adds nothing....
  
  There are really no difficulty levels and special items seemed to be thrown in as an after thought... Unless 
 you hate any kind of challenge and prefer easy game play avoid this.

Review:  An entertaining pirate sim - think Sid Myer's Pirates! "Lite". The small price tag and the facts 
 that it is downloadable and entertaining definitely make this game a good value. Initially the 
 game appears extremely addictive. I didn't want to quit playing, falling prey to "just let me finish 
 this task" quite often. I say it initially appears addictive because the only and very unfortunate 
 drawback of this game is the fact that it can be completed within a few hours play and has very 
 little replay value as the map changes and different characters actually yield very little difference 
 in the storyline. This can be considered a great game as a change of pace or something to do while 
 you're waiting for another game to be released.

Review:  Ahoy lads and lasses! Ye little landlubbers, hop aboard and grab your grog and I shall tell you 
 me tales of booty and swashbuckling scallywags!
  
  Ok, so the whole pirate talk isn't really my thing, but Tradewinds 2 takes the pirate concept a 
 bit further. Here, you take the role of a ship captain whose main source of income is trading goods 
 from port to port, buying low and selling as high as possible. During your travels, you will defend 
 your precious cargo from pirate attacks and complete missions for the governors of each port. So 
 that kind of makes you a "good pirate" of sorts.
  
  In story mode, you start small, with a little ship and limited funds, but you can start doing favors 
 for the governor right away. These will give you rewards ranging from items (which will give your 
 ship certain bonus like being able to carry more cargo) to crew members and of course, gold. By 
 advancing in these missions, you will gain access the governors from other places and unlock new 
 places on the map.
  
  Completing story mode will also unlock the Custom Character Creation mode.
  
  You can also 
 play Free Trade mode, where the purpose is to make as much money as possible. I noticed there was 
 a lot less naval combat in this type of gameplay, so it really comes down to buying and selling 
 everything from fish to textiles, or trying to smuggle illegal goods like tobacco and risk loosing 
 your cargo.
  
  Throughout the game, you work to create strong trade runs, buying at a port and selling at the 
 next. Keep in mind that if you see a price in blue, in means the cargo you're holding will make 
 a profit if sold at that market. If it's red, hold on to it and try another port.
  
  Here's a good tip. Visit the bars and buy a round of drinks. Doing this at certain bars will provide 
 you with useful info, such as what port buys cotton at the highest price, and during what month. 
 These bits of info are just what you need to make a good profit.
  
  You will have to defend your ship and your cargo from pirate attacks, so always make sure you repair 
 and replace any lost cannons at the next port. Mind you, not all ports have shipyards.
  
  The bigger the ship, the more cannons and cargo you can carry, and the more damage you can sustain 
 during an attack. Better ships will be available from the shipyards, so that's your major investment 
 right there, since the best ones will cost you a pretty penny.
  
  Daniel Bernstein, CEO and President, Sandlot Games stated "Players who enjoyed the original Tradewinds 
 will find everything they loved about it in this game, and much more. New players will really be 
 drawn into the Tradewinds 2 lore. You can be a master commander, defeating pirates and plundering 
 their gold. You can play it safe and trade goods, gradually amassing wealth and power. You can 
 trade contraband, risking seizures, but reaping larger returns. It's up to you. It's your world 
 to explore." 
  
  I'm a pirate, that I be,
  I sail me ship upon the sea!
  Aye, ye can sail your ship too!
  Avast ye, go play Tradewinds 2!
  
  Tradewinds 2 has really 
 shivered me timbers! You can find the free 60-minute trial at the official Sandlot Games' site 
 and enjoy a good hour of naval combat and mercantile expeditions. Yarr!
