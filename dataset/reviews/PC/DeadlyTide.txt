:::Review:::
Deadly Tide is a beauty with no brains. 

 It's been five years since the aliens broke through Earth's defenses and set up their ocean bases. 
 Now you are the last remaining fighter left to save Earth from this alien invasion. Deadly Tide 
 thrusts you in the role of one of Earth's elite hydrofighter pilots. As the aliens are aquatic 
 beings, all of the action takes place in the briny depths of the world seas. You must blast your 
 way through wave after wave of baddies if humankind is to see the dawning of another day. Wow, 
 sounds important, eh?  

 Deadly Tide is a rail shooter, which means you follow a predetermined path through hordes of alien 
 ships, shooting everything in sight. Since you cannot control where your Hydra sub travels, you 
 basically assume the position of a gunner, with the joystick controlling the cross-hairs. This 
 limits gameplay in a big way, and you often feel detached from the real action, as if you were 
 just playing a gun strapped to the bottom of a submarine. The basic premise is as follows: Arrive 
 at an alien infested area, blast as many of the little buggers as you can, and get the hell out 
 of Dodge.  

 Although this lack of control limits gameplay, it allows developers to fill the screen with the 
 best graphics and eye candy available. Because you are on a set path, the pre-rendered graphics 
 look loads better than games where you choose your own route. The underwater realm of Deadly Tide 
 is one of the most detailed and best looking of any video game I've seen, although there are a 
 few visual glitches here and there. The animation is generally smooth and slow-down is only apparent 
 in a few locations where the screen is swarming with alien fighters.  

 As far as the audio goes, Deadly Tide's soundtrack adds to the overall big-screen feel of the game. 
 The tense mood of underwater alien extermination is captured nicely in the eerie score. However, 
 the speech is barely audible over the music, so you may miss important information, such as where 
 you're supposed to go next or what you're supposed to get. Of course, none of this really matters 
 as you can't plot your own course anyway. As long as you continue to shoot the aliens and don't 
 get blown up yourself, you'll eventually get through each level.  

 Unfortunately, this is the overall failing of this game. If you play it through, it should take 
 you no more than two hours to totally destroy most of the alien horde and send the survivors packing. 
 As if this weren't bad enough, the game's predetermined path ensures very limited replay value. 
 Although the graphics and soundtrack may be some of the most impressive available, the game itself 
 is too short to offer any real long-term enjoyment.  

 Deadly Tide is a beauty with no brains. Although nice to look at and listen to, the gameplay is 
 repetitive and ultimately boring. Why pay $50 for a two hour experience that has no replay value? 
 Unless you're a gamer who prefers good looks to playability (is there such a creature?) , wait for 
 something better.

Review:  Deadly Tide is a game that takes place in the future. The Earth is flooded with seawater that aliens 
 are creating. Your mission is to take a superpowered craft, the Hydra, to stop the aliens from 
 drowning the Earth and everyone and everything on it.
  
  However, this game plays very funny. You never actually control yourself, the game moves your craft 
 around for you. Even when you are traveling on foot, you never actually move around. The only thing 
 you do is shoot. Sounds boring?? To me it does. This also makes the game have little to no replay 
 value.
  
  Although there are times when you can rotate around the field of view, you still can not move from 
 that one spot. Occasionally, you are given two paths to choose from, but that's just about the 
 only choice you have. A game can't get much boring than this. I was nearly falling asleep when 
 I was playing (which almost never happens) . 
  
  The storyline is also somewhat weak, especially the ending. Deadly Tide has the lamest storyline 
 ending ever, and is a major cliffhanger. I'm not even sure what exactly happened. And since the 
 chances of a sequel being made are virtually nil, I guess I never will.
  
  The graphics are quite good, however, considering that this game was made in 1996. Its musical 
 soundtrack is not bad either. But the incredibly boring gameplay and very weak storyline completely 
 outweigh these pros.
  
  Gameplay: 4
  Graphics: 10
  Sound: 8
  Value: 1
  Tilt: 5
  
  Final Score: 6.0\10 (fair)

Review:  Deadly Tide was one of the first game i got from my PC.
  
  Game play
  So basically its an on rails shooter. Sometimes it gives you choices to go left and right but these 
 are rare. It also lets you sometimes stand still and you get to rotate, turning around and looking 
 up to blast enemies, unfortunately this didn't come off so well, and preferred when it just moved 
 you along.
  
  Graphics:
  For its time? the graphics were great, it has cinematic cut scene which look great and the amount 
 of action on screen also looked fantastic.
  
  Sound:
  The sound was fine, nothing to go tell your friends about. it did the job, producing enemy lasers 
 and gun fire. It did create atmosphere when needed, and the music gunned up when the pace did.
 
  
  Story:
  So basically aliens have landed on earth in the deep sea, and they are producing H2O. Producing 
 so much that they are actually working on covering the earth in water. Not a good situation thats 
 for sure. You use a prototype hydra sub and have to battle through a variety of missions involving 
 dropping nuke, capturing Intel (on foot) and penetrating the enemy's mother ships. however the 
 story ending is not that desirable. You will have to play it to find out but it leaves you thinking.... 
 We're finishing on that note?
  
  Overall
  Overall it was a good game, very fun for its time. It could be frustrating at times because it 
 seemed impossible even on normal difficulties. However once you get the hang of the mission you 
 can get into the meat of the game

Review:  I remember this game so well it feels like i just stopped playing it yesterday. I pre ordered this 
 game thru QVC shopping and got it 7 days before the retailer at local stores got it. It was the 
 first of it's kind with the best graphic's that was never seen before.
  I played it hard &amp; fast that it made my arm sore. In the first battle i flew into a small room 
 to destroy a ship while getting a few seconds break to catch my breath from the battle. While in 
 there my heart almost stopped when the main battle cruiser tells you that there is hundreds more 
 enemies heading in my direction...
  Not many games made my arm &amp; heart hurt like that.. I felt like i was really there! The game 
 is over 10 years old now so yea the game is outdated with today's standards in graphic's....
