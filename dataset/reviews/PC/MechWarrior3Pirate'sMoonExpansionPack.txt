:::Review:::
MechWarrior 3 players who found the original game's campaign short or uninspired will find Pirate's 
 Moon to be all too familiar. 

 The official expansion pack to Zipper Interactive's futuristic combat simulation MechWarrior 3 adds 
 to the game a half-dozen new BattleMechs, several new weapons, new multiplayer modes, and as many 
 new missions as the original game's campaign. Its suitable if predictable assortment of features 
 and heightened challenge should satisfy fans who enjoyed MechWarrior 3's graphics and gameplay, 
 but Pirate's Moon lacks the ambition to surpass any of the precedents set by the original game. 
 As such, MechWarrior 3 players who found the original game's campaign short or uninspired will 
 find Pirate's Moon to be all too familiar.  

 MechWarrior 3 was an excellent-looking game six months ago, and Pirate's Moon proves how well the 
 graphics held up. The game still looks outstanding: The various BattleMechs featured in Pirate's 
 Moon - which include newly added mech chassis such as the imposing humanoid-shaped Atlas and the 
 devastating Masakari - are all fully articulated and beautifully animated. They look, move, and 
 even sound like the 50-ton tanks that they're supposed to be. Pirate's Moon even adds new ambient 
 special effects to MechWarrior 3's already impressive graphics engine, which make its missions 
 look even better than they did originally. The game's explosions and weapon effects also remain 
 singularly excellent, as they tend to convey the game's hi-tech weaponry precisely how you might 
 have imagined it while playing the tabletop BattleTech game. It's too bad, in light of how great 
 Pirate's Moon generally looks and sounds, that its dreary synthetic soundtrack hasn't been improved 
 since the original game, and that the voice acting often borders on bad.  

 Unfortunately, the problems in Pirate's Moon extend beyond its inconsistent sound. Its new scenarios 
 are more challenging than those in the original game, but the additional difficulty doesn't always 
 make them more enjoyable. Pirate's Moon has around 20 missions, split between a short all-new Inner 
 Sphere campaign and a linear series of otherwise unconnected scenarios in which you fight for the 
 enemy, the New Belt pirates. In the campaign, as in the original MechWarrior 3, you should take 
 care not to decimate your foes so you can salvage their ruined mechs to take with you to the next 
 mission. However, you generally needn't worry about salvaging anything in the pirate missions. 
 You'll have your hands full just trying to stay alive as you defend yourself against waves of powerful 
 Inner Sphere pilots. The computer-controlled opponents are noticeably more effective in Pirate's 
 Moon than in the original game, and they will make short work of you unless you coordinate your 
 attack with whatever lancemates you have working with you. Even if you think you're a hotshot pilot 
 - you don't let your mech overheat, you flush the reactor with coolant if you do, you take advantage 
 of your weapons' distinct advantages, you aim true, and you move fast - you'll still find that 
 defeat will come swiftly and often at the hands of your enemies' superior numbers and deadly accuracy. 
 Some of the game's missions, especially those involving the defense of key installations, can be 
 frustratingly difficult. Other missions are poorly paced, and you'll have plenty of time to consider 
 the ways in which they could have been more exciting as you trudge long distances between waypoints. 

 But the most insufferable scenarios in Pirate's Moon have to be the newly featured night missions, 
 in which you must do battle with your enemies by the guiding light of your BattleMech's headlights. 
 The mechs in Activision's classic MechWarrior II featured a green-tinted night-vision mode and 
 wire-frame image-enhancement mode, both designed to assist you when fighting in darkness. As such, 
 the pitifully short-ranged, prehistoric headlights in Pirate's Moon - a step back from MechWarrior 
 II's hi-tech surveillance options - are disappointing. While using headlights at night does provide 
 new tactical considerations, in that you're harder to see if you turn them off, essentially it's 
 just no fun shooting near-blind at your red targeting indicator in the pitch black of night, with 
 only a small spot of land illuminated ahead of you.  

 There are other areas in which Pirate's Moon might have improved on MechWarrior 3 but didn't. The 
 game's mech lab, where you can meticulously custom-tailor your BattleMech with specific weapons 
 and armor in order to suit your needs, still has a convoluted, unintuitive, and unattractive interface 
 that makes what should be one of the most enjoyable aspects of MechWarrior 3 feel more like a chore. 
 The game's instant-action mode and multiplayer mode interfaces are similarly cumbersome. Pirate's 
 Moon does feature two new multiplayer modes, in which you must try to defend your base and destroy 
 the enemy's, which can provide an interesting diversion from the more typical multiplayer mech-on-mech 
 violence. The new game types are also available in the instant-action mode, which also lets you 
 battle the computer in single combat or against waves of progressively tougher enemy mechs. Pirate's 
 Moon includes just four new maps for the instant-action and multiplayer battles, but they completely 
 replace those of the original, and though they all look great, there's far too few of them.  

 
 As in MechWarrior 3 before it, the problem with Pirate's Moon is that it lacks the scope and scale 
 of its subject matter. The game's unpolished front end and its lack of memorable scenarios are 
 circumvented by its impressive graphics and control, such that MechWarrior fans will probably enjoy 
 Pirate's Moon just because it lets them climb into the cockpit of the Atlas and the Awesome. Yet 
 while it accurately conveys the sheer power of BattleTech's walking tanks, it doesn't create an 
 environment that's big enough or otherwise interesting enough to do them justice.

Review:  Unlike MechWarrior 3, the Pirates Moon expansion gives you more to work on in terms of mission 
 flexibility and goals, new mechs and some deadly new weapons like the Thunderbolt missle. You are 
 able to do various objectives in a mission in order to complete the overall goals, in some scenarios 
 you have to destroy a comm ray which would lead you to a different mission where you would be doing 
 raids on other facilities like that and eventually wind up invading a base which would make it 
 easier to finish that mission, whereas you could risk going in and invading your enemies base straight 
 up.
