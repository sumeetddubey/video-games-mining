:::Review:::
Combat is where Ardennes distinguishes itself. 

 The Ardennes Offensive by SSG is yet another in a long line of wargames based on the Battle of the 
 Bulge, and it follows in the tradition of the 1965 Avalon Hill paper game and the more recent Bulge 
 chapter in the Talonsoft Battleground series. So what makes Ardennes different from previous Bulge 
 games?  

 First impressions of Ardennes will probably be less than favorable. The map is a 2-D view of the 
 familiar battlefield, with an emphasis on earth colors. Units are regimental and resemble the die-cut 
 counters of paper wargames. There are various informative displays situated around the playing 
 area, which are confusing at first but a pop-up help box is available if you right-click on a section. 
 Ardennes has eight scenarios to choose from, ranging in size from a small number of turns and units 
 to a mammoth 64-turn game that includes everything. You can play these scenarios against the computer 
 at various levels of difficulty or against an organic intelligence through hot-seating, networking, 
 direct connect, modem (including e-mail) , or the Internet. Of course, with an average turn lasting 
 anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour per side, it is doubtful you'll see Ardennes on any online 
 gaming services.   

 Gameplay is fairly simple. Movement of units, combat, air interdiction, and replacements are handled 
 with a simple point-and-click interface. Deselecting a unit tends to be an annoying process, but 
 otherwise everything is fairly intuitive. Unlike in traditional wargames, where a turn consists 
 of a move phase followed by a fire phase, Ardennes combines both into one phase. While this is 
 not unique among computer wargames, it is a nice feature - especially in the long scenarios.   
 

 OK, so far nothing truly new. Combat is where Ardennes distinguishes itself from previous computer 
 versions of the battle. Unlike most wargames, Ardennes doesn't hide combat behind smoke and mirrors. 
 Like Penn and Teller showing you how a magic trick works, SSG shows you everything involved in 
 combat. All modifiers are shown, all odds are shown, and the actual combat result table is displayed. 
 There are six possible results shown, allowing the attacker to get a good idea of what the outcome 
 will be. If that's not enough, the manual gives an in-depth explanation of the combat system. In 
 an age of real-time gaming, with an emphasis on splashy graphics, it's refreshing to see a game 
 play like a paper wargame. Armchair generals should rejoice - they haven't been forgotten.  

 In addition to the superb combat system, the AI is very good. While a lot of companies boast about 
 their advanced AI, SSG actually delivers the goods - which is great for players who still prefer 
 strong computer opponents to trying to find the time to play against a human.  

 What Ardennes lacks in eye candy it makes up with a wonderful combat system, challenging AI, and 
 an excellent, informative manual (a rarity in today's world) . If you found Panzer General too realistic 
 or you think Command &amp; Conquer is a wargame, you're going to be quite disappointed. But if 
 you know what a ZOC is, understand step reductions, and fondly remember Panzer Blitz, then by all 
 means pick this game up.
