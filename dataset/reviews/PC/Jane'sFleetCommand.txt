Fleet Command takes the Harpoon model of real-time naval combat, strips it tothe bone, and wraps 
 it in a simple and visually dynamic package. 

 Naval warfare simulations are a daunting prospect for most gamers. Images of inch-thick manuals 
 and esoteric strategies have kept this niche limited to the two Harpoon games and a few other titles. 
 Sonalysts, creator of the 688 (i) submarine sim, has taken on this vast and complex subject matter 
 with a graphical flourish and a determination to render the complex nuances of modern naval warfare 
 fun and accessible. Aside from a few interface and control glitches, it has succeeded admirably. 

 Fleet Command takes the Harpoon model of real-time naval combat, strips it to the bone, and wraps 
 it in a simple and visually dynamic package without sacrificing the core sense of depth and realism. 
 Missions run the gamut of modern naval actions: massive carrier operations, smaller patrol-boat 
 encounters, escort, transit, land strikes, and so on. Almost 40 single missions are offered, each 
 with a difficulty rating of one to four stars. A four-part globe-spanning campaign game utilizes 
 many of the more difficult single missions, tying them together in a scripted campaign with persistent 
 losses and damage. Each mission has set goals and victory requirements, with varying degrees of 
 success depending upon accomplishing the mission, keeping your own ships from being damaged, and 
 avoiding collateral civilian casualties. The seas are full of unidentified contacts, some friendly, 
 some enemy, some neutral. Picking your way through this target-rich environment to find and target 
 the key assets of the enemy while protecting your own fleet is the core of the game.  

 Gameplay is handled on one screen with a mix of maps and real-time hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. 
 A large main window can display either a zoomable map of the scenario or a moveable camera view 
 of any object in the current mission. Below this are three smaller windows. One has a thumbnail 
 overview of the entire region, another has detailed information (such as speed, heading, weapons 
 loadout, and damage) on the currently selected weapon platform, and a third may be swapped with 
 the main window to show either the map or the 3D camera view.   

 All commands are handled from this simple and elegant screen layout. Using a combination of mouse 
 and hotkeys you can give orders to any ship, aircraft, or submarine under your control. Some orders 
 are simple mouse-driven commands, such as move to a location, identify an unidentified target, 
 and destroy an enemy target. Using pop-up menus and hotkeys, you can also give more precise commands. 
 Antisubmarine teams can be given patrol boxes to search for threats. Individual weapons can be 
 selected from a menu, allowing you to order an aircraft to close use its AIM-9s rather than its 
 AIM-120s. Subs can be ordered to submerge and surface at intervals, placing them out of radio contact 
 while they execute their orders. Some important commands, however, have been assigned to hotkeys 
 only and can be hard to manage. Speed and altitude, for instance, may be set to low, medium, or 
 high settings, but the info box never tells you what the current order is, and any subsequent command 
 (such as a change in direction) cancels the last speed and/or altitude order and forces the unit 
 to go to its default setting. This is awkward.  

 Other interface quirks and problems keep Fleet Command from sailing smoothly. Some of the huge encounters 
 can involve hundreds of assets once you get all your aircraft launched, yet there are only ten 
 slots for storing groups, which is woefully insufficient. This means you can't effectively create 
 flight formations. Aircraft assigned to take out a target may wind up flying at different speeds 
 and altitudes. You also can't give complex group orders - only transit, attack, and identify. If 
 you want every unit to attack with a particular weapon, you have to select and change each individually. 
 Sensors are a major headache to control. There is a vaguely described global EMCON setting that 
 turns some sensors on or off for everyone. But not every sensor can be activated, and it's hard 
 to figure out just which sensors are going hot. Some sensors aren't controlled by global settings 
 at all: If you want them on, you have to select and activate each ship's and plane's sensors individually, 
 sometimes four per ship. Since EMCON is one of the most essential elements in naval strategy, this 
 is a poor solution.  

 It's a shame that control is so iffy in Fleet Command, since the missions are quite good and entertaining. 
 The graphics are finely detailed and provide an exciting window to the unfolding action. With a 
 mission editor and good online support, there is also plenty of gameplay value. AI is generally 
 very good for enemies and adequate for friendlies, though I do wish pilots would take more aggressive 
 evasive actions when being attacked. The many strong points tilt the scale in Fleet Command's favor 
 and overcome many of its interface problems. Once you get used to the flaky controls, there is 
 a lot to like here.

Review:  In a day where sims have diminished to becoming action or arcade games, this one still stands high 
 above the chaff. For many of us who, with P4's or PD's running XP, the days of Harpoon are over 
 (in boxed, retail form) . I loved this game when it first came out. As a EB Store Manager (poor, 
 poor me) , I would go to work early just play a few scenarios before opening the doors. It was Harpoon 
 lite, but who cares? Its' not a sim, but its damn fine fun. The graphics are serviceable, the sound 
 excellent given its' age, and there are a miriad of hours to be lost in playing this sim/game. 
 If you expect nothing more than it offers, than you will be delighted. Boot it up, don your Captain's 
 cap and brace the mainsails (?) . This is what gaming is all about. An acceptable attention to detail 
 wrapped up in a colourful package. Have fun!
