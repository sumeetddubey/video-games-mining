:::Review:::
It's a monotonous gaming experience that's difficult to recommend even to those looking for a little 
 nostalgia. 

  Pac-Man: Adventures in Time, which was released about a year ago, brought the classic arcade game 
 character into uncharted territory with its creative 3D level design and platforming elements. 
 Now, Pac-Man's better half has her own new game too. But unlike in previous examples from the Pac-Man 
 series, Ms. Pac-Man doesn't follow in Pac-Man's footsteps. In fact, Ms. Pac-Man: Quest for the 
 Golden Maze marks a return to the old-fashioned maze-ridden pellet chomping of the original arcade 
 game, right down to the same basic level design. Ultimately, it all adds up to a monotonous gaming 
 experience that's difficult to recommend even to those looking for a little nostalgia.         
   Ms. Pac-Man's new game is a lot like her old one...    

  Ms. Pac-Man: Quest for the Golden Maze offers two basic modes of play -- a single-player campaign 
 and a bare-bones hotseat multiplayer mode. In the single-player mode, you'll have to chomp your 
 way through several levels, each of which has three or so sublevels. As in the original Ms. Pac-Man, 
 your only purpose here is to eat all the pellets in a particular level before moving on to the 
 next, all the while avoiding the same persistent group of ghost monsters found in previous Pac-Man 
 games. Of course, you still have access to power pellets, which make ghost monsters temporarily 
 vulnerable to Ms. Pac-Man's chomp, but you also have opportunities to grab special power-ups that 
 can give Ms. Pac-Man more speed or even a magnetic effect that attracts pellets. These power-ups, 
 which are uncovered by eating one of the smaller ghost monsters that roams around the maze, appear 
 fairly often, making the game much less difficult than it probably should be. This is Ms. Pac-Man's 
 most substantial flaw.   

  While the difficulty of the game is artificially increased by the time it takes to adjust to keyboard 
 controls, there's virtually no challenge in Ms. Pac-Man: Quest for the Golden Maze. Both novice 
 and experienced Pac-Man players should be able to waltz through the single-player mode in less 
 than an hour. Even at the hardest difficulty setting, the game lacks any serious challenge because 
 the ghost monsters' artificial intelligence is simply too poor and poses no serious threat to a 
 Pac-Man player who doesn't waste power pellets or power-ups.   

  The mazes, which traditionally make up for the lack of ghost intelligence, are incredibly uninspired 
 in Quest for the Golden Maze and lack the creativity found in the mazes of Pac-Man: Adventures 
 in Time. All the levels are straightforward maze designs with portals to the left and right, as 
 well as an occasional dead end. In any case, they all start to look the same as you progress through 
 the middle portions of the game, which just adds even more to the tedium. Even the fact that these 
 mazes are modeled in 3D does very little to differentiate them one from another.           ... only 
 it's not nearly as fun.    

  The multiplayer feature is perhaps Ms. Pac-Man's one saving grace. Two players can compete against 
 each other on a single computer to see who can score the most points before all the pellets are 
 gone. It sounds fairly shallow, but it actually isn't -- you have to decide if you want to go straight 
 for the pellets or go after power-ups and attack your opponent instead. Of course, this mode would 
 have been much more fun if there were more than three maps to choose from and if it supported some 
 kind of networking features, but as it stands, it's the only real source of replay value in the 
 entire game.   

  Overall, Ms. Pac-Man: Quest for the Golden Maze is disappointing, especially after last year's 
 rather impressive Pac-Man: Adventures in Time. The mazes are boring, the ghost monster AI is lousy, 
 and the power-ups do very little to change the basic Pac-Man gameplay. There really isn't even 
 much of a nostalgic aspect to the game, except for some awful machinelike opening music and some 
 subdued jazz tunes during actual gameplay. So you're better off steering clear of Ms. Pac-Man's 
 latest.

Review:  Although others may think this game is overrated, my opinions differ from them. This game has some 
 unique mazes. Patience is the skill to beating it for example, the tiny green ghost has some great 
 power-ups that can be very useful when you are in such a tight spot. The graphics are highly too 
 good to be true, and as for the music, now that is what I call great sounds. It's not very easy 
 to control Ms. Pac-Man when she is darting through mazes and trying not to let the ghosts corner 
 you. The sub challenges to get the golden fruit are well timed and you have to use your timed skills 
 to get everything you see in that maze. The backgrounds in the game are pretty amazing. Infogrames 
 has yet made its cut. I was shocked to see that this was one of the best reallistic Pac-Man games 
 to ever hit the PC.
