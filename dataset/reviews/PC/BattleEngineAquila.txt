:::Review:::
Battle Engine Aquila is an inadequate addition to the mission-based sci-fi sim genre. 

  Battle Engine Aquila is a futuristic mission-based shooter that puts you at the controls of a spiderlike 
 tank that can transform into a jet for short periods of time. The game was originally released 
 on consoles at the beginning of this year, and, though the game's controls have been mapped to 
 a mouse and keyboard reasonably well, the game still shows its console roots with fairly run-of-the-mill 
 visuals and throwaway features, like a split-screen multiplayer mode.  

          The Aquila has two modes, and you can transform between them whenever you like.     

 
  The story in Battle Engine Aquila casts you as a futuristic forklift driver named Hawk. As luck 
 would have it, the Forseti military has been developing a new combat craft that pilots similarly 
 to what Hawk is used to driving, and some treachery forces the Forseti to look to Hawk to pilot 
 the Aquila against the evil forces of the Muspell. All of this takes place on a planet with melting 
 polar ice caps, which means that each level has more than its fair share of Aquila-killing water. 
 The story is told via pre- and postmission cutscenes.  

  The game sets up each of its 27 missions with a cutscene and a brief paragraph or two of text that 
 details your upcoming tasks. You'll also receive radio transmissions while in the cockpit of the 
 Aquila, which give you updates on the battle's current status. Most of the game's missions put 
 you in a defensive mode whereby you must guard transports or nearby buildings by eliminating foes 
 in the area. Each mission has multiple objectives, however. Completing primary objectives is enough 
 to move the story forward, but completing your secondary objectives will branch you over to different 
 missions. Usually, the branched missions are pretty similar to their main counterparts, but there 
 are a few drastic differences later in the game.  

  The Aquila has two modes, and you can transform between them whenever you like. The walker mode 
 is a sort of spiderlike tank. You can stomp and strafe the landscape while circling tanks or buildings 
 and quickly sidestepping incoming missiles. The jet mode, as you might expect, lets you take to 
 the air so that you can fly around like a plane. Jet mode takes up energy, though, so you can only 
 fly around for a little while before having to land to recharge your energy, which is done by simply 
 returning to walker mode. In addition to your energy, you also have a life meter to worry about. 
 Each form of the Aquila has its own weapon set, and you can gain access to alternate Aquila weapon 
 loadouts as you play the game. The weapons are pretty simple and include ammo-chewing machine guns, 
 rockets, and a large, chargeable beam weapon that acts a bit like the PPC from most BattleTech 
 games. In many cases, the game will take all the challenge out of aiming. The Vulcan cannon automatically 
 tracks and leads your target, while most of the projectile weapons are either easy to point or 
 have an automatic lock-on feature.  

  The game's multiplayer mode is only playable on a split-screen. The game lets you select a battle 
 engine configuration, and then you can dive into three types of two-player matches. Co-op pits 
 both players against a variety of Muspell forces. Skirmish mode gives each player a base, which 
 is defended by turrets and tanks. The object is to eliminate the enemy forces. Finally, there is 
 a one-on-one mode for going directly up against another battle engine. More maps are unlocked via 
 the single-player game, as are a ton of concept art and other little tidbits.  

  Graphically, Battle Engine Aquila has a pretty standard look to it. The gameplay doesn't slow down, 
 and, overall, the game looks decent without really standing out. The only notable weapon effect 
 is the upgraded version of your main cannon, which can white-out the entire screen when it lands, 
 but even this isn't especially impressive.  

          The game contains split-screen multiplayer, but no online or LAN options.     

  The 
 game's sound is similarly stock-feeling. The voice work contains a lot of English accents and is 
 solid without going over the top. The voices inflect well, and the game's sound effects and music 
 give the same sort of general sci-fi feeling as the rest of the game.  

  Battle Engine Aquila is an inadequate addition to the mission-based sci-fi sim genre. The branching 
 mission paths are a nice idea, but, in practice, they could have allowed for more mission variety 
 than what the final product actually delivers. And the concept of two-player split-screen, rather 
 than some sort of more accessible online or LAN multiplayer, is just plain silly. Fans of the genre 
 will probably be able to dig around and find some things to like, but, in the end, Battle Engine 
 Aquila isn't worth your time or effort.

Review:  This is one of my favorite games... I love the transforming thing and at my advice , the weapons 
 are unique and perfect... It's a very easy game and you can learn how to control and battle with 
 the Aquila in a very very short time.
  The graphics are quite cool but the sound could be better. I hope they gonna make a second episode 
 of this game because the story is nice but the bad thing is that is too short. The best thing is 
 that you don't have to own a very very fast PC to play it. For the people who expect something 
 very very good , I suggest to rent it first because I don't say is perfect , I say is quite good.

Review:  This games has good things and bad things, but I just want to talk about the good ones.
  The levels are quite good, action is all around, we can destroy tanks, jet fighters, buildings... U 
 name it!! The game its not easy, but at the same time is not hard... we can learn to play in no 
 time... and when we learn to control our Mech/Jet we can&acute; t stop playing the game, at least 
 it was what happened to me. I like blowing the hundreds of enemies into pieces, and at the same 
 time evade enemy bombs... simply good!!
  The graphics are quite good, with very good effects of explosions and lights.
  The sound its 
 ok, but it could be better... sometimes I don&acute; t know if I am on war field or in a noisy disco.
 
  This game is very good for passing some, only true Sci-Fi sim fans should buy it.

Review:  The game is to basic and the story isn't very interesting, it looks good but the game soon gets 
 repetitive. I soon lost interest. : ( The game does has good graphics but the gameplay soon lost 
 its value. The weapon choices are limited and your enemys are fairly weak except for the ociasinal 
 boss, or an oppsing Aquila. Thankfully i bought the game at a cheap price but i still have my doubts 
 about spending 20 dollars to buy it. I would not recommend buying this game maybe a rental if you 
 feel like stabing your eye with an ice pick for a week.

Review:  battle engine aquilla looks great and should be fun for anyone who likes sci-fi, mech games, anime. 
 This is a simple arcade style game with very few controls
  
  The mission editor is set up in a unique way giving you scores for levels and the ability to go 
 back at any time and play any mission. The mission path even branches out on occasion offering 
 you the option to play standard difficulty missions or much more difficult missions. For each mission 
 you will have the choice of 1-3 mechs and also the ability to chose from among several wingmen 
 all of whom have different strengths and weaknesses (this will come in to play depending on the 
 type of mission) .
  
  I never heard anything about this game and saw it @ a used book store for $4 so I thought I would 
 give it a try. I have to admit I was surprised how much fun it was to play. well worth the $4. 
 I even managed to get stuck on a couple missions and had to resort to going online and finding 
 a walkthrough.
  
  There isn't really multiplayer, just the ability to play someone else on the same computer with 
 a split screen (annoying) . Online could have had potentional: either pvp or even better co-op against 
 the AI in randomly generated scenarios.

Review:  For 20 bucks you get about 25 bucks worth of fun. Good for short gaming sessions or when you just 
 want to feel powerful and blow sh** up. The graphics are a bit dated, but will run on lower end 
 machines (which I think is a plus) . The sound is average with voice acting thats not too bad for 
 a game of this quality. The controls are smooth and for the most part intuitive. I would recommend 
 changing a few choice keys around before hopping in the pilots seat. Overall a bargain bin game 
 that tries a little harder than most.
