Not nearly as original as its unorthodox title may imply. 

 It's the same stale story. A big, bad, terrible war has devastated a planet and the post-holocaust 
 survivors have begun to battle for control of its resources. Enter Krush, Kill 'N Destroy, a game 
 not nearly as original as its unorthodox title may imply.  

 KKND is best described as Command &amp; Conquer meets Mad Max. Like C&amp; C, KKND has two warring 
 factions and you can play as either. There are the Survivors, an army that relies on technology 
 and machines in battle. Their weapons consist of huge 4X4 vehicles with machine guns and armored 
 vehicles bearing turrets and missiles. Conversely, the Evolved choose to use animals, not machines. 
 It wouldn't be out of the norm to see an Evolved battle group of three or four huge, acid-spitting 
 scorpions escorted by a few huge elephants bearing automatic guns. Oh, and don't forget that deadly 
 Missile Crab.   

 Gameplay is consistent with any traditional real-time war simulation: Click on units with the mouse, 
 then click again to order them to attack or move. To construct enough units to achieve victory, 
 bases must be carefully built, and resources (consisting of oil patches that must be refined) must 
 be managed and protected. Most missions consist of destroying the other faction's base, but other 
 tasks, such as escorting convoys and search-and-rescue missions, help break the monotony. Although 
 KKND is very much like others in this genre, there are some subtle differences. The units in KKND 
 are complex: they become more deadly as they gain experience in combat. A green squadron of infantry 
 won't stand a chance against a healthy veteran bunch that has notched a kill or two.   

 These intricacies are certainly welcome, but KKND fails to make the units interesting beyond their 
 ability to become more efficient killers. Giant scorpions and 4x4 trucks offer nothing new. Sure, 
 it's a crab that fires a missile and a scorpion that spits acid. Big deal. That's basically the 
 same as a tank firing a shell and a big truck firing an automatic weapon. There really isn't anything 
 that distinguishes one unit from the other, aside from their appearance. Clearly a killer scorpion 
 could do something more interesting to its prey than just fire green gobs of acid at it.   

 Expert players of real-time strategy games will probably get the most out of KKND because of its 
 sheer difficulty. The artificial intelligence is more advanced than other games in the genre, but 
 that isn't saying a lot given the generally simple AI found in similar titles. It isn't without 
 fault. The AI executes advanced tactics such as attacking positions from multiple fronts and probing 
 your base's weaknesses in an effort to exploit them. But KKND's challenge is also due to problems 
 stemming from the game's design. First and foremost, the map scroll rate is too sluggish, making 
 it hard to react to battles happening in various places. Also adding to the frustration is the 
 fact that it seems like the enemy is always one level more technologically advanced, artificially 
 making your opponent tougher by default.  

 Technically, KKND is slightly above average. The crisp SVGA graphics allow for many units and lots 
 of well-drawn territory to be onscreen, but some of the units could have been drawn and animated 
 much better. The soundtracks are decent and the chirps of your men audibly responding "Alrighty 
 then!" to your commands is funny - for a while. In all, the game would have benefited from a little 
 more polishing.  

 KKND is a good game, but it doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as WarCraft II or 
 Command &amp; Conquer. The few innovations and solid gameplay make KKND worth purchasing - but 
 only if you've finished the aforementioned games.

Review:  I think that this game is better than what is written!! Is to consider that this game was released 
 in 1997 so u can not pretend a lot of thing like great graphics or excellent sound!
  I remember that was one of my first games and i played a lot of hours with it!
  
  There are 
 2 factions: the Survivors and the Evolved! Survivors are humans that have survived to the nuclear 
 war and evolved are creatures and human that have transformed after the nuclear war.
  
  I think that this game is under appreciated because people that say their opinion about it have 
 played other games (newer) before playing this one and so they are influenced! :)
  
  I will give a 9 to bring up a little the score but i think that this game is 8 / 8,5!!!
