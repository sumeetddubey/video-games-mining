:::Review:::
Although this is not a terrible game, there's nothing here that would merit someone to really consider 
 buying it when there are so many other 3D games of such a higher caliber. 

 For decades Avalon Hill has been renowned for its wonderfully brilliant board games, but when it 
 turned its attention to computerized ports of its successful library, instead of becoming the turn-based 
 juggernaut of PC games, it took a promising niche and heaped on the mediocrity. Apparently not 
 content with giving only one genre a bad name, Avalon Hill decided to tackle the ultra-successful, 
 much-ballyhooed first-person shooter and create a Quake clone that'll no doubt reach the bargain 
 bin of your local Babbages in record time.  

 Defiance is the first release from Visceral Productions, the action-oriented publishing arm of Avalon 
 Hill. The game was developed by Logicware but still manages to evoke that Avalon Hill sense of 
 underachievement. Although this is not a terrible game, there's nothing here that would merit someone 
 to really consider buying it when there are so many other 3D games of such a higher caliber in 
 the same price range.  

 The action (to use the term loosely) takes place on the planet Calchona, in a secretive military 
 complex. There's a war raging between your Hegemonistic Core of Planets and the Anterran Premacy 
 Worlds, but it's being waged in space so no civilians are killed and no planets rendered uninhabitable. 
 Unfortunately, both sides have reached a stalemate, forcing you and the rest of the "good guys" 
 to resort to planetary warfare. As an elite fighter pilot, you've been selected to test out the 
 new LAV-6 SABER, and this is where the "fun" begins.  

 To its credit, the first level serves as a subtle tutorial, helping you gain an understanding of 
 the controls and get a good feel for the ship as you find your way through an obstacle course, 
 showing off for the monitoring military VIPs. Using a keyboard, joystick, or/and mouse, you move 
 along in a Descent-like manner. Instead of easily going up or down, your ship is equipped with 
 thrusters that are only useful in short bursts. Usually you glide a few feet off the ground, using 
 the thrusters to boost you through an elevated opening, or hopscotching up raised platforms. As 
 you make your way through the course, you're given little clues - from the background dialogue 
 on the intercom - that the action's about to heat up, until eventually you hear cries of terror 
 accompanied by squishy, flesh-ripping noises. Having reached the conclusion that this wasn't part 
 of the test, you fly out onto the battlefield and wage war with flying manta rays and other assorted 
 vile vermin.  

 While Defiance fails to copy any of the redeeming qualities of its id rival (namely compelling gameplay) , 
 it does manage to successfully imitate its insipid color palette with plenty of unexciting browns 
 and grays. The game does boast MMX and 3D-accelerated support, but aside from the realistic looking 
 explosions, you really have to look long and hard to see the overall difference. In fact, the game 
 actually slowed down for me when I played the 3D version.   

 The game brags of using a technology called Ncircle to deliver more realistic three-dimensional 
 sound, and whatever it does, it does indeed do well. The distant sound of screeching beasties doesn't 
 sound as if it's limited to the speakers right in front of you, though it must be admitted that 
 the effects sound like they are sampled from a special effects CD. The "over 200 lines of spoken 
 dialogue" are also decent, but nothing to write home about.  

 Gameplay is lackluster at best. Most of the time, the monsters simply run headlong at your ship 
 with little regard that you are blasting the hell out of them. The controls are infuriatingly difficult 
 to master and anyone who picks up the game will be glad it ships with a remapping utility. And 
 finally, you have to actually read the readme. txt file if you want to learn how to save a game 
 before you reach a save point.   

 Defiance is not a horrible game; you'll spend some time with it, get the occasional fleeting moment 
 of pleasure here and there, but invariably you'll struggle to remember a thing about it when you're 
 done.

Review:  This game is intense. You're alone on a planet filled with governmet made space monster that were 
 constructed by the Space Government, which I think is controlled by a corporation. Come to think 
 of it why are corporations always responcible for everything bad in games. Games are made by corporations! 
 I mean what is up with that? The same thing goes for science fiction movies, or most movies in 
 general. Remember Care Bears the Movie? That had an evil corporation in it and I think toxic waste 
 and frowning. Care Bears hate frowning! You know what? Care Bears the Movie was made by a corporation 
 too! I WORK FOR A CORPORATION! WE ALL DO! I'm WRITTING IN CAPS BECAUSE I AM YELLING! In short I 
 love this game. A lot of people don't but it to me is a classic. Pleasep lay it if you can!
