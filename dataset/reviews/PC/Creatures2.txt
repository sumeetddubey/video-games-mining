:::Review:::
It's quite charming, and the training, raising, and relationships you experience are, well, quite 
 real. 

 Mindscape's original Creatures product made its debut around the time that Tamagotchis were replacing 
 human breeding and pet-buying instincts with computer-generated life models. And people came running. 
 Not only did they buy it, they built web sites, friendship circles, pen-pal partnerships, web rings, 
 and support groups around the phenomenon. Now Creatures 2 is available, and fans of the original 
 (those already deeply embedded in the Norn world) will most likely be ardently moved and satisfied. 
 But if you're not already a patron, it might be a little late to become one now.   

 This is not to say anything generally negative about the Creatures 2 adventure. It's actually quite 
 charming, as before, and the training, raising, and relationships you experience are, well, quite 
 real. The concept is the same: You raise Norns, little creatures that are cute, but more in a TV's 
 Olsen twins sense - meaning surrounded by an inexplicable eerie quality that borders on disturbing 
 and nightmarish. These Norns come to you in the form of gender-classed eggs in a hatchery. You 
 pick your eggs and move them to an incubator. No pain here; they hatch instantly, then the real 
 labor of love begins.   

 Aside from making sure your Norns have food and proper entertainment, such as tossing a ball around 
 or harassing a puppy, perhaps the most interesting aspect of the entire experience is teaching 
 the creatures to speak. The language development model is pretty smart, exhibiting exponential 
 growth, as the Norns' lives are only about ten hours long at best. A computer assists you in the 
 language teaching area. You bark language commands by typing in words, or short strings of words, 
 to communicate with and build the vocabularies of your Norns. The Creatures enterprise will undoubtedly 
 reach its pinnacle when voice recognition becomes a mainstay in PC games, as chasing a Norn typing 
 "Stop, What, Look, Stop, Come, Eat" and so on does lose its charm fairly quickly. Other parental 
 duties, such as feeding and discipline, are more intuitive - spank your Norn by tapping him on 
 the butt with the cursor (that's right, good ol' spanking; no contemporary new-age child rearing 
 here) , get his attention by tapping him on the nose, and feed him by bringing him food, initially, 
 then by teaching him to find it on his own.   

 What you ultimately want to do with your Norns is pretty much what you did the first time around. 
 You must successfully raise and breed them while exploring Albia, the world they live in, now searching 
 for machines, which will assist them (and you) in the journey. One machine lets you genetically 
 conjoin your creatures of any type so that they can breed instantly and artificially - great for 
 players who have a tough time getting Norns to "do it" on their own. Of course, the beauty of technology 
 is carried one step further, as in the first Creatures, by the simple fact that if you're a total 
 reproductive failure, you can adopt baby Norns or grown-ups (six-hour-olds) online at any one of 
 the many web sites dedicated to this cause.   

 The environment your Norns live in is a large and detailed humanized burrowing habitat with everything 
 from plants (medicinal and otherwise) and animals to electronic devices and toys to interact with, 
 and the interface in which you use these items is relatively intuitive. You can maintain detailed 
 records of all of your Norns, tracking health, reproductive interests (you'll have a choice of 
 aphrodisiacs for your frigid set) , intelligence, boredom, and more. Finding your strays within 
 the habitat is also fairly easy, as a button on the upper left of your game screen allows you to 
 go from room to room, Norn to Norn, quickly, for routine checks.   

 Yet with all of this going on, Creatures 2 is kind of dull. Breeding your first pair, then watching 
 them reproduce, is pretty rewarding at first. But that initial milestone may not be enough to make 
 most gamers push for more. And playing Creatures 2 requires a lot of patience and persistence. 
 If you've ever given a pet away because it was too much work, this is not for you. What Creatures 
 2 delivers is more of what the original Creatures introduced: a membership to a culture dedicated 
 to the concept of artificial life and the intricacies of making it work in its controlled chaos 
 environment. It's the sort of thing that if actually real, it would be a whole heck of a lot more 
 fun, but since it's not, the best advice is just to know the limits of your attention span before 
 you jump in.
