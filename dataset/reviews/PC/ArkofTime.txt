:::Review:::
The logic behind some of the puzzles is a little on the dubious side. 

 All right folks, I'm going to admit it: I'm sick of Myst-style adventures. You know the kind, with 
 tons of gorgeous graphics, an appropriately ethereal musical score - and no characters to meet. 
 I'm not saying I don't appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into the making of these games, nor 
 do I mean to slag anyone who enjoys them. I just prefer traditional graphic adventures.  

 Ark of Time is definitely a traditional graphic adventure. There's nothing revolutionary or groundbreaking 
 here: The graphics are excellent, but certainly not unique, and the interface is based almost entirely 
 on the tried and true system found in LucasArts' adventures. In fact, Ark of Time is actually a 
 throwback in at least one regard: It has some of the worst voice acting I can remember hearing 
 in a game.  

 So why do I want to keep playing? The answer is simple: puzzles, and lots of 'em. Sure, they're 
 all pretty much of the "find the right object for the right situation" variety, but that suits 
 me just fine. Because the interface is so standard, you don't have to spend time muddling about 
 trying to figure out how to do something; instead, you'll be pulling your hair figuring out what 
 you need to do. There is one slight problem with the interface, though: You sometimes have to combine 
 inventory items in the "correct" order to make a new item. Simply (and mathematically) put, A+B=C 
 - but B+A doesn't always equal C. It's a small flaw, to be sure, but one that could convince players 
 they're on the wrong path when the only real problem is the order in which they're clicking on 
 inventory items.  

 During the course of your search for a missing archaeologist, you'll have to travel to several locations 
 around the world, from Stonehenge to Easter Island to the Mayan peninsula. It might seem odd that 
 you can travel halfway around the globe and still find the same people doing the same stuff when 
 you return from one of these jaunts - but hey, it's just a game. And while the logic behind the 
 solutions to some of the puzzles is a little on the dubious side, that's pretty much to be expected 
 in any graphic adventure.  

 As I mentioned earlier, the big disappointment is the voice acting. I don't have a problem with 
 the stereotyped, over-the-top vocalizations for a lot of the characters: This looks and feels more 
 like a cartoon anyway. And I can even deal with the wacky intro, where dialogue is eschewed for 
 a creepy narrator solemnly intoning what sounds like the first few paragraphs of a cheesy novel. 
 But I'd sure like to meet whoever it was that approved the actor who does the hero's voice. The 
 delivery is stilted, the tone flat and lifeless; to make matters worse, this "ace reporter with 
 an attitude" is a wimp of the first order. He doesn't want an all-expenses paid trip to the Caribbean, 
 nor does he want to discover why a famous professor has vanished mysteriously - he just wants to 
 get back to covering football in England. Make no mistake: This guy's not just an anti-hero, he's 
 a wuss.  

 Ark of Time won't be challenging for Adventure Game of the Year when next Christmas rolls around, 
 but if you can deal with the voice acting you'll find plenty of challenge wrapped up in a package 
 that's pleasing to the eye. If Koei and Trecision would invest some effort in getting better actors 
 for a sequel, the chances are good they'd have an A-class title on their hands.
