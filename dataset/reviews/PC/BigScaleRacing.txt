Outside of some bugs, Big Scale Racing turns out to be a pleasant little racer and a better game 
 than you'd probably expect. 

 With some games, you just have to ask, "Why?" That's the case with Big Scale Racing, a game about 
 1/5-scale, radio-controlled cars. Racing these 3-foot-long, gas-powered cars might be exciting 
 in real life, but you normally expect computer games to offer more exotic thrills, racing or otherwise. 
 You can easily find them, too. Acclaimed games like NASCAR Racing 2002 Season and Need for Speed: 
 Porsche Unleashed put you behind the virtual wheel of the sorts of exotic cars you'd love to drive 
 in real life. So, why would you want to play a simulation about miniature cars instead? For a simple 
 reason, really: It's fun. While Big Scale Racing may sound like a lame idea on paper, it's actually 
 a nice little racing game -- nothing extraordinary by any stretch, but not too shabby, either. If 
 only it weren't hampered by some major bugs, it would be easier to recommend.           The physics 
 are surprisingly convincing.    

 A few years ago, a game called Re-Volt offered up a somewhat similar racing concept. In Re-Volt, 
 you raced little R/C cars through museums, cruise ships, and other whimsical locales. Big Scale 
 Racing, on the other hand, puts you on replicas of actual miniature racing circuits found in developer 
 BumbleBeast's home country of the Netherlands.   

  In other words, the tracks look pretty much like the sorts of courses you'd see real racecars plying, 
 just a lot smaller. You'll zip down long straights, whiz around broad turns, and try to maintain 
 some speed through tight hairpins. Unfortunately, you only get a paltry six tracks. Other than 
 one small oval track, they're all basically characterless bowl-of-spaghetti layouts with little 
 to distinguish them.   

  Happily, the courses can be entertaining to race, despite their general blandness, thanks to the 
 game's fresh subject. Since you're dealing with 1/5-scale cars, the cars' handling won't be what 
 you're used to from standard racing games. One area where the game shines, in fact, is in the modeling 
 of the cars' physics. When you hit a curb or take an off-road excursion after a nasty spin on a 
 wet track, your car really jounces and bounces around -- or even flips -- just like you'd expect it 
 to. Unfortunately, you won't see any damage modeling, though.   

  Big Scale Racing offers a standard assortment of racing modes. Championship mode offers multiple 
 racing series, with one for each of the 10 car classes found in the game. In each of these series, 
 you'll race once on each of the game's six tracks, unlocking new championships and cars if you 
 place high enough. An 11th championship becomes available after you've beaten the first 10; there 
 you'll take part in two races on each track, choosing your car type for each race weekend.   

 
  Along with the various championship options, you can take some reconnaissance laps in a practice 
 mode, dueling a ghost car representing your fastest lap. You can also battle through quick races, 
 using the cars you've unlocked in championship mode. Here, your opponents will automatically be 
 matched to your skill level based on past performance. Opponent AI is decent overall, and, happily, 
 your competitors occasionally make mistakes, banging into each other or getting hung up on curbs. 
 If AI competitors don't suit you, you can take on friends in multiplayer races, which include split-screen 
 and LAN or Internet matches (the latter via direct-IP entry) .   

  The game's five main racing classes range from junior to pro, each with unique stats and increasing 
 realism. Junior cars feature four-wheel drive traction, but limited torque and rpm. Agile but twitchy 
 pro cars most closely match the real-world 1/5-scale cars, with rear-wheel drive, hard tires, and 
 high power. Each of these classes is subdivided into standard and "hopped" classes, the latter 
 a hot-rodded version of the standard cars. Sadly, you can't tweak the cars at all, something you 
 normally want in a racing game.           Solid graphics help make up for somewhat bland track 
 designs.    

 The graphics depicting the cars and tracks are surprisingly good for an obscure game like this, 
 with some memorable details and attractive scenes. Light and shadow play across the raceways, and 
 the reflective cars billow thin trails of bluish smoke when you accelerate. When you race in the 
 rain, lightning flickers among the clouds while the cars kick up a fine mist from the rainwater 
 on the track. The game's audio isn't as strong, with merely functional sound effects and a disposable 
 soundtrack (de rigueur for racing games, apparently) .   

  Then there's an intensely annoying bug that can occasionally cause a smoke-alarm-like sound effect 
 to loop endlessly -- and loudly, at that. Unfortunately, Big Scale Racing is beset by a few major, 
 though intermittent, bugs like that. Sometimes the game will force you to type in a serial number 
 before playing even after you've already entered it during a previous session. Sometimes the game 
 will lock up when starting, possibly requiring you to reboot your computer. Outside of these bugs, 
 Big Scale Racing turns out to be a pleasant little racer and a better game than you'd probably 
 expect. It has the added benefit of being a good choice for younger gamers: It's easy to learn, 
 nonviolent, and focuses on miniature cars -- something kids can relate to and car-loving adults can 
 always enjoy, too. Just hope a patch is released in short order.

Review:  Gamespot's review says about any thing that needs to be said about the game. I'd just add a few 
 precisions.
  
  There was this 1988 game on the NES called RC Pro Am. As far as my video games knowledge goes, 
 this was really the first game to feature R/C cars. Two years later, Commodore Amiga owners would 
 enjoy Super Cars II (by 8-bit racing geniuses Andrew Morris and Shaun Southern, fathers of the 
 much acclaimed Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge series) , which showed many gameplay similarities with 
 the latter, including the particular "2D-physics" of cars while skid-racing around the track. Speaking 
 about pre Re-Volt, R/C cars games, there's no record of any Micro Machines title before 1991, either. 
 I'm sure there could be a couple of others to add. Sorry for not bringing up more game names for 
 the moment.
  
  A remark pertaining to the main lack of Big Scale Racing. The absence of a good ol' garage area 
 really feeds a frustration which, to me, begins immediately with dicovering that the feature is 
 simply NOT there. I can't understand that, because, using the power of my mind, I can see a 3D 
 model of your R/C car, bodywork popped off, revealing the inner workings of the mini-monster; tweaks 
 like battery voltage, engine power and gears, tires, shocks & springs and ride height settings 
 would be visible on the 3D model while changing values... Well.
  
  To put an end to this pointless babbling, and incidentally to go to bed, I'll say why I like the 
 game. To be frank, I bought Big Scale Racing second-hand in 2003. Thinking, "that could possibly 
 provide some fun worth it's displayed price". I really can't remember what the cashier charged 
 me, but I know now it was less than the real value of the game. Big Scale Racing is very minimal: 
 it's all about the physics of these surprinsingly cool radio controlled cars. They feel sharp and 
 responsive. I could almost call it a pure delight to drive these little machines with a dual analog 
 sticks controller, finding the good tone to speed through a long mini-curve, stepping pregressively 
 on the mini-throttle while rolling out of sharper mini-turns...
  
  Just as reviewer Scott Osborne mentions, it's real fun to drive those models of model cars! The 
 addition of a car tweaking engine as solid as the physics model would have granted this game with 
 a minimum mark of 7.5.
