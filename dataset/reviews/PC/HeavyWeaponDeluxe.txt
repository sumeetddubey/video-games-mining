:::Review:::
Heavy Weapon Deluxe has great weapon effects and a generally solid look, but the gameplay and control 
 options make the game a little too shallow to recommend. 

  Heavy Weapon Deluxe is a shooter that puts you in an atomic tank, rumbling through fictitious, 
 decidedly Russian areas as you blast jets out of the sky with a variety of weaponry. Despite the 
 game's destructive theme, it keeps a lighthearted atmosphere, thanks to its cartoonlike graphics. 

  As you play, you'll earn power-ups that will enhance your tank's firing abilities by adding homing 
 missiles, lasers, and so on. One of the pickups is a screen-clearing nuke that comes complete with 
 a nice-looking mushroom cloud. The game's main mode is a campaign-based mode that has you upgrading 
 your tank along the way, but once you've completed a few of these missions, you can go into survival 
 mode for an additional challenge. Your only control is over where your tank is aiming, though the 
 tank will move back and forth as you aim, giving you some control over dodging, though not as much 
 as you'd like. Separating the moving and firing controls would have added to the game's complexity, 
 and the increasing control options would have been a nice addition.

Review:  In this review I'll just give out suggestions in what weapon upgrades you should use before each 
 mission, such as follows:
  
  Before M1: Normal gun only, of course.
  Before M2: Normal gun plus one defensive orb.
  Before M3: Normal gun, one defensive orb, plus 
 one laser.
  Before M4: Normal gun, one orb, one laser, plus one heat - seeking missile.
  Before M5: Normal gun, one orb, one laser, one tracking missile, plus one
  thunderstrike.
  
 Before M6: Normal gun, one orb, two lasers, one tracking missile, plus one
  thunderstrike.
  Before M7: Normal gun, one orb, two lasers, one tracking missile, one flak cannon, plus one thunderstrike.
 
  
  End of part 1
  
  I wrote those above to help you to choose the right weapons to upgrade before
  each mission, 
 and because those are the configurations I used to plow through missions 1 - 7 ---- without dying. 
 But, if you are more satisfied with your own configurations, I under stand you, because this guide 
 is only for the ones who needs a hand on how to upgrade their weapons carefully, and effectively.
