:::Review:::
This is probably one of the better kids' games to hit the market in a while, and that it's clever 
 and charming enough to appeal to adults is a testament to that fact. 

  The idea of retelling the story of Star Wars using Lego building blocks sounds like the premise 
 for a clever fan-made short film, something that would end up being passed around by e-mail and 
 message boards. But Eidos and Traveller's Tales have taken the idea and run with it, creating a 
 game that, while designed with kids in mind, has such a surplus of charm that even nostalgia-minded 
 adults will be able to join in on the fun.  

          You've got your Lego in my Star Wars!     

  Those same adult Star Wars fans may be 
 disappointed to learn that Lego Star Wars doesn't tell the tale of the Rebel Alliance and their 
 struggle against the evil Galactic Empire. Rather, Lego Star Wars focuses its energies on Episodes 
 I, II, and III. That's right, you'll get a glimpse of how  Revenge of the Sith  turns out nearly 
 a full two months before the film hits theaters. There are plenty of "spoilers" in the game, although 
 this isn't the strictest retelling and it isn't afraid to regularly inject some humor into what 
 were originally pretty serious situations. Still, it seems odd that an officially sanctioned product 
 like this, one that reveals so much about the final days of Anakin Skywalker, would be released 
 so far ahead of the film.  

  Each episode is broken up into multiple chapters, each re-creating memorable sequences from the 
 films. The game is largely an action adventure game, though it subverts its fair share of genre 
 convention. You'll only have control over a single character at a time, but you'll usually have 
 at least one computer-controlled companion with you, and at times that number can grow to a healthy 
 half-dozen. Making this even more interesting is the fact that you can switch between any characters 
 in your party on the fly. The game really capitalizes on this by giving different characters different 
 abilities. Jedi characters come equipped with lightsabers and the ability to "Force move" various 
 objects; Astromech droids (the R2D2 trash-can-style droids) can hover for short distances and can 
 also be used to unlock certain doors; and characters like Padme Amidala are armed solely with a 
 blaster and don't have the Jedi double-jump, but they can use grappling hooks to pull their way 
 up to otherwise unreachable areas. There are literally dozens of different playable characters, 
 many of which have completely unique abilities.  

  The game capitalizes on these unique characteristics by riddling every level with a ton of puzzles 
 that can only be solved by a specific character in your party or by several characters working 
 together. It's not all puzzle-solving, though. There are several big boss fights with the likes 
 of Darth Maul, Jango Fett, and Count Dooku in Lego Star Wars. There's plenty of straight-up combat, 
 too, with the high point being the massive Jedi arena battle on Geonosis. Like the puzzles, the 
 combat is pretty simple and straightforward. The game isn't afraid to break away from the third-person 
 action adventure altogether, such as in the pod race from Episode I, or a sequence where you pilot 
 an attack ship on Geonosis at the start of the Clone War.  

  The game is extremely forgiving in general, dealing out virtually no punishment for failure. There 
 is basically no way that you can "lose" Lego Star Wars. Also, the single-player game isn't particularly 
 long -- if you keep your eye on the prize, you can run through all three episodes in just a few hours. 
 But as you play, you'll gain access to other characters with which you can go back into levels 
 you've already completed. Since different characters can have markedly different abilities, you'll 
 find that there are areas in each level that you simply could not reach with the original characters. 
 So, despite the game's relative brevity, it definitely encourages multiple plays. The game also 
 has two-player co-op support, where a second player can jump in (or, alternately, drop out) at 
 any point. The game actually feels like it was designed for co-op play, and the experience definitely 
 benefits from having another warm body around.  

  The actual gameplay is generally enjoyable, if a bit easy. But what really gives Lego Star Wars 
 its appeal is the way it's all presented -- that is, with Legos. The game fudges a little bit on 
 some of the actual level geometry, but the majority of it appears as though it was constructed 
 out of those little Danish building blocks. All of the characters, even the various aliens, look 
 like Lego people, and when an enemy or an object is destroyed, it will crumble into its component 
 pieces. There are a few set pieces where the game looks downright impressive, but for the most 
 part it keeps things on a relatively small scale. It generally isn't overzealous with lighting 
 and particle effects, so the game therefore has a somewhat plain, but clean look. The differences 
 between the PC and PlayStation 2 versions are purely aesthetic and relatively minor. The PC version 
 simply looks a lot nicer, thanks to bump-mapping and some reflection effects. The PC version also 
 benefits from running at a higher resolution.  

          If you want to go into Revenge of the Sith spoiler-free, wait until you've seen the movie 
 to pick up Lego Star Wars.     

  Despite the game's unusual look, if you were to close your eyes, there would be no mistaking this 
 as a Star Wars game. The sound plays as big a part in establishing the tone in Lego Star Wars as 
 the graphics. With no voice acting to muddle up the affairs, blaster and lightsaber effects are 
 allowed to really take the stage, accompanied nicely by all of the classic John Williams music 
 that has become inexorably linked to Star Wars.  

  This is probably one of the better kids' games to hit the market in a while, and that it's clever 
 and charming enough to appeal to adults is a testament to that fact. The novelty of watching a 
 little Lego person version of Obi-Wan Kenobi duel it out with Darth Maul certainly accounts for 
 a large portion of the game's appeal, but on its own merits it's a fairly fun, inventive little 
 game.

Review:  me and a friend played this every day when he had it, story mode is very short, but i used to unlock 
 all the extra's that were pretty cool too, i always thought it sucked for some reason until i got 
 it for christmas, it got all three episodes in lego style, sounds kinda childish but pretty cool 
 
  
  graphics :Not bad, not great but certainly not bad for 2005, very bright and colorful, some cool 
 effects, and ofcourse everything is lego that makes it very cool too 7/10 
  
  sound : nothing really special, characters dont say anything, i dont think it would sound good 
 if they would, but at least everything has the same kinda sounds as in the movies, like the blaster 
 fires and light saber **** and such, done very good 
  
  gameplay : the gameplay ruled, you had to use the force to solve puzzles and such, you fought against 
 all kind of enemies that were in the movies too, and there were all kind of cool characters too 
 unlock, and much more extras, the multiplayer ruled too, spend a long time with a friend playing 
 this game together 9/10 
  overall : 8/10 if you see this game somewhere in a store for 5 or 10 bucks, i recommend you to 
 buy it, dont doubt cuz it's lego, it really wont disappoint you, have fun ! :D

Review:  =================================================
  Quick Review
  =================================================
  
  Lego Star Wars plays across Episode 1, 
 2 and 3 through 17 missions mixing light-saber battles, blaster battles, a few vehicle missions, 
 platforming puzzles and many hidden extras.
  
  Story mode is very easy but still fun. An average gamer easily race through all 17 missions in 
 an hour (without attempting to unlock any extras) .
  
  Some players will attempt to get all the extras. It's slightly challenging, but unfortunately the 
 extras have little/no change on the actual game play.
  
  For casual players or Star Wars 'super-fans', Lego Star Wars is good. Hardcore players expecting 
 depth and challenge should look elsewhere.
  
  I found it brand new for under $10 at Staples. 
  
  ________________DETAILS BELOW________________
 
  
  =======================================
  Extras: Mini-Kits
  =======================================
  Each missions has 10 hidden canisters. Collect all 10 
 and unlock a Lego mini-kit, usually in the form of a ship or vehicle. Both incomplete and complete 
 mini-kits are displayed in an area called the parking lot.
  
  =======================================
  Extras: True Jedi Status
  =======================================
 
  Missions have a set number of "studs" to collect. Collect this minimum amount to gain "true Jedi 
 status" for that mission. This unlocks some characters appearing in that mission. Completing all 
 17 unlocks a special mission.
  
  =======================================
  Multi-player
  =======================================
  I played LSW in single player mode, but by looking at 
 the level and puzzle design, it's obvious the designers worked with a second player in mind. In 
 solo mode, the CPU character almost always stays defensive; very boring. The fun-factor definitely 
 increases in co-op mode where players can stand back-to-back deflecting blaster shots and covering 
 each other.
  
  =================================================
  Graphics
  =================================================
  There are no overly complex models, since 
 the characters and surrounding objects are made of lego. All the missions are bright and colorful 
 and the character models animate nicely. The min system requirements are quite low, 1GH processor 
 256MB Ram, so any decent computer can run this game at medium-high resolution. There are many nice-looking 
 effects and some can be toggled: Bloom lighting, plastic reflection, water effects, shadows, particle 
 effects and more.
  
  =================================================
  Sound
  =================================================
  Awesome, all the missions are filled with 
 recognizable Star Wars music from the movies. All the Star Wars sounds are here and intact, from 
 blaster fire, light-saber swings, R2 unit calls, light-saber deflections, light-saber vs light-saber 
 sparks, "using the force"... all sound full and authentic. There is no voice acting at all, probably 
 to retain the childish tone.

Review:  Alright people now before you wet your pants and start sending some hate mail. I am a huge fan 
 of star wars and have been a fan going over twenty years now. This game at first was actually pretty 
 hip and exciting. However it grew rather repetitive very quickly. Now this would be a great game 
 to play with friends and even online. However if you sitting at home playing by yourself then this 
 one could really bite the big one.
  
  As an adult I understand this is supposed to be a little childish however the game is actually 
 pretty cool, great concept followed by solid graphics at a lego bite size proportion. The actual 
 gameplay on the other hand is pretty boring and you find yourself doing the same thing every level. 
 Till eventually you beat the game.
  
  To this games credit though it does offer some pretty solid unlockables witch are tons of fun to 
 use. The game is very short and can be beaten in several hours. I recommend this to kids and even 
 parents playing with thier children. However I do not recommend this to hardcore star wars fans, 
 and for people looking for some hardcore gameing.

Review:  Positive
  - Great graphics
  - A superb number of unlockables 
  - An awesome variety of characters 
  - Co-op mode is good
  - Very forgiving
  - Less frustrating 
 than the PS2 version
  
  Negative
  - Camera is a pain
  - A bit too easy
  
  Some time ago I reviewed the PS2 version of Lego Star Wars. Yes, the PC version is just as great 
 as it is on the PS2. There aren't major differences between the 2 versions, just some minor difference 
 in my reviews. Even if you own LSW on the PS2, it's worth checking this out on the PC too. For 
 those unfamiliar with LSW, this is a Star Wars game using Lego toys. Sounds childish but it's a 
 truly impressive game. There is some thinking in the game but lacks challenge and length. 
  
  Lego Star Wars contains the first 3 episode of the Star Wars trilogy. You will be at Dexter's 
 Diner and you can go take levels from here. If levels continue the game ask you if you want to 
 proceed or go to Dexter's Diner. You will first have the first episode and the other 2 are unlockables. 
 There is also a free play which each chapter has. This will be available after you beat that chapter. 
 Beating a chapter you will have to finish. You can collect money and parts. I already said most 
 in the other review. Still the game is very forgiving. If you're lego loses all 4 hearts he will 
 get destroyed but will come back. The only price to pay is that you lose some money and nothing 
 else. No game over. This makes the game far too easy. I found the PC version easier than the PS2 
 version. There are all the things that were on the PS2, and the camera is still a problem. No way 
 to turn the camera. The co-op mode is still there and great. There are a number of unlockables 
 including characters, hints and some extras. You can also unlock some stuff by using codes. I also 
 found this less frustrating than the PS2 version. Some puzzles and races are easier here.
  
  It may be to easy and aimed for kids, but it's good for anyone who have interest in Star Wars 
 or those not looking for a hard game. Lego Star Wars is both accessible and fun to play. The game 
 might lack challenge but some interesting puzzles and storytelling might easily hook you up. Even 
 if you have the PS2 version of LSW or the other versions and you enjoy it so much, you should own 
 the PC version.

Review:  Throughout my gaming career, I have played very few games that have succeeded at recapturing the 
 spirit of classic platformers like Banjo Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64 the way that Lego Star Wars 
 has. When I first started playing, I was transported back to a time when graphics and audio quality 
 were not that important -- a time when the primary consideration of a great game was providing enjoyable 
 gameplay and variety with lots of levels to explore and secrets to discover. Lego Star Wars surpasses 
 that standard like few games have before it, providing all of the above and much more in one well-rounded 
 package that will appeal to young and old alike.
  
  That is not to say, however, that Lego Star Wars skimps in the technical department. The graphics 
 are beautiful, with excellent lighting and shader details, and even a few environmental special 
 effects thrown in for good measure, all nicely implemented within the confines of the game. The 
 character models look almost exactly like their plastic counterparts, with a little more flexibility 
 added for fluid animation. Their varied facial expressions are a nice touch, serving to convey 
 emotions and general goofiness quite well, since the game features no voice acting.
  
  The music and sound effects are also very nice in Lego Star Wars, as they manage to flawlessly 
 capture both the relatively serious themes of Star Wars and the whimsical humor of Lego together 
 in one package. The music will be instantly familiar to any Star Wars fan, providing a nice touch 
 of nostalgia to complement the lighthearted themes of the game. The sound effects are sufficiently 
 goofy, and are exactly what one would expect from a Lego game set in the Star Wars universe.
  
  The controls of the game are also very well done, providing intuitive gameplay for both gamepad 
 and keyboard users alike (although the gamepad is definitely the better choice) . The only problem 
 here is a compatibility issue with some game pads that renders the control scheme unchangeable; 
 however, this problem has since been fixed in a patch, so it is really nothing to worry about.
 
  
  There is no doubt that Lego Star Wars is a technical work of art; however, where it really shines 
 is in the multitude of unlockable extras hidden throughout the game. Players will want to go back 
 to each level and explore every nook and cranny to unlock extra bonus levels, minikits, and dozens 
 of playable characters. Finding everything the game has to offer will reward the player with the 
 ability to play what amounts to an early version of the first level of Lego Star Wars II, the Tantive 
 IV, as Darth Vader.
  
  But above all, the real selling point of this game is its undeniable charm. Rarely have I come 
 across a game that exudes as much universal appeal as this one. Although the humor is often geared 
 towards kids, and is thus goofy and cartoon-ish in nature, it is still enjoyable by adults as well, 
 if only as a reminder of their own childhood. And although the game is rather easy, the option 
 to play with a friend on the same PC and the sheer variety of the game's characters and levels 
 ensures that you will come back to it time and again to search for more of its cleverly hidden 
 extras. This game is a must-own for any gamer of any age, a guaranteed classic that will certainly 
 spend a lot of time in your disk drive, whichever console you choose to play it on.

Review:  This game is so much freaking fun. Lots of cool characters to choose from, awsome Levels, very 
 nice graphics.
  
  My first play through, I did not like this game very much, I thought it was way too hard. But after 
 playing Lego Star Wars 2 for a couple hundred hours I got pretty good with the controls, So I went 
 back to Lego Star Wars 1 and had a much funner experience than my first play through. So many cool 
 characters, and extras.
  
  The absolute best part of this game is, after finishing it, you can take the characters and starfighters 
 you unlocked in LSW1 and use them in LSW2.
  
  I love the graphics, even having them on low looks damn nice. And the video options make it look 
 really good at a nice frame rate. I think thats pretty good considering my computer is a pile of 
 trash.
  
  So if you havent already, go out and buy it for every system you have! Seriously go do it... NOW... 
 Cause I just told you too, now stop arguing and just do it! OKAY!

Review:  It is good that I found this game with bargain bin tag; came home d/l the demo then immediately 
 bought it next day.
  
  This game is a very simple adventure game; in the sense that except modern graphics it lacks everything 
 that today's game have. I meant it in a good way, there is no user-movable camera (play tested 
 pre-programed camera) , no secondary fire, no weapon switch, and follows older style action-adventure 
 a la Crash Bandicoot for PlayStation (which is in fact my favourite too) and mesh it with LEGO 
 that should instill fond memory for most.
  
  The developer made an outrageous claim that this game will appeal adult as well as kids so it nails 
 right on, I'm 28, not 8. Even more amazing is that it did not try to make this game with a serious 
 tone, even character death had little impact and consider it is so scripted to match movie/non-interactive 
 entertainment production paradigm and Star Wars pre-Rebellion universe the attractive nature this 
 game is even more amazing.
  
  This enjoyable gaming paradigm do show up on the demos of LEGO SW 2 and LEGO Indy Jones, I have 
 high hopes LEGO Batman can do the same. Although Internet-teamup is conspicuously absent so far.

Review:  Now usually when I sit down to review a game I have to think about the gameplay and bugs, whatnot. 
 But this game, I just have to say it.
  
  Some guy, somewhere, was brilliant.
  
  Why not take a movie, and make it LEGO characters? Except, I don't mean some deplorable game that 
 comes OUT with a movie, I mean an establish, famous movie. You don't have to make up a story, you 
 don't have to develop characters, you just need to make them out of LEGO, and let them hack each 
 other a lot.
  
  And you know what? It's great fun. I think this one is even better than the second one (the original 
 trilogy) , despite the fact that I like the movies the other way around. Maybe it's being able to 
 hack Jar-Jar's head off, maybe it's a few more features (such as the super jump, which is strangely 
 missing in the second game. Or perhaps the four lightsaber wielding AND superjumping Grievous) .
 
  
  The game as a brilliant sense of humor, which makes playing the game with family or friend even 
 more fun. I played it with my sister and had a blast.
  
  I'd recommend it, as it IS great fun.

Review:  LEGO Star Wars is exactly what it says it is. Its Star Wars with LEGOs. Developed by Travelers 
 Tales, LEGO Star Wars takes you through all the major battles of the new Star Wars trilogy, a la 
 Episodes I, II, and III respectively.
  
  The play control is definitely the games strongest suite. The interface and controls are extremely 
 simple and easy to use. Next to the control stick, there's only two or three buttons that you will 
 ever be pushing to do anything, in most cases, during the game. These are attack, jump, and your 
 force powers if you have them. The games frame rate has no slow down; and thanks to the simplicity 
 of the controls, Lego Star Wars flows very fluidly. Once you pick up the controller you'll be deflecting 
 blaster bolts and using your force powers to build things out of LEGOs in no time. This is great 
 because Lego Star Wars is clearly a kids game; and as we all know, children have no patience.
 
  
  Graphically, LEGO Star Wars is simple yet sound. While the Xbox and PC version don't share the 
 rough edges that the PS2 version has, coupled with the variety of reflective surfaces and simple 
 particle effects, everything comes off as being solid regardless of which platform you choose to 
 play on. One of the really unique things about this game is that the entire Star Wars universe 
 within it is rendered in LEGO. Even the major and side events of the trilogy are done this way 
 in little mini LEGO cinemas. As a result of this, many of Star Wars overly serious tones and dramatic 
 moments, which were quite gripping in the films, come off as completely hilarious, and impossible 
 to take seriously. An example of this is the death of Qui Gon Jinn at the end of episode I, which 
 will have players laughing out loud and left eager for more.
  
  Audio wise, the game has no faults. All of the sound effects and music in the game are taken directly 
 from the Star Wars films. You will hear all the familiar background music, themes, and sci-fi sound 
 effects that Star Wars fans are familiar with, and have come to both love and/or loath. This does 
 a great job of creating the atmosphere in the game, as it feels like you are really in the battles 
 from the movies. There is no spoken dialogue in the game, nor any text dialogue. Everything is 
 done in sort of a silent film/mime fashion with the LEGO characters. This is good on one hand because 
 it saves you from having to listen to the actors voices in the same tired audio clips over and 
 over again. However, on the other hand this is probably one of the few faults LEGO Star Wars has, 
 if you want to count it as a fault. This is because it can seem rather odd to watch the cinemas 
 without sound, especially when you can clearly see that the characters are speaking. However, as 
 odd as this is, there is no confusion as to what is being said, occurring, or why its occurring. 
 This is because the animators did a superb job animating and miming the characters and their overly 
 flamboyant actions say everything that you cant hear.
  
  One factor that is a definite strike against LEGO Star Wars is that the game, while it takes you 
 through the story's of the episode I, II, and III, has little to no story in itself. This is because 
 all you wind up doing is playing through the major battles of those films. As a result of this, 
 if you haven't seen the films, or arent familiar with them, you won't have any idea on why what 
 you are playing through is happening. LEGO Star Wars is just a hodge-podge of levels thrown together 
 with nothing really connecting them aside from the games global theme. A second strike against 
 the game is it's ridiculously easy. Dieing is a challenge here, which is almost impossible to achieve. 
 You probably never will die simply because your lives equal a certain number of LEGO pieces, which 
 are abundant in the billions. This is because everything that is destructible in the game is made 
 of them, and as a result said LEGO pieces go everywhere when you destroy something for your collecting 
 pleasure. The game has a co-op mode, which is extremely good, and if youre playing co-op you and 
 your partner can cannibalize each other, not to mention any other characters in your party (come 
 here Jar Jar) , for LEGO pieces giving you an infinite supply of LEGOs.
  
  There is a plethora of unlockables in LEGO Star Wars, which will keep you busy for a while after 
 you have beaten the game. As you might have guessed, like everything else in the game the key to 
 obtaining these hidden treasures is by collecting the proper LEGO pieces. Once players have said 
 LEGO pieces, they can unlock everything from display models to playable characters to mini-games. 
 However, LEGO Star Wars is a kids game at heart, and so its usually all pretty silly, but no 
 less enjoyable. LEGO Star Wars main focus is to just let the player have fun, which it dose very, 
 very, very well. Collecting LEGOs, blowing up LEGOs, and building things out of LEGOs is as addictive 
 in the game as it is with the physical toys. LEGO Star Wars will make you feel like an intergalactic 
 LEGO Maniac, or that LEGO maniac you were oh so many years ago all over again. All in all, LEGO 
 Star Wars is buckets of fun and belongs in every Gamers library regardless of their age.

Review:  I enjoyed almost every Star Wars game to date, minus Lethal Alliance. This one is a funny little 
 game, with easy controls and simple gameplay. My little brother loves it, and didn't stop playing 
 it until we got Knights of the Old Republic. But that's another story. Every character stays loyal 
 to the real Lego dudes, so this game seems to be really interesting. Overall, the game is funny, 
 and not overly tense, so this game is just right for... anyone. TT games really has the potential 
 to make great games. This was one of them. The sequel also was. Bionicle Heroes... not quite.
 
  This game stays loyal to the movies, and makes it fun by adding some parts to levels. But not 
 so much that levels don't resemble the movies anymore.
  If you are under 10, and you like Star Wars... rent this.

Review:  LEGO Star Wars is one of the best video games ever. Thus, I shall have to review each level individually 
 while avoiding spoilers.
  
  EPISODE 1
  
  Level 1: Negotiations
  This level is very impressive for being the first in the game.
  The opening cutscene is animated 
 great, and the game play is very entertaining, with lots of secrets to find later, and directly 
 following the scene from the movie makes this one of the best levels. It's only downside is being 
 way too short.
  
  Level 2: Escape from Naboo
  This Level is a bit disappointing after the first one. In order to get money you have to use the 
 force on the flowers while battle droids are trying to kill you. The rest of this level pretty 
 much is a tutorial on high jumping, with Jar Jar being the first with the ability.
  
  Level 3: I can't remember what this one is called.
  This level is another great one. You start 
 out with only characters with blasters, and you have to battle our way through the palace to escape.
 
  
  Level 4: Podrace
  This one could have been great, but they didn't quite pull it off. In two player mode this is nearly 
 impossible, because instead of the expected racing environment, the race is in three laps, each 
 with three laps. You have a time limit on each section, making winning a requirement.
  
  Level 5: Retake Theed Palace
  One of the longest levels in the game, but it's similarity to level 
 three is very dissapointing
  
  Level 6: Darth Maul
  This level follows the end scenes of episode one, but too much of it is chasing Maul and too little 
 fighting him.
  
  EPISODE 2
  
  Level 1: Discovery on Kamino
  This level is set inside the cloning factory. This also includes a disco room, with Star Wars music! 
 The rest of the level is chasing Jango Fett, then fighting him while the Slave 1 is shooting you.
 
  
  Level 2: Droid Factory
  This level meets expectations, with fun machinery all over! It doesn't seem to be making droids, 
 but it is still fun.
  
  Level 3: Jedi Battle
  This is one fun level. Rescuing all three prisoners while destroying battle droids finishing with 
 a fight with Jengo. One fun level.
  
  Level 4: Can't remember the name. This level is mediocre. Fly through the battle while avoiding 
 huge lasers.
  
  Level 5: Count Dooku
  This level exitingly throws you right into the battle, with Yoda coming in half way through. YEEHAA!
 
  
  EPISODE 3
  
  Level 1: Battle over Coruscont.
  Star Wars Dogfight with LEGO ships. 'Nuff said.
  
  Level 2: Chancellor in Peril
  Very exiting, 
 and portrays the movie very accurately. The end fight with Greivous' body guards is great. watching 
 them fight with their heads cut off in LEGO is very entetaining.
  
  Level 3: General Grievous
  This battle was too short, and general Grievous is too weak.
  
 
  Level 4: Defence of Kashyyk
  This level is more annoying than fun. Everything attacking you while you are trying to use the 
 force can get very frustrating.
  
  Level 5: Ruin of the Jedi
  This level is pretty good. Walking through a broken down building that can be broken even more 
 is pretty fun.
  
  Level 6: Darth Vader
  This has to be one of my favorites. You have to make your way through a quickly collapsing volcanic 
 planet and end with a fight with Anakin on a sinking platform.
  
  This game is great. What Ever system you have, I recommend this game.

Review:  The game play is amazing and just all around fun! The overall feel of the game is awesome, and 
 there's loads of unlockables. But the best part by far is the co-op. I played this with my little 
 siblings and they were able to get the hang of it just fine. One of the best parts is getting POed 
 at each other and the killing each other off. One thing I didn't like was the fact that you couldn't 
 really die. About the worst thing that could happen to you was that you not unlock EVERYTHING, 
 although you'd have to be pretty bad not to.

Review:  Very cute and lovely! A game that will appeal to anybody, young and old, who love Star Wars and 
 most importantly, Lego. There are cans of laughter to be had as you play the game with the uncanny 
 match of our favourite film of all time and one of the most popular toys in the world. There is 
 neither a sinister twist nor a dark moment in this game where it tends to lurk everywhere in the 
 film trilogy, so you can basically enjoy this action adventure with a light heart only with the 
 exception of trying to pit your skills against the enemies and puzzle solving.
  
  There are tons of fun things to unlock (like the familiar characters and vehicles in the Star Wars 
 universe) with the completion of story missions with certain requirements, resulting in a high 
 replayability rate. Every mission kind of follows the storyline in the actual films, thus doubling 
 your movie experience with a new level of interactivity.
  
  It is not a difficult game for an action adventure genre as the developers modify game balance 
 very well with progressive puzzle difficulties and of course, overall gameplay like battles and 
 acrobatic (jumping) puzzles, in order to attract any level of gamers. With your keyboard or joypad 
 in hand, this is a game to enjoy both in the process of completing it as well as in the appreciation 
 of the clever humour this interesting hybrid theme has to offer.

Review:  Lego Star Wars took two incredible properties, namely Legos and Star Wars, and combined them 
 in what can only be described as a fanboy's dream. Most likely following the successful release 
 of Lego kits first featuring vehicles from Episode I, and later the rest of the Star Wars universe, 
 the next logical step was to produce a videogame combining the two properties.
  
  Lego Star Wars allowed the player to essentially play the scenes from the first three films in 
 a Lego setting. Everything appeared to have been built out of Legos, and when destroyed appeared 
 as a pile of Legos. Jedi characters could even use the Force to form piles of Legos into useful 
 items like platforms.
  
  The videogame game allowed the player to switch between any allied characters on the screen, as 
 different characters had different abilities which would have to be called upon in order to advance 
 through the levels; for example, droids were necessary to open many doors.
  
  Lego Star Wars was clearly designed for children; the puzzles were simplistic and the player 
 was granted infinite lives which assured game completion. However, the game was still a joy to 
 play for the older generations, raised on Star Wars and Legos alike, in the days before Episodes 
 I, II, and III, who yearned for the two properties to be combined.

Review:  Ok so where should i begin, I own both of the lego star wars games and they are both very good 
 games but this review is about the first game so here we go. STAR WARS LEGO With the ability to 
 play with over fifty of the famous star wars charectors.
  And the ability to play through all 3 of the star wars prequels.
  So when you first start playing 
 the game your located in a place called dexter's diner. sound familiar? Dexters diner is in sort 
 your home base where you walk through a series of doors to get to your missions.
  Also lego star wars has a comic relief plot going by the way of ingame videos that are to say the 
 least very funny. If you were to buy lego star wars you could probably beat all of story mode in 
 about 6 hours of gameplay but it doesnt end, no not that soon first you have to go back in free 
 play and go where no story mode character has gone before.
  What is story mode you ask, story mode is a mode that unlike free play you are not limited by the 
 characters that are in that particuler mission. [Example] Say i'm going to play episode 3 the duel 
 between Obi-Wan and grievous, what i do is i go to the door labeled grievous duel, and i select 
 Darth Maul from episode 1, beside's giving me Darth Maul it will give me several other charectors 
 that are necessary to complete this story fully. when i say that i mean characters that can jump 
 high like jar jar binks. and characters that can fly short distances like R2D2.
  
  Now i'm moving on to the co-op part of the game.
  Co-op you say what is co-op it stands for cooperative.
 
  Meaning you and a friend or family member can play simultaneously in a very easy at any time drop 
 in drop out mode.
  Co-op can at most times be fun and some times can be very stressful.
  
  
  
  So even though i could go on typing for a very long time about this game i think i 
 shouldnt because the only way for you to really find out for yourself is to buy/play this game.
 
  
  Thank you for taking your time to read this review.

Review:  It's a pretty nice game but you shouldn't play it on your own, the game is made for 2 players so 
 I'd say you really have to play it with two persons.
  You can't beat the total game in one turn, you have to beat all the levels once then you're able 
 to acces the game in Free Play, in Free Play you can be whoever you wanna be and you just have 
 to replay the game and collect all the money and minikits to beat the game totally.
  
  You can't really die but everytime you get broken you lose 1,000 bucks and that's quite a lot, 
 as a jedi you can use the force to break trough special barriers and the whole game excists out 
 of puzzles.
  Later in the game you can be Padme and you have a gun then, you don't have an aiming cursor but 
 that's not needed, you point the direction and the pc aims for you, how simple it seems... but 
 it's great fun, especially when you play together.
  The game isn't made for serious people that don't have a sense of humor caus that's quite what 
 the game is all about, to make you laugh.
  
  Well I have written longer reviews in my time but maybe I will adjust this one later, I still say: 
 If you are a Star Wars fan you should have least once played this game.=)

Review:  LEGO Star Wars, it was just simply amazing how it had got this far, and a sequel! Though the game 
 should've been much longer, it was a game with eye-popping graphics, great gameplay, and just awesome 
 sound. Alot of people thought that LEGO Star Wars would be just like all the other LEGO video games 
 like LEGO Harry Potter, LEGO Racers, and much more, which all never really went anywhere. But for 
 some reason LEGO Star Wars was just one that was overall better than all the other LEGO video games. 
 Maybe it was because of it's humor (which was pretty funny stuff, but they needed more of it) , 
 or because you could have Darth Maul kill Darth Maul and so on, but if you ask me, I think that 
 Star Wars was just meant to be a LEGO game. Considering we haven't had a humorous Star Wars game 
 like... ever, the game did manage to put in some funny stuff. It's really fun just going through 
 the whole game and you think you're done but then you realize that they're's a bunch more characters, 
 secrets in levels, and just plain old stuff you never saw before. The level enviorments are fantastic, 
 the value of the game is alright, so I reccomend this game to almost anyone.

Review:  Lego Star Wars (PC)
  
  Introduction
  
  Who would have taught that adding Lego to Star Wars would be such a great hit. This game is one 
 of the best Star Wars game ever. It is so easy to get into and anyone can play this game and have 
 a great time. Lego Star Wars has all 3 episodes and allows you to play as so many characters ranging 
 from Obi-wan to those famous droids.
  
  Gameplay
  
  The fact that every single thing in this game is made out of Lego parts is awesome. It's sometimes 
 so funny to look at the environments and see Lego trees and Lego rocks. For a game that looks so 
 much for kids I couldn't believe that it could be this much fun and laughter. Just seeing Obi-wan 
 Kenobi holding a lightsaber and doing so much force jumps was hilarious. 
  
  But Giant thought this game needed something else to make it so much better, so they added in force 
 powers. Yes I said it force powers. And it's not complicated like other Star Wars games but it's 
 so very simple. I have never been able to use force powers so easy. You can use your force push, 
 force pull and even use the force to activate switches. 
  
  Not only are there force powers but there are also combos. Each character has their different style 
 of using the lightsabers. This is such a great add-on and it doesn't make the game feel repetitive 
 in any way.
  
  You also get some levels where you are in a star fighter and a pod racer. These levels really make 
 you feel like you are in the Star Wars universe.
  
  The one and only major problem in this game was that there were too much collectables. Really a 
 lot, you'll find yourself hooked and keep trying to unlock everything. However this does not bring 
 down the quality in the game, for you have the decision whether or not you really want to collect 
 everything. Not collecting everything wouldn't stop you from wining the game or completing a certain 
 level.
  
  Visuals
  
  This game is really well rendered. Shadows look great and the Lego people look like actual Lego. 
 But because this is Lego Star Wars don't think that this game would run on any low-end graphics 
 card or an old one you found so if you are purchasing this game make sure to upgrade. 
  
  Sound
  
  Wow, when I installed this game I couldn't believe my ears. The blaster weapons sound 
 so great, and the lightsabers make that cool sound they make in the movies. The only problem is 
 that the Lego characters don't actually talk. The sort of make little screams and that's it. I 
 taught they could have added some sort of voices or something, to really make the game sound better. 
 But Giant still delivers the best in the sound department.
  
  Overall
  
  Some people may say this game is childish. But the only people that may say that are the ones who 
 have never played it before. Great job Giant you couldn't have done any better, this game is a 
 definite purchase.

Review:  Lego Starwars is a game that just looks like it screams out that it's made for Starwars fans, and 
 not only, it's for LEGO fans too. Because i'm a big fan of both, Lego Starwars was just a blast 
 to play. This game is for absolutly anybody, it's a nice game for kids who aren't expirienced gamers 
 yet or for anybody who hasen't played many games yet for that matter. Why? because it's just so 
 easy and fun you can't even die, if you do you'll just lose a litle studs and you'll resurect right 
 there so it's fun for anybody. Even more expirienced gamers should have a blast playng it because 
 it's so fun it has little in game jokes and it's just humorystic it's not sirious at all because 
 while playng with legos nobody want's to be sirious.
  The only short commings to this game are the graphichs that could have been just a little more 
 sharp and the fact that this game is extremely short but only the main story is the game has an 
 imense replayble value.
  The only sitiuations when I found the game a little more chalenging are the vechicle levels there 
 you can die more often and if you do you'll start a little more back when you resurect but anyway 
 there are a lot of checkpoints and it's easy.
  This game was a lot more than I expected, so I recomend it to anybody.

Review:  Lego star wars is a really fun star wars game. You play the first three episodes, but you play 
 as lego versions of the characters. You get to also play co-op threw out the whole game. Its fun 
 because all the characters look like legos. You also get to unlock different characters so you 
 can play as them. You can play the levels over when ever you want to and you get to free play the 
 episodes. The only things that suck is that none of the characters can talk and you cant use the 
 force on every body only on some droids and certain objects. You should get this game it is really 
 fun.

Review:  First when i downloaded the demo, I thought it seemed like a game for kids.
  And it is aktually a game for kids but even elder can have really fun playing this game. It's a 
 lot of humor in this game, just because it's LEGO is it fun and almost silly but then the producer 
 has create lots of funny stuff and hidden areas. The hidden areas is good for when you complete 
 a stage you get one character or two and been able to buy one. All of those characters have some 
 special ability (force, high jumping, droids can open doors...) as you need to go to these hidden 
 areas, witch you can do in something called free play witch means that you can play the stage again 
 with the characters you want. another good thing is that there's something call drop-in drop-ut. 
 that means that a friend anytime can jump in and out from the game (you always are two or more 
 at any level) . The graphics is good and so are also the sound, the only bad is that there's no 
 speech but i don't know if the game would be better if that was the cause! The game is also sticking 
 very good to the movies.
  A pure masterpiece!

Review:  when i first saw this game i thought to myself this should be a laugh. so i downloaded the demo 
 from gamespot. i liked it so much i got a copy of the full game and i've been playing it non-stop. 
 The graphics are not realistic by any means, but you do feel like your playing with the lego set 
 you got for christmas when you were ten. It's that much fun. The game follows the starwars story 
 through the first 3 episodes and u get a bonus level of episode 4 which will be in lego starwars 
 2. After you finish each level in story mode you get to replay each level to try and collect mini 
 lego kits to go in the car park area. there are plenty of characters all with different abilities 
 to help you through this world of lego bricks. Fantastic just try it.

Review:  The title explains itself rather well, it's star wars but with legos, the ships are legos the buildings 
 are legos the characters are legos. The game is fun but it defiantly has it flaws.
  
  The game plays out as this you start at a location called "Dexter's diner" it is a diner and it 
 has doors which leads to different stages of the starwars series which then lead to chapters of 
 that specific stage. There is an outside area of dexters diner where all the characters you have 
 unlocked walk around, but beware because certain charactars will fight each other! This is a nice 
 touch that the buyer does not expect. 
  
  Story wise the game is accurate, although there is no talking in the game by any of the charactars 
 which makes the story a bit cartoonie. With no talking you can't really grasp the full story of 
 starwars unless you have seen the movies. Certain parts of the story are made more child friendly. 
 Such as when Anakin falls into the lava. In the movie it is brutal but in this game you can tell 
 they don't want to show the vulger of it. Although the story does end rather quickly.
  
  Light saber battles aren't that great and are continues. You attack they block then they attack 
 you block, it is very simple and unless you jump takes a while.
  
  The Graphics are also choppy.
  
  Overall I would say rent it first but since it's a PC game 
 that option isn't very valid.

Review:  I bought this game for weeks ago, but i didn't try it till today.
  I just know it's a eidos game.
  As other eidos game, you will find that there are not enough 
 hints forever, at least not enough for you to play the game without difficult.
  
  Be honestly, I admit I don't like eidos veeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrry much!
  I think they only make 
 the games poorer than the other. I admit I'm not objective to it as well.
  
  But the game itself has quite many problems as well.
  Like I can't see some place in some angles. 
 and I can't change the camera angle as well. This is quite a problem.
  And sometimes I don't know which place I can stay or not, the 3-D effect is not so good.
  In 
 my opinion as a Star Wars fans, it do destory the good fame of the movie.

Review:  Coming to store shelves on April 2nd of 2005, Lego Star Wars gave fans a little bit of a spoiler 
 for The Revenge of the Sith. Those who couldnt wait to see the movies in the theater could see 
 how it ended in this fun filled Lego game. First thought to be a kids game, Lego Star Wars can 
 easily appeal to adults with its humor, replay value and just the overall presentation of the game. 
 There have been numerous games across multiple platforms about the Star Wars setting, but Lego 
 Star Wars takes a different direction dealing with humor and just plain fun.
  
  The story is self explanatory if youve watched the movies, but if youre one of the few who hasnt, 
 it follows the first three movies in the Star Wars Trilogy. Not the movies that were created back 
 in the 1970s with Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, but the newer ones that are the prequel that explain 
 everything in the storyline up until those movies. I would give a brief summary, but I believe 
 that a simple review summary wouldnt do the movies justice, so please go watch them instead. Youll 
 follow many points of the movies from the very beginning where the Obi-Wan and his master jedi 
 go to deal with negotiations all the way till the end of the third episode where Padme gives birth 
 to her and Anakins (Darth Vadar) children, Luke and Leia. In between those two events, youll 
 deal with some of the larger sequences that play a role throughout the three movies consisting 
 of the podrace with Anakin, the light saber duel between Yoda and Count Dooku, and also the epic 
 fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin at the end. 
  
  There is quite a bit of combat in Lego Star Wars and the controls are quite simplistic, but because 
 of the game levels length, the simplicity really doesnt hurt the overall gameplay. If youre 
 just racing through the three episodes, you can probably beat this game in a few hours and that 
 isnt a joke. This game, although covering three movies, takes less than five hours tops to complete 
 on the first time through, but there are two types of gameplay though, the story mode and the free 
 play mode. The story mode is self-explanatory, while the free play is where youll be able to switch 
 between the different characters you accumulate throughout the storyline, and from using their 
 different abilities, youll be able to find secret material spread throughout the entire game. 
 Stuff like more characters to play, secret levels, and more credits to spend at the diner where 
 you begin the game to gain even more goodies are just some of the cool stuff that can be received 
 while replaying the game over. And if that isnt enough for gameplay, the pc game, like the platform 
 games, includes a multiplayer where you and friend can both play through the game at the same time. 
 
  
  Before each episode and chapter, there is the always fashionable introduction to whats going on 
 with the classic from top to bottom scrolling of written story where the player is introduced to 
 what theyre about to do throughout the level. There are about six chapters in each episode and 
 being more directed towards kids, Travellers Tale made it pretty much impossible to die and have 
 a game over sequence in this game. If youre character does end up losing all their life, their 
 body with explode in the different Lego parts, and theyll be charged a simple some of credits 
 theyve picked up, or if theyre out of credits, they simple will be respawned. And the game does 
 provide some humor throughout the three episodes. In one particular spot, youre able to use your 
 force powers to move some objects around to create a disco floor where different droids will come 
 up and start dancing for your enjoyment. This is only one of the many humorous spots throughout 
 the games campaign.
  
  The graphics are nothing to marvel over, but they do both the Lego world and the Star Wars setting 
 justice. If you havent been to the kids section in any retail store and seen different Lego vehicles 
 or characters in their Lego Star Wars form, then youll be in for a treat when you glimpse how 
 Travellers Tale told this story in true Lego form. There arent a lot of graphical changes you 
 can make throughout the game, pretty much just different in resolution and some bump mapping, but 
 this game looks good nonetheless. Youll see your characters reflecting off the glistening floor 
 and youll certainly enjoy how the destructible environments turn into Lego pieces when you break 
 it apart for you to collect. All the characters look unique and different from each other and time 
 was spent in creating the different looks for the characters in the different movies. Such as Anakins 
 clothes and facial features changing from episode one to episode three. 
  
  The sound, much like in every game with Star Wars in the title, is fantastic. Lucas Arts always 
 gives the developers of their games the sound bytes that they used in the movie to recreate the 
 same sounds in the games and this is apparent in Lego Star Wars. The light sabers sound great from 
 the first thrust to the last slash and the blasters sound just as crisp now as they did back in 
 the 70s with episode four. Throughout the three episodes, you wont hear any of the Lego figurines 
 speaking to progress the story, but youll easily be able to tell whats going on with not only 
 their physical motions, but their facial reactions and some grunts here and there.
  
  Even though the campaign is quite short, the game does have quite a bit of replay value not only 
 with finding all the hidden secrets and characters, but also with the ability to play with a friend 
 by your side on the computer. With having awesome sound and true Lego style graphics, Lego Star 
 Wars gives kids, and adults alike, a great playing experience going through the newly released 
 trilogy. Giving a more humorous side to the Star Wars setting, this title could give any Star Wars 
 fan or action game fan a good laugh, whether its their first or fifth time through. And if you 
 were hoping that episodes four through six could be introduced into the Lego form, youll just 
 have to wait until September when Travellers Tale redoes the second trilogy.

Review:  Lego Star Wars, contrary to the massive hype and critical success heaped upon it, is absolute garbage 
 for any gamer over the age of 6. For those of you living under a rock for the past few months, 
 let me get you up to speed: Lego Star Wars is a cutesy little kid's game that let's you play through 
 the plots of Episodes 1-3 in the form of various little Lego characters, from Obi-Wan to Darth 
 Maul. It sounds like fun, and by most people's accounts, it is - but don't be fooled. This game 
 is tedium defined.
  
  The basic gameplay takes advantage of only two concepts: there is your standard "attack" button, 
 with attacks varying from character to character, and for your force sensitive characters there 
 is the amazingly vague "force" button. Pressing this will have your character use the force, which 
 in this game can pretty much be summed up as disassembling unidentifiable objects made of lego. 
 You can switch characters on the fly, but thanks to lack of interesting gameplay you really won't 
 have any desire to. You'll likely find yourself doing it only out of necessity, and even then it's 
 more tedious than it should be.
  
  Graphically speaking, the game looks alright. They did a fine job of merging Star Wars environments 
 with the lego brand, and yet they didn't really break any new ground. The soundtrack too is what 
 you'd come to expect from a Star Wars game, and yet the lack of voice acting - a choice they clearly 
 felt fit with the lego style - was out of place in this title and only served to hurt it further.
 
  
  Gamer's and Star Wars fans alike will find very little to like in this title. Unless you're buying 
 this title for the 10 and under crowd, I suggest steering clear of htis train wreck.

Review:  This is an excellent game for kids  the violence has been minimalized for the combination of these 
 franchises. Star Wars, the huge Lucas saga, combined with a childs favorite toy is an excellent 
 combination for an interesting video game. The game play is simple and I especially enjoy using 
 the jedi stomps on the adversaries. Each character has a unique ability that is helpful at some 
 point in the game. Environments and enemies are varied. Graphics are good  the sound of Star Wars 
 music cant be beat  and my reviewers tilt is high because I enjoy Star wars stuff  the story 
 line sticks pretty close to the three movies and its easy to understand without the player needing 
 to read because there are just visual representations of the story between levels instead of the 
 usual subtitles. This factor makes the game appealing to even very young children. Reviewers tilt 
 is also high because my kid really likes this game. So I bought it for GBA, PC and PS2. The PC 
 version is has really great graphics and was quite a value when I purchased it at the local video 
 game shack. The PC and the PS2 versions are both very short but still fun. The replayability of 
 it is high if you want to get crazy and collect all of the canisters to build all of the vehicles. 
 This is a pretty cool game the way the two areas of interest collided to create an interesting 
 and entertaining Star Wars title.

Review:  lego star is very funny and really give of a comedic style and because of that i just can stop 
 laughing about them dieing but mostly obi wan kenobi whenever he dies he sounds very very funny 
 i mean i just could not stop laughing 
  
  anyway the game lacks of graphics and so is the gameplay and the sound but the game is still quite 
 solid i mean the good thing is when you are allowed to use 2 player since you get to change in 
 different charecter how coll is that anyway you also get to kill you enemy whule disguising isnt 
 that cool well the game still packs quite a punch!

Review:  Now, I wouldn't consider this game to be a great game. It simply isn't. But it is very fun. Essentially 
 you can play through Star Wars episodes I - III, unlocking characters and secrets along the way.
 
  
  I would say that there is something comical about playing this game, but even as an adult it is 
 a lot of fun. Kids must absolutely adore this game, because it combines the classic fun of LEGO 
 with the legendary Star Wars series.
  
  The graphics are great, even though it is LEGO we're talking about. The levels aren't too short 
 and the puzzles are fine for a kids game.
  
  The multiplayer is great though! I played this with my brother and we had fun playing as Anakin 
 Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Just plain fun.
  
  I wouldn't necessarily recommend buying this game, but if you do you won't necessarily regret it. 
 If you have kids, I would say you should definitely buy it for them! Although apparently there 
 is a LEGO Star Wars 2 coming out soon.

Review:  Above all my expectations this game was exceptionally good, if not awsome.
  The gameplay is very nice though the controls will take quite long to master, what is the only 
 real difficulty of this fun game.
  Like other lego games I've played, this game has a lot of humouristic elements.
  This game is 
 maybe not as superb as Far Cry or Quake IV qua graphics or with story (in the case of Far Cry) .
 
  But it has its own feeling about it that makes this title certainly worth playing.
  The new Star Wars trilogy is in it, as well a bit of the Clone wars and ofcourse, the Rise of Darth 
 Vader.
  Sound is great, graphics very good, gameplay almost perfect.
  So this game gets a 9,1/10!

Review:  this is a great game based on star wars most recent trilogy (I, II, III .) br /&gt;
  Its very simple and if you don't have an xbox, ps2 or game cube like me, you can still hook up 
 a game pad with the game.
  Another great feature is its two player (not split screen) co-op
  multi play featuring quite 
 a bit of team work. When it comes to graphics the game dosnt look you playing with real Lego figurines 
 but is still nice.
  The sound is good, the game play is good worth the value on this game. even if your a hard core 
 game head buying this game is a good addition to your collection.

Review:  In early 2005, Edios Interactive, Travellers Tales, and Lucas Arts released what was one of the 
 biggest sleeper games ever created. Most casual game fans, young and old, were simply confused 
 when these three publishers announced Lego Star Wars. Most of us thought, "Oh great, another mildly 
 impressing Lego game for us to play, suffer through, and eventually sell to the pawn shop". Most 
 of the past few Lego themed games fell victim to shotty development and lazy producers. Games like 
 Soccer Mania, Rock Raiders, and Lego Loco have all been representations of what went wrong while 
 trying to blend Lego with video game systems. However, Lego Star Wars changed everything...
  
  Lego Star Wars is an action adventure game based on the first three episodes of the actual 
 Star Wars timeline. The only catch of the game.... it's all made of Lego. Everything is Lego! The 
 people, the vehicles, the cities..... everything! While Lego Star Wars is meant to be a video game 
 for small children with little knowledge of Star Wars, the game comes across as a simple platforming 
 game for all ages. While this may seem like a bad thing, Lego Star Wars is the most complete Star 
 Wars game you'll ever play...
  
  Gameplay: 10/10 - Lego Star Wars is the perfect blend of kiddie platforming and mindless droid-cutting. 
 The game, like I said before, features Episodes I, II, and III, in bite-sized levels that never 
 overwhelm you. The majority of the Lego Star Wars experience is spent cutting up droids and solving 
 simple puzzles in an attempt to re-create the movies in as simple form as possible. Along the way, 
 you'll handle all of the main jedi characters such as Obi-Wan, Qui-Gonn Jinn, Anakin Skywalker, 
 and more. Jedi characters can use their lightsabers to deflect the blaster fire of the many droids 
 and clone troopers that are seen in the game. They are also essential for level progression in 
 the game, as they can use the force on the environment to create steps, platforms, or reveal paths, 
 in order to finish the level. The controls are quite simple, as there are few buttons to use, and 
 very few attacks to use with each character. Because most of the levels are made entirely of Lego 
 blocks, this makes the small wink at the free building of Lego. Another small wink goes to the 
 "fall-apart" like action when an enemy is struck down. It makes a really cool effect, and surrounds 
 you in the Lego portion of the game. Another main feature that must be noted, is the ability to 
 have a second player join in the game at any time. This leads to some fun Co-op gameplay, and, 
 if you are both using jedi or sith, can actually duel each other on the spot...
  
  The main campaign of Lego Star Wars is the "Story Mode". The Story Mode spans 17 short levels spread 
 out within the newest three episodes of the Star Wars Legacy. The levels often consist of cutting 
 up large groups of droids, while solving easy puzzles, and, cutting up more droids! While the on-foot 
 action does get boring after a while, the three vehicle levels really mix things up. The vehicle 
 levels consist of Pod Racing, The Clone Wars Gunship Battle, and, The Battle Of Coruscant. While 
 these levels are pretty linear, they are a good break from the sometimes tedious walking levels. In 
 order to give the game some life, the game includes some cutscenes on each level to give you a 
 break from the action. Most of these scenes are extremely funny, and give in to the lighter side 
 of Star Wars. You just can't resist Lego people fighting each other, it's just so........ cute!
 
  
  The story mode of Lego Star Wars can be completed in just a couple of hours, while the game only 
 takes a few days to complete. The other big feature in Lego Star Wars is the "Free Play" mode. 
 This mode lets you take any character you've unlocked, and replay any level. In all, 56 characters 
 can be unlocked by using the money you've gained from the levels to purchase them. These characters 
 include Jedi, Blaster Characters, Clone Troopers, Droids, and Sith. The diverse cast is amazing, 
 as there is something for everyone. However, once you unlock everything, there is really no reason 
 to go back and play the levels more than once. Also, the secret level you unlock at the end is 
 a complete rip-off. Challenges include collecting canisters to build ships in the game's parking 
 lot, and achieving a certain amount of coins in each level. The game's boss fights are really easy 
 if you know what you are doing, and this takes away largely from the game, as the core action in 
 Star Wars are the lightsaber battles. In all, the gameplay in Lego Star Wars is easy, enjoyable, 
 cute, and ultimately, repetitive...
  
  Graphics: 8/10 - The graphics for Lego Star Wars on the PC are very good and very smooth. The framerate 
 never drops below 60 FPS, even on some of the higher detailed levels. All of the characters in 
 the game are modeled just like they should be, and the game is extremely colourful. However, on 
 some levels, there are a few graphical glitches, most notably in the cutscenes. For the most part 
 though, the graphics are pretty good...
  
  Sound: 8/10 - The sound in Lego Star Wars is excellent. The John Williams music is excellent. The 
 music is always slow when nothing is happening, but switches to a faster piece when enemies come 
 on the screen or when something is happening. All of the blaster and lightsaber sounds are correct, 
 except for the odd lightsaber block sound. In conclusion, Lego Star Wars sounds pretty good...
 
  
  Final Score: 8.9/10.0 - Lego Star Wars is an exciting but short-lived action experience. The game 
 is best played with a friend, as the Co-op is the heart of the game. Because of the games length, 
 most people will be turned off by it, as the Story Mode can be finished in a couple of hours. Casual 
 gamers will find this game extremely enjoyable, while hardcore Star Wars fans might be turned off 
 by how light-hearted the game is, and how many serious moments in the saga come out as downright 
 silly just because of the Lego. To sum it up, Lego Star Wars is the best kiddie game ever made...
 
  
  Rent Or Buy: Buy - Lego Star Wars is a must own for anyone who still enjoys Lego, Star Wars, or 
 destroying things. The game is simple enough that anyone can play it, yet complicated to the point 
 where some younger gamers will have a little bit of trouble on it. Even though it is a bit short, 
 Lego Star Wars will satisfy anyone's inner child...

Review:  it was quite fun ^.^ every short movie gave me the laughs; D
  there were places very easy, and there were places extremely hard (like racing against sebulba) 
 the story was like the original star wars saga, but i missed the III episode music in the game../;
 
  though it would heave been better for the creators to make the characters talk; p
  the store was helpful, i liked that there were a lots of characters to chose from, the fun part, when 
 you can kill everyone at Dexter's dinner; DD and the best part was, that i could play with my friend 
 ^.^
  
  now the bad part....; p
  the game is in normal difficulty, when you are playing alone, but when you are playing with a friend, the 
 game turns VERY easy, you can win it in over an hour or so...
  and the sound........ almost 0 sound.... that sux....
  Creators, you could heave made 2 different 
 story's,1 to play alone and 2 to play with your friend.... just an advice; p
  well, that's it ^.^ don't kill me or anything; D

 you have unlimited lives. try to unlock the secret level. it took me quite a while to unlock it.

Review:  Best of all, it's lighthearted, simple gameplay. Whenever you 'die' you simply lose some of the 
 studs you collected, most of which your teammate can quickly scoop up. It's pretty much impossible 
 not to complete a level; this is one of the friendliest games on the market. It's a challenge to 
 get all the stuff, but never a challenge to forge on ahead.
  
  Adding to that playful sense of fun are the great cutscenes, where hysterically animated LEGO characters 
 mutely grunt their way through key scenes in the movies. Yep, there's no actual spoken dialogue: 
 that means nobody ever utters the word "metachlorians." Even if you didn't necessarily like the 
 movies, you'll probably have a great time with the game. 
  
  That's what LEGO Star Wars is all about: a great time. Whether it's the nostalgia or the cuteness 
 that hooks you in, the gameplay makes it worth sticking around. SO many games take themselves too 
 seriously and forget about the fun; that's not a problem here. Heck, in a perfect world, we'd love 
 to see this concept taken to other franchises like The Matrix, Spider-Man or Lord of the Rings. 
 You're best sticking with the console versions of the title, but if you're packing a couple of 
 gamepads, the PC version is almost certain to please.

Review:  Lego Star Wars takes the prequel trilogy movies experience and turns it into legoswhat more is 
 there to say, it is awesome.
  
  Graphics: The graphics present Star Wars and Legos very well. It looks like it should where and 
 when it should.
  
  Sound: All of the Star Wars sounds and blips are here as is the clanking and splattering of the 
 legos, it is great.
  
  Gameplay: The game is fun for anyone, but it is so easy and is over quickly which is a shame considering 
 the awesome gameplay. This game is perfect for what it is supposed to present, and it is exactly 
 the way it should be.
  
  You can buy this game for anyone, co-op is fun. Lego Star Wars is just a great game for the whole 
 family even Grandpa.

Review:  This game is very fun. The combat is very satisfieing, the puzzles are fun, not diffacult, and 
 playing with people who have guns is really fun :D. The single player is pretty short, but the 
 is alot of replay value. You can unlock 50 charecters, a special "?" level, and you can collect 
 parts for mini ships. The sound i good and all, but none of the people actually talk, they just 
 make grunts or laughing sounds. The graphics r pretty good, some minor glitches ive seen, like 
 your face gets all fuzzy and messy. I really enjoyed this game, and i think you would too.

Review:  For someone who mainly enjoys FPS and RTS games, I was surprised how much I am enjoying this game. 
 Lego Star Wars is not terribly challenging or amazing, but it is a great co-op console style game 
 that two players can really have fun with, and others can enjoy watching!
  
  My sons (ages 6 and 8) are just crazy about this game, and have really learned to work together 
 to solve the puzzles and navigate the various chapters. They are constantly laughing, yelling (even 
 fighting) about where to go next, and just having a blast trying all the different characters during 
 free play.
  
  This game is well worth the money, and has us coming back time and time again for pure gaming joy.

Review:  Lego Starwars is a great fun game to play, Although this game is deisgned for kids theres no reason 
 why us adults can't pop out and buy this game to play.
  
  I am lucky enough to have nephews and such young enough to come play this game with me so I could 
 take advantage of this 2 player drop in drop out - op system of Lego Star wars.
  
  This game provides some good educational tools as well as bags of fun. Such as for example the 
 obvious team building skills - as parts of the game require you to work together in order to achieve 
 your goal.
  
  Also to improve problem solving skills and other such skills. I used this game to introduce Star 
 wars to my nephews and such. Who really enjoy playing this game. They've come to learn about Star 
 wars through the game and gone on wanting to see the films and who knows perhaps another Star wars 
 fan is created. 
  
  This did surprise me a little bit. Ok This does say Starwars but I had a feeling the Lego was going 
 to show through more than the starwars feel. However this was not the case, They struct the balance 
 well, you do feel a real presance that you get in the films. As well as seeing your playing with 
 lego pieces.
  
  The delight little secrets like the Disco floor lights in the episode 1 section where you need 
 to players to step on the white colored circles to light up all the circles in time before they 
 go out, your Team play is rewarded by a jazzed up version of the Starwars theme. 
  
  This game is a lot of. Either if you do the episodes or spend most of your time chasing the Sith 
 around Dex's dinner or picking a fight with everyone in Dex's dinner. 
  
  This game isn't too hard and then again it isn't too easy either. You can't exactly lose , then 
 again it doesn't let you win either.
  
  This one is one for the books I feel. Nice family feel with, good game to play with your kids, 
 Also a good game to play when the kids arn't watching. Thats right you 18/20 yr olds will get hooked 
 aswell.

Review:  Lego Star Wars is simply one of the best children's games ever. It is a very funny, clever and 
 addicting game that anyone will like. It is brilliantly done, with an accurate storyline that covers 
 the first three Star Wars movies (I - The Phantom Menace, II - Attack of the Clones, and III - 
 Revenge of the Sith) It is certainly appropriate for kids; some may question the game because of 
 the strong content of Revenge of the Sith movie, but don't judge it off of that. Playing the 3rd 
 one in the game, you don't get that deep dark feeling, it doesn't show anything sensitive or that 
 would scare kids. It is perfectly fine. The gameplay is the same most of the time, but somehow 
 it is very addicting because of how hilarious it is and how they handle things in a cartoonish 
 way. The best children's game on the market; 8.1/10.

Review:  Even my kids can only take this game in doses. My 5 year old can play it the longest but even he 
 will move on after a few sessions of about an hour each. I moved on after five minutes. Of course, 
 it really wasnt designed for adults anyway. I found the starting "diner" er.. I mean Cantina starting 
 point confusing. Essentially, the whole interface is in-game. You start out on a level (which you 
 can explore) and can upgrade your characters abilities and collect cash etc... by interfacing with 
 various things in the 3D environment but nothing is labled or jumps out at you and its not very 
 intuitive. You run through some doors that look like closet doors and then through some more doors 
 to start a level. Think Alice in Wonderland. The gameplay is pretty much the same throught out 
 no matter what character you have. Kill lego bad guys to get lego money to upgrade lego character 
 or purchase new characters to use to break up the routine. Graphically, its adequate. Nothing great, 
 nothing terrible. It all looks Legolicious. Sound is adequate but sparse. Pick it up from a bargain 
 bin if your kids show a particular interest in the cover grpahics or if your a massive Lego or 
 Star Wars fan who has to have EVERY piece of fandom out their.

Review:  As a child of the 80's I have an appreciation for this game since legos were big then. Now some 
 people probably look at this and think Lego's and Star Wars together yuck. This game is good ol 
 fun. Its a game for sheer entertainment and enjoyment, thats obvious since you cant possibly die 
 in this game, you just keep respawning where you were. I love how lego pieces go flying when people 
 die and objects blow up, very cool. There are tons of unlockable people, and loads of items to 
 buy, overall great game. This is a great game to pick up for the kids and its something you can 
 enjoy too!!

Review:  The develepors made this game very well desided. The characters look like the origanal ones like 
 in the movie exept they are made of LEGO bricks!!! My dreams at night were about this game and 
 you would totally freak out when you saw them. They are about Anakin Skywalker in Episode II turning 
 aginst everyone who is in the entire Star Wars saga BUT mostly Jango Fett and Boba Fett. I don't 
 know why but recently it was on earth here! Anywayz back ta da story, now Bassicly completing chapters 
 will show you what characters you unlocked how many studs you got and how many canisters you got. 
 Oh and note that above I mentioned Jango Fett and Boba Fett. You may be thinking "OH MY GOD!" but 
 this game is more about Episode I II AND (You won't believe this) EPISODE III REVENGE OF THE SITH!!! 
 Although it does have a secret level that is part of Episode IIII A new hope. I don't have much 
 else to say exept that I love this game.

Review:  Lego Star Wars lets you play through episode I, II and III in the action scenes of course. You 
 will start of with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan destroying robot after robot and solving puzzles. Your lightsaber 
 attacks run smoothly and quite fun destroying the robots but when you are also moving your lightsaber 
 you are protecting yourself from the blasters of the robots. Each character has their unique lightsaber 
 moves like Yoda and Darth Sidious. All of the characters that have a lightsaber can move things 
 and interact with the objects. There are also the shooters: Padme, Jango Fett, Chewbacca, etc. 
 Sadly they cant protect from shots they simply shoot with their guns although Jango is better 
 because you shoot with 2 guns. They also can climb high places with a cable but you will have to 
 find the red spot 1st to use the cable. They are also the pointless characters that only help you 
 to open doors such as C-3PO or TC-14 (same type of robot) ; at least R2-D2 can fly around. There 
 is also Jar Jar Binks which can jump higher, they are other type of robots that do cameos on the 
 movies that you can play as but they only walk nothing else why would someone put a character that 
 does nothing. In order to unlock the bad guys you have to buy them at Dexters dinner were you 
 also start the game to select your episode and chapter. 
  
  The puzzles on the game are pretty simple they are not going to make you think for 10 minutes. 
 Some of them are cool like both Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon use the force on the boxes that they are standing 
 so they can reach the top. While others have you holding switches or throwing stuff at the baddies. 
 There is also a disappointment with the fights because you spend most of the time controlling stuff 
 they throw at you and when doing a duel with lightsabers you can jump and while in the air do an 
 attack that will hit the baddie easily. What is also annoying is that before dueling with them 
 they will start running away from you and start to send lots of shooter baddies and make you do 
 puzzles which is pretty annoying specially when battling Darth Maul. 
  
  There will be also some chapters were you play in a different way racing or space battle. The pod 
 race is pretty simple you must go through each green thing on the floor to increase your speed 
 so you can reach the checkpoint before time is over. Now thats the problem here you have a time 
 limit to reach each checkpoint which can sometimes be challenging and each lap is in the same place 
 but new things happen on the place like rocks falling but then when you go to the next lap those 
 rocks that fall are in the way of the course so you have to think fast was the best area you can 
 pass through. It doesnt feel like racing tough you just simply have to make it in time on each 
 checkpoint and you win the race. 
  
  There is also the space battle that appears on the beginning on episode III and is really good 
 on this game you can feel you are in the battle with so many ships and shooting around. But the 
 game goes in a rail mission way like star fox you are simply avoiding the ships and shooting all 
 of the small ships that fly around. You also destroy stuff that is in the way or else you will 
 explode with it, and last but not least is an arcade shooter type mission were you are using the 
 clone troopers ship destroying all the robot machines on the way. 
  
  Now the character selection you get is really good you can even unlock my favorite Jedis that 
 always do cameos in the movies. But one thing that is out of hand is having 5 different types of 
 Padme what is that all about. There is Padme with the dress of queen, there is purple clothes, 
 tattoine clothes, there is the white clothes with the cape she wear on the robot factory ad there 
 is also another one with the white clothes but with no cape and with the scratch of the monster. 
 
  
  I think that Lego star wars does offer new stuff that are really good but in then end the game 
 is pretty short and with no challenge it might turn down some gamers. I must also remind you never 
 die on this game you might get killed but never get a game over stuff making the game more simple 
 and less for everyone. 
  
  The graphics are blocky but in a good way because we all know Legos are all about blocks. I like 
 the way they design each level that make them look just like the movie. One of the most very well 
 designed levels is the arena from episode II were you can play as Mace Windu they are so many robots 
 shooting and Jedis deflecting their shots I really felt I was in that battle. There was also the 
 space battle from episode III that make you felt that you are in that space war. Yet the problem 
 here is the camera it gets sometimes clunky when playing co-op because you need both players on 
 the same screen. Some of the cut scenes felt good while others did not adapt everything perfectly 
 like making Obi-Wan act as a stupid. I t was also nice to see the robots falling in pieces and 
 Jar Jar haters will love killing him in pieces. 
  
  Lego star wars adapt most of the sound effects and music from the film and in a very good way. 
 I like the idea that when the action starts the music goes loud but when is about puzzles and nothing 
 else it goes back to a soft music. They are no voiceovers on this game only the characters saying 
 hmm or crying when they died. It was hilarious when Jar Jar screams when falling from the floor 
 or getting killed. Yet some sound effects like using the cable with the shooters feel bland and 
 the sound of Jangos jetpack is totally annoying. I also found disturbing that some of the music 
 tunes ended pretty quickly like darth mauls theme. 
  
  The singleplayer is a totally short experience with only 17 missions that only a few worth replaying. 
 But what is actually great is how many characters you can unlock and play in the story. You can 
 play as darth maul and general grievous what more could you want? There is also co-op play which 
 is great especially for a parent to play with his kid, yet is a trouble because one person goes 
 one way while the other goes another way so they both get stuck because they have to be on the 
 same screen together, you dont know how many times I scream at my cousin for going the wrong way. 
 They also some unlockables that can be goofy like make all Jedis have purple lightsabers or everyone 
 have weird guns. But there is no difference it plays the same it just changes the look. What is 
 interesting is playing all the episodes again on the free play mode which lets you play all of 
 them but with any character you have unlock, you can make Jedis that do cameos become the important 
 characters that was a pretty interesting new idea. 
  
  I recommend this game for those who like both Lego and star wars and do not care if the game is 
 not challenging. Lego Star wars is a great package we just wish it could be at least more challenging 
 and a bit longer. Still it delivers just right now where's my sequel with episode 4, 5 and 6?

Review:  I have to disagree with GS review this time. Star Wars Episode 3 the video game is better than 
 this
  
  Gameplay:
  
  One word.... REPETiTIVE!
  
  Sure, the vroom vroom of the lightsaber is cute, but try listening to that for the next 2 hours...
 
  
  And Sure, Anakain and Boba can climb down vents, R2-D2 can float and Queen Amidala can use pistols...
 
  
  WHOOP-DEE-DO!
  
  It just gets old... Wah!
  
  Graphics:
  
  Cute... lego characters...
  
  But! The system requirements do not suit the quality of graphics. 
 A windows 98 fits, and... Radeon... A low Radeon card fits the quality of this Game...
  
  PPFT! That's all.

Review:  When I first heard about this game I thought that it would be awful! It was like a kiddy game, 
 in fact, right at the start I thought it was going to be a creator game! I read some previews, 
 watched some movies, looked at some shots. It looked much better, but I still wasn't sure. I got 
 the demo and what can I say except-WOW! I bought it and haven't stopped loving it since.
  
  Th graphics in this game are really good. Bright, colourful and really clear. The expressions on 
 the lego people's faces (they don't talk) just makes it really funny! The movement of the characters 
 captures the real people in the film brilliantly!
  
  The gameplay, while very simple, is a lot of fun! It's really easy to get to grips with, and is 
 so much fun to play. I haven't had this much fun playing a video game in ages!
  
  The sound is one of the best parts of the game. All of the music is taken from John William's fantastic 
 score from the actual Star Wars movies, and the sound effects (lightsabers, blasters etc) are taken 
 straight of the film too.
  
  Value for money wise its not very good. While it will take a while to unlock everything it will 
 still be gathering dust sooner or later. Great for when mates come round though. br / 
  
  It's got a great lifespan in terms of the multiplayer and a whole lot more great features. It does 
 have a few flaws though. It is very easy to play, which isn't really a bad thing, and it doesn't 
 take long to complete. A few extra levels would be welcomed maybe in an expansion pack?!
  
  A sequel looks to be on the way AND i WILL DEFINATELEY BE BUYING IT!
  
  A Great Gmae If Ever 
 I Saw One!

Review:  I honestly thought the idea of a Star Wars game where the characters were comprised of Lego people 
 would be 
  something you would have found several years ago -- until I played it. I knew I had to have this 
 game asap, whatever the cost. While I saved up the dough, I played the first level at least 2-3 
 dozen times. 
  
  I was a little disappointed when I bought the game and saw that it had only 17 levels with an additional 
 bonus level. Although 17 recognizable locations is certainly better than the one provided by the 
 demo, they were all pretty short. However, since you aren't able to save your games, it's very 
 appropriate that they be short. Once you finish a level, though, you can go back to play it again 
 with whatever character you choose. They even encourage this by only allowing you to get all the 
 canisters when you back and play in Free Mode. Unfortunately, the only thing you get by collecting 
 all the canisters is a whole bunch of blue studs to increase your score after each completed level. 
 Most of the levels are easy enough for little kids, but challenging enough to make you try again 
 if necessary until you get it right. 
  
  There are also extra items and characters that you can buy. Some characters (such as siths) are 
 essential to unlocking parts of certain levels. Some of the characters are pretty pointless though, 
 especially the ones that have no weapon at all. Another thing that flaws the game, in my opinion, 
 is that you are only able to choose 2 of the characters you want to play while entering a game. 
 The other 4 or 5 characters are chosen for you, some of which aren't practical choices for gameplay. 
 You do get the important characters that are needed for each level most of the time, but not always, 
 so you'd better be sure you choose one of those characters if you plan to hunt down the canisters 
 or go for those blue studs. 
  
  Some of the other great features are the ability to play multiplayer (which is nice since Lan or 
 internet games can be a pain) on the same computer and also to be able to fly Anakin's podracer 
 and a two other vehicles from the movies. I think the best feature is that everything is re-playable. 
 All the levels are fun to play over and over again.
  
  One other disappointment that's worth mentioning is that you can't exit out of cutscenes or level 
 intros (except for the classic star wars scroll) . Some are rather long and will bore you since 
 playing the game several times will have you watching the same intros over and over.
  
  Lego Star Wars is highly entertaining and will have you spending hours and hours trying to get 
 all those canisters and collecting all the studs. It's all worth it, though, when you get to experience 
 that bonus level. 
  
  I hope they make another game for 4, 5, and 6, because this one sure was a blast! Go ahead and 
 give the demo a try, but be prepared to count those dollars for the real thing!

Review:  Lego Star Wars is a great game because it combines two elements that have been popular for a decade. 
 Legos and Star Wars. As you play as lego characters identical to the actual legos we all now and 
 love you play the storyline of Episodes 1,2,3, and 4. The legos behave as actual people in the 
 sense that they do not act as legos. Studs are used as currency and to buy certain characters, 
 abilities, and hints. My favorite part is that you can play as any character. Anyone from Jar Jar 
 to Anakin to Padme to a Gonk Droid this is a great game

Review:  My 6 year old daughter's favorite thing to do. The game is so cute you can't believe it. It begins 
 even before you leave Dexter's diner. For example, when you win studs you can go back to Dexter's 
 diner and buy all the characters you have seen so far, after which they wander around the diner. 
 After a while, the diner will be full of pit droids and casual firefights between General grievous 
 and Mace Windu. You can also use studs to buy things like silly mustaches or to turn all the lightsabers 
 purple. When you head outside the diner to the parking lot, you will see (partially-built) vehicles 
 made out of all the lego pieces that you have acquired in the episodes.
  
  The episodes themselves cover all of the scenes of episodes I-III and are amazing in their cleverness 
 (much more so than the movies themselves) . They're also very kid appropriate with no blood, and 
 the only penalty for dying is a loss of studs. You absolutely must use a gamepad (gamepad setup 
 can be a little tricky. If it gets confused, delete your swlego. bin and try again) .
  
  My ratings are given as a kid's game. For example, the graphics are not as good as, say, Far Cry 
 but they are a million times better than any other kids game we have. If I rated it as an adult 
 game, the scores would be a little lower but not that much.

Review:  Lego and Star Wars: for years a marketing match made in heaven but recently thanks to Legos recent 
 business trouble a partnership in desperate need of rescue. Never fear, for now we have Lego Star 
 Wars, a game merging two of the most recognizable products in our global culture. What sounds like 
 merely a creative marketing ploy to hype both the imminently releasing Star Wars Episode III: Revenge 
 of the Sith and rekindle interest in Lego is actually a hugely entertaining action-adventure game 
 suitable for people of all ages who all have fond memories of both the science fiction legend and 
 those little plastic building blocks once so heavily adored.
  The concept is simple: bring all of the numerous Lego Star Wars figures to life in the video game 
 medium by placing them through the paces of some of the most recognizable scenes of Episodes I, 
 II, and III of the Star Wars sextuplet of movies. The delivery is nothing short of astounding, 
 from the charmingly blocky awkwardness of the character models to the overemphasized facial expressions, 
 Lego Star Wars oozes with nostalgia in every sense.
  The game is clearly designed to appeal to kids, with bright colors, low difficulty (you cannot 
 lose at this game) and very clean combat (beaten enemies burst into Lego pieces) . The hook here 
 however, is that this game will appeal to the kid in all of us. Everything is recreated in impressive 
 detail and absolutely looks like it is built from Lego bricks. Characters and creatures are faithful 
 to both Lego and Star Wars. The appearance is dead-on, right down to the stick-on hairpieces and 
 hole-filled legs.
  Fans of Star Wars will undoubtedly benefit the most from the game, as there are numerous at times 
 almost surreal and extremely hilarious moments scattered around the game. Whether it is the attempts 
 by a stumpy Darth Maul to intimidate you or the immensely satisfying scene of Jar Jar Binks plummeting 
 off of a cliff, you can tell Star Wars fans made this game, and they had as much fun creating the 
 scenes as you probably will playing them. The franchise has I felt been stuck in a sort of lackluster 
 Han Solo Syndrome ever since the lovable scoundrel vanished from the series, and this game successfully 
 revives some of the classic comedic value the original trilogy so effectively captured. There are 
 of course other perks, like the rampant use of random celebratory dance scenes which add to the 
 utter absurdity of it all.
  On top of it all is John Williams classic Star Wars score. Faithfully reproduced and playing throughout 
 the whole game, the dramatic orchestrations make the game just that much more enjoyable as the 
 squat figures lock into mortal combat, such as when Qui-Gon is stabbed by Darth Maul and has the 
 classic Xs over his eyes to signify his death. The contrast between the musical score and the 
 actual presentation ups the absurdity level even higher, and makes it absolutely hilarious.
  Theres plenty of action to go around too, from the opening fight of Obi-Wan & Qui-Gon Jinn aboard 
 the droid control ship in the Phantom Menace all the way through the activities of Episode III. 
 It must be noted that spoilers abound in this game, and so for Star Wars purists you had best put 
 off playing the last third of the game until after you have viewed Revenge of the Sith to prevent 
 any spoilers from reaching your ears.
  Throughout the game players will take control of all manner of characters from the Star Wars universe 
 to tackle varying tasks, each one faithfully replicated in comical fashion from their real-world 
 Lego model counterparts. Obi-wan and his Jedi ilk will appear when fighting is required, but sometimes 
 droids and others step in to solve puzzles and unlock doors. Combat is a simple manner of running 
 around and varying between a couple buttons to attack, block incoming attacks, or use a special 
 ability like force push to move an obstacle. An additional bonus to the game is on-the-fly two-player 
 mode in which a second person can grab a controller and jump in on the action at any time they 
 choose.
  If there is any downside to this game it must be traced back to the kiddy nature of the actual 
 game play. Children will absolutely devour this game, but for older players there is no challenge 
 to the game unless you are obsessed with achieving new high scores, and some people will only need 
 a couple of trips through the game to thoroughly enjoy everything there is to see. Nevertheless, 
 Lego Star Wars won't leave fans of either trademark feeling short-changed. Once the novelty wears 
 off, the lasting humor and utter absurdity make for one of the most original games in years. Heres 
 hoping the developers come back later with a longer adventure using the original trilogy. Fanboys 
 unite, you have a new hero.

Review:  Lego Star Wars is very fun. It's a great game for anyone to play and very addictive. This game 
 has co-op which is good, especially for the PC. Two people can play on the same keyboard. If not 
 then you can play with the computer. But it's more fun with someone else. The games contains Episode 
 1, 2, and 3. (Possible Spoiler: There is also a bonus level which is takes place after Episode 3, 
 but is short.) There are tons of characters each with their own abilities and fighting styles to 
 unlock. 
  
  The graphics aren't really good, but they are decent. The characters, levels and environment are 
 highly detailed even though they are made from Lego pieces. The levels are greatly made and are 
 colorful. The gameplay is alright, but it's too repetitive. All you do is fight and use force power. 
 There are some cool levels like pod racing and spaceship battle. I found those to be the funnest, 
 but there are only 3 levels with that kind of gameplay. The camera angles are terrible. It's only 
 focused on you, but not on what's important. So you'll be running in circles trying to figure out 
 what to do. Although the keyboard can get hard to get use to co-op mode is still fun. You can play 
 it with a family member or a friend. It has a great blend of platform and action. The action in 
 the game is fun at times. But the bad thing about it is that it occurs too much. 
  
  The sound isn't that good either. It's just short cut off versions of the real songs from Star 
 Wars and the sound effects aren't really good. The charaters make little screaming sounds when 
 they die and there are cheap lightsabers and laser blaster sounds. There aren't any voices and 
 there are repetitive songs played over and over again once they're done. The value in this game 
 isn't good either. The game is short and the only reason why you would find yourself playing this 
 game after you beat it, is to unlock stuff like characters and extras. Personally, I don't like 
 unlocking stuff. You need certain characters to get into certain areas and some areas are just 
 hard to find.
  
  This is a great game for anyone to play. Its definitely a must have for star wars fans or platfomer 
 fans. This game has great action and is extremely fun.

Review:  Weve seen LEGO Island, LEGO Loco, LEGO Racers, LEGO Knights Kingdom and I still await a LEGO 
 Barbie. What has never been done, however, is without a doubt my most favorite dynasty of LEGO 
 sets; LEGO Star Wars. Ever since my finding of the game in a small corner at Comic-Con of 2004, 
 Ive been anticipating its release. Most Star Wars games are known to be complete failures that 
 end up in the Bantha fodder department. LEGO Star Wars attempts to create something truly unique 
 in an entirely different league away from past Star Wars titles. A sequel would surely fix several 
 problems, but for a first swing at an entirely different Star Wars title, developer Travellers 
 Tales has made quite a name for themselves.
  
  LEGO Star Wars features the first three episodes of the Star Wars saga (no, not the originals that 
 were worth paying for) which each contain about five levels. You can play the episodes in any order 
 all thanks to a very creative menu system that is actually Dexters Diner from Episode II. There 
 are various doors that you can go through to get to whichever level you wish to play. As you walk 
 about the diner, you will find your companions that you have collected wandering about. If your 
 cold heart desires, you may even duel with your polished little friends until they explode into 
 a dozen LEGO pieces. The menu has LEGO currency hidden all around which is used for purchasing 
 items such as characters or cheat codes. The menu system alone is very unique and fun to play around 
 in. 
  
  The gameplay is certainly where the game shines, yet not bright enough. Each level involves a lot 
 of teamwork based gameplay involving yourself and usually around 3 other characters. They use the 
 everybody stand on a button to open a door technique a little too often taking away from the 
 whole point of having a large party of characters. There are moments, however, where the teamwork 
 gameplay is very creative and exciting. The saber fighting is the part of the game I was hoping 
 would be the most polished yet I was slightly disappointed. There are several moments where the 
 saber action will blow you away in comparison to the majority of Star Wars games on the market, 
 whereas other times you will feel like youre watching your little brother play with LEGOs. Since 
 it is targeted mainly at children, you can easily block anything by holding down the block button 
 (much like in Episode III: ROTS which is supposedly for the older crowd) . Using The Force is 
 unfortunately very fixed and is mainly used to build LEGO sets out of broken pieces. The only other 
 force power you have is force push, which simply cannot be used in intense situations. Using ranged 
 weapons, such as a blaster, is sometimes difficult to aim. Also, there always seems to be a Jedi 
 around to make you not want to use a ranged weapon character in the first place. The lack of an 
 objectives menu becomes a frustration and would have been a simple addition worth adding. There 
 are random glitches that become extremely frustrating, such as characters that cant walk up stairs 
 or confusing jumping problems. The majority of the gameplay is like most Star Wars games in that 
 you are constantly slicing up battle droids as opposed to battling Sith Lords or harpooning AT-ATs. 
 LEGO Star Wars does offer a few space and aircraft battles that, while very fixed and sometimes 
 side scrolling, are still enjoyable. The game allows for two player arcade style action and is 
 usually not a problem considering theres only about four buttons on the PC version and easily 
 done on console. This multiplayer action is usually quite fun but no other modes, such as a duel 
 mode, were included.
  The development team put a lot of work into making the players believe that they are in the LEGO 
 universe, not just the Star Wars universe. Its one of the most graphically polished games Ive 
 laid my eyes on and never has a moment that graphically lets you down. Each character looks identical 
 to its LEGO counterpart and when killed does not simply disappear, but shatters each LEGO piece 
 (including the hair!) to the ground. The camera has moments when you cant see the right action 
 but usually stays in the right area. Overall, the game is graphically appealing and beautifully 
 rendered.
  
  The story tries to stay along the same path as the Star Wars prequels but is mostly a very compressed 
 Star Wars in 5 minutes style. Each boss battle is very different from the actual film version 
 in order to lengthen the game. The way the story itself is explained is quite poor unless you have 
 seen the prequels already. The main cause of this is the fact that there is no dialogue. Skipping 
 over more important scenes was certainly not wise, but obviously not in the budget. The story has 
 several light hearted humorous moments that Star Wars fans will enjoy and other moments that will 
 make the Star Wars kid in all of us smile.
  
  The shortage of levels consequently shortens the game since each level is only 10-15 minutes. LEGO 
 Star Wars isnt even a weekend gameits a few hours game. Thankfully, the developers were quite 
 creative in using the LEGO theme to add a wide range of replay value. When youre not slicing up 
 battle droids into LEGO pieces, you can be on the biggest Easter egg hunt of all time collecting 
 LEGO currency. You can find these LEGO coins just about anywhere; under a seat in Dexters diner 
 or inside of a tree. Once youve collected enough money, you can purchase cheat codes that allow 
 you to have random accessories such as moustaches or large blasters. There is also a plethora of 
 characters that you can purchase and play as in the game aside from the many you collect from playing 
 the normal game. In other words, you can have two Yodas take on Darth Maul in the Episode I level. 
 Also collectable in the game are pieces to various spacecrafts that are eventually constructed 
 and placed outside the diner for you to view. Not much purpose to the models but continues the 
 theme of endless replay. There is far too much too collect, but at least you dont have to buy 
 anything in real life. The LEGO Star Wars world is fully converted onto your gaming system.
  
  When it comes down to it, LEGO Star Wars has its problems like any other LEGO game but has 
 something more unique than any other LEGO game or Star Wars game; spirit. LEGO Star Wars strives 
 to please every age group of Star Wars fans in hopes of capturing the spirit of the universe far, 
 far away that stole us all so long ago. With its ingenious gameplay and graphical world, LEGO Star 
 Wars does just that. All that I ask for is a sequel with the original films where I wont have 
 to kill Jar Jar Binks every time he walks by me in the diner.
  
  82/100

Review:  lego star wars is a verry good looking action game with great hummor fantastic star wars music 
 
  
  the game is a port of ps2 version with little better grfx
  
  the grfx of the game are verry good but i have found that you may have some problems with some 
 of ati radeon 9200 se cards like polygon breaks.
  
  the music of the game & most of the sounds from lightblades & blasters are from the star wars movies 
 something that make the game verry good sounding
  
  the gameplay of the game is a litle sloppy if you dont have a ps2 like game pad but you will not 
 have problems to gontrols you characters
  
  the only bad about the game is that is small the characters dont have speech
  & that the game 
 is not a pc one but a port from another system.
  
  lego star wars enyway is a verry fun to play game & a good break for eny gamer from 9 years old 
 to 999
  but is not one of the titles that will leave a mark in the video games legacy

Review:  There are so many trashy licensed properties out there, that its easy to get cynical about them. 
 But every once in a while, one of them comes along and hits the spot. Lego Star Wars is one of 
 those games. Lego Star Wars is a fun game that stays faithful to Star Wars, while providing something 
 different. But not only is this a good Star Wars game, its also a good Lego game. I had my doubts 
 that anybody could make a fun action game out of Legos. I was wrong. This game is a lot of fun. 
 
  
  At its core, Lego Star Wars is a pretty typical action/platformer game. You collect money, jump 
 on and over stuff, fight enemies, and solve simple puzzles. Occasionally, there is a change of 
 pace level where you do something like pod racing. Death merely causes you to lose a bit of money, 
 which means that this is a very easy game. If you keep dying, you can just keep retrying without 
 losing any progress. Essentially everything in the game is made out of Legos. The characters are 
 all short and squatty and have simplistic, expressionless Lego faces. The objects and vehicles 
 are all made out of Legos too. Even the Droidekas in the game are made of Legos.
  
  Lego Star Wars doesnt officially require a gamepad, but it might as well. This game would be hard 
 to play without an analog stick. If you have one though, then youll find it very easy to pick 
 up and play. The gameplay lacks depth, but thats not really a problem. It makes up for it by providing 
 a large variety of levels and the ability to replay through them. 
  
  Each of the three Star Wars prequels is recreated in this game in surprisingly faithful fashion. 
 This game has a lighthearted campiness that is hard to describe. It never takes itself too seriously. 
 The idea of a squatty, blocky Obi-Wan Kenobi wielding a lightsaber is funny enough. Unlocking a 
 dance floor that plays the disco version of the Star Wars theme song is hilarious. The game recreates 
 cutscenes from the movie with Lego Blocks. Its quite funny to see Darth Maul get cut by Obi-Wan 
 and then split into upper and lower half Lego pieces.
  
  The first time through each chapter, you play in Story Mode. The game encourages you to replay 
 the levels multiple times by putting in areas that are impossible to access in Story Mode. After 
 that, you can play in Freeplay, which allows you to take through characters that you have unlocked 
 in other chapters. You can complete each level by finding hidden items, which unlock Lego vehicles. 
 Unfortunately, you cant do anything with them. You just admire them in the parking lot at the 
 area between each chapter. The ability to take dozens of playable characters through each level 
 is one of the games greatest strengths. Every notable character in the trilogy is playable -- 
 even members of the Jedi Council who have but a few lines in all the movies. This is an unusual 
 and enjoyable twist that has never appeared in a Star Wars game. If you want, you can play through 
 part of Episode I with Count Dooku and Jango Fett, or maybe with General Grievous and one of his 
 bodyguards. Thus, Lego Star Wars will appeal not just to casual fans, but to the hardcore Star 
 Wars fans as well. 
  
  One quality of this game that is bound to go unnoticed is how highly polished the game is. There 
 are no faults that stand out about it. No bad levels. No bugs or glitches. Attention to detail 
 is excellent. The game seems to have been extensively play-tested so that there is no way to break 
 the levels.
  
  The audio for the game is decent, but not excellent. None of the characters speak, although they 
 do have occasionally grunts or cries of pain when they die. The music samples come directly from 
 the movies, as do all of the weapon sounds. If you have been playing Star Wars games for the past 
 few years, then you have heard all of these sounds a billion times, so they are nothing new.
  
  The graphics for the game have a weird and colorful style that easily makes up for their lack 
 of technical prowess. The way that all of the characters and objects are built with Legos is highly 
 impressive. The way that they are animated convincingly is even more impressive. General Grievous 
 and the Droidekas, in particular, are very cool to watch. Lego Star wars, overall, has a nice presentation 
 that adds value to the game. However, it wont make you forget about Half-Life 2 or Painkiller 
 anytime soon.
  
  Whether or not you get a lot of value out of this game depends upon how much you want to replay 
 the levels to explore all of the hidden areas and collect hidden items. Lego Star Wars takes maybe 
 7 or 8 hours to play just once, but over 20 if you unlock everything. For a game that almost has 
 a budget price, thats very solid. 
  
  When it comes to licensed properties, Lego Star Wars is one of the most pleasant surprises that 
 the gaming industry has ever provided. This game captures the Star Wars universe in a way that 
 is both unique and highly faithful. Thus, this is a very easy game to recommend for Star Wars fans 
 -- especially those that grew up making spaceships out of Legos.

Review:  LEGO Star Wars is a very simple game. An arcade that takes you through the first three Star Wars 
 movies the LEGO way. You just run around, jump, shoot and collect LEGOs. A few missions are race 
 type and complement other parts of the game beautifully. At first sight nothing special. But as 
 you play for a while you begin to notice the finer points of the game.
  
  First of all, the story is great. The cut-scenes show interesting parts of each movie, shortened, 
 as not to make them too boring for those who saw the film, and with a subtle sense of humor that 
 really makes you smile.
  
  The game-play has tons of different characters and a few of them follow you around as you play. 
 Occasionally you have to switch between these LEGO people to use their special ability, which you 
 need to use at a certain point to continue. So you have characters working as a team to get along. 
 The Jedi characters can also use the force to move the LEGOs. You can make a bridge, push droids 
 over a ledge, flick a switch,...
  I also like the fact that you cannot die. Is you get blasted you loose some money and reappear 
 where you disintegrated. But if you don't like it easy you can challenge yourself by going for 
 the high score. If you collect enough LEGOs you can buy more characters, weapons and other fun 
 stuff, you also get a prize vehicle if you pick up all 10 special containers in a single level.
 
  
  After you finish a level you can play it again in free mode, which means you can select any character 
 you want. This way you can get some secrets that are impossible to get with other characters.
 
  
  All the elements together make LEGO Star Wars a great game. It's not very complex and very deep, 
 but it's not meant to be. It was made primarily for kids, and it shows. It's entertainment for 
 a few hours when you just want to relax and rest you brain from all those grownup games.

Review:  I played a lot of games since i was little and i have to say that this game is one of the most 
 fun games ever. the graphic and sound department's not state of the art but it's nice and very 
 clean. and the lego characters looks very cute too! u must play this game with a friend. or maybe 
 with your 10 years old sister. or maybe with your 70 years old grandpa. and i guarantee that they'll 
 have a lot of fun. this game is also a great party game coz' it's not so hard and you can finish 
 the whole game in a couple of hours.
  ok in a nutshell, give your stressfull self a favor and play this game. you'll feel better. well, 
 at least i do. 
  
  lego + star wars = fun!

Review:  Lego Star Wars is one of the most intriguing cross-promotional games ever. Its managed to garner 
 more hype than the official Episode III game, which speaks volumes about the trouble the Star Wars 
 franchise has been in lately. While the game offers a unique take on the Star Wars universe and 
 pretty much hooks you in with the gotta catch em all factor of unlocking all of the characters 
 and getting a sneak peak at Episode III, the somewhat lackluster gameplay, however, doesnt make 
 up for the content offered. 
  
  Lego Star Wars is a truncated retelling of the stories from the movie prequels. Youll play through 
 the key events from all three movies from the trade federation ship to the final showdown between 
 Obi Wan and Anakin (and perhaps even beyond) . What makes the game so interesting is that almost 
 everything in the game (sans most of the environments) looks like its been built out of Lego blocks, 
 which will send enemies, as well as the majority of the destructive objects exploding into small 
 blocks or just collapsing on top of themselves. 
  
  Each chapter stays true to the story and will let you play one main character and have up to four 
 other characters following you around. Each character type has their own special abilities, for 
 instance, droids can open certain doors, blaster characters are able to repel up to higher ledges, 
 and so on. You can switch between characters when the need arises, or if youre just tired of playing 
 Jedis all the time. When youre not assuming the role of these secondary characters, they do exhibit 
 some sort of AI, though theyre more likely to just stand around while youre being attacked from 
 all sides; they well fight back if theyre being attacked however. 
  
  The games shortcomings really show in terms of combat. Jedi characters practically play the same, 
 with Yoda being an exception to the rule. No matter who you play, youll be using the same three-hit 
 combo and jump attack throughout the game. Blaster characters are the same story, with the only 
 difference being the sound of their blasters. Combat isnt fast paced and becomes pretty repetitive, 
 only to start playing second fiddle to your quest to collect money and the numerous Easter eggs 
 the game holds. One element that spices up the generally bland gameplay is the ability to use the 
 force on certain objects, usually designated with a glowing aura. Youll come across more than 
 a few puzzles where you have to lift objects or build new objects that will let you get to a hard 
 to reach item or allow you to push on through the level. The monotony is broken on a few levels 
 in Episode II and III where the chapters consist of some shooting levels reminiscent of Zaxxon, 
 not to mention the Pod race in Episode I. 
  
  The scavenger hunt doesnt end with Easter eggs and studs. Youll also be able to find kit pieces 
 hidden in levels to build vehicles specific to that level. You also have a meter at the top of 
 the screen that fills up as you collect more and more studs. When you manage to fill the meter 
 for each level, youll gain a piece to a super secret ship as well as Jedi master status which 
 will unlock more levels to play after you complete the initial three episodes. You can also use 
 your hard earned money to purchase up to 40 characters including Darth Maul, General Grievous, 
 Count Dooku, among the other lesser droids, Jedi, and Wookies available. You can then go back to 
 earlier chapters and play the free play mode where you can assemble a veritable dream team to play 
 through with, like Yoda and Darth Maul. You can also purchase extras that will change the way characters 
 and items look in the game, like oversized blasters, moustaches, tea cups, and so on. 
  
  As mentioned earlier, the use of Legos give the visuals a simple, yet charming look. Its pretty 
 neat to see ships and generally evil characters depicted as blocks and it doesnt really get old. 
 Youll also get some neat blur effects off of light sabers, a lot of reflective floors, and some 
 particle effects from running your light sabers across things. Environments all have that sanitary, 
 void look to them that stays true to the Star Wars universe and though theyre not totally made 
 of blocks, they come across well and dont look out of place. 
  
  Sound offers the usual Star Wars fare. Youll have the usual John Williams score pounding in the 
 background accompanied by the sounds of light sabers and blasters. Characters dont talk, however, 
 only offering small grunts and sighs during cut scenes and during battle instead opting to talk 
 with their hands and body language. The lack of voice acting isnt a bad thing though, as it adds 
 to the overall charm of the presentation. Though its a tad odd during certain emotional scenes 
 like the final battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan. Its still more lifelike then the love scenes 
 presented in Episode II, however. Oh did I just go there? Yeah I did. Burn. 
  
  Lego Star Wars is definitely a unique take on the movie prequels and despite the lackluster combat, 
 any fan of the series, or the prequels for that matter will find some joy in playing through the 
 storylines. This is a must for any die hard Star Wars fan, though casual gamers or skeptics might 
 find some enjoyment in a rental, since the game can easily be beaten over a weekend. Die hard fans 
 will have a ball trying to collect everything there is. In the end, Lego Star Wars is a good experience 
 despite its basic fighting mechanics and is sure to whittle away a few hours no matter what type 
 of gamer you are.

Review:  Being a bit of an old school gamer, I was horrified when I first heard about Lego Star Wars some 
 time ago. I found fault with the idea, the screen shots, everything. What an horrifyingly bad idea.
 
  
  After reading some glowing previews by people I respected, I decided to try the demo. It was the 
 most fun 5 minutes I have had in a long time. Pretty much everything was entertaining from one 
 end to the other, aside from a minor annoyance in getting familiar with the controls (PC Users: 
 use a gamepad with this one) .
  
  There is nothing particularly deep or significant to the game, but it was so easy to get into and 
 so entertaining that I found myself playing the short demo 3 times over, just to make sure that 
 I hadn't missed anything. I got the game as soon as it came out and have just had a blast. (Although 
 I don't plan on playing the third chapter until after the movie comes out) .
  
  The levels are fun, the gameplay is fun, the puzzles are fun. I'm even ashamed to say that because 
 of playing this game, I found myself wanting to buy a bunch of Star Wars Lego sets and put them 
 together. :-o And I haven't done that for about 18 years.
  
  I had to put aside Far Cry, NFSU2 and Riddick to play this one. Not because its production values 
 were better, but I just had a great time playing it and couldn't stop.
  
  I recommend this game to anyone, young or old. Try the demo and give it a whirl! I'm sure you won't 
 be disappointed.
  JK

Review:  So, time has past, and the onslaught of new games have filled the market place. With so many great 
 games coming out, its no wonder your wallet may be feeling a little empty inside. It's times like 
 these that we gamers are glad to see a budget game that can make us forget about all our little 
 problems. This is basically the whole reason for buying Lego Star Wars. Through its splendid presentation, 
 the graphics, sound, and gameplay jump out at you as "pretty dang good for a budget game". On to 
 the rather short review!
  
  The first thing on our plate for today is the graphics. The PC version has some of the best graphics 
 of the tri-platform release. While it may seem like an oddity, the lego star wars people actually 
 look quite good. The enviroments, even though more detailed, mix well with the lego models. The 
 visual effects, ranging from your force powers to the blasters are just perfect for this type of 
 game. It all combines to make quite the eye candy. All these colors and lights add to the stimulating 
 experience of the game.
  
  After you finish your first serving, the next thing you notice on your shmorgisbourg of stuff is 
 the sound. While not exactly fantastic, the music in the game is basically a mild rehash of the 
 movie soundtracks. There are no voices, and the characters usually let out grunts or funny "sounds". 
 The fact that there is no spoken dialogue kind of takes away from the over all experience, but 
 it is still a great sound score.
  
  Last but not least, we have the gameplay for desert. The game mechanics are quite simple, consisting 
 of an attack/defend button, a force manipulation button (which lets you pick up legos) , and a JUMP 
 BUTTON!!!! (My personal favorite.) These three buttons, and the button that lets you switch between 
 characters, work in unison to do semi-challanging puzzles through the game. Most of your time will 
 be spent trying to unlock all 50 characters in the game..... thats right, there is a crap load of 
 stuff to unlock. Just the sheer volume of crap makes a person shutter. You unlock stuff from the 
 story mode by collecting oddities and buying them from this guy at a bar, which is never really 
 explained, but a good mechanic.
  
  Overall, this game makes for a unique experience. The sound, gameplay, and graphics all add to 
 entrench you in this insanely corny world where an evil mating of legos and star wars has occured. 
 For a budget game, this should keep you busy for about 14-20+ hours of gameplay, most of your time 
 going towards the unlockables. This is a recommend buy if you have a controller for your PC.

Review:  This game was amazingly good. The graphics are nice and the gameplay is smooth. Sometimes the camera 
 angle will frustrait you but for the most part its fun. If you like jumping games with puzzles 
 to solve you'll love this one. Plus as a bonus it follows the three movies of Star Wars pretty 
 close. Its often amusing to watch what things would look like as legos :) 
  The sound track is great and the sound effects are a nice touch. 
  I definitely recommend you 
 have a gamepad for this game. The keyboard play is very awkward.
  
  I would recommend this game.
