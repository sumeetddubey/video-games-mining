:::Review:::
Marvel TCG isn't too bad as far as digital trading-card games go, but it's unlikely to convert anyone 
 not already invested in TCGs. 

  Upper Deck Entertainment, one of the more prominent purveyors of collectible trading-card games 
 today, has teamed up with Konami to create a digital version of Upper Deck's Marvel-licensed TCG 
 with the succinctly (if dryly) named Marvel Trading Card Game. It seems like a solid representation 
 of Upper Deck's robust, flexible, and rather popular Vs. System Trading Card Game, and it packs 
 a solid online element. As is the case with most digitized TCGs, it's not a particularly exciting 
 game to watch. If you're not already knee-deep in the real-world Vs. System Trading Card Game, 
 or other similarly advanced TCGs, it can be a confusing experience, as well.  

  In concept, Marvel Trading Card Game is a straightforward exercise in strategy. Two players, each 
 armed with a deck of cards, take turns attacking one another by playing various cards with unique 
 characteristics until one player has had all of his or her hit points depleted. Cards are divided 
 into several different categories: characters, equipment, locations, and plot twists. Characters 
 are probably the most significant cards, as these are what you'll use to actually attack your opponent, 
 while equipment and locations can be used to enhance their abilities. Plot twists are also of great 
 import, due largely to the wide range of effects they can have, from simply buffing up one of your 
 character cards for a turn to forcing your opponent to discard cards. Plot twists can also be chained 
 together, which can potentially cause several reversals of fortune within a single character clash. 

           Was Marvel Trading Card Game really the best name Konami could muster up?      

  Before 
 you can put any characters into play, though, you'll need to meet their resource requirements. 
 You can choose to play any card in your hand as a resource at the start of your turn, similar to 
 the way mana cards are played in Magic: The Gathering. Likewise, you can only add a single card 
 to your resources during any given turn, which generally causes the action to build up slowly over 
 the course of a match, since it will take time to garner the necessary resources to put your more 
 powerful characters into play. There's certainly a significant element of luck to your success, 
 since you'll be drawing cards randomly from your deck, but there are several thick layers of strategy 
 to it as well. Which characters you play is important, as each has a unique attack and defense 
 rating that will determine how it'll fare against other characters, but  where  you actually place 
 them on the playing field can matter just as much. There are two rows your character can be played 
 in -- front and back -- and how they'll behave when placed in either can depend on whether they have 
 flight abilities and ranged attacks. Where they're placed in proximity to other characters that 
 share their team affiliation also matters.  

  All of these elements can make for some really interesting play, if you can figure out what's actually 
 going on. There's a series of interactive tutorials to help beginners, which is instructive, though 
 you'll ultimately still have to jump in feet-first to fully understand the ins and outs of the 
 game. Even then, the interface is dense with icons used to signify lots of important stuff. Plot-twist 
 chains, which will regularly determine the outcome of a specific confrontation, can be especially 
 difficult to keep track of due to the way they're presented. Though the game does try to spruce 
 things up with some nice background and card art, as well as some light particle effects, it can 
 still look like some kind of alien tax return. The interface on the PC version is significantly 
 more manageable than the PSP or DS versions, due simply to the size of the screen and the more 
 intuitive mouse interface, though you'll still find yourself right-clicking to pull up lots of 
 sub-menus, and referencing the manual for certain vital, keyboard-only commands. And, in a move 
 that will certainly frustrate some players, the PC version apparently only plays in a fixed-resolution 
 window.  

  If you can get the hang of it, though, Marvel Trading Card Game brims with ways to play. There 
 are two unique and lengthy single-player campaigns to play through, putting you in the role of 
 either hero or villain. You can play against a live opponent either over a LAN or through the game's 
 online mode, where you can jump right into games with players from around the world, or compete 
 in numerous sponsored and user-created tournaments.  

           How about 'Marvel Card Battle' or 'Marvel Hero Clash'? We just came up with those, on 
 the spot.      

  The PC version also finally makes good on the promise of cross-platform support with the previously 
 released Marvel Trading Card Game for the PSP. You can now play against PSP players, and your account 
 can be used seamlessly between the two platforms. All of this works well, and the addition of PC 
 players to the already healthy pool of PSP players means it's never too hard to find someone to 
 battle with. Taking the digital trading-card concept to its logical conclusion, you can also buy 
 additional booster packs and starter decks of "cards" to enhance your online deck. As a nice little 
 bonus, the PC version comes with a voucher for 10 free booster packs.  

  With its capable implementation of the well-known Vs. System, Marvel Trading Card Game will make 
 those who've already got a taste for TCGs quite happy, and it makes pretty good use of the Marvel 
 license on top of that. It's a step up in sophistication from the Yu-Gi-Oh! games that Konami has 
 been churning out for years, and the online component is surprisingly solid. It's a fairly well-made 
 digital trading-card game, but ultimately, its accessibility is hindered by its inherent trading-card 
 game format.
