:::Review:::
It's basically just Virtual Pool 2 with a handful of enhancements. 

 Though it's been more than two years since Interplay released Virtual Pool 2, there's no question 
 that it's still the best pool simulator. Of course, some might say it's merely a case of a big 
 fish in a little pond - you can count the number of Virtual Pool competitors on one hand. But that 
 doesn't change the fact that just about everyone from casual pool enthusiasts to hard-core billiards 
 fans agrees that 1997's Virtual Pool 2 delivered an experience as close to the real thing as you 
 could hope to see on a PC monitor. Interplay even backed the game up with an impressive guarantee: 
 You would get a full refund if you didn't see improvements in your real pool game after applying 
 the techniques and strategies featured in Virtual Pool 2.  

 Virtual Pool Hall carries the same guarantee as Virtual Pool 2, which isn't surprising since a closer 
 inspection of the box copy reveals that it's basically just Virtual Pool 2 with a handful of enhancements. 
 Arguably, Celeris achieved such high standards with Virtual Pool 2 that there was no way to raise 
 the bar much higher in Virtual Pool Hall. Then again, after two years it's certainly reasonable 
 to expect more than a few new modes of play, a new table, and slightly improved physics and artificial 
 intelligence.  

 Each game in the Virtual Pool series had great graphics for its time, and Virtual Pool Hall is no 
 exception. Even in software rendering mode, the balls and table look top-notch - you really couldn't 
 ask for much more. There's actually very little difference in detail between the software-rendered 
 and 3D-accelerated graphics; you have to squint to tell them apart. You can make the game run more 
 smoothly by switching resolutions, although I experienced several game crashes while trying to 
 switch between software rendering, my primary 3D accelerator, and my Voodoo2 card.  

 But while Virtual Pool Hall scores high marks for its table graphics, it doesn't handle other visual 
 elements as well, such as the playing environments and opponents. Psygnosis' Expert Pool at least 
 made an effort to bring some variety to the pool-playing experience; on the other hand, Virtual 
 Pool Hall hardly tries at all. There are apparently only four available venues in the game, which 
 are assigned automatically based on the type of table you select. For instance, choosing a barroom 
 table takes you to The Hawg Pen. In fact, the barroom table is one of the few additions to the 
 game. You'll also find the traditional championship table, as well as tables for snooker and billiards. 
 Otherwise, the game's minimalist background scenery isn't the sort of shortcoming that'll stop 
 you from playing, but you'd think a little more effort would have been invested in lending the 
 simulation a more realistic appearance. Virtual Pool Hall features 128 computer opponents, and you'll 
 have to take Interplay for its word when it says these opponents have enhanced artificial intelligence, 
 mainly because there's no good way to tell. It's not like you actually speak to the opponents; 
 just as in Virtual Pool 2, you compete against invisible players whose shot-making abilities run 
 the gamut from awful to astounding based on easily understandable numerical rankings. At first 
 I was a little disappointed that Virtual Pool Hall lacked rendered opponents - all you see is your 
 invisible opponent's cue stick taking the shot - but then again, rendered opponents didn't actually 
 succeed in making Expert Pool more immersive. The bottom line is that Virtual Pool Hall's gameplay 
 is as fast and enjoyable as ever, rendered opponents or no.  

 Virtual Pool Hall doesn't have many other features besides the improved graphics and computer players. 
 Some new game modes have been added, including 15-ball, cribbage (sinking two consecutive balls 
 whose total face value equals 15) , cowboy (a combination of carom and billiards) , Honolulu (no 
 straight-in shots) , and bowlliards (run a rack of ten balls for a strike!) . You also get snooker, 
 which may or not be appealing to you, and two types of billiards (one- and three-cushion) - but 
 for some reason you can't play either billiards variation against the computer.  

 Which brings us to the biggest problem in Virtual Pool Hall: lackluster multiplayer support. Playing 
 against 128 computer opponents is great practice and a real blast for a while, but even average 
 players will be itching to take on human opponents before long. But all you get from Interplay 
 is a section in the manual that suggests you use Kali, a third-party software package, to find 
 opponents for online play. Kali was great back when it was the cheapest way to play multiplayer 
 games over the Internet. But because Virtual Pool Hall features DirectPlay support, you don't actually 
 need Kali to play online; it only serves as a clearinghouse for meeting potential opponents. At 
 any rate, there's little competition to be found on Kali, so you'd be better off heading to the 
 Celeris web site instead and using its links to various Virtual Pool sites to find live opponents. 

 If you're looking to buy your first pool simulation, Virtual Pool Hall should be a no-brainer: It 
 has incredibly accurate physics and a wide and satisfying array of pool variations that make it 
 the most realistic and addictive pool sim you can buy. However, it's the best simulation on the 
 market by default, rather than because it couldn't have been better.
