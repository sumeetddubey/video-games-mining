There's a lot to like in this low-priced gem. 

 Question: Why spend $20 for ten levels when you can get 1,500 levels for the same amount of money? 

 Answer: Quality.  

 If you've tried those 1,500-level Duke packs, you know most of those episodes are terrible. Brief, 
 little, uncreative excursions. On the other hand, working your way through the ten huge and cleverly 
 connected locations in Duke It Out in D. C. will take several days and massive quantities of caffeine. 

 Our affable buddy Duke takes on one task: blasting through a gazillion aliens to rescue the kidnapped 
 President (of course, once you've reached the beleaguered soul, you can take a pass on the final 
 rescue) . Along the way you'll visit most of the capital's major tourist stops, from the White House 
 and the Lincoln Memorial to the Smithsonian and the Capitol. Plus you'll head underground into 
 the sewers and subway and work your way to a nuclear submarine base and a nuke-proof (but not Nukem-proof) 
 command bunker. And if you look carefully near an abandoned subway stop, you'll find a crack in 
 a wall that takes you to a humongous, top secret government warehouse full of goodies, including 
 a time machine. (This level was designed by Charlie Wiederhold, who is something of a Duke guru.) 

 There's a lot to like in this low-priced gem. And you've got to love its behind-the-scenes story. 
 Eight of its ten levels were created by one guy: Robert Travis. He worked for a year at Babbages, 
 and in his spare time he struggled through the frustrating task of creating Doom levels. Then along 
 came Duke, with its much easier level editor, and he began cranking out one good version after 
 another, posting them on the Internet as he went. Meanwhile, a small software start-up in Indiana 
 wanted to get into authorized add-on packs, saw his stuff, and snarfed him up.  

 Travis managed to create those eight levels in only 16 weeks. Hard to believe, considering their 
 complexity and the quantity of new art, including paintings, flags, and museum exhibits. Each episode 
 takes plenty of time to navigate and some are frustratingly difficult. For instance, in the Smithsonian, 
 you can see a door key card hovering in a fish tank. Getting there requires finding a few hidden 
 passageways, diving into a half-dozen shark-infested tanks, and locating several nearly invisible 
 underwater switches.  

 D. C. is a little behind the times (one reason may be because they finished D. C. in January but held 
 it for release until now) . It has none of the new weapons and monsters from the Plutonium Pak, 
 and there are no new sounds, no new music, and no light switches. You find yourself going a long 
 way down some lengthy tunnels and elevator shafts just to throw a critical switch or find another 
 key card. After that much effort there should be a larger reward. Plus there are too few surprises. 
 The opportunities for humor, irony, and sight gags in this political setting should have been too 
 numerous to pass up. But pass them up they did.  

 Meanwhile, there are many improvements over the original Duke. This version's nuclear submarine 
 is full-sized and fully functional (even the torpedoes work) , not just a means to end a level. 
 The Smithsonian is an amazingly detailed level with aquariums, a space exploration section, and 
 an overview of ancient civilizations. The subway system is well designed and appropriately gritty. 
 There are plenty of wide-open areas with places to duck behind for decent multiplayer matches. 
 Plus, you shouldn't miss the final animation. It's not that spectacular, but if you click any key 
 after defeating the "Boss," you'll skip it  

 Duke It Out in D. C. misses a few obvious opportunities to improve on the original, but the numerous 
 enhancements that weren't missed, and the low price, make this a worthy investment for anyone looking 
 to prolonging the reign of "the king."

Review:  Duke It Out In DC is an addon for the classic Duke 3D, and takes place in Washington DC. Duke is 
 sent there in a helicopter to fight against the aliens that have taken over the city. Duke Nukem's 
 classic character and attitude is used well in Duke It Out In DC. The addon doesn't have any new 
 weapons, but it uses the existing ones very well. It does have lots of cool new artwork, though. 
 The game starts out at the white house, and as you move through the levels, you'll visit the Lincoln 
 Memorial, the capitol building, the smithsonian, and many other places in DC. The levels were designed 
 by Charlie Weiderhold (who worked on DNF from 1997-2006) , and they are all very well designed. There's 
 even one level named Dread October where Duke moves through a very detailed submarine underwater 
 and launches a missile from inside! The game has a total of 11 new levels, including one secret 
 level (Which is AWESOME) . Overall, this game is a classic and all Duke fans need to play it!

Review:  I barely can remeber this game..... But i remeber it being a prettty good game just like most of 
 all the Duke games were, for the time that they were made and the style that was in at that time, 
 this game kinda sat aside all that. It had most things that no other first person shooter had. 
 The game was good, but not as good as the other in the series were. Sure, the graphics were pretty 
 good, and the gameplay had it's up's and down's but more could have been done with this title. 
 It's a game that you can probably find for fairly cheap now, and it's worth playing if your looking 
 for an old school shooter
