:::Review:::
While Zork Nemesis may be too graphic and intense for children, adults who loved Myst or Phantasmagoria 
 will find a lot to like about this CD-ROM. 

 Despite the elite pedigree that its name suggests, Zork Nemesis has little to do with the best-selling, 
 text-based Zork of a simpler era.  

 That said, expect the folks at Activision, Inc. to walk around their West Los Angeles offices with 
 a classic "What, me worry? grin. As soon as Zork Nemesis deposits players into its temple 
 courtyard, the Myst crowd will feel right at home, and Activision should keep on smiling all the 
 way to the bank.  

 Myst, which has stayed on top of the sales charts since it was released in September 1993, put the 
 final nails into the text-adventure coffin. It's ironic, then, that this new adventure-exploration 
 CD-ROM should attack its family tormentor by taking the graphic adventure genre to a new level. 

 This title's richly-executed visual environment, well-written plot, "Z-Vision" 360-degree pivoting 
 point of view, Gregorian chant soundtrack, and ambient sound effects (Windows 95 only) make for 
 a slick, enticing game experience -- but computer gamers should expect that experience to be a long 
 one.  

 While Zork Nemesis follows the  format, the game's 
 designers trip players up by throwing in many situations that demand abstract, sometimes counterintuitive 
 reasoning. If players can get past these frustrating moments and concentrate on what decisions 
 fit best within the Zork Nemesis underworld, they'll be rewarded with a progression of puzzles 
 more closely tied to the story than is the case with The 11th Hour or Phantasmagoria.  

 In between decision points, Zork Nemesis presents some of the best integration of full motion video 
 to date. Why? The use of such footage is restrained and understated. There's a lot of it throughout 
 this three-disc adventure, but it's always supportive of the 3-D rendered environment and the story. 

 Lately there has been a clarion's call for multidimensional characters and situations in computer 
 games, and Zork Nemesis actually delivers the goods. As players uncover more information, they 
 come to realize that there are reasons why the chief villain has set events in motion. Players 
 may even become sympathetic. Other characters are just as complex, and assuming that an ally can 
 be trusted can lead to dead ends.  

 While Zork Nemesis may be too graphic and intense for children, adults who loved Myst or Phantasmagoria 
 will find a lot to like about this CD-ROM. With Broderbund Software pushing the sequel to Myst 
 back into 1997, computer gamers might not find a better substitute than Zork Nemesis.

Review:  Zork : Nemesis is the second graphical installment in the Zork franchise, being released after 
 Return to Zork. From the beginning, Zork has been complex adventure games, always with a hint of 
 fantasy lore and myth in the midst of it's deep and networked story lines.
  
  In Zork : Nemesis, you start at the mythical Temple of Agrippa, where shortly after the beginning, 
 you have a vision of a young girl, named Alexandria, who has a plea for help, stating "they're 
 in the temple". By 'they', Alexandria means the four alchemists, who are being hunted by a bizaar 
 entity called Nemesis.
  
  Throughout this game you will find a suddenly changing story being developed around you. The graphic 
 environments of the temple and the four realms that you travel to throughout the game offer puzzles 
 that will challenge the most elite of adventure gamers, and the plot line will develop in front 
 of you as you interact with the environment and the characters of the game.
  
  The feel of this game is a lot more dark and sinister then the previous games, with not as much 
 humour popping up when necessary, like the franchise's previous installments. However, the developments 
 of the story and characters throughout this game will keep you on your seat from start to finish.
 
  
  Graphics - 9/10
  Sound - 8/10
  Gameplay - 8/10
  Overall - 8.5/10

Review:  My only complaint about this game (which isn't even really a complaint) is the fact that there 
 exists no other games on the Playstation that can even approach this game in quality, atmospherics, 
 graphics and gameplay.
  
  Zork Nemesis just blows me away - even now, so many years after its release, it STILL captivates. 
 The sounds, the amazing atmospheric and textural effects, the easy gameplay mechanism yet extremely 
 challenging puzzles, the gorgeous graphics and the way it has of completely immersing you in the 
 game's universe, it's just unparalleled for me.
  
  I can't really say much more only that I haven't actually played this game in over a year. But 
 just the process of writing this review has once again whetted my appetite to drag out my old notes, 
 re-install the game on my XP system (even though it was written for Windows 95, it still works 
 PERFECTLY on my current XP box) , and delve back into the wonderful, stunningly immersive world 
 of Zork: Nemesis.

Review:  When reading this review, please keep in mind that it is coming from a hardcore adventure game 
 fan who played this game originally in 1997, and still thinks that its the best game out there.
 
  
  I obtained this game for my birthday way back in the day. It came complete with the journal of 
 a character who had travelled into the "forbidden lands" of Zork, and never returned. Needless 
 to say, I was swept into the forboding feel of the game almost immediately and never really looked 
 back. After all these years, I must say that the atmosphere created by the story and sounds of 
 this game is almost every bit as dark and mysterious as it once was.
  
  Okay, so the graphics and sound may now appear to be somewhat outdated, but they are still amazing. 
 When I play this game, I'm still astounded at the beauty of the different worlds; of which there 
 are 5. Each world is created with painstaking attention to detail and has a feel entirely of its 
 own. While there is virtually no character "interaction" throughout the game, this only contributes 
 to the dark and suspenseful plot of the game. In each of the worlds, you are uncovering bits and 
 pieces of the lives of the people who lived there and there are truly many layers to be discovered. 
 
  
  The story is also fantastic. This may come as a surprise given the lack of characters in the game, 
 but they makers managed to create a compelling story with twists and turns and an awesome ending. 
 The characters that do exist each have histories and personalities which you will have the chance 
 to explore and secrets which will have to be uncovered. Without giving much of the story away, 
 I will just mention that each main character comes from one of the different (and beautiful) worlds 
 and their personality traits are reflected in the places they come from. While this seems a little 
 esoteris, I'll just say that once you are fully immersed in the game, it will all make sense.
 
  
  The one thing that I think sets this game apart from all others is the puzzle element. I am not 
 going to soften the blow - some of the puzzles are difficult. The bottom line, however, is that 
 they all fit seemlessly into the story. While attempting to solve a particular puzzle, you will 
 inevitably come accross excerpts from novels about the land of Zork, photographs, and histories 
 - each one contributing to the insight that will enable you to continue in the game. Looking back 
 on the experience, I wonder how many people devoted large parts of their lives to making sure all 
 the details came together in such a synergistic fasion... Simply amazing! 
  
  I could go on for much longer singing the praise of what I consider to be the best adventure game 
 of all time, but I think I have said enough. Needless to say, this game is still as impressive 
 as it once was and deserves recognition as a masterpiece.
  
  If I had to pick one catch phrase to sum up all that I've said it would be the following: This 
 is a game of haunting beauty which will have you up for hours solving mysteries which only add 
 to the game's charm.
