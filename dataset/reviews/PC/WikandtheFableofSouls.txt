:::Review:::
Wik & the Fable of Souls is a mix of challenging, intelligent gameplay and an intriguing, fairy-tale 
 presentation that will appeal to just about anyone. 

  Wik &amp; the Fable of Souls is a static platformer starring Wik, a bug-eyed creature with an extraordinarily 
 dexterous tongue. Whether you're playing story or challenge mode, you progress through a series 
 of screens that are filled with coins, gems, enemies, and little green grubs. You have to collect 
 grubs with your tongue and spit them at your pack animal, Slotham, who slowly moves from left to 
 right at the bottom of the screen. If Slotham reaches the end of the screen before you collect 
 the required number of grubs, you lose. Luckily you can slow Slotham down by spitting puddles of 
 honey in his path. To collect grubs, you'll have to jump, swing from your tongue, and fend off 
 enemies that try to carry the grubs away. As if that weren't enough, some enemies can actually 
 kill Wik, so there's the matter of self-preservation to keep in mind as well. With its charming 
 presentation and challenging gameplay, Wik is an enchanting little game that's definitely worth 
 checking out.

Review:  This game has been seriously hyped. Its got a steep difficulty curve, but ultimately is too easy. 
 It has nice 2D graphics, and a fairly pleasant soundtrack, although it gets repetitive. The story 
 is cute, but written in a slightly twee style, that rhymes every line. The gameplay is also repetitive, 
 and the guy handles quite badly. You spend all your time catching bugs and spitting them at things, 
 while trying to collect gems or coins. The story seems too distant from the plot, which is a shame, 
 because it was quite a good one. Overall, its not as good as fancy pants adventure, which has a 
 slightly different handling style, but it a similar concept: highly produced artwork, simple gameplay 
 and well thought out storyline. Its much better integrated with the story, its easier to get the 
 controls, and its free, which Wik isn't.

Review:  Having bought this game from x box live, i am sorry to say that my points were ill spent. This 
 game coupled with lack of entertaining game play and an equally boring story is one of the worst 
 games that has come out of the live arcade. I would recommend any other live arcade games to Wik 
 such as Geometry Wars or Outpost Kaloki but this is just one game you'll want to aviod at all costs.
 
  As much as i enjoy writing bad reviews and being a harsh critic, this game has nearly nothing to 
 offer, except if you like to feed a pack mule thing and getting grubs, there is not much else one 
 can say except that, dont buy this game it sucks.

Review:  this is a good game and has many reasons why. When you finish a chapter you have good poems and 
 riddles to read. The game plays good and is preaty fun as you have to collect grubs and spit it 
 out at a thing. Whe you do this u earn points and progress thro the story. The game gets harder 
 and harder but with no multiplayer on xbox live This game lacks on replay value As you see it all 
 when you play the story but it is fun to come back and play it a little bit The graphics are good 
 as they have good motions and you can see Wik making the motions. all in all I dont have much to 
 say about this game except for it is fun in ways but does get boring after a while if you have 
 a little extra chage get it off the reflexive website or buy itoff the xbl market place

Review:  This game is surprisingly good.
  
  "As heroes go he's quite a pick
  He cannot walk Sir, no not a lick
  And running? Methinks a simple stick
  Could run faster than 
 poor ol' Wik"- An excerpt from the game box.
  
  Now at first, the game seems rather simplistic and childish. But after you start playing and passing 
 a few levels you learn that there is a LOT more to the controls than point and click. You have 
 to get a real feel for the physics and it takes a little practice, but once you learn it; it becomes 
 second nature. You maneuver around single-screen levels by jumping and swinging by Wik's tongue. 
 All the while you are following a creature called a Slothom. You must catch grubs with your tongue 
 and spit them to the Slothom, all while the Slothom is slowly treading across the level (once he 
 leaves the screen your time is up) . Sound easy, but it gets more difficult once bugs are threatening 
 to take the grubs, as well as threatening to take Wik's life. Then more and more level hazards 
 appear and time gets lower, you find yourself frantically hopping around, swinging, and licking; 
 just trying to get the grubs to the Slothom. Immense fun and extremely addictive.
  
  There are 2 play modes: Story mode, and Challenge mode. Both are challenging.
  
  Story mode 
 consists of unraveling the story of Wik and his past; as well as the world around him. It explains 
 why you're going around collecting grubs and gems. And the levels get progressively harder as you 
 go, and yet; progressively easier as you go back to find the gems you missed.
  
  In challenge mode you don't have to worry about the number of lives you have (infinite tries) ; 
 although it does keep track of deaths on each level. 
  
  The music in Wik and the Fable of Souls is very good, high repeat value and mellow. The sound effects 
 are good as well, though a little familiar. 
  
  Graphics of Wik are very good, it doesn't require a high-end computer to run at full graphics; 
 and it runs smooth as glass. 
  
  Overall, This is an excellent puzzle game that is definitely recommended if you crave a good challenge.

Review:  Even though it does't have multiplayer but for the price u can't beat it. Its really usefull if 
 u have alot of stress. Very easy to use controles and graphics arn't bad. I Really like the beginning 
 song its Amazing. If you have or dont have xbox 360 buy it its alot cheaper then the xbox version 
 ($60) so try this game. The downside is that u can't get it to match 1024X768 Resolution other 
 than that there is no problem every one that i told said they loved it and the toad thing named 
 wik does BackFlips lol yeah he does backflips its pretty cool but it will last you some time

Review:  You're Wik. You're a freak. You look kinda like Gollum from "The Lord of the Rings". You're a forest 
 creature. You have a story. You have a tongue, and you're not afraid to use it in any imaginable 
 way possible.
  
  This platform arcade game us uber-fun due to its innovative gameplay. Did you ever used the rope 
 in Worms Armageddon? Yes? Was it fun? :D. Here it gets much better - you have a permanent "rope" 
 - your tongue, which you can use to grab and spit bugs, climb to seemingly inaccesible places, 
 grab unto surfaces, swing around, shoot down other creatures, etc. And of course, you can jump. 
 Using this combo: jump + tongue, you can do pretty amazing acrobatic feats. 
  
  The controls are also amazingly simple - you can play it using only your mouse to aim, button 1 
 to extend tongue/retract tongue/shoot contents of mouth (imagine that :) towards cursor position, 
 button 2 to jump towards cursor position. 
  
  The music is OK, creates a fantasy/mystery atmosphere, it's a bit repetitive but without beeing 
 annoying.
  Graphics are ok, nothing too fancy, enough to make your game pleasurable.
  
  Behind it's simple control scheme, this game has much complexity to offer, so if you didn't tried 
 it before, you should wait no longer.
  
  Oh, yeah - it can get quite difficult later on, but there's a trainer available somewhere on the 
 net.

Review:  If you don't play platform games much, just give this game a try it will blow your mind. I've just 
 got my copy un few month ago and it's one of the rare games that I still play. 
  
  This game is intelligent, inovative and relaxing. You will love the loke of the game. Easy to lurn 
 but hard to master. Just collect all the jewels and/or peace and finish the level. Sounds easy 
 enought but it's not. 
  
  The music is a kind of electronic new age, but you won't have to turn off the volume after un couple 
 of hours like so many othe games.
  
  The replay value is good, youwill want to replay some levels that you've finish just to master 
 the game.
