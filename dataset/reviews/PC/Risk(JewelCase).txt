The best computerized version of Risk yet. 

 Several computerized versions of the classic world-domination game have appeared over the years. 
 Many have been fun - the ancient Macintosh version immediately springs to mind - but most have 
 convoluted the simple strategy of the original, ostensibly to make the game more "sophisticated." 
 Hasbro's newest computerized Risk succeeds where many others have failed, with a picture-perfect 
 translation of the board game featuring complex AI, a simple interface, and numerous user-controlled 
 options that make the game as simple, or as complex, as you wish.  

 The reason this nuevo-Risk has an edge on its predecessors is that the basic game follows the exact 
 structure of the original. You begin with an allotted number of troops, choose your territories, 
 and get to warrin'. During battle sequences, as you try to conquer adjacent territories, the die 
 rolls are shown - so there's no more taking the computer's word for the outcome. This seemingly 
 minuscule addition makes battles much more exciting, with massive forces often being cut down within 
 a few rolls.   

 As for the options, well, there's plenty of 'em. With the classic game, you can set any number of 
 parameters, such as the rewards for turning in cards you receive when you successfully conquer 
 a territory and the number and difficulty of the computer opponents. You can also play something 
 dubbed "Blind Risk," in which you can't see the activities or troops in any territories but those 
 immediately adjacent to your own. For those looking for something a little beyond the basic board 
 game, Hasbro has created "Ultimate Risk," adding some tactical elements to the basic game. During 
 a bout of Ultimate Risk, you must choose formations for your troops, deal with weather conditions, 
 form alliances and hope to overcome the enemy not only through luck and sheer force, but also through 
 strategy.   

 The game also features excellent multiplayer options, including modem, local-area network, and Internet 
 play, so you can act out your Napoleonic fantasies at will. This is, quite simply, the best computerized 
 version of Risk yet.

Review:  This game does what a pc version of risk should do -- turn the game into something resembling more 
 of actual warfare. With personified generals and battle plans to boot, this game turns this into 
 a truer version of Napoleonic warfare and no dice. However, the visuals could certainly vary more, 
 rather than recycling the same few sequences. It's tiring to see your men get killed, and kill, 
 in virtually the same manner every fight. Also, the realism of the game should extend to the visuals. 
 A correct likeness of the number of troops and cannon in each territory and battles should also 
 be present. Although the dice factor is left out, a certain amount randomness remains; one battle 
 plan does not always defeat a certain other battle plan. Ultimately, this version is inventive 
 and yet more true to the actual time period. It would be great to see an updated verion released.

Review:  Risk the board game is a great, but long game. Its transfer to the computer is excellent. The classic 
 game is the same as the board game, but you don't need five other people with you to play it. Good 
 animation when in huge battles leaves you in suspense as you watch your soldiers fall down. Other 
 than the classic game, there is another form of the game where the number of soldiers is multiplied. 
 This form of the game allows you to have Generals and Forts to protect your territories. The Generals 
 allow your army to have many different tactical formations to choose from, which gives your army 
 an advantage over other armies. This game is a great old game that deserves to be remembered.

Review:  This specific Risk game proclaims to give the player the Risk a facsimile of the board game. Fortunately, 
 they have produced the Classic version very well but there own creation has few problems.
  The Ultimate Risk game completely changes the format of the original board game, except the idea 
 of battalions on territories and the same general map of the world, with addition of small islands. 
 In Ultimate Risk, the game adds the new facets of generals and forts, even adding capitals to the 
 mix (although its superfluous unless you play in Capital Domination) . Even though with all these 
 interesting new things, the ultimate risk falls flat. The construct of the whole game comes down 
 to the division of Risks classic lands into smaller ones and adding more land here and there. 
 In addition, generals can now be placed on to territories, which in effect increases the tactics 
 and probability of victory in battles. Also forts allow for greater probability of an area to successfully 
 defend themselves from a superior force. All that said, Ultimate Risk seems like an exciting and 
 interesting new version of Risk. The truth of the matter is the game goes too far to even the odds 
 between the player and the opponent.
  Ultimate Risk, tries to keep the odds equal with the opponents but in effect it tries too hard 
 and eliminates the user slowly. One of the tools used to even the odds is Random events. These 
 can range to weather, rebel uprisings, and diseases, eliminating any number of battalions on any 
 territories of any player. And when you lose all the battalions in an area there is rebel takeover 
 of the area. However, these random events hardly seem to affect your computer opponents. They happen 
 to each player but the computer always takes enough to give you an uprising in your area (the computer 
 loses all but one almost 99% of the time in their areas) . Troop placements in effect, useless, 
 since the computer chooses anywhere where near the areas you placed most of your troops, nullifying 
 any specific strategy you had. Battle strategy, seemingly suggests strategy in battle, but most 
 of the time you are repelled on attacks, even with a great strategy. Advancement on forts is lopsided; 
 computer takes at most two turns to take your forts, while you with a greatly superior force can 
 take nearly 6 turns. But taking this course of action drains all your forces in other areas leaving 
 you with few territories after your opponent comes from behind (their fort is usually destroyed 
 by the time you take it) . And if you believe, I made these conjectures on one play through, you 
 might like to know I played it for 4 or 5 times, with the same result.
  In summation, the Classic Risk game is fine though dice rolls can seem weighted toward bounded 
 numbers. The game loses most of its credit through Ultimate Risk. Ultimate Risk can quickly frustrate 
 and can give the player the notion its completely pointless to continue soon in the game. So kudos 
 for the classic Risk transfer but bitter scolding for the Ultimate Risk.
