:::Review:::
Before you think that this is an entirely bad game, let me be the first to inform you that it does 
 have its strong points. 

 Subject for debate: Just as all those ultraviolent car shooters like Interstate '76 and Carmageddon 
 hit the streets, the discussion of that latest of 21st Century syndromes, "road rage", has become, 
 well, all the rage. It's open season on America's freeways with computer games bringing the biggest 
 keg to the party. Coincidence, or something a bit more insidious?  

 To add jet fuel to the flames comes the sequel to the semisuccessful PlayStation console car killer, 
 a game that'll encourage living out real-world violent tendencies more towards the game's designers 
 than towards the jerk who just cut you off (right before he gave you the finger) .  

 As far as plot goes, this title prefers to take the Seinfeld approach to story development and be 
 pretty much about nothing, save the fact that essentially it's kill or be killed, which has always 
 been my personal favorite. In the original PSX game, the venue for your carnage took place in LA. 
 You and several other contestants were confined to a futuristic arena where the sole goal was to 
 take out every other vehicle with your own armed-to-the-teeth motorized machine of mayhem. It was 
 victory through attrition; the last one standing was crowned the winner and promised glory, riches, 
 a T3 connection, and whatever else his heart could possibly desire.   

 But the times, they are a-changin', and where once there stood a proud City of Angels, there stands 
 only a rotting corpse of a metropolis (yes, I know, not much has changed since 1998, but I digress) . 
 The duel-to-the-death contest has gone global, taking you to such international hot spots as Paris, 
 Hong Kong, and an abandoned Soviet missile silo.   

 After choosing one of 12 deviant cars, you drive it from your raised chase-car perspective through 
 mostly uninspired arenas, picking up health, napalm, and other assorted weapons of mass destruction 
 in hopes of being the last one standing. Racing around the area, you try to pick off the other 
 contestants before they take you out of the game. As a nice little sadistic sidelight: Scattered 
 throughout are the poorly rendered unprotected groupie, skateboarder, and other assorted out-of-place 
 pedestrians that you can run over (well you don't really run them over, it's more like you push 
 them for a few hundred feet before they disappear from the screen) .   

 But before you think that this is an entirely bad game, let me be the first to inform you that it 
 does have its strong points. For those equipped with a 3Dfx card, this game is monumentally better 
 than its PlayStation sibling, with realistic flames and translucent smoke. However, even on the 
 highest resolution, there just aren't enough interesting things to look at (and what is there isn't 
 all that impressive) to make you boot it up to show off your computer's processing power to your 
 friends.   

 Gameplay isn't too shabby. It can be quite entertaining living out your road rage vicariously through 
 this title, blasting baddies before they blast you. The excellent, hard-driving sound track makes 
 the gameplay even that much more intense. However, controlling your automotive arsenal is as infuriating 
 as being stuck behind a senior citizen going 35 in a 55 with his blinker on. You'd think you were 
 turning mammoth 18-wheeler trucks as opposed to hot rods, considering how unwieldy these things 
 are.   

 But where this game really shines is not in single player, but when you go head-to-head with your 
 friends, the way wanton slaughter was intended to be carried out. Here, the game actually becomes 
 more than a distracting diversion and almost approaches being moderately entertaining, at least 
 for the first hour. Like I alluded to earlier, the arenas are a bit on the uninspired side and 
 tend to be pretty monotonous after awhile.  

 Call me spoiled, but after playing so many really good action shooters like Quake II, Jedi Knight, 
 Duke Nukem, or even Carmageddon, games like this aren't nearly as entertaining as they may have 
 been just a few years back. While at times an engaging ride, especially in multiplayer mode, this 
 game just doesn't have the horsepower to keep up with the best.

Review:  i didn't play this game since 6,7 years ago but, i still can remember it caompletely, with our standards 
 now imean when you play dirt or other great car games.. this game has not anything to say but, it 
 has somthing more, fun, i propise even now if you play and a new car game after a few hours.. it's 
 twisted metal 2 that you still wanna play, storyline is good for this kind of game, graphics are 
 good for 97 ,game facilities for enjoying are great! and that's the point! very nice pursuits, car 
 handling, guns, fun environments plus this that you can still other players cars if you like them.
 
  get a little repetitive for some peoples standards after few hours but not mine.
  and mys last words is that even you are not a fan of this genre, even your system is updated that 
 you can play new games with those high graohics.. play it.

Review:  Man when this game first came out i was completely hooked! Even though i didn't have the best PC 
 at the time it still ran really well on the meduim resolution settings.
  
  Gameplay:
  Sometimes the car doesnt want todo what you think its going todo and driving in reverse was a challenge... I 
 love the maps!!! they were definately one of the best parts of the game with lots of secrets and 
 interactive environments. Weapons were decent good selection.
  
  Sound:
  Not so good but back then that didn't really matter anyways!
  
  Overall:
  If you can find 
 it for free i would probably not play it again as its very old school and there has got tobe over 
 6 over TM games after this title... But the maps are just amazing!!! For its time it was really 
 a good game.

Review:  This game is completley retro and its incredibly cool and fun to play. i wased pretty much from 
 ages 8-11 playing this game even though i had gotten way newer ones but this game just screams 
 cool and fun too. the graphics were kick ass at the time although they look dated as hell now. 
 using the giant guy stuck on wheels is just to fun or driving around in a cop in paris while driving 
 up a destroyed eifeil tower then flying across rooftops to other oppoents. The loads of other oppoent 
 cars make the levels alot more fun to play with and if you couod imagine playing it online would 
 have been soo much fun but i never did. 
  
  im really glad i still have a copy of this game and i play it every once and a while and its still 
 just as fun as it ever was which its strange that its still kept all of its coolness seince 1997. 
 this game is about as good as you get when it comes to car combat. either with a friend or by yourself 
 its still fun as hell. using the F1 car ontop of a giant iceicle while doing a whirlwind attack 
 and blowing them off the edge while the level cracks and breaks around you
  
  fun just so much joy from this gme!

Review:  This is indeed the best game of the Twisted Metal series. The graphics are pretty good, but the 
 best thing about this game is the gameplay. You can blow a lot of things up like and each character 
 has there own unique special and story. There are a lot of characters to choose from like Axel, 
 Sweet Tooth, Twister and a whole lot more. The environments are huge and nicely well done. Twisted 
 Metal fans, look no further this is the game for you!!! 
  
  If you're still reading this, you aren' doing yourself a good favor... Go and buy this game! NOW!!

Review:  What a rare treasure Twisted Metal 2 PC. This game was supposed to be released with the PSX version, 
 but was released a year later by sony with no publicity what so ever. Now the game is extremely 
 rare, and chances are the only place you'll find it is ebay.
  
  TM2PC plays just like the PSX version. You pick a car and take it through all of the levels to 
 try and win your wish. The controlls are convinient and easy to learn. The best part is by far 
 the multiplayer. While I've never played the 2 player mode, I've heard that it's alot of fun. What 
 I have played is the 1 player game, and it is alot of fun. It never gets repetitive thanks to the 
 cool level design and number of enemies you have to fught at once.
  
  The graphics are deffinately a step down from the PSX version. While everything is clear and easy 
 to see, the game has a very slow frame rate. Even though every thing is slow, it doesn't take away 
 from the fun of the game.
  
  The sound however is just as good. Each of the special weapons has a distinct sound, and the background 
 music sounds just as good.
  
  TM2PC isn't quite as good as the playstation version, but it's still alot of fun. If you can find 
 a copy of it I suggest that you get it.
