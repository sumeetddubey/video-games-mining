Yoot Tower - billed as the sequel to SimTower - is actually no more than a rehash. 

 Yoot Tower - billed as the sequel to SimTower - is actually no more than a rehash. As in SimTower, 
 you play the role of a building developer. You begin with a piece of land and several million dollars, 
 and your goal is to develop your tower into a five-star building.   

 The generic city of its predecessor is replaced with three scenarios. You have the choice to build 
 your tower in Tokyo, Waikiki, or Kegon Falls. Each scenario requires different strategies for you 
 to succeed. Tokyo requires you to build office space to generate more money and people, while in 
 Waikiki you need hotel rooms and shopping to succeed. All the scenarios share several facilities, 
 such as restaurants and shops. Many of the facilities from SimTower have returned unchanged, like 
 offices, hotel rooms, security stations, and medical centers. Yoot Tower augments the standard 
 facilities with "plug-ins," facilities that are unique to each scenario. Waikiki, for example, 
 has ship docks, whereas Kegon Falls has a Shinto shrine. Although these plug-ins are supposed to 
 allow for new scenarios, there is no way to create your own. Updates are only available through 
 the Yoot Tower web site.  

 Gameplay has changed very little from SimTower. The basic premise of the game is to build the best 
 skyscraper and keep your tenants happy. To build the best skyscraper you need more tenants to move 
 in, or you need to make VIP guests happy. In order to keep your tenants and attract more, you need 
 to design an efficient transportation system. These are the elevators, escalators, and stairs. 
 You need to have enough elevators spread throughout the building, because if tenants have to walk 
 too far to their destinations, they'll complain. If you can satisfy your tenants and VIPs, you 
 will be awarded extra stars and new facilities.  

 Two areas where gameplay has changed from SimTower are in elevator control and the role of stores 
 and restaurants. In SimTower, much of the gameplay concentrated on controlling the elevator schedules. 
 You would have to tweak the elevators to move people efficiently. This has been replaced with a 
 simplified system; you only control which floors the elevator stops on. In SimTower, restaurants 
 and stores were rented out to tenants, and you could only control the rent. Now, you are the owner 
 of each store, and rent and pricing cannot be controlled. Any loss or gain at that store is reflected 
 in your daily balance. The advantage of being the owner is that you have greater control over what 
 kind of stores are in your building. The disadvantage is less realism.  

 Graphics and sound are similar to SimTower. Tenants and guests are tiny shadows, and shops look 
 just as tiny and pixilated as in SimTower. There is now an external view available, which lets 
 you see how your building looks from the outside. The image is very pixilated, but at least you 
 can see how weather influences your building. One would hope that with all the improvements in 
 graphics technology, Yoot Tower would look a bit more advanced.  

 There is so little change from SimTower, it is questionable why Yoot Tower was even released - especially 
 considering that the original was rather disappointing to begin with. Had the graphics been improved 
 and a scenario editor included, it might have been a decent game. The game is passable for a short 
 while, but - like its predecessor - it quickly degenerates into an elevator-building contest. Die-hard 
 SimTower fans may enjoy Yoot Tower, but only because it is the same game with a new name.

Review:  Yoot Tower is in a way a sequel to the original Sim Tower game created by Maxis. It features many 
 new innovations that the original game did not have such as advertisement boards on the outside 
 of your towers and the choice to build in many different cities with different goals. However the 
 game still feels very incomplete and even less balanced than the original game. It is still a pretty 
 solid game though, but in this day and age it does not compare as its very simplistic nature can 
 generally only appeal to a gamer for about an hour at max before it is become deleted from the 
 computer. I wouldn't recommend this game for anyone since there isn't much that this game can offer 
 in modern day.
