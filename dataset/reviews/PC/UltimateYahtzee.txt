Strictly for loners who love the original dice game. 

 Yahtzee. The name immediately brings fond memories to mind for just about everyone. It was only 
 a matter of time before this classic found its way to PC screens, and with Ultimate Yahtzee, Hasbro 
 has delivered not only the venerable dice game to gamers, but also four new variations. If you 
 like dice games, your day has come.  

 For those of you unfamiliar with Yahtzee, I recommend studying your 'human lifestyles manual' a 
 little harder, or you're sure to be detected for the extraterrestrial you are. For those who really 
 were raised in a cave, here's the rundown: Each player (two to four people are required for a game, 
 but the computer will be glad to fill in any empty spaces) rolls five dice three times in an attempt 
 to create combinations vaguely similar to those found in poker (four of a kind, straight, full 
 house, that sort of thing) . The ultimate combo is a 'Yahtzee', or all five dice the same. At the 
 end of the round, all players' scores are added up, and the player with the most points wins. Unlike 
 most board games (Monopoly, Scrabble, Clue) a whole lot of Yahtzee is based entirely on luck, a 
 fact that adds a great deal of excitement to the game while preventing veteran players from kicking 
 the crap out of newbies again and again.  

 As stated before, Ultimate Yahtzee is collection of all the wacky Yahtzee variations that were released 
 over the years. In addition to the standard or 'classic' Yahtzee, Ultimate Yahtzee also includes 
 Triple Yahtzee (about the same as playing three games of Yahtzee at once) , Pyramid Yahtzee (a four-sided 
 dice variation that's a lot quicker to play than the basic game) , Painted Yahtzee (Yahtzee with 
 colors, very addictive) and Battle Yahtzee ( you get a chance to throw your dice at your opponents' 
 combinations, guaranteed to start fights) . All of the versions have a clean (if not particularly 
 impressive) look and feel, and do an excellent job of retaining the original flavor of the game. 
 The 'virtual cup' (don't get me started on that moniker) technology - actually moving the mouse 
 around to throw the dice - is kind of cool, but it's not much more than a gimmick and eventually 
 becomes annoying. Although the dice sounds are well done, the rest of Yahtzee's fairly thin effects 
 library is easily the game's weakest attribute.  

 You might as well face it - Yahtzee is Yahtzee, and the addition of a computer screen and mouse 
 doesn't really change that. If Hasbro had shot for network or Internet play, there would be a lot 
 more to write about here, but they didn't and that creates the biggest question of all. If I have 
 gather my friends together and roll my own dice, why should I play this on a computer at all? Strictly 
 for loners who love the original dice game.

Review:  Yahtzee is a great dice game. The computer game has five nice variations. You've got the classic, 
 then Triple Yahtzee where everything is triple the fun. There is Painted Yahtzee, where colors 
 come into the game for more points and combos, and Pyramid Yahtzee where your dice are pyramids 
 and have different twists and rules. Finally, Battle Yahtzee offers competition where you can ruin 
 the other players' scores! It's five-in-one Yahtzee entertainment!
  
  It's pretty fun for the most part. It does get repetitive after a while, and it's not necessarily 
 the best way to play. But is sure is some good passing fun. The visuals are also nice, clear and 
 colorful. The SFX are also nice, and so is the music.
  
  It might not be worth everything you pay for it, but it is mostly worth what you put in. If you're 
 a fan of Yahtzee in the slightest, perhaps you'll enjoy this game. The extra modes are quite exciting 
 and are fun little twists to the plain game.
  
  Ultimate Yahtzee offers five different fun versions of the game. It truly is ultimate.
