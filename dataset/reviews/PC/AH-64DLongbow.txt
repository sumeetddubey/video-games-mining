:::Review:::
Longbow is a fabulous piece of work, full of attention to detail and countless features. No serious 
 sim fan with the right hardware should miss it. 

 After a long drought, helicopter fans have been rewarded with an embarrassment of riches, starting 
 with Digital Integration's Apache and forthcoming Hind, and continuing with Janes' Longbow. Coming 
 from Andy Hollis, the man who pioneered helicopter sims in Gunship, it should be no surprise that 
 Longbow is a winner.  

 Longbow puts the Apache attack chopper through all its paces and then some, with numerous single 
 missions, quick start custom flights, and historical missions drawn from the Gulf War and Panama, 
 as well as two full campaigns. This is cutting-edge programming, featuring gorgeous graphics, good 
 flight dynamics, a diverse mix of missions (escort, search and destroy, recon, etc.) , and plenty 
 of on-line resources (including an elaborate narrated, interactive tutorial) . Ground and air threats 
 are dynamic and fairly smart, and complaints on Usenet about targets not moving or responding correctly 
 are unfounded. Numerous difficulty toggles allow you to take on as much or little accuracy as you 
 want, with play ranging from as simple and arcade-like to as complex as it gets.   

 The difference between Apache and Longbow is the difference between the nimble featherweight and 
 the hard-punching heavyweight. Apache features cleaner, more simple graphics that get good frame 
 rates on mid-level systems, while Longbow pushes the limits, demanding beyond-state-of-the-art 
 machinery to work well. Longbow has more chrome, more flourishes (such as cut-scene animations 
 and extensive on-line resources) , while Apache offers solid head-to-head play. Both flight models 
 are good, though Apache's is more unforgiving. Longbow seems to tackle a more elaborate and complex 
 range of instrumentation, and its tutorial is second to none.  

 Longbow is hard on your system, demanding a P-133 with 90 megs free on the hard drive, oodles of 
 RAM, and a high-end graphics card for it to really work well. It is also shipped with a problem: 
 the video drivers were written to Sci-Tech's Univesa, but Sci-Tech pulled the plug and refused 
 to allow their driver to ship on the disk. Ergo, you'll have to dig up a copy of Univesa (try other 
 games like U. S. Navy Fighters, or check out our Longbow download page) , or it just won't work right. 
 This has caused massive problems for many.  

 People with less than a hot rod system will miss a lot of Longbow's virtues, and head-to-head fans 
 will be disappointed with its lack of modem features. Regardless, it's a fabulous piece of work, 
 full of attention to detail and countless features. No serious sim fan with the right hardware 
 should miss it.

Review:  As a helicopter simulator, this has to be one of the best ever made. Even though graphics are decent, 
 the realism is awesome. Just learning how to fly a helicopter is so much different and difficult 
 than flying an airplane. Then flying while trying to kill and not get killed took even longer.
 
  I played this game using the standard keyboard and mouse. I am sure with proper joysticks, the 
 experience would more enjoyable. One of the features I love the most about this game is one of 
 the multi player options where one player is the pilot and the other is the gunner. In some missions 
 you need the extra pair or hands and eyes.
  Sure there are newer helicopter games out there but most of them arcade like shooters. This game 
 is a classic and a standard

Review:  this might not be the first game you will buy when you're in the shop but it deserves more credit. 
 its a great simulator game that emulates te real flying experience in a apache longbow. it's hard 
 to learn the game because of the overkill of controls. the game comes with a think manual and a 
 keyboard layout for better understanding of the controls. but the best way to learn how to flight 
 is by the game itself. it has a very good tutorial part witch wil explain al the features and controls.
 
  
  the game can be very realistic when you play it in hard mode and be very playable in the more ezy 
 modes. this gives casual games as well as hardcore gamers there own experience. this is i think 
 one of the powers of the game. the game is a real simulator, that means there has gone a lot of 
 work in the handling of the chopper. the adds to the gaming experience to a almost realistic game. 
 in my opinion the army can probably use this game a training simulator for there pilots. but that 
 aside it's still a nice game. the missions are nice and vary from desert storm missions to jungle 
 missions. one thing i do miss is the use of trees for cover. the game is old and has good graphics 
 for the time. but in a remake the graphics could be a lot better with more detail.
  
  there are some drawbacks in the game. i nowadays need an emulator to play the game because the 
 game is based on MS DOS. the game is a good foundation for a second release that features better 
 support and better graphics.
  
  but for now! good game and good fun. have a nice flight :-)

Review:  Gameplay:
  By far the best simulator game I have ever played. Im so disappointed that this wont work on 
 newer computers. It requires MSDOS to run. The helicopter responds great and you can tweak its 
 difficulty to your liking. The weapons are good too, and it is easy to reload and refuel just fly 
 back to your base and land and your set to go back out and cause more damage. Its fun trying to 
 earn new medals and the missions are always fun and exciting.
  
  Graphics:
  I dont they could have done a much better job here, the only thing that lacks is the terrain and 
 solders, the soldiers are actually 2D and look really badly. The terrain is really bland but this 
 doesnt take away from the gamplay because there are plenty of hills. The chopper looks great and 
 so do the explosions. The gun fire looks good too. All the vehicles look good and so do the buildings. 
 And the main menu is a nice touch too, I like the way it is set up.
  
  Sound:
  The sound is good for the most part, it could have been tweaked more thought. All you really ever 
 hear is your engine and your gunfire. It gets old after a while.
  
  Summary:
  Definitely worth the money if it will work on your machine. If you took the time to read this then 
 I say go out and get it now. This game is great.
