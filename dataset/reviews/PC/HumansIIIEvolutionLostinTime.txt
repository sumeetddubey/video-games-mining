:::Review:::
Not only does Humans III have remarkably dated graphics, annoying sound, and inept gameplay, it 
 is also as boring as a sack of sticks. 

 It's not that often that a game of this caliber gets installed on my computer. Not only does Humans 
 III have remarkably dated graphics, annoying sound, and inept gameplay, it is also as boring as 
 a sack of sticks.  

 The story in Humans III revolves around a dumpy little cave dweller named Arthur. It seems that 
 Arthur bopped an alien zoo keeper over the head with his club and took control of its time-traveling 
 spaceship. Arthur, not the smartest of fellas, broke the time machine into six pieces with his 
 blunt instrument of destruction. Now, with the help of some famous historical and legendary figures 
 (Merlin, Confucius, etc.) who have also been kidnapped, Arthur must retrieve the six pieces so 
 he can return to his time.  

 Humans III, like its predecessors, is a puzzle game in the vein of Lemmings. Using the characters' 
 special abilities (magic, archery, etc.) , you must navigate each level and get everyone to the 
 exit, collecting pieces of the time machine along the way.   

 Unfortunately, the wearisome interface makes Humans III nearly unplayable. It's difficult to gain 
 control of each character and, because you can't see the entire level while you're playing, even 
 after you do gain control it is completely exhausting trying to get your character to go where 
 you want.   

 If this weren't bad enough, the graphics add the adjectives dark, simple, and uninspired to the 
 list describing this game. You'll wonder why you spent $3,000 on a computer to display graphics 
 that would have been considered bad in 1983. The music ranges from pooty syth-pop to pooty synth-calypso, 
 and sound effects are nearly non-existent (which, judging by the high set of standards found in 
 the rest of the title, may be a good thing) . The only thing less fun than Humans III is a broken 
 seesaw, and maybe Catfight.  

 I was also amazed by the lack of information on the Web about Humans III. I couldn't find anything 
 about it on Gametek's Web site... and it's pretty scary when the developer doesn't even acknowledge 
 a game's existence. Plus, I have yet to actually see this game on any store shelves, so don't be 
 surprised if you never even see Humans III. In the end, that may be best for everyone involved.
