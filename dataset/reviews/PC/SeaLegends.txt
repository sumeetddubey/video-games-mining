:::Review:::
Ocean of America's Sea Legends has painstakingly reproduced almost all the elements that made Pirates! 
 so popular, and injected just enough new material to qualify it as a unique experience. 

 Microprose Software's Pirates! is unquestionably one of the greatest games in the history of PC 
 gaming. Its unique blend of action, strategy, and economic empire-building endeared it to the hearts 
 of thousands of gamers in the late 1980s. Adhering to the golden rule if it ain't broke, 
 don't fix it, Ocean of America's Sea Legends has painstakingly reproduced almost all the 
 elements that made Pirates! so popular, and injected just enough new material to qualify it as 
 a unique experience.   

 For those unfamiliar with Pirates!, would-be buccaneers must learn the arts of swordsmanship, warfare, 
 and trading to survive the cutthroat waters of the Caribbean Sea. Starting with a small ship and 
 a few stalwart men, gamers attempt to amass a fortune through a combination of trade, bounty hunting, 
 and outright thievery on the high seas. Once a mighty fleet has been amassed, gamers can even attempt 
 to capture entire colonies in their quest for fame and fortune.  

 Sea Legends takes the action/strategy gameplay of Pirates! a step further by introducing a new elementa 
 scripted role-playing adventure replete with damsels in distress and traitorous governors. While 
 players have the option of totally disregarding the plot that unfolds around them, the entertaining 
 storyline inserts a bit of intrigue and order to an otherwise unstructured game.   

 Since Sea Legends is a game about piracy and war on the high seas, the excellent ship-to-ship combat 
 engine deserves special mention. While Pirates! relied on a simplified overhead representation 
 of combat, Sea Legends has opted for a first person, 3-D approach. Using the same voxel space technology 
 found in games like Comanche, Sea Legends has managed to reproduce the look and feel of 17th century 
 sea warfare. The attention to detail is impressive, to say the leastdecks pitch and sway, 
 cannonballs whiz past your head, and lightning flashes through the sky. In this chaotic environment, 
 players must navigate the ship, aim and fire the cannons, and issue commands to other ships in 
 the fleet. To call the combat in Sea Legends exciting would be a gross understatement.  

 My only major gripe with the game lies in the documentationor rather, the lack of it. The 
 instruction book is hardly more than a pamphlet, and it omits information that is vital 
 to successful completion of the game (such as staying in Taverns to replenish hit points) .   

 
 In conclusion, Sea Legends takes all the elements that made Pirates! a classic, and adds a healthy 
 dose of action and intrigue to make a great game even better. When you consider the street price 
 of just $39.99, you owe it to yourself to get this game!

Review:  I remember this being one of the first games I ever played, and quite possibly one of the games 
 that got me into PC gaming. There's so much freedom to do what you want instead of what the game 
 wants you to do. You can go out sailing and just kill pirates the whole time if you like, and completely 
 skip the story.
  
  As most games of its kind, you start out as a lowly captain trying to earn a reputation and become 
 rich and powerful. You'll fight pirates and steal ships, visit different islands to hire men and 
 buy supplies as well as new ships, duel enemy captains, find intrigue in greedy mayors, play around 
 with the mayor's daughter, everything that makes that time so interesting!
  
  The game can be a little complex and requires a bit of learning to be able to play profeciently, 
 but it's well worth the time. You'll be fighting ships in full 3D, having to steer your ship, aim 
 and fire your cannons, as well as give orders to your other ships. This can lead to quite a few 
 hectic times in Sea Legends but there's nothing like seeing the rewards after a hard fought victory!
 
  
  Sea Legends is a great followup to Sid Mier's Pirates and paves the way for games such as Pirates 
 of the Carribean. The main storyline can be quite interesting, if you choose to follow it, but 
 the beauty of the game is that you don't. You can take a break at any time just to travel around 
 the sea looking for pirates to fight and what have you. An excellent game that I still sometimes 
 install just to see it again!
