:::Review:::
Its lame minigames, lack of varied speech, and generally slow pace make for short-lived fun at best. 
 

 The Luv Shack is a little old place where we can get together. Now that the token B-52s reference 
 is out of the way, South Park: Chef's Luv Shack is essentially You Don't Know Jack about South 
 Park, with the addition of some old arcade games disguised as South Park-themed minigames. The 
 result is a trivia game that can be amusing sometimes, but its lame minigames, lack of varied speech, 
 and generally slow pace make for short-lived fun at best.  

 Luv Shack is set up like a gameshow hosted by everyone's favorite chef, Chef. Chef offers you a 
 choice of three trivia categories at a time. The categories manage to be pretty funny and include 
 topics like "Sucks or Canadian," "Giant Japanese Monster Bad," and "The 1991 Denver Broncos." The 
 questions are occasionally funny; for instance, "The rock band Loverboy: Sucks or Canadian?" The 
 correct answer is both, of course. But after two or three days of casual play, you'll start to 
 see some questions repeated. Speaking of repetition, the game's speech gets old pretty fast. It 
 uses all the real voices from the show, but there isn't enough variation. The game's intro is the 
 same every time, the announcer says the same things, and so on. A few different intros and an assortment 
 of quick jokes would have gone a long way toward lending the game more variety. In addition, although 
 the loading times are relatively brief in Chef's Luv Shack, they're long enough to really break 
 up what should be a fast-paced game. Having to wait between questions and minigame rounds has a 
 noticeably detrimental effect on the overall flow of the game.  

 The minigames themselves are very basic. Some take on elements of classic arcade games like Asteroids, 
 Warlords, Super Sprint, Tapper, and Kickman. Others just force you to pound buttons, so dig out 
 that old keyboard that's been collecting dust in your closet or you'll find yourself pounding your 
 good V key until it disintegrates. After you see each of the minigames even once, you'll probably 
 wish there were a way to disable them altogether. The game's warped sense of humor and the trivia 
 questions themselves are the main attractions, whereas the minigames really take away from the 
 game's overall quality. Visually, the game looks just as you would expect it to look. The simple 
 style of the South Park characters is well represented, and the animation also closely mirrors 
 the show, even in the minigame rounds.  

 Fans of South Park who also happen to like trivia games would be better off keeping their two passions 
 separate than indulging in Chef's Luv Shack. The game just isn't anywhere near as good as You Don't 
 Know Jack; the questions are only funny the first two times you hear them, the minigames are completely 
 uninteresting, and the repetitive speech is a real drag.

Review:  If you havent bought this game yet, don't. its completely worthless. if you have. Sorry about that, 
 there is room still in the boat with me if you want.
  
  The questions, are stupid, rarely do they hve anything to do with the show at all. The minigames, 
 some are fun, but mostly they are just anouying. Especially the can drink one, that one just sucks. 
 and the one where u try and put out the fire with water balloons, I suck at that one. Thankfully 
 the AI is actually pretty good. But you almost certainly need a friend to crowed your keyboard 
 to play this game properly. Don't ever be cartman, because you'll never get points for the easy 
 probe game.
  
  THe voice overs were decent, and they do seem to have plenty of speeches that you will gradually 
 hear through the course of the game. But for the most part, its only funny the first time you hear 
 it. Eventually (if your keen enough, which is unlikely if you bought this game) you will figure 
 out that you have heard every bit of voice there is in the game.
  
  And to the person that bought this for me as a gift
  I ask you
  
  WHY??????
  
  Don't 
 get this game, its worthless.

Review:  I feel like revewing and old game so here I go. I am a south park fan and this was a good idea 
 but of course they didn't do it right. They have fun mini games but Mario party is just a WAY better 
 version of this and of course you would exspect a game on the PC game to look a little better than 
 it's N64 counter-part. This game does look like the show and that is it. The question part of the 
 game was just stupid. I mean I don't play a south park game to get questions about Nebraska or 
 T. V dinners. Give me some trivia from the show. If you are looking for a fun exsperience this game 
 isn't it but if you are looking for a game that captures the look of the show than I guess I can 
 go out on a limb and reccomend it.
