:::Review:::
Time Twister is modeled on the same formula as its predecessor and is just as disappointing. 
 

  Chris Sawyer's RollerCoaster Tycoon phenomenon is stuck at the top of the Ferris wheel. RollerCoaster 
 Tycoon 2 was a disappointing repeat of the first game, last spring's Wacky Worlds expansion was 
 lambasted by critics and fans for offering just a few new themes and scenarios, and the latest 
 add-on is equally uninspired. Time Twister is modeled on the same formula as its predecessor and 
 is just as disappointing.  

          Crashed flying saucers and animatronic aliens are hallmarks of the new Future theme.   
   

  Although the Time Twister title refers to the expansion pack's historical themes, it could just 
 as easily be referring to last May. Gamers who played Wacky Worlds back then might feel like they've 
 entered a time warp here, because the gameplay and few meager additions mirror those highlighted 
 six months ago. In many ways, they're even more of a letdown now, because one had to hope that 
 publisher Atari had learned its lesson from the criticisms that the prior release took in the spring. 

  What Frontier Developments has created here is best suited for scenario modders seeking new scenery 
 for their home-brewed works. The heart of Time Twister is six new themes that represent different 
 historical eras, so if nothing else, there is a lot of new stuff to look at. Prehistoric lets you 
 play with giant cavemen and woolly-mammoth-tusk fences. Dark Age boasts new stone walls, which 
 look a lot like the old stone walls, and decorations such as animatronic knights in full armor. 
 Mythological has Roman temples and cheesy animatronic skeleton armies straight out of a Harryhausen 
 movie. Roaring Twenties comes with a big menu of urban wall tiles, like red brick, along with animatronic 
 gangsters and statues of period automobiles. Future features crashed flying saucer displays and 
 alien buildings. And Rock 'n' Roll is sort of a catchall representing the '50s and '60s, including 
 such things as B-movie giant spiders and animatronic go-go dancers.  

  Most of the new scenery looks pretty good. There are some nice touches here that make the themes 
 fairly distinct. Future does an especially good job of giving RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 a face-lift, 
 due to its lit-up walkways, take-me-to-your-leader alien statues, giant robots that sit atop the 
 park entrance and exit, and  Blade Runner -style video signage. Still, most of the themes rely 
 heavily on old ideas (how many wall tilesets does one game need?) and are far too dependent on 
 animatronic statues to produce their new looks. It's nice that you can put a distinct touch on 
 a Roaring Twenties park with gangster and cop statues, but it often seems like statue type is all 
 that separates the scenarios from one another. Gangsters, Medusas, aliens, rock guitarists -- they 
 all seem to blend together after you've played through a few scenarios.  

  A big reason for this is the absence of new rides. As with the scenery, rides in Time Twister are 
 just subtle variations on the old ones seen in both RollerCoaster Tycoon and RollerCoaster Tycoon 
 2, slightly adjusted for the historical themes. So you get Fighting Knights and Triceratops dodgem 
 cars, Dinosaur Egg and Tommy-Gun teacup rides, Moon Juice and Neptune's Seafood concession stands, 
 Gangster Car and Hover Bike Ride coasters, and so on. Frontier Developments hasn't added anything 
 the least bit innovative to the list of available rides, so don't get your hopes up if you're tired 
 of the old standards.  

  At this point, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the 14 scenarios are also minor variations 
 on rather tired ideas. In Cliffside Castle, you have to attract 1,500 guests and keep your park 
 rating above 700. In Future World, you have to build a park worth $300,000 by the end of your fifth 
 year. In Prison Island, you have to build 10 roller coasters with an average excitement value of 
 6.00. In Rock 'n' Roll, you have to repay a loan and build a park worth $265,000. And so on. It's 
 all been done before.  

          'New' attractions, such as the Dinosaur Egg Cup, are little more than variations on old 
 ideas like the Tea-Cup ride.     

  The only thing separating the new scenarios from their many predecessors in RollerCoaster Tycoon 
 2 and Wacky Worlds is size. Most of the maps here are huge, with lots of open spaces giving you 
 room to experiment with ride placement and coaster design. Woodstock, for instance, starts as a 
 massive empty field, Cliffside Castle dwarfs somewhat similar predecessors like Crazy Castle, Skyscrapers 
 lets you take over roughly four city blocks, and Cradle of Civilization gives you a Greek island 
 with huge amphitheaters. This at least gives many of the scenarios a different feel from their 
 predecessors and frees you up to try different approaches if you play them more than once.  

  This one positive doesn't compensate for the fact that Time Twister is yet another rehashing 
 of the same old formula that Chris Sawyer and Atari have been milking since 1998. There's something 
 to be said for sticking to what's tried and true, especially when you have millions of fans, but 
 there also comes a point when you run out of gas and have to try something new.

Review:  If your a fan of the original game this sequel offers even more parks/missions and even more sim 
 items/coasters to fill that addictive need. The graphics are the same as they were in the original 
 as is the sound.. but what this game gives is even more gameplay, more sim building.. and even 
 more addictive fun for the entire family.
  
  Gameplay: is exactly like the original game and will not deter newcomers. As such the game plays 
 very well and without errors. Value: endless play possibilities limited only to your imagination 
 with the ability to terraform land and build your own coasters.
  
  I give this game a solid 9 for being a superb game with great great replay value. Something that 
 means you will spend less money on shallow non-replayable games.
  
  The added bonus of this pack is with even more possible sim development. The challenge level has 
 increased as well as the overall fun.
  
  The expansion of both add even more endless play and gives the user more options in which to increase 
 their imaginative powers.
  
  A must have pack!
  
  Time Twister may not give THAT much more possibilities but it is extremely welcome to a game that 
 offers endless enjoyment.

Review:  I can play this game for day's its just cool, and I think its really good that all the rollercoaster 
 games keep on moving whit there time , and thats something really hard to do!
  I still think that its better to just go on whit the more 3d versions of rollercoaster.
  Like 
 they done wisely whit RC 3, and I think that there are more options.
  
  Because there are more things to build, and more freedom in the game , but its looks just A little 
 bit like rollercoaster tycoon 1.
  But now they are heading to A really good way
  
  On the other side, there aren't a lot cheats for it, what makes it a little bit boring when you 
 are done with the normal campaign.
  
  Good Game;)

Review:  The 2nd expansion of RCT2 is not exactly good but not bad either. Its underapreciated due to the 
 graphics. i myself would rather have a game with S****y graphics and perfect gameplay that a game 
 with great graphics and S****y gameplay. The new Scenarios are very clever and fun to play. the "new 
 rides" arent new but a cool new theme to it. you can still import classic coasters and tracks from 
 the original rct so im happy there. Also it doesnt take up much space. If you love the series but 
 cant buy RCT3 buy this too keep you busy. You will love it as soon as the main screen comes up

Review:  Yeh, i got Tycoona while ago and loved it. Its the total package. Nothing can even come close to 
 it. Taht and with blahis the bestestest game evars.
  
  Alot of people whine at Tycoon for bein short, but i thought it was just right, about 15 hours 
 of play time. The ending was to easy though, could of been longer and maybe an actualy boss would 
 of been nice, but otherwise it was perfect and fun..
  
  Looo ooooo ooooo ooooo oooo ooooo oooo oooo oooo oooo ooo ooo oooooo ooooooooo oooo oooooo ooo
