 Raven Software's MageSlayer is a homage to top-down action games, specifically Atari's Gauntlet. 
 In "single slayer" mode you assume the role of one of four assassins, attempting to prevent Lore 
 Thanes from ruining your plans to attend the college or university of your choice. To accomplish 
 this, your MageSlayer hacks and spell-casts through five stages of maze-like levels, each with 
 its own set of monsters. Hackneyed plot aside, MageSlayer is a glowing, well-rendered, well-planned, 
 and well-implemented trounce through dungeons, sewers, rivers of death, lava pits, and monster 
 rooms. The gratuitous gore will leave parental advisory groups nonplussed, as dungeons are ripe 
 with carrion and replete with blood. Bodies fly apart in full 3Dfx or vanilla display, walking 
 on or shooting dead flesh makes squishy sounds, and in some rooms off-screen light sources cast 
 shadows - gross distortions of monsters over the character. The game is just plain scary.   

 The conceptual inventiveness is the strong point of the game. Character classes are dark extensions 
 of fantasy archetypes, whose abilities cohere to the game's morally ambiguous theme. Nowhere is 
 light versus dark or good versus evil mentioned as a motivation; instead, inquisitors take the 
 place of clerics and archdemons of warriors in an attempt to prevent one bad apple of a mage from 
 ruling all. The monsters and bosses are of a more standard ilk (giant spiders, rats, a frost giant, 
 and so forth) but even the lowliest of worms and small rats will unexpectedly bite a character 
 from behind, forcing him over a precipice or into a trap. The better endowed opponents have some 
 nifty AI: Some will hide, some will bait you into an ambush or trap, most will attempt to flank 
 when attacking in numbers, and spell casters will fight behind their melee counterparts for their 
 own defense, creating a challenging combat system.   

 MageSlayer contains a few specific references to its obvious inspiration, Gauntlet. Many of the 
 levels have monster generators, which characters must destroy, else be destroyed. There's a secret 
 level called Run the Gauntlet. There's even a magic gold skull that transforms the finder into 
 Death from Gauntlet incarnate. Sure, lots of games have an item that gives you some form of limited 
 invincibility, but none are this fun. Better still is the way Raven has tied the locations of the 
 various magic items to riddles embedded in the titles of certain levels.   

 The game lacks the variety of tricks, traps, and monsters needed to put it over the top. Each level 
 has four or five monster types, but they attack much like the monsters from previous levels, only 
 wearing different costumes. You'll soon find yourself wishing a more diverse crowd were pursuing 
 you. That's not to say that the more difficult of the three levels of play aren't challenging, 
 they are. But they failed to get me in the gut. The subdued soundtrack, infrequent lockups, and 
 frustrating Direct X 5 installation subtract from the otherwise superior coding of the game's engine. 
 But fans of Gauntlet will find it a blast, especially with its excellent multiplayer options.
