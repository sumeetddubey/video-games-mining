:::Review:::
From the exceptional graphics to the innovative driving model, Grand Prix II sets new standards 
 in almost every category. 

 Almost a year after MicroProse posted the first tantalizing screen shots, Grand Prix II has finally 
 arrived - and it turns out that it was worth the wait. From the exceptional graphics to the innovative 
 driving model, Grand Prix II sets new standards in almost every category.   

 Until now, racing games on the PC have come in two distinct flavors: arcade-style racers that provide 
 a quick dose of adrenaline, and serious racing simulations that provide a deeper (though less exciting) 
 experience. Grand Prix II shatters these traditional barriers by providing seven adjustable driving 
 aids that affect the difficulty and the complexity of gameplay. These aids range from the 
 traditional automatic transmission to more exotic aids like braking assistance and automatic steering. 
 The result is that Grand Prix II performs like an arcade racer when all the driving aids are switched 
 on, and a deadly serious simulation when switched off.   

 For those that dare to opt for the full realism, Grand Prix II contains a driving model so complex 
 that it would make the folks at Papyrus blush. Not only are the cars quick and nimble, but Grand 
 Prix II is the first racing game to accurately simulate motion in all three axes. In other words, 
 if you hit a bump at 200mph, you literally become airborne! This not only makes the cars handle 
 more realistically, but crashes now take on a whole new dimension as you twist and gyrate through 
 the air. To complement the excellent physical model, MicroProse has included a fully functioning 
 garage and 16 painstakingly reproduced tracks. These features all add up to make Grand Prix II 
 one of the most realistic racing simulations on the market today.  

 Whether you opt for arcade or simulation-style play, Grand Prix II manages to deliver plenty of 
 racing thrills. While other simulations have managed to reproduce almost every minute detail of 
 auto racing, Grand Prix II is the first to actually reproduce the excitement of the most dangerous 
 sport on the planet. In other words, this game is both realistic AND fun to play. It is this factor, 
 above all others, that makes Grand Prix II shine so brightly.  

 To enhance the spectacular gameplay, Grand Prix II sports some of the finest graphics yet seen on 
 a PC. In fact, the 640x480 mode comes very close to being photo-realistic. While these 
 graphics are beautiful to behold, owners of anything less than a Pentium 133 may find the frame 
 rate a bit low for their tastes. Fortunately, the low-resolution mode runs fast and furious on 
 my P90, and - unlike many dual-resolution games - the cars and tracks are clearly discernible from 
 the background. Believe me, this is of extreme importance when heading for a hairpin turn at 200mph! 

 In conclusion, Grand Prix II from MicroProse is unquestionably the best racing game yet made for 
 the PC, and a strong contender for game of the year! Whether you're a fan of arcade-style racers 
 or full-blown simulations, Grand Prix II is certain to please.

Review:  I first played F1GP2 on my first Pentium CPU. A 75 Mhz with 1 MB graphics. This game blew me away. 
 The graphics and sound were amazing, but the driving was even better.
  
  The game was very easy to begin, with auto brakes and shifting and ideal line display and many 
 other help tools. The better I got, the better the game was. All I had to do was turn off those 
 tools and upgrade my competition. After a while I saw how the car could be made faster and started 
 to use car setup. After a month I was competing with my friends for the fastest lap on the Monza 
 course. And I won. 
  
  The core of the game of the game was it's Season. Racing on all current tracks for either a full 
 race or shorter. I would play every Sunday after the F1 race was over on TV.
  
  The thing that made this game last were the fans. You can still find tons of updates and mods and 
 tracks and other tools for the game on the Internet. There was even a season 2004 package somewhere.
 
  
  I played this game from time to time for about five years and in all that time it never got old. 
 I tried it again last month and the graphics are still pretty good, the sound is almost up to date, 
 but most important of all, I have never played a racing game that could equal the driving and realism 
 and the fun of F1GP2.

Review:  When i bought this game, it did not seem that great. But after years of playing this game it came 
 to me: This is the F1 racer ever! I have never seen any game with that many different customizing 
 choices. Shure, it is a little primitive but, it rocks. This is really realistic though it is very 
 very hard. The fact is, when you are actually playing whitout any driving aids, it is really hard. 
 Also, it is about the only game that you can actually do every practice on the days before the 
 race and the qualifying sessions. In the end there is really not much to say about a game that 
 is really this good. But since you will need to get windows 95 and a ebay ticket to be able to 
 play it, it is very, very worth it!!!!! Trust me.

Review:  This game definately redefines the limits of what is considered as a pure racing game. The design 
 and the realism behind hte game is all just too much to describe in just simple terms. Unlike traditional 
 racing games where you select a car and just go straight into the race this game offers you many 
 different options that you can select for your vehicles. Each of these options make your experience 
 with the vehicle more realistic or they make it more fictional. For example there are automatic 
 transmission systems which can be switched over to manual. There are also other things such as 
 automatic steering and braking assistance which all can be turned off so the game would be a real 
 life like simulation of real F1 Racing. The effects of what happens after every crash are much 
 more realistic in this game than in many of the other fictional games where you can just keep going, 
 even after you've hit a corner at speeds up to an excess of 150 miles per hour. Overall I would 
 definately recommend this game for the PC, especially since its graphics requirements aren't all 
 that high anymore.
