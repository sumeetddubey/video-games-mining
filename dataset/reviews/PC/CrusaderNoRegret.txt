:::Review:::
Everything that was good about the first game is great in the second. 

 There's no point in opening here with a witty anecdote or high-brow setup: Crusader: No Regret is 
 simply the best action/adventure game in its class. A sequel to its equally impressive predecessor, 
 Crusader: No Remorse, No Regret is a game that is at once gorgeous and gruesome in its execution 
 and attention to detail. The game's sci-fi storyline picks up where the original left off: Having 
 destroyed The World Economic Consortium (W. E. C.) 's Vigilance Platform, you, the Silencer, wind 
 up aboard a salvage ship en route to the W. E. C.'s moon-based Lunar Mining Cartel. Once again, it's 
 time for some serious breaking, entering, and assassinating. While some of the original's 15 levels 
 meandered on perhaps a bit too long, No Regret cuts the game down to 10 levels that are more complex 
 and challenging to work your way though (yet which Origin says should take as long to complete) . 

 Everything that was good about the first game is great in the second. Crusader: No Regret's top-down, 
 three-quarter perspective graphics run smoother than before, particularly when things blow up. 
 Like real flames, No Regret's explosions flare bright and change color, then eventually fade - 
 without distorting or slowing down whatever other animations are happening on the screen at the 
 same time. As the returned Silencer, you move more convincingly - especially while running, which 
 in the original sometimes felt jerky. Your weapons arsenal has been improved, with several new, 
 highly evolved firearms and explosives to put to no-good use. Two notable additions are the "Crystalizer," 
 which freezes your unlucky target into an ice statue that, when hit with a bullet, bursts into 
 a hundred twinkling, resonating bits; and the "Broiler," whose microwave pulse liquefies the flesh 
 of any hapless souls it encounters. Talk about agonizing deaths. Victims caught aflame take their 
 last failing breaths and flailing steps with arms a-wheeling, windpipes uttering hoarsely their 
 unrestrained agony. Without a doubt, Crusader: No Regret's savage last hurrahs are the most horrific 
 and drawn-out demises ever to unfold on a computer screen.  

 All of this breathtakingly morbid attention to detail would be merely gratuitous if the game lacked 
 its own redeeming value - and values, for as the Silencer, it is your job to overthrow a government 
 bent on controlling and exploiting its underclass. Clever plot twists advance the game forward 
 like a suspense film. For instance, one level finds you hacking into a not-so-secure computer to 
 upload a virulent code that brings down the level's security system. Video cut scenes play between 
 levels to update you on what the other side thinks of, and is doing to contend with, your revolutionary 
 ways (however, the caliber of acting here barely rises above the daytime soap level) . Settings 
 range from the heavily guarded and staffed laboratories and staging areas that made up so much 
 of the first game, to new, sumptuously appointed executive suites occupied by unarmed business-suited 
 men and women who, the moment you storm in on them, throw up their hands and cry "Don't shoot." 
 As the Silencer, your hardest rule is take no prisoners, and these personnel, like their protectors, 
 must be eliminated - quickly, decisively, and, most important of all, before they can alert others 
 to your arrival.  

 In the end, what makes Crusader: No Regret a winning a game is its ability to utterly move you out 
 of your own headspace and into the Silencer's. For the few hours a day that you let yourself escape 
 into it, your vocation as the Silencer becomes a high-minded obsession, a fervent crusade, a battle 
 of wits and reflexes that takes an ample measure of control to not only command, but also to walk 
 away from, back into your own life, with no regret.

Review:  Crusader is one of those games which make you feel that you used the time machine to go back to 
 1995 and play it again.
  
  The graphics at that time were so real. Of all the games i have played so far this was the scariest 
 of them all. Robots would appear from no where. You basically a robot have to eliminate the other 
 robots.
  
  The best thing is apart from you main character you get to control some other robots as well. I 
 especially loved the machine gun robots. Also the explosions the cold freezing were so realistic 
 and scary that i dreaded even doing those moves.
  
  The guns and weapons are not so many but the traps and other things are well executed.
  
  The 
 AI for that time was very good and the game overall is a very difficult game atleast for me. Not 
 The Best Game but will be one that will remind me of my early gaming days.

Review:  No Regrets with this game. This game is loads of fun. It's a violent, heavy assault, isometric 
 experience, with a little bit of sneaking around thrown in.
  
  You play as a red armoured elite killer, who's out to extract some revenge. You get a wide variety 
 of weapons to go up against a plethora of enemies. This was also the first game I can remember 
 playing where you could see visible damage on everything you shot. You also came with a variety 
 of moves, which was impressive for the time. Strafing, crouching, jumping, running and rolling 
 in all directions. You felt in control of the character.
  
  The details environments and 3D characters looked great, and the live action footage for the cut 
 scenes were done quite well, considering some of the horrible acting that's gone on with these 
 type of cut scenes in the past.
  
  The game is challenging, and the action stills holds up today!

Review:  Crusader had very high production values, the story line was simply brilliant as in blended perfectly 
 with the game through cutscenes that used live actors to play as your team mates.
  
  There was a huge arsenal of weapons you could use in this game that did everything from freezing, 
 liquifying, evaporaying, flaming, melting the enemies and more. It paid to be smart in how you 
 encountered the enemies in each room as well, simply going in firing was not always the best option. 
 You also had items like land mines and trip mines and remote det. bombs that could be placed to 
 activate when required. The environment was fairly destructive as well and could be used to great 
 effect in creating chain reaction type explosions.
  
  Sound was great fitting music and sound effects and graphics were advanced beyond their years.
 
  
  I had great fun with this game.
