:::Review:::
If you want a good rhythm game, look elsewhere. And if you want  American Idol , just go watch the 
 show. 

  Codemasters' rhythm action game, based on the hit show  American Idol , attempts to combine the 
 timing-based, performance-emulating mechanics of games like PaRappa the Rapper with the pageantry 
 of entertainment mastermind Simon Cowell's feverishly popular reality TV series. Neither part is 
 really done right, resulting in a game that's built on compromise.  

           American Idol flagrantly steals its main gameplay mechanic from Gitaroo-Man.     

 
  The action in American Idol is directly derivative of mechanics found in Koei's inspired rhythm 
 action game Gitaroo-Man. However, the mechanics lifted from Gitaroo-Man represent only a portion 
 of that title's gameplay system, and they were better implemented in Gitaroo-Man as well. In American 
 Idol, you're presented with a cross in the center of the screen, while in the background your would-be 
 American Idol sings his or her cel-shaded heart out. Button commands move from the tips of the 
 cross toward the center, and the closer the command icon is to the center of the cross when you 
 press the corresponding button, the better your avatar's singing will be.  

  Or, if you screw up and your timing's off, the singing will falter. The bad singing is done well, 
 and it's apparent when you're not playing right. The gameplay is fairly simplistic and requires 
 only a single hand on the arrow keys on your keyboard, though it'll regularly throw you some curves. 
 The speed and complexity of the button commands can get pretty rough in the expert difficulty level, 
 but even then the judges are pretty forgiving, so you really have to butcher a song pretty badly 
 not to win. The game also supports a Dance Dance Revolution-style dance mat, though considering 
 the fairly extreme rarity and borderline uselessness of a PC-based dance mat, it's a pretty impractical 
 feature. American Idol's gameplay is shallow and easy, and, unfortunately, the game has little 
 to distract you from this fact.  

  The heart of American Idol is the competition mode, where you create your own American Idol contestant 
 with aspirations of being the next Kelly Clarkson or Ruben Studdard. You'll start in the audition 
 room, move to the theater, and finally end up on the American Idol stage. Despite the set changes, 
 the gameplay remains the same the entire time. So, basically, you'll perform a song, listen to 
 critiques from the judges, which regularly seem to have little bearing on your actual performance, 
 and repeat. Since you'll be on "TV," your appearance factors in to how well your performance is 
 received, so American Idol includes a little dress-up mode where you can choose a variety of different 
 outfits. You're given a rating on your apparel after finishing a song, but the actual logic behind 
 this fashion feng shui is unclear.  

  There are several other options beyond the main competition mode in American Idol, but they are 
 all pure filler. The rehearsal mode lets you try out songs without being judged. The party mode 
 lets you and some friends each take a crack at a song; then you get to judge the other players' 
 performances, which -- since the people who are singing are also doing the judging -- seems like it 
 could get really political really fast. The aptly named karaoke mode presents you with an instrumental 
 version of one of the songs, along with sing-along lyrics at the bottom of the screen. At the end 
 of the song, there's an option to "judge" the performance, after which you're dumped back to the 
 menu screen. Finally, the jukebox mode lets you listen to the game's amateur renditions of the 
 pop songs featured on the soundtrack, which seems a bit pointless. If you wanted to hear these 
 songs, wouldn't you just go listen to the originals?  

  Though, to be fair, the song selection in American Idol is the game's best asset, consisting of 
 43 pop songs that cover a surprising range. The songs, however, never stray from the kind of material 
 that you'd hear contestants on the show actually singing -- which could be good or bad, depending 
 on how you like your pop music. There are plenty of songs like "Hit Me One More Time," "Livin' 
 La Vida Loca," and similarly obvious choices that exist right alongside more interesting selections, 
 like The Commodores' "Easy," Al Green's "Let's Stay Together," and George Michael's "Fastlove." 
 Some people might be projecting their own star fantasies when they watch  American Idol , but the 
 dark, underlying appeal of this nationally televised talent show is seeing Simon Cowell rip enthusiastic -- but 
 undertalented -- aspiring performers to shreds. In this respect, the game fails pretty thoroughly. 
 The game features original voice work from  American Idol  judges Paula Abdul, Randy Jackson, and 
 Simon Cowell, but their readings are flat and apathetic, and the number of lines recorded is so 
 limited that you'll hear several of the judges' comments repeated through the course of a single 
 career game.  

           There's nothing much here for fans of rhythm games -- or American Idol for that matter. 
     

  The game definitely looks worse than it sounds. The characters, who are presented with a low-rent 
 cel-shading effect, are boxy and poorly animated. You'll rarely see a contestant doing more than 
 a little side-to-side shuffle while performing. The different environments, which look roughly 
 like the different locales used by the show (except much more simplified) , are coated in grainy 
 textures that exhibit some pretty bad color-banding. There's really not much else to say about 
 the visuals in American Idol because there's really not that much to them.  

  Though the rhythm game format seems like a natural fit for the  American Idol  property, its execution 
 betrays the concept, and the end results just don't do the show justice. Perhaps a more interesting 
 game would be an  American Idol  adventure game, where you play as Simon Cowell and have to pick 
 through dialogue trees to choose what sort of venomous remarks you'll make to the contestants. 
 If you want a good rhythm game, look elsewhere. And if you want  American Idol , just go watch 
 the show.

Review:  American Idol. I don't know why they made a game about it for PS2. Why don't people just watch 
 the show? Like they have the kareyokee thingie, but i'd rather play that then this piece of crap. 
 I think Red Steel was bad, but that is better then this thing. Like honestly, if you want to be 
 on the show virtualy, grow up. When your old enough, see if you can acually get on the show. I 
 thought that this game might be fun to try out. The first day i went with my cousin to rent this 
 thing, we thought it might be fun to try out. So we played it, then we returned it after 25 minutes 
 'cause his house was pretty far away.

Review:  This is the most horrible game to ever come out. I only saw the videos and man does it suck. The 
 judges are way to nice and never rip on you, HECK, they arn't even the voices by the real judges. 
 They don't even have their cup of Coco Cola ethier. The games even to generic to actually display 
 the audience. Everything is fakish. Graphics look like dookie and the sound is fruity. If you buy 
 this game, please give me your email address so I can come and kick your a**! The GameSpot crew 
 was being extremely generous when they gave it a 4.7. They probably felt sad for the company who 
 made the game. If you have any sense of humanity, DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!! However, if you want a 
 game that will scare even your most fearsome enemies away, then you may buy this game. Personally 
 I wouldn't make my worstest enemies play this game. This game should be banned for genericness. 
 I woudln't take this game if someone offered it to me for free and held a gun to my head. In fact 
 the company who made it should be blown up. Looking for an awesome PC game get Halo or Unreal Tournament 
 2004.
