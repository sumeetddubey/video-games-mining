:::Review:::
While the unusually small levels keep the pacing of the game fairly brisk, you'll also find that 
 it takes about two hours of casual playing time to finish the entire game. 

  Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a first-person shooter that follows the same events as those of the 
 soon-to-be released animated Disney movie, and it casts you as Milo Thatch, a young adventurer 
 who's involved in a turn-of-the-century expedition to find the sunken city of Atlantis. The game 
 starts off aboard your expedition's submarine, the Ulysses, and then moves on to other key areas 
 from the film, including the underwater caverns, the bowels of a volcano, and the ruins of Atlantis 
 itself. In total, Atlantis has 22 single-player levels -- none of which will take you any longer 
 than five minutes to complete. While the unusually small levels keep the pacing of the game fairly 
 brisk, you'll also find that it takes about two hours of casual playing time to finish the entire 
 game. Unfortunately, the game has little to keep you interested once you've finished it the first 
 time.           The environments are colorful, but not very detailed.    

  It doesn't take long to complete Atlantis, nor to get frustrated with it. The game seems to assume 
 that you've already seen the movie (which is strange, considering the game was released prior to 
 the film) , since a myriad of characters -- both good and evil -- will talk to your character over his 
 radio without any prior introduction. During a particularly confusing sequence in the game, five 
 different characters will radio in to you, some of which merely chatter on nonsensically, within 
 a span of a single minute. There's also nothing to preface the situations that unfold in the game -- the 
 cutscenes in between each mission do nothing more than pan around the level you're about to enter -- and 
 as a result, the game's plot quickly becomes confusing. For example, during the first half of Atlantis, 
 you're constantly radioed hints by one of your expedition partners, but halfway through the game, 
 you supposedly meet an Atlantean girl, who then becomes your primary radio contact. However, the 
 game makes no attempt to inform you of that meeting -- in one level, she's nonexistent, and in the 
 next, she's your new partner. In light of all this, you'll quickly learn to ignore all radio messages 
 and complete each of the level's overly simply objectives on your own.   

  Despite the plot's confusing nature, Atlantis plays like a straightforward, uninspired first-person 
 shooter. You're given the option of customizing your controls, even though there's little need 
 to do anything other than shoot, move, and jump. The game has eight weapons, or more accurately, 
 "tools" that you'll find throughout the single-player campaign, although you'll rarely use anything 
 other than your primary tool, which is a slow-firing beam weapon of sorts. The first-person perspective 
 doesn't show the item you have equipped, so the only way to tell what you're actually using is 
 through Atlantis' clunky interface, which is nothing more than a toolbar located at the bottom 
 of the screen. Most of the real estate on the toolbar is taken up by two rows of 10 colored lights. 
 The top row represents your health, and the bottom is your ammo -- but neither gives an accurately 
 quantifiable indication of your reserves.   

  Atlantis has other problems. Its graphics look dated, and while some of the levels use vibrant 
 colors, for the most part all the environments are dull and muted. This is unfortunate, considering 
 the game uses the robust LithTech 3D graphics engine, which was recently featured in the impressive 
 shooter No One Lives Forever. Unlike in that game, the levels and characters in Atlantis are rendered 
 using very few polygons, and the textures throughout are small and plain. It's a shooter, but there's 
 no real violence in Atlantis -- enemies you shoot simply seem to teleport away. Atlantis almost manages 
 to capture the stylized look and feel of an animated cartoon world -- similar to that of a game like 
 Rayman 2-- but in the end, it falls short.           It won't take you long to see every corner 
 of Atlantis.    

  The game does offer a number of multiplayer modes, including "capture the crystal," but you'll 
 be hard-pressed to find any players on the scarce active servers that are actually online. For 
 what it's worth, browsing these servers is certainly easy, thanks to the game's inclusion of the 
 GameSpy program. Another redeeming aspect of Atlantis is the inclusion of vehicles that you can 
 control. There are only two levels where this is possible, but these sequences do break up the 
 otherwise monotonous gameplay of the rest of Atlantis.   

  While the fact that Disney Interactive has created a first-person shooter might seem surprising, 
 the fact that it's not very good may not be. Atlantis has most of the conventions found in a typical 
 shooter -- strafing, mouse-look, a variety of weapons, and several multiplayer options -- but its lack 
 of a coherent plot, depth of play, or even overall quality prevent it from being worthwhile.

Review:  I am a sucker for a lot of shooters, and this seemed ot offer a lot for the bargain price that 
 I picked it up for ($3) . I am a big fan of things that use the Lithtech engine from Monolith, as 
 I checked my "You get what you pay for" at the door and dived in. I had earlier tried the demo, 
 and that was passable, but I only had about 10 minutes to go over it.
  
  When I installed the full product, I again played the demo.... And found out it was about 11 minutes 
 long! That's the first sign the product was bad! This ratio definitely applies to the whole product.
 
  
  The general feel is one that insulates the player from the realities of "fighting" one's way along 
 in hostile environments. Rather the bad guys "de-rez" similarly to the guys in TRON. Colors are 
 bright, and the puzzles are engaging, but it's obvious that many areas were artificially shortened 
 in order to get this thing out the door. What makes it really funny is that some areas are unusually 
 long and tortured, making a very imbalanced play experience.
  
  Tasks are different and interesting, so that's a plus. Control is good, and the environments are 
 varied. 
  
  The most painful edit is the game's completion. It's all rush-rush to stave off a big problem, 
 and as soon as the task is completed, you are shown a segment from the movie and it is over. No 
 closing or end humor as in the movie at all. It just ENDS. Very unsatisfying.
  
  Even for $3 the thing shows a lot of inconsistency and I cannot recommend this to anyone.
