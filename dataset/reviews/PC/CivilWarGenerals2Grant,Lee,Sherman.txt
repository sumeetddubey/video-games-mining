:::Review:::
When it gets to the actual gameplay, Civil War Generals 2 is practically identical to Robert E. 
 Lee: Civil War General. 

 There is nothing terribly spectacular about Civil War Generals 2, the latest wargame from Impressions 
 and Sierra. It doesn't offer eye-popping graphics or any true innovations in gameplay. This is 
 simply a solid, enjoyable, and challenging turn-based wargame set in the Civil War.  

 Unlike its predecessor, Robert E. Lee: Civil War General, CWG2 lets you play either side of the 
 conflict. You also have the option of fighting in the Eastern or Western theaters, through 46 historical 
 scenarios covering such engagements as Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, Vicksburg, and Chickamauga. 
 The game includes a whopping 17 campaigns - including one very impressive option to play out the 
 entire war in both theaters. A vast throng of alternative scenarios is also included, and these 
 come into play during campaigns whenever you change the course of history. All totaled, CWG2 packs 
 in over 200 predesigned scenarios - surely enough to keep most Civil War buffs happy (or at least 
 busy) for a long, long time. But if that isn't enough, you can whip up a few of your own with the 
 game's editor. This fairly intuitive tool lets you customize existing scenarios and even sculpt 
 an entire battlefield from scratch, placing all troops, terrain, and resupply points. When it gets 
 to the actual gameplay, CWG2 is practically identical to Robert E. Lee: Civil War General. Game 
 maps are set up on a hex grid, with decent terrain art and less-than-spectacular unit art. Actually, 
 the unit art could stand some serious improvement. For one thing, I can't figure why the developers 
 didn't take the time to include mirror images of each unit, so that they could at least change 
 their facing from left to right (and vice versa) . Many times, Union and Confederate forces meet 
 on the field of battle with their backs turned.  

 The AI ranges from decent to devious and can be quite challenging on the hardest level. The game's 
 victory conditions, however, are problematic. One scenario I played (Murfreesboro) was designed 
 to run 81 turns. Even though I managed to drive the entire Confederate force into a general retreat 
 by turn 20, and had occupied all of the objectives and all three enemy resupply points, the scenario 
 kept going until I obliterated every single Confederate unit (turn 44) . Not only was this frustrating, 
 but it was sort of disturbing, too (being forced to slaughter routed troops can be rather distasteful) . 
 A "declare victory" feature, a la Sid Meier's Gettysburg!, would be a huge improvement here. Also, 
 the game ran slowly in spots. This is particularly noticeable whenever the AI move is being calculated, 
 but also pops up between scenarios, as the computer tries to figure out which way the campaign 
 should branch.  

 Still, CWG2 can be a lot of fun. Some features, including the detailed battle summaries and hospital 
 reports, are very well done. I also loved the between-battles weapon upgrades. Similar to Panzer 
 General and its many siblings, CWG2 lets you upgrade each of your troops after each battle of a 
 campaign. You can't purchase more troops, but you can load up on Napoleons and Parrott guns.  

 
 Even though the initial release of CWG2 was plagued by bugs and crashes, the 1.0.1 patch seems 
 to fix these problems. After I applied the patch, the game behaved itself and was stable in both 
 single- and multiplayer modes. Multiplayer CWG2 is available for two players over modem, serial, 
 and IPX links. Internet support for the game is available on Sierra's free online gaming server 
 (SIGS) . Also, you can do it the old-fashioned way via hot-seat and play-by-e-mail games.  

 The final word on Civil War Generals 2? If you're a wargame or Civil War enthusiast looking for 
 an extensive list of scenarios to keep you occupied for a while, this is definitely the game for 
 you. The full war campaign alone makes this game worth trying. Just don't expect to be floored: 
 It's a good game, but not a great one.

Review:  Civil War Generals 2 is a turn-based strategy game about the Civil War. Lets be realistic. The 
 first one was really not a lot of fun because the campaign was only for the Confederates. But in 
 this one, there are more than 10 campaigns for you to play as either the Union or the Confederates. 
 The campaigns are broken down into different battles. In between them you can buy your troops better 
 weapons so they fight better. Instead of squares for the grid it is made up of hexagons which gives 
 you more strategic options. There are many unit types available. The 4 main ones are infantry, 
 cavalry, and artillery. Others that are not used as much but are still there are ships and fortress 
 artillery. If you don't really want to play the entire campaign you can fight any battle by itself. 
 Just like other strategy games there are different terrains that affect your troops movement, defense 
 rating etc. Graphics are ok now but back then awesome. If you still have an old computer this game 
 will work on I recommend this as a great strategy game.

Review:  Civil War Generals 2 is an entertaining game that is not without its faults. I first picked up 
 this game in a bargain bin eight years ago, and find it an amusing excursion that is far from perfect. 
 Firstly, the graphics are very underwhelming. Whle hex-based strategy games aren't exactly known 
 for their stunning visuals, this game still comes up short. The Union and Confederate units are 
 identical in their formations regardless of which direction the enemy is facing. It must take great 
 courage to stand with your entire brigade's back to the enemy. Additionally, the armies themselves 
 are virtually the same, just with different colors to denote Rebel of Yankee. Still, the environments 
 are decent, with enough variety that you won't be mistaking a stream for a river or a stone wall 
 for Gettysburg's Devil's Den.
  The sound is similarly dull. The annoying renditions of Civil-War era music grate on one's ears 
 and the sound effects are repetitive. Even so, they serve their respective purposes (just be ready 
 with that mute button) .
  The gameplay, the most important factor in such a strategy title, is full of options. Taking into 
 consideration several aspects of your units' well-being, such as organization, health, and morale, 
 you must decide whether to rest, dig fortifications, resupply, withdraw, attack, or charge. You 
 must also decide what the correct action may be in the given context: do you bombard the advancing 
 infantry with artillery, giving your stragglers time to get away, or feint with your cavarly, forcing 
 the enemy to change formation repeatedly to avoid a slaughter? The depth is not astronomical, but 
 it does lend itself well to the strategy, as you soon find the your units' morale may be the deciding 
 factor of the battle, and even the war.
  Civil War Generals 2 is certainly not perfect, but it may be the game that I've assigned the lowest 
 score to while still genuinely enjoying it. If you are an afficianado of Civil War history, you 
 could do worse.

Review:  Its a good game but I got overloaded with all the campaigns. One thing I really liked was that 
 I can make my own battles in this game. Its fun to create an Army and appointing all of my friends 
 to be my generals. The each side takes turns thing gets old. There is so much more to this game 
 but there is not a whole lot to talk about. Um... I don't know I haven't played this game in a 
 long time, but maybe if I play it again I'll have a more positive out look on it. My Civil War 
 Generals series started to collect dust when I purchased Sid Meier's Gettysburg and Sid Meier's 
 Antientam. Over all good game, but a little disappointing.

Review:  This game has it all, as far as content and gameplay are concerned. Going from battle to battle, 
 with your victories and defeats altering the situation, you command a force of Billy Yanks or Johnny 
 Rebs on a hex-map turn-based stratey war game. You move the units, give the orders, signal the 
 attacks, call the retreats. The battle is yours to win or lose. Casualty report screens, and a 
 good musical score make this one great game. Also, this game has one of the best scenario builders 
 that I have ever seen. The battles you create are as good in quality that the developers have, 
 and the situation is entirely yours to create. All around one of my favorites. A sequal needs to 
 be made and soon.
