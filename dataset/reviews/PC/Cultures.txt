:::Review:::
There's a lot of gameplay in Cultures, but it's mainly because the designers keep forcing you to 
 do the same thing over and over. 

  Cultures is the North American release of last year's game of the same name, which was published 
 in Europe around Christmas. Created by German development house Funatics, it's a perfect example 
 of the kind of slow-paced city-building game that tends to be quite popular in Europe but never 
 seems to catch on in the States. Judging from the gameplay in Cultures, it's clear why such games 
 aren't popular here.           The gameplay in Cultures is slow, familiar, and formulaic.    

 
 The campaign's story follows the voyage of a group of Vikings from a village in Greenland who are 
 seeking the remains of a meteor -- described as the "six pieces of the sun" -- that has fallen to Earth. 
 Each mission sees them travel farther in their quest across the campaign map, where they will encounter 
 Eskimos, Indians, and other natives of Greenland. Unfortunately, the story tends to get lost in 
 the general sense of repetition found in the gameplay, so there isn't the sense of an epic, continuous 
 campaign.   

  Cultures follows in the well-worn footsteps of games such as The Settlers and 1602 A. D. by creating 
 a game universe that seems to exist as much for its own sake as for the sake of the game. In fact, 
 a reasonable description of Cultures is to call it a cross between The Sims and 1602 A. D., with 
 the latter game's glacial pace. Cultures includes elements such as trade and combat, but the need 
 to pay attention to tiny details and the fact that it can take an hour of play just to construct 
 a basic settlement means that you have to be engaged by the world itself or you'll quickly become 
 bored. Unfortunately, even the stand-alone scenarios that begin with a built-up town (of which 
 there are several) still don't have much to recommend them.   

  Like many other games of its type, Cultures is based on producing food and raw materials to expand 
 your settlement and increase its population. You assign your Vikings to build various structures, 
 and once these structures are built you assign workers to man them. The more a Viking performs 
 a particular task, the better he becomes at it, until he earns a "diploma" and becomes certified 
 in that skill. The skill tree requires expertise in one skill before progressing to the next: To 
 become a miller, for instance, a Viking must first become a master farmer. The linear building 
 dependencies mirror this scheme, and through this gradual advancement you'll eventually have temples, 
 weapons makers, carpenters, and all sorts of other buildings and artisans. Despite the storyline, 
 the actual gameplay doesn't do much to evoke the feeling of a Viking saga and actually seems fairly 
 bland.   

  The game is similar to The Sims in that each Viking has a name and varying needs for things like 
 food, sleep, entertainment, and religion. If your Vikings aren't assigned to a specific house, 
 they'll sleep on the ground, which makes them less efficient. Likewise, homeless Vikings will scavenge 
 for food when they get hungry, so it's much more efficient to have them get married and live in 
 a dwelling, where their wives will fix them lunch (seriously) . Unfortunately, making housing assignments 
 and ensuring that your Vikings have had enough sleep is about as interesting as the decisions get. 
           There's a good in-game help system, but it doesn't solve Cultures' problems.    

 There's a lot of gameplay in Cultures, but it's mainly because the designers keep forcing you to 
 do the same thing over and over. Completing the entire campaign as well as the stand-alone scenarios 
 may take a lot of time, but long before you get there, the gameplay will have become excruciatingly 
 repetitive. Each of the 13 campaign scenarios requires you to build up your settlement essentially 
 from scratch, so you can look forward to building the same huntsman's tent, woodcutter's shed, 
 farms, and other basic structures time and time again. You'll also spend a lot of time performing 
 other mundane tasks, like arranging marriages between your Vikings and instructing them to have 
 children. When you send scouts or soldiers on long journeys, you have to specifically instruct 
 them to eat, or they will starve. Despite having to do so much micromanagement, you'll still feel 
 like the game drags along because it'll take you so much time to make any progress. Even the simplest 
 scenarios can easily take several hours if you get sidetracked, and the advanced scenarios are 
 much, much longer.   

  The lack of variation and seemingly interminable build times suggest that you're supposed to become 
 attached to the Vikings and their little world, but there really isn't much to become attached 
 to. The mediocre graphics, repetitive soundtrack, and clumsy interface do little to remedy this 
 problem. Cultures suffers from a lack of personality because it feels like an amalgam of other 
 games in this genre rather than a distinct design. If you're interested in city-building games, 
 there are far better ones available that are more worthwhile.

Review:  The good: Vikings. Able to change the vikings' jobs, and make the women get married and have kids. 
 They look funny as fighters.
  
  The bad: Graphics were out of date at that time.
  
  Now I will be reviewing that viking real time strategy game called Cultures. This game is where 
 you control a group of vikings. It provides excellent humour, and very creative. 
  
  One of the main features in this game is what they say when you click exit, like yes I must. My 
 house is one fire, or stuff like that. Also, there is free will, and one of my favourite, you can 
 add attributes to your fellow vikings.
  
  One of the things that makes the game great is the variety of resources. You can have shoes, furniture, 
 and all of the necessities as well. I'm sorry, but I must stop writing this review. Anyway, this 
 game is a great game. When you see it on the shelves, get it. You might not get another chance.
