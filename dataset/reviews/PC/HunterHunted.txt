:::Review:::
Hunter Hunted is a level-hopping step in the right direction... 

 Part of Sierra's newly-hyped and irritatingly mysterious "k. a. a." (Kill All Aliens? Kick Ass Action? 
 Knights Against Assexuals? Know Another Acronym?) line, Hunter Hunted is a one- or two-player side-scrolling 
 action game which pits Jake, a muscle-shirt-and-blue-jeans human street fighter who might have 
 stepped from the grooves of a Bruce Springsteen record (except for the guns) , against a large and 
 unpleasant creature of vaguely minotauroid appearance and mien (except for the guns) . Those ever-reliable 
 Bad Old Aliens have captured these two combatants and put them into a dark, industrial warren of 
 tunnels and platforms for the purposes of entertainment. The two SGI-rendered, motion-capture combatants 
 pursue each other around and through crumbling halls, pits, traps, and automated defenses, starting 
 the game unarmed and eventually locating whips, guns, rocket launchers, ammo, and other resources 
 in their search-and-destroy competition.  

 Every year or two, a game comes out which turns a particular genre on its ear, inspiring us to think 
 in new directions. Hunter Hunted is not that game, but there is a simple, brutal, no-BS quality 
 to your objective: Go find the other guy and plaster him on as many walls as you can as the discarded 
 mortal coils accumulate in the hallways (and to hell with the Princess and her freakin' Power Stars) . 
 This is, for all practical purposes, another side-scrolling action game of almost stunning normality 
 (albeit with good looks and terrific sound effects) , with one tiny catch which may be the game's 
 saving grace: The action goes into the screen as well. When Jake or the Hunter reaches a 2-D door 
 set into one of the many side-plan levels of the game, a stroke of the up arrow sends the character 
 running asses-and-elbows into the screen, "away" from the player, into the next lateral level of 
 arena, allowing players to sneak up on their opponents from slightly unexpected directions (including 
 from above or below) . It can be a godsend when you're diddling around at half-health with some 
 little girlie-gun and, meanwhile, your opponent has taken to priority-mailing love taps to you 
 via Bazooka Express ("When it absolutely, positively has to blow some poor schmuck into little 
 gobbets") . Certain other special doors which require keys or other objects/actions to open them 
 are presented edge-on to the viewer in a kind of cutaway view.   

 Sierra sales slicks on Hunter Hunted make much of the SGI-rendered characters and motion-capture 
 movement, but the plain fact is that nothing here looks any more fluid or especially "realistic" 
 than the simple sprite animation in, say, Lode Runner - so this is no bad thing. The gameplay is 
 straightforward and violent enough; the tight graphics of the characters, the flying shell casings 
 as players unload into their onscreen enemies, and the crispness and power of the sound effects 
 remind one of the sheer joy of gunfire in Out of This World or Flashback, which are fine steps 
 to follow in. Also, the soundtrack, ranging from screechy metal tunes to clashing industrial bangers, 
 suits the action well. The two-player split-screen mode is no more nor less annoying than most 
 split-screen game situations, and you do, at least, have the ability to delve horizontally into 
 the world and attempt to sneak up on your opponent from behind, above or below. Hunter Hunted is 
 a level-hopping step in the right direction... but only a small, tentative step (as opposed to the 
 line-crossing stomp of, say, Abuse) . There is reason for hope if Sierra's new, edgier title division 
 Keeps Applying Attitude.

Review:  The side-scrolling genre was a great genre, but since time time and new genres have come along, 
 it is pretty much dead. Even at the time of Hunter Hunted's release, it was starting to become 
 much rarer than other genres.
  
  Its been a long time since I've last played this game, so the story is hard for me to remember. 
 It takes place in the future, and Earth has been invaded by aliens, and five billion people were 
 killed in a matter of days. You play as two people, the Hunter, Garathe Den, a minotar beast and 
 the Hunted, a human named Jake. Garathe Den is faster and can jump higher, while Jake has a better 
 selection of weapons. You play in the ruins of your homes, and try to survive. You have to fight 
 many things, like floating mines, laser turrets, chameleons, bruiser (large robots) and Death (fiery 
 demons) . There are a lot of levels to battle your way through. Its a surprisingly difficult game, 
 and it should keep you occupied for a while.
  
  You can play single player, or you can play with one other person. You can fight each other in 
 a selection of levels, and having either Jake or Garathe Den to be. You can also play co-op, which 
 is very fun (the level called Death's Army is easily the funnest level in the co-op mode, maybe 
 even the game) .
  
  The graphics and sound are old, but aren't too shabby. The backgrounds look pretty good, and the 
 characters don't look too bad as well. There isn't a large variety of sound, but despite having 
 not played this game in about four or five years, I still remember a lot of the sounds, from the 
 humming of objects, to the firing of lasers, the grunting of Jake and Den, the jumping of Bruiser 
 and the spawning of Death, the sounds are great.
  
  Hunter Hunted isn't a game that you can play as a "main game". It's more of a game that you play 
 when you don't feel like playing anything else, but it still does give you time to burn off. Despite 
 that, it will be hard to get bored of Hunter Hunted.
