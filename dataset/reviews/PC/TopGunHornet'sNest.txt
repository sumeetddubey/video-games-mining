:::Review:::
Top Gun: Hornet's Nest has little to recommend it, other than some original (if wacky) mission scenarios. 
 

 MicroProse has a license to kill. In this case, that license is the rights to Top Gun, the cheesy 
 but enjoyable Tom Cruise aerial celluloid romp from the '80s. A few years back, the company's Top 
 Gun: Fire at Will provided an entertaining flight experience for beginner and casual sim pilots. 
 But the sequel, Top Gun: Hornet's Nest, is a mistargeted, ill-designed mess that's too tough for 
 beginners, too silly for experts, and more an exercise in frustration than in fun.  

 The setup of the game is only tenuously related to the film, or to the previous Top Gun sim, for 
 that matter. Your character is called Maverick, and each campaign is introduced by a video of actor 
 James Tolkan, reprising his role as Hondo, Mav's commander. The resemblence ends here. Your backseater 
 is gone - you now fly solo in an F/A-18 Hornet, rather than an F-14 Tomcat. And while Top Gun's 
 plot wasn't exactly out of the Navy yearbook, this game's campaigns have far more in common with 
 the corniest of James Bond films than with the Tom Cruise movie.  

 Not that that's a bad thing in itself. In fact, when taking on mad Russian general Martikov in the 
 Siberian campaign, I got a kick when the game shifted from taking out regular ground targets to 
 destroying secret weapons of mass destruction that were threatening to fire a huge electrical pulse 
 with the potential to wipe out entire cities. Unfortunately, although the missions were certainly 
 unique in nature, they went from challenging to frustrating. In the first mission of the second 
 campaign, set in Iraq, you task is to take out a series of radar-jamming stations. Sounds interesting 
 enough, but you have to take out nine stations, each of which requires two missile hits to be destroyed. 
 In addition, the skies are swarming with enemy aircraft, which you must take out with heat-seeking 
 missiles since your radar is jammed. And you really should eliminate some of the SAM sites around 
 your target. By the time I completed this mission, I'd felled 12 enemy planes and destroyed 20 
 ground targets. Good thing the gun is overpowered.  

 With those odds, I don't think you need to feel as if you're cheating if you choose the unlimited 
 ammo option. On those missions where you have wingmen to help you, they're more often than not 
 cannon fodder, if they don't die a prescripted death or fly into the ground. On top of all this, 
 many missions have time limits.  

 Luckily, your plane is better armed than the typical F/A-18 Hornet. In addition to realistic ordnance 
 such as Sidewinder and AMRAAM missiles, there are also some fictional armaments, which can be carried 
 in greater quantities or which have particularly strong effects. My favorite is the Starflower, 
 essentially an aerial cluster bomb that can take out a group of targets flying close together. 

 The Maverick air-to-ground missile modeling is particularly frustrating. It will only lock onto 
 vehicles, not the buildings or structures you often have to destroy. You can fire missiles at buildings 
 by bore-sighting them - aiming your plane directly at the target. But if you've previously locked 
 onto a vehicle, your valuable Maverick will go careening offscreen to blow it up instead.  

 The sim offers three perspectives on the action: a cockpit view with instrument panel, a full-screen 
 HUD (heads-up display) view, and an external view from behind your plane. You'll probably spend 
 most of your time in HUD view, since the instrument panel blocks the bomb-targeting indicator on 
 the HUD.  

 The sim's fatal flaw, however, is the flight model, which will please no one. This F/A-18 turns 
 more like a B-52 than a fighter jet - changing directions takes forever. It makes you wonder what 
 Zipper Interactive was thinking when it tuned the plane's handling. While the game's missions, 
 weapons, and storylines are clearly targeted at action gamers, the plane is so unresponsive that 
 it's more difficult to fly successfully than Falcon 4.0's F-16.  

 There are some good points. The game's graphics and sounds are top-notch. The graphics engine, which 
 will also be seen in MechWarrior III, is very fast, allowing smooth play at 1024x768 even on a 
 Matrox Marvel card, which is no 3D speed demon. Special effects are very good, although the terrain 
 itself is fairly polygonal.  

 The initial missions can be interesting, until the overwhelming odds begin to take their toll. They're 
 certainly anything but typical - what other sim lets you navigate your F/A-18 through a maze, Quake-style? 
 The configurable instant action mode is good for familiarizing yourself with your craft. Multiplayer 
 mode is dogfight-only, although team play is allowed. The game does allow you to land and rearm/refuel, 
 an important detail left out of multiplayer mode in other recent sims.   

 However, you can probably find better places to spend your multiplayer moments. Top Gun: Hornet's 
 Nest has little to recommend it, other than some original (if wacky) mission scenarios. Sim fans 
 will be put off by the bad flight modeling and unbelievable scenarios, while action gamers will 
 find the plane's sluggish handling and poorly implemented weapons an exercise in frustration. The 
 real losers are the film's fans, who will find that the only connection to the movie is a few brief 
 video appearances by Hondo. This Top Gun is a washout.
