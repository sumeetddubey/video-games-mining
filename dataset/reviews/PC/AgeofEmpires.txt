:::Review:::
This is not quite the game you hoped for. Even worse, it has some definite problems. 

 When you first play Age of Empires, a warm feeling develops in your gut. Warcraft meets Civilization! 
 Real-time empire-building! And does it ever look sharp and feel right.  

 But an uneasy feeling builds as you get deeper into it, a sense that all is not quite right. This 
 is not quite the game you hoped for. Even worse, it has some definite problems. The pitfall when 
 you review a game as anticipated and debated as this one is to make sure you criticize it for what 
 it is, not for what you wish it was. I wish that Age of Empires was what it claimed to be - Civilization 
 with a Warcraft twist. Instead, it is Warcraft with a hint of Civilization. That's all well and 
 good, but it places it firmly in the action-oriented real-time combat camp, rather than in the 
 high-minded empire-building of Civilization. The result is Warcraft in togas, with slightly more 
 depth but a familiar feel.  

 Age of Empires places you on a map in an unexplored world, provides a few starting units, and lets 
 you begin building an empire. Each game unfolds the same way. You begin with a town center and 
 some villagers. The villagers are the basic laborers, and the town center enables you to build 
 more of them and expand your settlement. The villagers are central to AOE: they gather resources, 
 build structures, and repair units and buildings. Resources come in four forms: wood, food, stone, 
 and gold. A certain amount of each is consumed to build various units and buildings, research new 
 technology, and advance a civ to the next age.   

 There is no complex resource management or intricate economic model at work here. What you have 
 is the same old real-time resource-gathering in period garb, with four resources instead of one 
 or two. As your civ advances, you develop greater needs for these resources, but the way in which 
 they are gathered and used becomes only marginally more complex (certain research can cause faster 
 harvesting or more production) . It appears on the surface to be a complex evocation of the way 
 early civs gathered and used materials, but beneath the hood is the same old "mine tiberium, buy 
 more stuff than the other guys" model. It is the first hint that AOE is a simple combat game rather 
 than a glorious empire-builder.  

 There's no denying the thrill the first time a villager chucks a spear at an antelope and spends 
 several minutes hacking meat from its flank with a stone tool. This is the level of detail that 
 brings an empire-building game to life. If only those villagers would grow and develop over the 
 course of the game, it would make it so much more interesting. If only they would trade in their 
 loincloths for some britches and maybe some orange camouflage, and switch from spears to arrows 
 and rifles. Yes, that's another game, but it could easily have been done in AOE, and why it wasn't 
 is a mystery.  

 The overall impression of AOE dips further with the prickly issue of unit control and AI. As you 
 expand your city with new and improved buildings, you develop the ability to produce new and better 
 military units. These fall into several categories: Infantry (Clubman, Axeman, Short Swordsman, 
 Broad Swordsman, Long Swordsman, Legion, Hoplite, Phalanx, and Centurion) , Archers (Bowman, Improved 
 Bowman, Composite Bowman, Chariot Archer, Elephant Archer, Horse Archer, and Heavy Horse Archer) , 
 Cavalry (Scout, Chariot, Cavalry, Heavy Cavalry, Cataphract, and War Elephant) , and Siege Weapons 
 (Stone Thrower, Catapult, Heavy Catapult, Ballista, and Helepolis) . With the completion of a temple, 
 a priest becomes available that can heal friendly units and convert enemy units. Naval units come 
 in the form of fishing, trade, transport, and war.  

 The problem is that while enemy AI is savvy and aggressive (it can afford to be since it appears 
 to cheat with resources) , your units are bone-stupid. Path-finding is appallingly botched, with 
 units easily getting lost or stuck. There is a waypoint system, but that hardly makes up for the 
 fact that your units have trouble moving from point A to point B if you don't utilize it. Military 
 units will stand idly by while someone a millimeter away is hacked to pieces. They respond not 
 at all to enemy incursion in a village and wander aimlessly in the midst of battle. Was this deliberate 
 so that the gamer needed to spend more time in unit management? If so, it was a poor idea, since 
 there is simply too much going on midgame to worry about whether your military is allowing itself 
 to be butchered in one corner of the map while you are aggressively tending to a battle in another 
 portion. There is no excusing this flaw, and it seriously diminishes AOE's enjoyability. Finally, 
 there is the fifty unit limit that is irritating many players, but in light of the game's already 
 troublesome play balance, it was a solid decision to force users to build units more selectively. 
   

 AOE obviously is sticking close to an early-empire motif, and there's nothing at all wrong with 
 that. Stone, Tool, Bronze, and Iron are the four ages, and with each come new structures and military 
 units. You don't earn these advanced ages - you buy them with resources. Advancement is a simple 
 matter of hoarding and spending food and gold. The overall welfare of your state is irrelevant 
 as long as it survives: happiness is not measured, trade is barely modeled, and the state exists 
 merely to produce a military machine to crush everyone else on the map. Naval power has a woefully 
 unbalancing effect upon gameplay, with a strong navy able to shred the competition at the expense 
 of reality.  

 Micromanagement is the name of the game in AOE. There is no unit queue, and to build five villagers, 
 you need to build one, wait, build another, and so on. With units acting so stupidly, you should 
 be able to set their level of aggression and the manner in which they attack (a la Dark Reign) , 
 but that is also not an option. Diplomacy is relegated to tribute and nothing more, and alliances 
 are hard to form. You can be allied, neutral, or at war with other civs, but if the radio button 
 is still set to "allied" when an opponent starts firing on your units, your units will not fire 
 back, defend themselves, or even flee. They will just be destroyed. Cues as to exactly what's happening 
 on the map are obscure; the duty has been relegated to unrelated sound effects. Does that bugle 
 call mean my building is finished being built, or my units are under attack? How about some help, 
 people? Victory conditions can also be irritating. There are several campaigns that require that 
 specific goals be met, and these quickly grow tiresome. Thankfully, there is an excellent custom 
 generator that lets you set map size, starting tech, resources, and other features. This is the 
 saving grace of AOE, and what kept me coming back again and again. The main reason is that it let 
 me change some of the insane default victory requirements, such as when the victor is the first 
 to build a "wonder" (through another massive consumption of resources) that stands for 2000 years. 
 These 2000 years can pass in about twenty minutes of game time. That means that as soon as an opponent 
 builds a wonder, you create a whacking huge navy to go over and blow it up. Not a very subtle way 
 to maintain an empire. In fact, there is no strategic nuance: It is merely a brawny muscle contest. 
 For all its historical trappings and pretensions to recreate the early progress of civilization, 
 in the final analysis it does not even have the depth of a pure combat game like Dark Reign or 
 Total Annihilation.  

 If all these judgments seem harsh, it is only because Age of Empires looked, and pretends, to be 
 so very much more. It still has tons of potential and a fundamental gameplay that remains entertaining 
 enough to overcome the flaws and merit a fair rating. The system can go very far with some fine-tuning, 
 but as it stands it seems downright schizo. Is it a simplified Civilization or a modestly beefed 
 up Warcraft? It's almost as if the designers started out to create one game and ended up with another. 
 With such beautiful production and the fundamentals of a vastly entertaining game, it's sad that 
 it fell short of the mark. The disappointment is not merely with what AOE is, but with what it 
 failed to be.

Review:  This game supposed to be an empire-building game like, Cesar or Settlers. But it didn't feel like 
 any of them. This game rather more action-oriented and less empire building oriented.
  
  It has usual resource management scheme found in many other base-building games. You were given 
 few people to build your empire at the start of any campaign or skirmish map. But once time goes 
 by, you'll see that combat against AI is the key point of this game. You don't need to build a 
 gorgeous empire with many town centers lying around the map etc. Just build enough population and 
 armies with sufficient research done, then attack and crush your enemies.
  
  This isn't any empire-building game. Period.
  
  Pros:
  + Good graphics.
  + Campaign story 
 was average.
  
  Cons:
  - More attack oriented and less empire building oriented.
  - Not much strategy required to win against AI.

Review:  Well I could be biased, since this was one of the first pc games I played (I was roughly 8 back 
 then) . Nevertheless, I would still love to play this game again! It was addictive and easy to play.
 
  
  Although there were different city building and RTS games such as civilisation and Ceasar 3, I 
 feel that AoE is one of the most memorable games I've ever played. 
  Different races, skrimishes, campaigns, death match? I miss them all. These offered heavy replay 
 value, and experimental factors for a gamer, thus the 100 hours+ of gameplay. 
  And then the humour kicked in with the cheat codes: Big Daddy, photon man, Big Bertha, peppperoni 
 pizza? ok im starting to sound like a creepy AOE geek- but if a game aint fun, I wouldn't even 
 remember these things. 
  
  The first version is truly a long lasting classic, and for a game that is made back in 1997, to 
 me it was impressive. The healing priests' voice is funny btw.

Review:  
  Age of Empires will be remembered for one thing... its terrible path-finding the units couldn't 
 do anything unless you were babysitting them. My transport boat was on its way back, I thought 
 it had made it back because it's hard to tell one dot from another on the map anyway I found it 
 stuck on the coast figuring it could take the most direct route.
  
  Now I haven't beared enough terrible path-finding to find out what other atrocities lie in the 
 game, however I do know they at least had good units anyway. The sound nothing special, unit types 
 nothing too diverse, path-finding atrocious, military units will sit there getting owned while 
 your babysitting your landing force, economy is terrible I mean no market or way of getting resources 
 after you've run out and resources are to easily eaten I mean 5 secs to use up all the wood on 
 a tree, that is the worst realism since I don't know when. So what is great about this game?
  
  The fact that there is none like it, that it is the first of its kind is what makes special, 
 the civilisations are diverse but is downplayed by only having 3 or so ages to go through. The 
 only reason why I have this game is because it came with the Collector's Edition of AoE. OK so 
 I like my RTS, so I'll be fair to the classic and in memory of Ensemble that should be gone after 
 Halo Wars and give this a 7.5. Yeah just get Collector's Edition, so you know what I'm talking 
 about, compilations rock!

Review:  First of all the person who reviewed this games should be shot. Secondly this game rocks. It got 
 me into gaming, especially the rts genre and eventually battlefield 1942 got me into shooters, 
 that is why i am currently playing far cry 2, gears 2, and company of heroes (i love this game)
 
  
  Now in espanol (don't know how to make little squiggly line above n on here)
  
  En primer lugar, la persona que revis este juego debe ser fusilados. En segundo lugar el juego 
 rocas. Me consigui en los juegos de azar, especialmente el gnero RTS campo de batalla y, finalmente, 
 en 1942 me tiradores, es por eso que estoy jugando actualmente dista mucho 2, marchas 2, de hroes 
 y de la empresa (me encanta este juego)
  
  now in german
  Vor allem die Person, berprft diese Spiele sollten erschossen. Zweitens dieses Spiel Felsen. 
 Es hat mich in die Spiele, besonders das RTS-Genre und auch Battlefield 1942 bekam ich in Shootern, 
 das ist der Grund, warum ich mich zur Zeit spielen weit entfernt 2, Getriebe 2 und Company of Heroes 
 (i love this game)

Review:  Graphics: At the time of release I thought the buildings in the game were beautiful and the character 
 design was cool. The maximum viewing area in-game is rather limited and so was the screen resolution.
 
  
  Gameplay: In AoE the idea is fairly simple. You gather resources as fast as you can. You build 
 and train as fast as you can and you advance technology as fast as you can to stay ahead of the 
 enemy. While doing this, you have to fend off attacks and try to destroy the enemy.
  
  Story: There isn't much of a story, it just has a historic-ish background. I can't help thinking 
 that there are some anachronisms in it at times. I can't pick an example of it right now though. 
 You start off in the stone age, in a nation of your choice and wage war on opposing nations while 
 advancing your technology and architecture.
  
  Lifespan: If you like strategy with simple design with challenging gameplay, you could probably 
 spend over 100 hours playing this. It also has a multiplayer option and a scenario builder.
  
  Sound: The sound effects are clear and informative. There is no "distant" sound so you usually 
 won't be able to hear events that are off-camera. There is background music which can be turned 
 off.
  
  Control: Here is where AoE let us down. Pathfinding in the game is poor so units would constantly 
 get stuck on trees if there was a large enough forest directly in between them and the destination.
 
  
  Originality: You've obviously seen games like it before. AoE just has that "polished remake" feeling.

Review:  I absolutely don't agree with the editor's score of Age of Empires. It was a highly ambitious game 
 of 1997 and it conquered the RTS market at that time. A game that didn't use fantasy creatures 
 or alien technology, but gave us the hardcore history of mankind in a nutshell.
  
  A few drawbacks of Age of Empires can't overshadow the fact that it also used the best AI of the 
 time. Age of Empires is all about building an empire from the bare necessities of life, right from 
 the scratch. You start of with a tiny village and have to make it grow and prosper into a large 
 empire capable of fighting and fending enemies.
  
  It was the first game to bring an equality among the units of various civilizations. All the units 
 of all civilizations were the same with the fact that only a few units were available to certain 
 civilizations and that was made them different. Unlike other strategy games, no unit in AOE is supremely 
 powerful - every unit has it's weakness and it is your duty to exploit the enemies weakness and 
 strengthen your own.
  
  Also it is the first game to introduce the concept of an overall advancement. In games like warcraft, 
 every building has it's own advancement and there is no total advancement and so you have to actually 
 advance one building and then advance another when it become available. In AOE a concept called 
 age advancement is used, where the entire age is changed from say The Copper Age to The Bronze 
 Age, thus making available various other and new weapons.
  
  Certain glitches in AOE included poor graphics effect and single unit production. These however 
 I feel aren't enough to overshadow AOE. So if you are planning to get an RTS for yourself get the 
 AOE collection, or at least get the beginning of the series.

Review:  Age of Empires 1 Review made by minimme:
  
  Everyone says a game is bad because of its graphics but that is totally WRONG!!
  
  This game 
 is a great game and i think that it is HEAPS better than all the other games in the age of empires 
 series... I played this ages ago and got it out of a serial box, and i still play it! its a really 
 great game, i even bought the 'Age of Empires: Rise of Rome Expansion Pack' for my cereal box version, 
 AND I STILL PLAY IT! if you don't like this game even slightly, your weird. just plain weird...
 
  
  This game is a great game and i recommend anyone to buy it because it is so good! it is really 
 cheap and i think that the only way that you could probably get it is off ebay (unless of coarse, 
 download it...)
  
  It also has heaps of other cool stuff like scenario editor, multiplayer, single player AND HEAPS 
 MORE!

Review:  Age of Empires.......
  
  Well I don't really think that you guys are gonna take your time to read something on the Internet 
 that is TOO LONG and take TOO MUCH TIME to READ IT!
  
  DON'T WORRY You'll like it and as you may already have realized it will NOT BE A LONG TEXT.
  
 
  Well now that i have your attention i need to say that i'm not an American so don't expect every 
 little word to be grammatically right.
  
  *GETTING TO BUSINESS*
  
  AEO CANNOT be analyzed without considering the time that it was made. Because a game can only have 
 limited resources in the time that it was made, for example we could not say that the game could 
 be better if done in 3D even if in the time we had this resource, but we have to consider the resources 
 that the game had to be built.
  
  #GRAPHICS
  
  AEO graphics are impeccable. even if repetitive, but quite real, with very good shadow techniques. 
 So the game is SIMPLE, something that make a first game in a series quite good looking. Using very 
 light colors that make the ambient very soft and smooth that even a kid could say what is what 
 in the screen.
  Each unit has it on little details that make you want to build them all or to like a single type 
 of unit.
  
  #GAMEPLAY
  
  Easy, a diablo apprentice. Click Click Click and Click.
  The gameplay is SIMPLE (again) , attack or build. Remember... A well designed game doesn't need TOO 
 MUCH actions, too much buttons get the user confused and sometimes they may CRY!
  Again... very simple, does what it can do (can't fly and go to neverland! why?! don't ask!) , no 
 more nor less.
  
  
  
  Well guys THIS IS IT! I could do more than this and write a lot of details that after you read 
 it you'll start to remember when playing other games, seeing in other games and then sending me 
 a message of how cool was it. But now it's probably past midnight and you (WE) have to sleep a little.
 
  
  THANKS FOR USING YOUR VERY PRECIOUS TIME READING THIS!
  
  THANK YOU

Review:  Build an Empire to Surpass Microsoft's
  Microsoft has decided to make a game about something that they are experts on, the rise of an empire. 
 At first glance, Age of Empires looks sort of like a cross between Civilization 2 and Warcraft 
 II, and that is a fairly accurate comparison. Age of Empires is a real-time strategy game set in 
 the eras from the formation of the first civilizations to the end of the iron age. Although the 
 time period of Age of Empires limits the technology available to the player, this is compensated 
 for by making a very detailed game world full of historical depth. 
  You typically start each game with a town center, a few peasants, and stone age technology. Your 
 first priorities are building shelter and, like the good hunter/gatherer that you are, hunting 
 and gathering food. With food and shelter, you are free to create more peasants who in turn can 
 be sent out to chop wood, quarry stone, or mine gold. Eventually, you build more complex structures 
 and are able to increase your technological level. Oddly, to raise your technology level, you do 
 not assign peasants to be scientists or scribes, but instead you spend food. I have never known 
 of a situation where food buys technological progress, perhaps the scientists won't work unless 
 you throw a banquet. 
  Increased technology allows you to construct more advanced units, of which there are many. There 
 are a total of 40 units, which is actually a great amount of detail for a historical period which 
 ends before the renaissance. There are 7 different types of archers, 9 types of infantry, and 11 
 types of boats. All in all, the many types of units allows Age of Empires to very closely model 
 the types of armies in use 2000 years ago. Age of Empires has 12 ancient civilizations available 
 to the player. Each civilization has certain units not available, however they gain certain bonuses 
 for whatever aspect that civilization excelled at. For example, the Greeks can produce advanced 
 infantry more quickly, while the Persians are excellent hunters. Microsoft obviously did its research 
 here, and the result is a well rounded, historically accurate product (at least for a game) . 
 
  The resource model of Age of Empires wins both praise and condemnation from me. Scattered across 
 the board are many different types of resources, including berry bushes, forests, quarries, mines, 
 wild game, and fish stocks. It is nice to see mankind's interaction with nature when gathering 
 resources instead of the simple 'ore harvester' or whatever. You can watch your little people pick 
 berries, cut down trees, mine gold, and hunt and butcher wild animals. One problem I have with 
 the resources is the lack of the bounty of nature. A typical game might last 10,000 'years' and 
 in all that time, animals do not reproduce, and berries and forests do not regrow. This basically 
 means that you are stuck with the amount of resources that the map comes with, leaving you with 
 no incentive to conserve for the future generations. If you started with 10 gazelles, you will 
 never get any new ones, you will only lose them from hunting and predation from lions. (I must 
 admit, it's pretty neat to see a lion eat a gazelle in a computer game) 
  Another problem with the resource model is the handling of food. No, I'm not talking about dangers 
 from undercooked meat, I'm talking about the food supply. It takes food to create villagers and 
 soldiers. I have no problem with that. I fail to see why it takes 30 villagers-worth of food to 
 upgrade a catapult trireme to a juggernaut. Also, villagers don't eat. Your populace can stand 
 around for thousands of years and never need a bite. This causes a problem with siege tactics. 
 The tired and true strategy of destroying farms to kill of the population just doesn't work. Also, 
 the units most useful when under siege, such as the catapult, require no food to create. 
  Despite its flaws, Age of Empires is great fun to play. The graphics and sound effects are of high 
 quality, and the computer plays a respectable game. In fact, there is a very large selection of 
 AIs to choose from in the scenario editor. Ah... the scenario editor. The scenario editor allows 
 you total control in the design of scenarios and campaigns, right down to the intro movies. Even 
 if you don't like the full selection of scenarios included with the game you have all the tool 
 at your disposal to create a scenario exactly to your liking. Its minor annoyances are just that, 
 minor compared to the game as a whole. For any fan of real-time strategy or historical simulations, 
 I would recommend Age of Empires.

Review:  age of empires is a game where you play as 1 of the ancient empires such as romans, egyptians etc. 
 you build and create soldiers to fight for your empire while in war with other com empires. there 
 are many buildings to choose from which give you a strategic part to the game. well basically its 
 all strategy really by knowing where to place certain buildings and what units to use in the armies. 
 the buildings have different uses such a house which provides population space for the empire and 
 barracks where you can train infantry. as this game came out about 10 years ago or something it 
 is still a pretty good game nowhere near as good as the newer 1's but still very good. i like this 
 time stage better though ( the ancient civilisations) compared to AoE3 where its like 1700- start 
 of 1900. but the sounds for this game are pretty bad i have to say and the graphis are terrible 
 ion this day and age. but this game is still very addicting and can be played for many hours. overall 
 i think that this game should be remade with better graphics and better sounds and yah just done 
 up in general and then brought again because it has the best time stage of the ancient civilisations.

Review:  As I was reading through the reviews, I went on to the Age of Empires II review page. I noticed 
 how people thought highly of the series. All three of them. As for me, I bought the collectors 
 edition, which packaged all four of the original games. I installed the first, not expecting to 
 play it. A few days later, what was I doing? As with all games, you get bored of the game before 
 getting back into it in a few months. I am a huge Conquerors fan, but to tell you the truth, I 
 got bored of it after the tenth week. The computers were too easy, and online was rather boring. 
 So I popped in this game and found it very fun. It's a slow game, for sure, but who cares? It's 
 a good game! The intro was long and boring, just like that of the second one. Who cares about some 
 dead soldiers history? Anyways, it is historically accurate. And research is as well historically 
 accurate. You have to get the wheel, writing, and things like that. All the more fun! Although, 
 every good game has it's fair share of cons too. In this one, I consider having to blow up a wall 
 every time you want to let a few units out a cons. And people can't walk on farms. Unless it's 
 walled, you should be able to hike across the field. I have noticed that people call none-to-scale 
 units a cons. What a spoiled generation we are! But think of Civilization! That has gone far in 
 the TBS genre, as this series has. Also, naval warfare was great! It was even easier to rush someone 
 an age or two behind you with ships! There is a lot of difference between different units, so it's 
 best you spend it on upgrades! Although, each civilization was no different then another. I mean, 
 one civ has this, another has that, but they all add up to equality. You will find pressing the 
 random civ button is just as good as pressing the Greek's button. But, as you can see, if you look 
 at the positives and not the negatives, it is a great game and worth however much you plan on buying 
 it for.

Review:  Personally, I found this game to have a very interesting strategic design. The fact that you were 
 unable to use gates and such, was very interesting. Making it so you had to place units to defend 
 your bases entrances, and leaving them ungaurded could be hostile to your base, and your groups 
 survival. The gameplay was very interesting, with amazing music and awesome turtorial. Making it 
 easy to understand and get use to the controls of the game. The problems I found about this game 
 is in certain stages you would be "dead locked" from the action. As forced to watch building and 
 gathering while you could not attack, defend or do anything or major interest.
  
  However the pro's of the game are fairly interesting. You have to build your base flawlessly. If 
 not, you stand a high chance of having your base raided, and unable to be repaired in time before 
 serious damage is caused. The game overall was fairly well done, with the occasional glitch then 
 and there.

Review:  Compared to the games of today, the first Age of Empires would look crude and too simplistic. Maybe 
 that's true... but my memories of this game are nothing but fun.
  
  AoE started me off into the strategy genre, and I've been hooked ever since. Back then, every strike 
 of the villager's axe against the trees was rendered with sweet, liquid animation. Simple tasks 
 such as mining, or bringing down an elephant and gathering its meat, became a pleasure to watch.
 
  
  Gameplay is straightforward. Spawn villagers. Gather resources. Buy stuff. Dominate the world. 
 Units are generic, and military dominance is virtually the only way to win the game.
  
  Despite that, for a guy just getting his toes wet in PC gaming, Age of Empires brought fun fun 
 fun. The experience has been enjoyable enough that it made me try out Age of Empires II and III.

Review:  Age of Empires is just the beginning of a highly successful series of computer strategy games made 
 by Microsoft. This series is the Age of Empires series. The modern Age of Empires game are fun 
 to play, easy to get used to, and offer a great variety of gameplay options not seen in many games 
 of its type. This is great. However, the first one didn't start out so good. 
  
  First, this game has many, many problems that will cause extreme disappointment and boredom in 
 it. I am only going to skim the surface of this game with this review just to give you an idea 
 of how this game is.
  
  Age of Empires 1 is a fun game at first but quickly grows old, slow, and boring. There just isn't 
 enough in it to keep it going. The graphics are okay considering the time this game was made and 
 how it really doesn't matter much. All of your villagers look the same and act the same which won't 
 really bother you too much considering how you will mostly want to build armies and take over the 
 enemy as quickly as you can.
  
  The sound in the game is bad by all standards now a days and most standards of the time it was 
 made (1997) . It comes out scratchy and muffled and just isn't good. You will often find yourselft 
 turning the volume down or off.
  
  The gameplay is what makes and breaks this game. It is where the game has its highest amount of 
 good things as well as bad things. 
  
  First off, in the game you have one main objective... TAKE OVER THE ENEMY'S EMPIRE!!! and other 
 mini objectives within each battle such as find all the ruins, build the bigger/est empire, etc. 
 You can play as a variety of civilizations but neither of them really bring much difference to 
 the table besides different building designs. You have to fight against one or more other civilizations 
 in the game per map. Each time you start a new map you get to choose stats such as the maximum 
 number of units a civilization can have, what map type you want to play on, how big you want the 
 map to be, and other basics of that sort. You have four map types to choose from... highland, coastal, 
 inland, and one other that I can't remember. These maps are fun at first but the lack of variety 
 of map types quickly wears down the enjoyment of these. Also, in the game your main objective is 
 to take over the other empire (s) . In order to do that you have to build the biggest army and take 
 over the other empire (s) . Your army can be made up of different units covering the basic cavalry 
 units, archery units, and infantry units. This portion of the game (building your army) is the 
 funnest but with the lack of control on how you can move your army causes the whole having to move 
 them feel more like a chore than anything else.
  
  Pros of Gameplay:
  
  You get to build armies
  You get to build your empires up to massive sizes with time and effort
 
  
  Cons of Gameplay:
  
  Everything about the gameplay, even the good things, have bad things about them that pull their 
 "Fun" level down. Some of them are just bad (refer to my first mentioning on gameplay because the 
 cons are so great that I don't feel like posting them again.)
  
  :RATINGS:
  
  Graphics - 6
  Sound - 4
  Gameplay - 6
  Replay Value - 7
  
  Summary: Although this game 
 has it's major problems... MAJOR, MAJOR problems. If you have nothing better to do and you like 
 strategy games then you will find this game entertaining for a while. 
  
  OVERALL SCORE: 5.3

Review:  The first strategy game I ever played was AoE II, then after spending an inordinate amount of my 
 middle school years conquering as the Mongols, I moved on to other critical darlings like Rise 
 of Nations, Age of Mythology, and Rome: Total War. I had never met a strategy game I didn't want 
 to spend weekend after weekend mastering, until I popped this game in a few weeks ago for the first 
 time in a few years, and was all but disgusted. Though this game may have been significant when 
 I was in third grade, it is now obsolete in every sense of the word. The concept remains good in 
 attempting bring a little more action to the historical RTS world, but when the original AoE can't 
 even get its unit designations right, one has to wonder about even the accuracy of this "Historical" 
 RTS. My beef? Infantry units, mostly. Legions were a Roman development, which came centuries after 
 the hoplite revolution in Greece, the phalanx is misused, as it is a formation of hoplites, not 
 an individual. I'll take this as a segway into the lack of formations, which may not have even 
 crossed player's minds in '97, but 10 years later and having come to expect them in every RTS, 
 I found myself wanting to hang myself with my mouse cord (maybe it's time for wireless...) after 
 having my archers constantly march in front of my infantry, only to be mowed down by absurd numbers 
 of enemy elephants and leave my hapless infantry with no support. The balance seemed alright, but 
 the enemy AI is just plain murderous. 
  Fifteen minutes into my Deathmatch I actually found myself wanting to return to my homework on 
 German conjunctions...

Review:  Before I even played the game, I knew I fell in love with it while watching my friend play it as 
 he introduced me to the gameplay mechanics.
  At the time I was playing strategy games Star Craft and MechCommander; each having their own type 
 of game play but nothing close to the style of Age of Empires.
  
  Sound:
  What's great about this game is that the music does an excellent job of bringing you back to prehistory 
 and the ancient times. I loved the soundtrack and I still adore it to this day. The sound effects 
 were pretty good, but what stood out to be kind of crappy were the sounds of ballistas and other 
 "giant arrow" like projectiles. 
  
  Graphics:
  Back in 1997 the game's graphics were descent. Not the best compared to other RTS games, but it 
 was good enough to keep your eyes glued to your monitor while you enjoyed playing the game.
  
  Here is a rule of themb when reviewing a game:
  Game play   Graphics
  
  Even though the 
 military units don't have a unique look to each civilization, for the most part, the buildings 
 do. Another thing that sets the civilizations apart are unique technology trees and that includes 
 the upgrading of units, buildings, economic upgrades, military upgrades, etc etc. 
  Being the first AOE, they did a great job.

Review:  This is one of the first of game I played when I got a modern computer and I think the score for 
 this game on gamespot is under rated. This game starts in the eariest period of time with the Stone 
 age and has three more ages. For it time this was a very good game and is a great joy to play and 
 to have in your collection. There is a lot to do for the single player game and had a very good 
 multiplayer system back when it was around. The units in the game are the same mostly for all the 
 groups expect for a few units.

Review:  This truly one of the best real time stratgies that i ever playerd. when it first cam out i was 
 like omg this is a game that i have been looking for. Some of the things may be off.... for example 
 that houses are smaller than the villagers but thats ok i don't mind with that. Also how you have 
 to collect gold and food and all type of resources was awesome. This is also a very addictive game 
 because you can spend hours on it and you wont even notice all the time you've spent on it. A single 
 map can take up to 5 hours or more depending on how you play and good you are.

Review:  I own this game, and I've probably only played it three or four times. It gets so repetitive and 
 boring. There are very few elements to the game, so it gets tiring fast. The tutorial is okay but 
 after that pretty much everything seems the same. The difficulty doesn't seem especially bad; I 
 haven't played it much but it is variable. However, it goes slow and the graphics also suck. Don't 
 bother buying this game... there are other versions out now that are much better and are also cheap. 
 That pretty much sums it up... Age of Empires II is better, and check out other games by the same 
 company; they are all pretty good, aside from this piece of ----.

Review:  Ive had this game for 5 years and I still play it now and again. It may not have great graphics 
 but the gameplay makes up for that. Online is extremely fun, especially with friends. Many different 
 kinds of units such as archers, calvary, swordsmen, samurai, pikemen and many more. The campaign 
 is addicting and takes a patient player. It is long and has alot of history in it. The cheats are 
 fun for about 5 mins, but they ruin the game after that. I think that too many people are just 
 looking for graphics and not gameplay, and gameplay is exactly what this game has much of. This 
 is a great addition to any real-time strategy players games.

Review:  I am not a person that gets tied up in graphical pickiness. Quite frankly, since it was 2002 when 
 I originally got this game, I wouldn't have played Age Of Empires if I was. So I wasn't too fussed 
 when the games graphics were, frankly, hilariously silly by today's standards. But it was when 
 I began to play the game that I got disappointed.
  
  Perhaps it is just because I am looking back from the time of Age Of Empires 2, Age Of Mythology 
 and now Age Of Empires 3, but I didn't really enjoy the game as much as I would've liked to.
  
  The AI was either predictable or ridiculously fast-paced, and the sound was poor, especially 
 considering it was only made a decade ago. I had fun in some games, but the enjoyment was inconsistent 
 for me.
  
  In the end, I only gave this game 6.5 because of the amazing games that came after because of it.

Review:  age of empires has a great game play involved. the aim of the game can consist of many different 
 categories. one mission could be as simple as destroying an enemy, or as difficult as bring an object 
 to an area in a short time while defending your territory from seven other different teams. you 
 can do a huge variety of different things in age of empires such as spawn different types of people 
 i. e. swordsmen archers and Calvary. although the cheats and hints to this game can ruined it. as 
 in, i know all the cheats but i try not to use them to make the game last longer and be more realistic.

Review:  Age of Empires is a game where I have a very particular opinion. It's a good game, and the theme 
 is great. No one had ever put out a game set in ancient (real) history, and Ensemble did it, with 
 mostly good results both evoking the real period and keeping it fun.
  
  The game, however, suffers from several issues:
  
  The first one is it's lack of originality. 
 The game plays exactly as Warcraft II did 2 years before. In fact, Warcraft II visuals and responsiveness 
 were actually better than in AoE.
  
  The second one (and in my opinion, bigger one) was that despite having 12 playable races , all 
 of them played exactly the same. Not only that (Warcraft 2 had two sides with mostly equivalent 
 units) , the units actually looked and sounded the same, no matter your side. It looks almost as 
 if they wanted to aim for something bigger, but ended up not doing it.
  
  So, despite being a rather good game, it's got some serious flaws that make it feel half-baked.

Review:  It's the first Age Of Empires Game that I own. I got this one as a gift from one of my Teacher. 
 But at that time I don't have a PC. After that at late 2000 I bought my PC and this was first game 
 to install in the same... At that time it take about 4-5 hrs to understand the game... And after 
 that it became a problem for my parents... As late night I start the game and some time I just 
 go playing for the whole night and the next day my eyes were just red... Anyway this is just to 
 share with all of you... I really love this game... It's toooooooo good. And this is the game which 
 teach me to love the Strategic games.

Review:  Good RTS games stand out well from the other rip offs on the market and offer good gameplay, units, 
 and challenges. Age of Empires has no doubt been a revolutionary step in the genre and for the 
 first time you are actually capable of controlling ancient civilizations in a RTS setting which 
 is why the game should have been a little bit better than what it is now. Age of Empires delivers 
 a unique experience with different units and buildings and strategy but then fails at providing 
 any more than that. The gameplay is good and the units speak for the themselves, but its all rehashed 
 sprites with almost every civilization having the same units and even having the same music and 
 sound effects which definitely takes away from the experience of playing a historical RTS. Age 
 of Empires is a good game but can get repetitive and boring at times

Review:  10 out of 10 for ten great years! Starcraft may be the RTS game of choice for certain people (and 
 countries) , but in our household this is the game that has stood the test of time. It may be not 
 as graphically pretty (though I still find them well done) or feature packed as some of it's sequels 
 and competitors - it's AOE's lack of complexity that has made it easy to learn and difficult to 
 master.
  While it may not have waypoints, unit queuing, gates in the walls, mega death weapons or battle 
 formations it is the constant need to keep a watchful eye over the battlefield that has made it 
 so exciting. Compared to Age of Kings which seems to bog down to trench warfare once the castles 
 and fortifications are up, Age of Empires keeps its play dynamic and varied.
  Given myself, family and friends have also been keen Civilization fans, in it's various incarnations 
 from the days of DOS, we liked the historical perspective of the various combatants from the Stone 
 to the Iron Age. It's something tangible and quite interesting - when reading into the various 
 histories of the lesser known empires.
  We've had some brilliant multiplayer moments over the years with this game and find the various 
 victory conditions add to the appeal - from total battlefield victory, timed or points victory, 
 wonder victory, or grabbing all the artifacts/relics and holding them. We still talk about one 
 game when a players wonder was destroyed with only 20 years to go (roughly 30 seconds) , only for 
 our game to then rage on for another 3 hours before a victory was achieved. As well as the time 
 I snuck away with two villagers as my original township was being destroyed only to rebuild in 
 hiding and win after a major counter attack.
  Back in the days when this was out C&amp; C, Warcraft 2 and Starcraft were all the rage, but the 
 points for me go to Age of Empires!

Review:  I've been playing this game from the start. You run your own empire, gain an army and towns in the 
 area, and take over your enemy. While it doesn't seem like much at first there is a lot of stuff 
 you can do on this game. You can go through the campaign, create your own scenarios, or play on-line 
 with up to eight people. And if you believe it is to hard, or just want to go through a campaign 
 faster, you can just cheat. There are some cool cheat codes like spacemen and cars with lasers 
 and stuff (no i don't cheat myself) . You can easily find this game for $10 in walmart, and you 
 can get it with Age of Empires 2 , still for $10. This is definitely worth picking up.

Review:  At 8 years old when my dad got Age of Empires. I wanted to play it. The only RTS games I played 
 were C&amp; C. The gameplay wasn't as good neither the graphics and sound wasn't that great but 
 it kept me happy.
  
  The game got me intrested and I started reading about the Egyptians, Sumerians, Babylonians, Persians, 
 Assrians, Phoenicans (made the first alphabet) , greeks, macedonians, romans and other civilizations 
 in the Middle East. The Yamato Shang campaign I thought didn't give enough info. Even though I'm 
 1/2 taiwanese so 1/4 Chinese due to most of the taiwanese people migrated form China to escape 
 Mao Zedong's Communist Totalitarian Regime, I didn't spend that much time learning about the Ming 
 Dynasty and other stuff.
  
  The thing I like most about Age of Empires and the Expansion Pack and AOE2 Age of Kings is that 
 making you own scenarios. My favorite thing to do I make a very large map, and place 30,000 enemies 
 on the screen. Yes it would take a lot of clicks to place that many enemies. So I would fight against 
 outnumbered 1000 to 1 and you the cheats of photon man and bigdaddy to fight of the huge hoards 
 of Persians to somewhat recreate the 480 B. C. Battle of Themopylae. Yes the Spartans did not have 
 soldiers armed with laser weapondry but hey its fun to do. It's funny having modern weapondry soldiers 
 slaughtering the Sumerians for irrigation rights.
  
  Age of Empires 2 Age of Kings also played an intrest in fascination for the middle ages and went 
 one step further telling more about the histories.

 and unit making then fighting with the enemy ... C&amp; C series was futuristic but this one goes 
 into medieval times ... graphics are ok but not by todays standards .... Lan matches can be done 
 but apart from that it has got some very nice single player story line .... when it came out it 
 was a huge success don't know why gamespot gave it such a low score !! Any way if you are buying 
 it now then it's only good for putting it into your collectgion otherwise rent it .

Review:  Gameplay: Age of Empires places you on a map in an unexplored world. At the start of the game it 
 provides a few starting units, and lets you begin building an empire. Each game unfolds the same 
 way. You begin with a town center and some villagers. The villagers are the basic workers, and 
 the town center enables you to build more of them and expand your settlement. Gathering Resorces 
 are pretty simple, you gather resources such as wood and food to build up your base and army. When 
 you built up your army and upgrade them and fight the enemy which is pretty strait forward. But 
 this gameplay kinda reminds me of the earlier Warcraft games, so i think as a result it is Warcraft 
 in togas, with slightly more depth but a familiar feel. Also there is a multiplayer portion of 
 the game which you can play against other people over the internet.
  
  Graphics: The graphics are accually really well done for the time it came out. It's colorful and 
 fully 3-D which most Real Time Strategy games at the time where not. My only complaint is that 
 the building that are ment to be large seem to be the same hight or shorter then the people themselves 
 which really puzzles me.
  
  Sound: The sound is quite good, the sound effects are well done which suit the game. The voices 
 and the clash of metal on metal are also quite good and sound the way they should sound.
  
  Value: All in all this is a good game. I had loads of fun with it back in the day but now there 
 are better RTS game out there to play. This game accually has quite a bit of replay value to it. 
 There are random maps to play, make your own map to play and also a multiplayer to play against 
 other players.
  I give this game 8.1 out of 10.

 you can kill animals like goats and lions and aligators and other things.. can extract gold and 
 stone from mines and can cut trees to get wood... its a good game but when playing with the pc 
 it not quite as good...
  pcs will win everytime and you wont have chances..
  another thing is that if you create your own territory youll be able to do watherever you want 
 because you know where animals are and where mines are and everything... well...

  +Features different nations
  -Games can get boring, recource gathering is as slow as hell
  -Multiplayer has no lag, but can 
 get very long
  -Bugs ruin the game
  
  Sounds:
  +Features some good music that really fits the game
  +/- The rest of the sounds are mediocre 
 and sound very old
  
  Graphics:
  +Nice colorful graphics
  +/- Some animations like fishes and explosions
  -No real super detai
  
  Value:
  +Features 
 both singleplayer and multiplayer
  +Multiplayer is nice, but gets boring
  +Overall decent AI
  -Some massive bugs ruin the game
  
  Tilt:
  +Easy interface + Controls
 
  +/-No real presentation
  
  If you like very old RTS games and dont really care about graphics and sounds, this is your game!

Review:  age of empires is one of those games to play with others on the a Local Area Network or the internet. 
 i'm just putting it out there, but i did not find the campaign mode entertaining at all which is 
 the primary thing that either makes or breaks the integrity of a realtime strategy game. the original 
 impetus is unfortunately simple: you lead a civilization from the stone age all the way into the 
 golden age of earths history through research, technological advancement, and WAR!! as i said before 
 the main isnt much (i wasnt joking) but the head to head or multiplayer rocks. the only thing i 
 can say bite about the whole prospect is cheat codes. it's easy to use cheats during LAN and NET 
 games which is frustrating because the only thing you can do is fight fire with fire or just quit 
 and play something else...

Review:  Great game, don't know anyone who dosen't kile this masterpiece. We are in the year of 2007 and 
 still this game has what it takes. Easy to learn, none-advance and a perfect start for those who 
 are learning to play realtime strategy games. The multiplayer part is bit lagy if you play with 
 slower game speed but who does that anyway? Finaly.... GREAT GREAT GREAT! GREAT! GREAT! &amp; GREAT!
 
  
  Age of Empires requires the player to develop a civilization, from a handful of cave men in skins 
 to a large Iron Age civilization with weapons and technology. To assure victory, the player must 
 gather resources in order to pay for new units, buildings and more advanced technology. While it 
 is possible to set up the game so that winning is based on economic/technological achievements, 
 in practice most players focus on developing military strength to conquer their opponents, before 
 the opponents conquer them.
  
  Age of Empires consists of various single-player scenarios in which the player is required to complete 
 specific objectives. These scenarios are grouped as campaigns for a certain civilization. Besides 
 the campaigns, the other main mode of single player gameplay is the 'random map' mode (where the 
 map is generated randomly) . These are scenarios in which the human and CPU players begin with only 
 a small settlement and must utilize the available resources to build a powerful civilization and 
 victor over their adversaries. The random map game is the heart of the game's gameplay, while the 
 'death match' game offers a variant of random map play where all players start with very large 
 resource stockpiles.
  
  Age of Empires features online and network play with up to 8 players simultaneously. A mix of random 
 map and death match games have been popular among online players, including some death match variants 
 where players only use specific units (e. g. 'Legions') . Because the network play is less sophisticated 
 than that of modern games, lag and disconnections often occur.
  
  Multiplayer gameplay has been supported by the Zone for most of the game's lifespan, but was terminated 
 by Microsoft in June 2006 along with most other CD-ROM games like Age of Empires II. Age of Empires 
 is commonly played on GameRanger and GameSpy today. World tournaments are played regularly to establish 
 the best players. The graphics have become outdated, but the gameplay still attracts players.
 
  
  There is one unique aspect of Multiplayer in Age of Empires: the a player is able to create a multiplayer 
 game without other human players, which is not possible on Age of Empires II and future Age of 
 Empires games.

Review:  When it comes to games that make me look back and smile with nostalgia its Age of Empires. It was 
 the first PC game i ever played and in chronological order it is the 3rd game i ever played but 
 in my heart its the original, just as a note as to how fond i am of this game is the fact that 
 i can remember my first ever map in detail and what i did.
  
  The graphics for the game are ok but not great and the huge selection of races is mired by the 
 fact that they arent all that different but the score is dramatic and inspiring.
  
  The gameplay can be quite addictive but due to the population limit of 50 you arent going to get 
 any dramatic battles out of this unless its on an 8-player map with 3 allies and 4 enemies.
  
  The campagins have no real depth as hero units are simply renamed units that have their stats 
 changed and the stories are pretty boring but simply jumping into a skirmish match can be a great 
 way to pass away an hour or so.
  
  The game may have its faults but it will always remind me of the good old days and remains a classic 
 in my eyes.

  because this game is well.. Good.
  
  you may disagree with me or not.
  have a nice day.
 
  
  good memories with this game. but age of empires 2 is much much better. u will enjoy the campaigns 
 and the game but it seems a bit sloppy. everything is pretty much fixed in age of empires 2 so 
 don't worry aobut it. the series is good just not this particular game.

Review:  Easily one of my favorite games ever! If you've never played it you need to go out and get it. 
 (get the expansion pack one) I don't know how it got rated so low on gamespot. I give it a 9.4 
 out of ten. the newer ones may have better graphics and larger range of units and capabilities, 
 but this one is still the best of the three. I probably played it first in 1999 and I can still 
 sit down and play through a campaign or a random map. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on it 
 if you get it and it's your first time to play any of the three.

Review:  If you like older games or don't have much grunt in your PC then its alright. I got right into 
 it back when it was new and in it's time it was great. But I put it on recently and it was just 
 unplayable at the pitiful resolution it runs at. It had some good innovations which have become 
 the building blocks of the Age of Empires franchise. If you remember it fondly, don't get drawn 
 in by nostalgia. But hey, great game in its time, and deserves a high score. But Age of Empires 
 2 beats it in every way possible.

Review:  This game is seriously awesome. It will challenge you for at least 5 hours in single player, then 
 once you master the AI, you go on and try and become the best in multiplayer. I really enjoyed 
 this game. Choosing an ancient civilization, then having to master it's units and make strategies 
 was challenging. The graphics (for that time) were amazing. They were simply nice.
  
  The best part of Age of Empires though was playing with people. Even during Age of Empires II's 
 prime, you could find people. And it was nice fighting with club men and such instead of knights. 
 All Microsoft has to do now, is remake it and update the graphics. Change nothing of course, seeing 
 as how it is perfect as it is now.

Review:  This is my first game i played on my pc! It's truly one of the best strategy games, if not the 
 best. An instant classic that i feel like going back to it once in a while although it's so old. 
 The gameplay concept of this game is now at the base of every strategy game that appeared since 
 then. The game has a well-made campaign mod in which you can play as yamato, greeks and other civilizations. 
 The campaigns are very challenging if you play them at the last difficulty. The game also has single 
 player and multiplayer modes. I know that many will say that Starcraft is the best in this genre, 
 but Age of Empires has a certain charm that makes you play it. Maybe it's because it's history 
 in it. Whatever it is i like it :D As a conclusion, if you like playing strategy games, even if 
 you aren't a fan of this genre, this is a must have.

Review:  This is the best game for the Runescape and WoW fans who want to control there envorment. This 
 game has 10/10 gameplay, It suck you in to be specific. But, the graphics are a little poor. And 
 the sound is only almost , and ooga . But the value is top notch. 5 bucks for this game is proboly 
 the price. The originality of this game is great. But it is a little like all the other RTS's. 
 Build and conquor, conquor-that is the purpose of Age of Empires. Age of Empires-the game of Strategy 
 and conquor. I play it very often. It is really good, build your own worlds with the scenario builder. 
 Trust me-you'll love this game.

Review:  This is the first game in the Age of Empires series. It is really fun to play and it is not terribly 
 difficult to learn how to play. There is a good amount of strategy involved in this game which 
 is good considering this is a RTS. The graphics are pretty good, definitely for it's time. It is 
 surprising that this is a 2D game. This is best when played in multi-player and that is where the 
 real fun and action starts. This is a revolutionary game that showed how RTS's are supposed to 
 be made and this formula is carried through the entire series.

Review:  Age of Empires was my first serious introduction to real-time strategy games. As such, I was pretty 
 blown away.
  
  The gameplay is very cool. The player builds units such as villagers, archers, catapaults, calvary, 
 priests, and warships with resources the villagers must collect: gold, wood, and stone. The player 
 begins with just two villagers and eventually has about 200 units and a powerful army. Multitasking 
 is the name of the game. You can send a group of villagers to hunt an elephant, a group of fishing 
 boats to fish, another group of villagers to chop down a forest, another group to build an Academy, 
 and scouts to check out the map - all at once. The main objective is to either destroy all of the 
 opponents or to gather enough resources to build and maintain a Wonder.
  
  The graphics are very nice for its time. The first time I saw an elephant I was impressed and then 
 when my villagers started throwing spears at it, my eyes widened. When the behemoth fell and the 
 units started carrying the meat back to town, I was thoroughly stunned and amazed.
  
  The music is very good with a nature feel and the sound effects are very detailed and widespread. 
 There are thousands of differedt sound clips. I will never forget the chant of the priests: oh 
 w-oh oh 
  
  This game has tremendous value in that the matches take about 2 hours each, there is a large campaign 
 mode, a freestyle mode where you set the rules, and online multiplayer. Of course now there are 
 bigger and better Age of Empires to play.
  
  Assuredly, some of my high score for this game is a rating of the genre itself and its newness 
 and splendor to me. But I can still go back to the game and enjoy a high quality match. Age of 
 Empires is a teriffic game.

Review:  Have u ever thought yourself as an warrior? No? Ok ok ok... Now close your eyes, and think that 
 you live in the ancient civilization, you are the commander of an army. What you will do if youre 
 general commands you to led your army to a battle against a massive force. You have no other option. 
 Just to guide your army to the war field.
  
  How are the feelings now? Not so good? Hmmm... But I can bet that you will enjoy it, if you are 
 playing Age of Empires. Cuz only the size of an army can't decide the true power. You can set your 
 strategy, build your own army, towns. You can be defensive or can directly attack the enemy.
  
  As it is a strategy game. You have to decide your style. You are the boss here. You can command 
 your people by pressing buttons or clicking on them. You can build several structures. They come 
 in two types, city and military structures. City structures are great help to build your economy. 
 You can create mines to earn gold and rock, lumber mill to get wood. Remember that, you cant build 
 any structure without villagers. They can be created in town centers. Now comes the military. Without 
 your own armies enemies will crush you in a moment. So build barracks, archery, stables, castles, 
 docks... to create military units. You can also create an armory, which will help you to improve 
 the armor and attack power of military units.
  
  You can play campaigns. This will deliver the thrill of ancient times. Or choose to skirmish. Either 
 way, you can play as different civilizations. Every civilization has some special units and technology. 
 But also some weaknesses. So its too tough to decide which is the best. But actually they are all 
 same. Its not too tough.
  
  Technology is on of the most vital factor to decide your power. If you have a massive army, but 
 you are still in the Dark Age, you cant win. You have to research and upgrade your civilization 
 too its peak. Else wise, if your opponent is advanced in technology, you can do nothing with your 
 army. If you want to check this. Try to play in the Dark Age, and see that you can not build some 
 heavy weapons. Now shift to the later ages, now build some ballista or ballista towers. Now see 
 what happens if enemy comes near them. But one thing you should remember. Heavy weapons can't decide 
 the fate. Because they are slow. So faster enemy units can crush them easily. The key to win the 
 game is to balance. Balance your economy and army. Then attack your opponent. But You also have 
 to defend your town.
  
  Its may not have a good graphics. But it can deliver you a true gaming experience. Its difficulty 
 is medium. At lower difficulty modes enemies are less aggressive. But at higher modes, they are 
 more ferocious.
  
  So, what you are waiting for? If you are new to the world of strategy. Hop in.
  Join the world 
 of empires, THE AGE OF EMPIRES.

Review:  You can't argue that Age of Empires was one of the most revolutionary games in the RTS genre of 
 gaming. You can't argue that Age of Empires was a hit and that people played it around the world. 
 However you can argue the flaws and the faults with the game. But you can't argue with the fact 
 that game was absolutely fun!
  
  If your not an RTS fan, then there's no point wasting your time with this game. You'd probably 
 be best playing Age of Mythology as it can pretty much convert any RTS loathing gamer into a strategist 
 in a matter of seconds, however this game may appeal to those that love hardcore RTS games or old 
 school gamers that want to remember the good old days of RTS.
  
  The game lacks graphical appeal, but that's because it came out in 1997, however the gameplay the 
 absolutely fantastic and will hook any RTS fan from the moment they lay eyes on the game. It's 
 fast, it's action packed and at $9.95 AU it's awesome value to relive the classic RTS game of the 
 90s. The sound however can get terribly annoying and I think it could've really done with a rock 
 soundtrack to bop along to!

Review:  This game is SWEET sure the graphics aren't so great but its good for a 90's game.
  
  Gameplay : Probably the only War Strategy were i loved the campaign mode. The game is awsome. Just 
 plain addicting i got in trouble for playing this game for 8 and a half hours strait .It's that 
 addicting. I like the fact you can set up your battles.
  
  Graphics: Not great but it was the 90's what do you expect for a PC game but this game still has 
 some pretty good graphics. Just plain short.
  
  Sound: Kind of funny how they speak a mix of languages. I like the priests thing when the convert

Review:  We got to be realistic, this game was a mark in rts game's history. Many reviewers says it has 
 not good graphics or that the other serie's games are much more, etc.. Damn! These game was launched 
 in 1997! The other games had access to technologies that haven't been invented when this game came 
 out.
  Graphics were a couple of years in advance to other games from the same year. Sound was just fine, 
 i can't remember a previous rts game where the characters don't speak English but another language.
 
  The gameplay was pretty attractive and kind of a revolutionary.
  The lowest attribute should be it's launching price... it was a little bit expensive for a computer 
 game at that time.

Review:  Age of Empires would be yet another knock off of a Blizzard game had it not been written in its 
 own graphics engine with Microsoft supported DirectX support. The game-play itself however is very 
 innovative and was the first war style game that was not bogged down in strategy turn based attacks.
 
  
  Depending on your Multiplayer style this game can be fast paced or dig in defensive which is in-line 
 with what was promised about the game. However the single player scenarios are a too much fighting 
 in comparison to this expectation.
  
  This game is addictive for its ability to be played over and over with friends, rather then an 
 irresistible scripted story. Definitely a command and conquer idea, with a plateau forming when 
 you reach Age 3 in the game its all about killing or be killed.
  
  As per many other games of this type, its hunter/gatherer attitude with a mixture of defence or 
 attack, then the technology race, and finally complete your single player or personal objectives 
 to win the battle.
  
  The classic Roman genre gives this game uniqueness to stand out and call to be repeated by hard 
 core gamers as it has minimal variables to consider while being entertaining.
  
  Graphics are very HiRes and gives complement to Microsoft for their ability to command DirectX 
 (excluding the fact that they designed it) and as such use acceptable resources. You even get some 
 amusing glitches (or perhaps it was an attempt at a feature) as large groups of your units try 
 to all walk in unison like zombies.
  
  Music and FX are high sample wave and synthesiser calls so you can expect an immersive experience, 
 although still room for improvement which was achieved eventually by version III.
  
  This is one of those games that keep on going, and as such I recommend it for any collectors cupboard, 
 for under $20.00 you can add just one more dimension to your LAN events. I believe you can get 
 a pack of version 1 and 2 together also for $40.00 which would be even better since there are many 
 features worth seeing in the sequel. Version III however is another tale.

Review:  Many Real Time Strategy gamers love the Age of Empires Series. It is easy to learn, addictive to 
 play, and offers a lot of value. It is arguably one of the best Real Time Strategy series ever.
 
  
  However, there is one small weakness in the Age of Empires Series that prevents this, and that 
 is the original Age of Empires.
  
  Age of Empires takes place in the days before the Romans begin their conquest. This game was being 
 highly recognized, and was expected to be great. It was said to be about vast empire building with 
 a little war. However, Age of Empires does not bring all that it had to offer. I find that I am 
 spending more time attacking my enemies and defending my town.
  
  You start off in the Stone Age, with a handful of villagers in an unexplored territory. Are you 
 on a coastline, smack down in the middle of a continent near enemies, or are you alone on an island? 
 That's for you to find. Your starting location can affect the game. You must use these villagers 
 to build your empire, and gather the resources needed to build your empire. You must gather food, 
 gold, wood and stone to build your empire. You must also build the buildings needed to make your 
 empires more powerful, and advance to another age. Advancing to another Age takes resources and 
 a certain building, and when you advance, you can get more buildings and millitary units to build.
 
  
  You get to choose from a selection of civilizations that were around that time. Though I have heard 
 of some (Babylonians, Egyptians) , most of them I haven't even heard of. This makes the game more 
 complicated than it should be. There are also many types of units you can build: Infantry (basic 
 footsoldier that fight toe -to-toe, archers (ranged attackers) , cavalry (mounted units) , siege 
 weapons (manmade weapons) , priests and boats.
  
  Even though I expected to build the grandest civilization, and sweep through the map like I did 
 in Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, that is impossible. You find that your in the early stages 
 of the Tool Age, and suddenly, a wave of Catapults and Horseman in a matter of minutes, unless 
 you've got enough Axemen to beat them! The enemy AL is a lot smarter than in most other games, 
 which gives the game an extra challenge. I get angry at my troops many times because of their lousy 
 attacking. Isn't it mostly you guys are smart and your enemy is lousy at attacking? There is something 
 else that can drive a person crazy, the 50 unit limit. It limits your abilities that you need. 
 I am used to building 70+ villagers in Age of Empires II, and now I have to share 50 unit spots 
 with both villagers and soldiers? It makes the game far too hard.
  
  I also hate having to use only one unit per quene. The quene is building a unit. In most strategy 
 games, you can often build at least five, but in this you can only get one, which makes it harder 
 to defend.
  
  There are also some campaigns that you can play. They are often true tales of a civilization. You 
 must beat a mission in order to advance to the next one. These campaigns, while challenging, can 
 also be very fun and exciting. Age of Empires also has a scenario editor, where you can build your 
 own maps like those in the campaigns. This feature may sound fun, but is boring and not as fun 
 as others, like Age of Empires II or Starcraft's. Now I'll get down to some basics.
  
  I don't like the graphics. They don't seem well done, and the units seem too colourful for a war 
 game. Though some really liked the graphics, it just didn't sooth me. Yea some of the graphics 
 are impressive, but it just is not what you could hope for.
  
  The sound could have been worse, but it also could've been much better. The sounds that units make 
 are unimpressive, and make the units (especially villagers) sound drunk. You should also consider 
 that they all speak the same language. The sound effects, like explosions (some birds explode when 
 you kill them) , sounds of swords, and the firing of arrows, also brought the mark down really low.
 
  
  Age of Empires is just not a fun game. It doesn't cash in to all of its potential. Though die hard 
 RTS lovers may like it. That said, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. Though many others may 
 like it, if you haven't got the game, and want to get it, I recommend that you don't and stick 
 to a different Real-TIme Strategy game for now.

Review:  Age of Empires is the one that started it all. Graphics are not great, they are bit hard to make 
 clear. Game is pretty unrealistic, since workers just do the job, they don't have to eat or anything. 
 Computer's pretty smart which is good thing. But I think that everything happens too quickly. Buildings 
 will be completed in a minute and developing to other age ( I hope I spelled that right) will happen 
 very quickly. If you like this game, you won't get bored for it quickly, that's for sure. I played 
 this game about four years and I still play it!
  
  Age of Empires will be great game for strategy-game fans. Sure it's not as great as Civilization 
 or some game like that, but it's still good.

Review:  The success of the most popular game, the most suprising features and the most historical-stragety 
 game there is is age of empires!
  
  Age of empires is a stragety game that would also recommend you to play because this game is the 
 one of the most addictive games ever! If you want to build an empire you need to gather resources, 
 if you need to upgrade units you need gold! The graphics are detailes enough but keeping a small 
 amount of space on your hard disk isn't gonna harm you. Expanding an empire isn't hard, but you 
 will start to learn how if you play this game. There are lods of different units in this game and 
 buildings in this game. The thing you really need to know it this game is not as good as gamespot 
 told us but honestly this game is absolutly a masterpiece! 
  
  There are different types of tribes you would wanna be. Age of empires is not as perfect we thought 
 it would be but still a great game, there are some things you might not reckonize in da game but 
 it would not pursuade you to exit the game. Another features which is scenerio editor which allows 
 you create maps, yes maps! This game has a few bugs when the shipment which was dissapointing.

Review:  Age Of Empires For PC.
  
  Age of Empires is the first in its series of great and unique games. There have been many attempts 
 to create a great strategy game as this but none have come close (With the exception of the Civilization 
 series) this has started the War-Strategy franchise that most series still try and recapture today.
 
  
  Gameplay : This game simply plays amazingly, there are the standard scenarios where you can start 
 as a little village and venture out and become the dominant ruler of the lands. My favorite; the 
 custom maps, which allow you to create your own challenge or own unique map fit to your likings. 
 You'll notice I took a point off; the reason being is because of the last mode which is online/network 
 gaming. This doesn't actually capture the real feeling of what Age of Empires really is, and can 
 be quite confusing for starting players. Starts out just like any other RTS. In this game you mine 
 gold and stone, pick berries, farm, catch fish, kill animals for food, and chop down trees for wood. You 
 need all these resources to get different types of buildings/units from the game. You can build 
 various of units differing from Archers to elephant archers, Swordsmen to the next headless horsemen. To 
 go along with the lots of units, theres also alot of buildings you can build for the different types 
 of units or for upgrades and such. This game does require some strategy if you got some, or you can 
 learn while playing the game. You can play with up to 8 players in game, such as you and 7 other 
 computer players, or you can go online and play with vast amounts of people from the world. This 
 game also has an intriging campaign which interacts with real history (which i'll talk more about 
 later) It also has alot of different civilizations like the  
 and persian. This game also comes with the capibilitiy of making your own level. To go along with 
 that, there is alot of different modes you can do, such as Death matches (start out with alot of 
 resources) Campaign mode (learn about civilazations and go back in history) Multiplay (will talk aout 
 this later) Scenarios (which you can play and they are already set up maps, lots of fun) and more. Also 
 this game generates maps so most likly you will never get the same map twice. (less you play it 
 alot) There is also some good patches for you to downlaod for this game, like population 200 (which 
 is sweet) and more.
  
  Graphics : Here is where this game perfects every little aspect games are missing in this type 
 of genre. The graphics are amazing for this time period, each character has his/her/it own unique 
 look. Every person moves so human like it's kind of scary. Now there's the background with every 
 tree looking so much different and real than any other game out there. 
  
  Sound : The sounds from this game are pretty good. The mining of stone, the lamb sound of farms, the 
 battles, this game does have very good sound effects. you can even press number 1-25 and say sayings/taunts 
 that talk.
  
  Every character moves almost perfectly, the legs and arms are great and so are the attacks they 
 make. There is a problem in this area that includes the moving of groups. While moving with a group 
 of similar units, they will all make the same move at the same time so it looks like they're robotic 
 soldiers moving into battle, which take some (but little) of the realness away from the game experience. 
 Other than that it's quite easy to move your guys where you want them to go, which doesn't get 
 them killed in battle by having them misinterpret your command and keep on running while they are 
 being struck.
  
  This is a difficult thing to rate for a few reasons. When playing the regular single player, custom 
 maps, or scenarios you'll want to start on easiest difficulty which takes a few games to finally 
 realize This is incredibly easy and switch it to the hardest difficulty with still just a hint 
 of a challenge. Then there's the death match mode which is insanely hard unless you are a pro, 
 even with easiest setting this can make your eyes bulge. There are still many different settings 
 which barely raise or lower the difficulty setting.
  
  Here's one of those games that just makes you want to keep coming back and back to play, or create 
 a new and rich gaming experience. With so many units, and map items that makes it very difficult 
 to re-create the same map twice. These are one of those games you just want to keep coming back 
 again and again to experience.
  
  I strongly recommend you to buy this game, you should still be able to find this game for under 
 $19.99, or else just try online stores like amazon, ebay, ebgames or gamestop. Be sure to read 
 the final tips in deciding on your purchase of this game. But there is the sequel which improves 
 on everything, so get this if you don't want the sequel.

Review:  A Great Game . 
  Anybody who has a lot of time to waste can waste his time in this game. This game features Eight 
 civilizations But they dont have anything different .
  There is no much variation in troops in whatever civilizaton you are.
  No civilization has any 
 speciality.
  Best of its time but not now.
  All scenarios have a very good historic background.
  There are 8 civilizations but only 2 types 
 of buildings are there {except hut}
  The introduction movie is so good that the game looks too less against it.
  Games are too long.
 
  There is no religion but still monotheism is prevelant i cant understand.
  Frustrating, that priests with magic can convert enemy bldgs into their own.
  The different types 
 of soldiers are good enough.
  The scenario builder is not complex.
  The different types of scenarios are good.
  Island skipping are Enjoyable.
  Speciality is that 
 it was my second game of my whole life.
  Only for History Lovers.

Review:  Anyone who has played the later Age of Empires games know that they've really come a long way since 
 the original game was released. The graphics have become better, for instance the buildings and 
 people don't seem as odd looking anymore in the newer versions. But if we head back almost 10 years 
 to when the game first came out, it was a very well done piece of work.
  
  The gameplay is basically the same as any other real time strategy game. It comes packed with ages, 
 upgrades, and units of all different shapes and sizes. The storymode itself is pretty good, but 
 the thing that really caught me was the multiplayer. Even on slower connections, this game will 
 run pretty smoothly and is enjoyable. There is a pretty steep learning curve though, as more hardcore 
 players who know the game better can easily take out new players to the game.
  
  Features that should have been implemented into the original game, like gates and better proportions 
 for characters, are available in AoE II. Even though the game was really well done for its time, 
 there was still room for improvement that could have been completed in the original Age of Empires 
 game.

Review:  Okay first of all, this game is an older RTS, its been around nearly 10 years, yet I can't say 
 its not enjoyable or enjoyable to play anymore. So what I plan to do is do the best I can with 
 this review, as if I just played it 9 years ago and not by today's standards, like I did with the 
 other games. 
  
  1) Gameplay it is simple, you basically have your peasants, hunting, mining, and lumbering, for 
 resources to help your empire rise to be the number one power in the overall game. You stock up 
 on resources, build important structures, research technologies to improve your empire, Rise up 
 an Army strong enough to defend your Empire, and strong enough to expand it, meaning destroy or 
 convert your enemies. That basically sums up the entire gameplay. A Rise, Conquer , and/or Destroy 
 concept game, nothing more, nothing less. The up side to this is that nothing like this, had been 
 approached before other than the Civilization game, it was really special, because it focused on 
 the more enjoyable concepts of the Civilization game, without having to worry about all the other 
 nonsense in the game. It was and is a Gather Resources, Build and Army, Upgrade your Empire, and 
 Destroy the Enemy type game. Nothing like this had been so dramaically focused on.
  
  Bad side to the game is its too slow, building an Army took forever, and building numerious amounts 
 of infantry, war machines, and preists, also takes way too long, it kills the excitment level ,knowing 
 that you and your enemy are restricted in speed to raise up an army and destroy or convert them. 
 Also gathering resources really slows down the gameplay excitment. So this hurts the gameplay dramaically. 
 However the concept of this type of game was and is great for its time.
  
  2) Graphics, Somewhat impressive for the day it was released, I remember it being very buggy and 
 slow in certian areas, but for its day I would give them a good solid 4 stars for what they accomplenished 
 back then in those days.
  
  3) Storyline Probally the most interesting part about the game other than actually playing it, 
 its knowing that your in a time period, thousands of years before the Roman Empire, it makes you 
 feel like you were playing in that time period. with everything being slow and steady. it makes 
 you feel like your actually controlling the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Greeks. Very much Impressive 
 for its time. knowing this is what drives the overall storyline in the trilogy, its cool that they 
 started way back here, and advance through Historical periods. 
  
  4) Overall this I give a 7 out of 10, especially remember playing it back in the day.

Review:  this game is full of great things. it is a really fun expierence going off and killing your enemies 
 with massive assault troops. (or whatever else u may get) the computers in this game even though 
 pretty dumb, can pull some quick moves on u if ur not fast enough. So the graphics arent the best 
 but there still better then some. the gameplay is simple to understand and trust me when i say 
 this, but if i can play this game, anyone can. Its that easy.
  
  overall (even though i hardly said anything) this game is fufiling in making u feel supieror to 
 ur friends if u play them online. its a Fun Expierience

Review:  This game is very fun to play though there are many flaws, but all in all it is a game worth buying 
 considering it is now only a couple of dollars becuase of its age. My only major complaint is that 
 often time the combat doesn't seem strategic, it meerely seems like whoever can throw the most 
 units or replace their units the quickest is going to win. Maybe that is just me though. 
  
  However, as good as this game is, it is not as good as most strategy games out today. I still 
 play it every now and then, but not as often as Hearts of Iron II, Red Alert 2, or Age of Empires 
 2. (Something about games ending in 2, eh) However, if you want to play a game in ancient Roman 
 times, it seems that you would either need Empire Earth (sorry if I am wrong, I don't have Empire 
 Earth) or this, as most strategy games deal with other time periods or settings.
  
  A good game if you want a solid, cheap strategy game that will run on any computer. Over the years 
 I have played this a lot here and there, it is will probably be one of the few games that doesn't 
 grow old after the first year or so of playing it. Good back-up game.

Review:  This game is nice, the first time i played it i loved it, and also its supports low quality and 
 have amazing graphics. i give this game a score of 6.0 because once you play it alot you'll get 
 bored of it but then after a long time you will want to play it again, and of course you will. 
 this is a pc game microsoft created it, and trust me iam not a microsoft fan but i have to congradulate 
 them for making the pc but if that was on xbox or something i would'nt be making this review.

Review:  The game was supposed to be Warcraft with a Civilization twist. Too bad it wasn't either. The original 
 Warcraft exceeds this game by a lot. Civilization will only be sampled in this game as you don't 
 get much Civilization from it.
  
  The AI is way too good for you. Your units are really dumb. Almost to the point where you wonder 
 how they could have found out how to use this technology.
  
  The contructing of buildings/units in this game is a little too slow for my taste. 
  
  The 
 campaign is boring for me. It is too repetitive and just plain boring.
  
  This was a game that had potentail, but didn't live up to it.

Review:  Even though this game is pretty old now, it's still has it's strengths (and weaknesses)
  
  There are sequals to this game, but if you only have a few bucks, you can easily have fun with 
 this game.
  
  Graphics- All right, I guess. Not the best. Your people aren't the biggest, and your buildings 
 tend to get confusing between which one is which, but all in all, still good.
  
  Sounds- Pretty good. I liked the sound of this game. Maybe it's not as good as I remember, but 
 I still like it.
  
  Playability- besides the fact that you have building 'trees' and different building produce different 
 things, (just the like any other RTS) . But once you have the handle on these, all is good.
  
  The different stages in history really make this game shine. That's why I bought it in the 
 first place. I liked playing the stone and iron age more than the others, but other people may 
 have other tastes, and this game caters to them.
  
  Replayability- the single player missions are all right. You can choose your empire, and work through 
 them. This adds a certain replayability.
  
  Muti-player is best for replayability of course. Get a few friends together and try to take out 
 each other's empire is a fun way to waiste and evening. Just remember not to take it too seriously.

Review:  Age of Empires may not have been the revolutionary step forward in RTS games players had been looking 
 for in 1997, but it was a good starting point for an excellent series.
  
  AOE had a good base concept: to deliver a Warcraft-style game set in the early history of our planet. 
 What I liked most about the single player campaigns (and this holds true for all the AOE games 
 that followed) was how they taught the player a bit about how our word started off and the challenges 
 our early civilizations faced. Granted, games like Sid Meier's Civilization covered the same territory, 
 but something about AOE's approach made the experience more immersive to me.
  
  Of course, there was also the map editor. This was the first time I had ever come across a game 
 that allowed me to build my own levels and I ended up spending countless hours making all sorts 
 of crazy scenarios. I commend producers that offer a map editor along with their games as they 
 tend to give the respective game far more worth in terms of gameplay possibilities as well as an 
 extended lifespan within the gamer community.
  
  Now, of course, Age of Empires had its downsides. It was released with numerous bugs and minor 
 glitches that sometimes caused the game to crash without warning if a number of them occurred at 
 once. There were also problems with the AI, namely its inability to traverse across the map without 
 getting stuck in nooks and crannies along the way. The enemy AI also tended to completely lack 
 a sense of self-preservation, but I don't hold that against the game as much as that was the norm 
 for AIs of the day.
  
  All in all, while Age of Empires may not have stood out as a bright star in the overall games line-up 
 of 1997, it certainly had its own charm. I would recommend it to anyone who has some spare time 
 to try out old-school games and especially to anyone who wants to know what got the AOE series 
 started.

Review:  Way back in 1997, the Age Of Empires series began, and I must say I am happy for that. This game 
 is a some-what classic, but it's still fun today.
  
  The graphics in AOE are very good for a '97 game. Brilliant 2-D graphics and sounds make the game 
 good by itself. The gameplay is a bit sloppy at times... Especially if say: About 5 or so of your 
 villagers are building a Wonder and the enemy army come and destroy it when you only just started. 
 The villagers don't do anything about and get killed afterwards. Plus your resources you used to 
 build it don't come back.
  
  Apart from that, this is a very enjoyable game. Fans of Warcraft type game swill LOVE this.

Review:  I see many people hate this game. Why do you excactly hate it? I recently saw a review on another 
 site that said just a few lines. Here is a line:
  
  Oh, age of empires craps out. It is boring and too hard 2 play. 
  
  Don't just insult a game 
 because you don't know how to play it, because, that is not acting like a true gamer. And yet, 
 how many discouraging and negative reviews does this game get? Those negative reviews for the AoE 
 series are often undetailed and short, perhaps they don't know the true reason that AoE sucks. 
 
  
  Gameplay and Story: Age of Empires places you on a map in an unexplored world, provides a few starting 
 units, and lets you begin building an empire. Each game unfolds the same way. You begin with a 
 town center and some villagers. The villagers are the basic laborers, and the town center enables 
 you to build more of them and expand your settlement. The villagers are central to AOE: they gather 
 resources, build structures, and repair units and buildings. Resources come in four forms: wood, 
 food, stone, and gold. A certain amount of each is consumed to build various units and buildings, 
 research new technology, and advance a civ to the next age. But, one uneasy feeling, AoE. Why couldn't 
 you have invented a thing called catapult towers? Or made it for RoR? Those pathetic Ballista Towers 
 are bad. The problem is that while enemy AI is savvy and aggressive (it can afford to be since 
 it appears to cheat with resources) , your units are bone-stupid. Path-finding is appallingly botched, 
 with units easily getting lost or stuck. There is a waypoint system, but that hardly makes up for 
 the fact that your units have trouble moving from point A to point B if you don't utilize it.
 
  
  There are about 4 stories/campaigns that are fun to play. You can also create your own. At the 
 end of each campaign level completed sucsessfully, you get a history lesson out of the computer. 
 One fact - not enough for your homework. A bad thing is, if you unsucsessfully complete a game 
 (failure 0) , you don't get a history lesson, you get an insulting and discouraging kick up your 
 ass. Uh, Microsoft AoE, you don't have to take a level failure 0 so seriously. It is just a game, 
 not a real life failure big fat 0's. 
  
  The graphics is pretty simple and straight forward. There is some cutscenes that actually looks 
 great and life-like. But, sometimes, when you change your game settings for your computer screen, 
 the whole screen slowdowns and it all turns green, purple and blue.
  
  The audio is good. If you just hear a Broad Swordsman fight another Axeman, Long Swordsman or anything 
 else, you can hear the clash of the sword. Another example is the Watch Tower, Sentry Tower and 
 Guard Tower. The the sound of the arrows is simply amazing. Infact, it is not just those towers. 
 It is also every unit from the Archery Range. The song puts you in a pretty good mood. I found 
 myself humming it (pretty stupid to imagine) . Why did I confess it? Anyway, some unit sounds are 
 pure bullcrappy. The Tririeme (whatever you spell it) makes a purely annoying GRR! noise and you 
 will get pissed off in a while. Infact, it is also the Ballista, Helepolis and Ballista Tower. 
 lol, so crappy and that is the main reason I took a point off the audio.
  
  Replay Value in this game is absolutely immerse and great. Some levels like Multiplayer Intruder 
 (2-player only) is so good, you can not possibly imagine the fun I had. Or the campaign level, 
 Holy Man. But, that was not as good as Intruder. Getting out of track here.
  
  *Inserts bag guy music* SO, it has come. Should you buy it or not? Depends, yet again. If you hate 
 history, there is simply no reason of what you are doing here. No reason. And, don't get it. If 
 you hate annoying sound, or gay graphics, there is also no reason for you to get this game, but, 
 to simply borrow. If you like history, don't mind annoying stuff, slowdowns and all that, I think 
 that you would be off to the stores by the next Black Friday I write this review (October 13, 2006) . 
 
  
  Overall AoE has earned its place in gaming history. It was and still is fun to play for those craving 
 a bit of nostalgia to all the flashy 3D games out there today. A classic in its own right, AoE 
 set its own precedents back then, maybe subsconciously, but they were set. After that the RTS flood 
 gates were opened onto a new world in which to perpetuate themselves and become one of the most 
 highly rated and most played genres on the PC till this day. I highly recommend this to someone 
 just getting into the genre and who wouldn't mind playing an older game, or for those curious and 
 want to see where the roots of RTS gaming lie. Also, for those on a not so powerful PC but don't 
 want to be left out of the fun, even the weakest PC of today could run this game now with flying 
 colors.

Review:  :Good Idea:
  Land Grab in which you try to conquer as much land as you can. That's just a great mode that's 
 hard and well worth the accomplishment.
  Building a Wonder actually could help you win the game, no matter how much you haven't been attacking.
 
  Random map generator.
  
  :Bad Idea:
  Not enough differences between ages.
  No stat system.
  Too tempting to cheat with the nuclear unit. Gaaa!
  
  :Overall:
  A 
 terrific game from back in the day. Any Age of Empires fan should already have played this and 
 if not, you're just a playa. If you haven't played it and can't afford today's high priced games, 
 this is a very entertaining game.

Review:  This is definantly a ground breaking game. It does something that few games can. It made history 
 fun. This game, believe it or not, got me into history. The campaigns provide interesting historical 
 facts and lets you play as some of the greatest civilizations ever. 
  By advancing your civilation, you can create an army and destroy all who stand in your way. One 
 of the coolest things is that you start off as a civilization where it started and progress from 
 there.
  One of the game's greatest features is creating your own maps, scenarios, and campaigns. It is 
 enough to keep every emperor occupied for hours at a time.

Review:  Age of Empires is actually one of my first game experiences. I can still remember how hard I though 
 it were in the start, but later I understood the game, and overall it's actually a pretty good 
 game. But the game has its ups and downs. Like the boring sound effects and the no-point single 
 player campaign. And don't forget the single player opportunities. Somehow that's bad. But the 
 gameplay itself isn't so bad. Once you've started a game against the computer, it's actually quite 
 fun. 
  
  The gameplay has some minor issues, but as mentioned before, quite fun. It's very exciting and 
 entertaining to create a huge army and crush your opponent with a stunning victory. In a more detailed 
 way, Age of Empires doesn't have so much to offer, compared to other games. But Age of Empires 
 actually has a Map Editor and this is somehow great fun, for those who likes to create their own 
 scenario.
  
  The graphics is pretty simple and straight forward. There is some cutscenes that actually looks 
 great and life-like. But anyways there's actually not so much to say about the graphics. 
  
  The sound is incredible boring and totally broken. The villager and soldier voices is crappy 
 and very stupid to hear. The only good thing about the sound is the music. It creates a good mood.
 
  
  Not that much replay value, but the single player against a computer, is something you have to 
 play more than once.
  
  If you're a really big fan of real-time strategy games, then buy Age of Empires, but anyways don't. 
 Go buy Age of Empires 2 or 3.

Review:  Microsofts first move into the rts genre isnt a good one. I mean they make the Pc goddammit they 
 should make better games. The graphics arnt very good and the movie clips are crap. The 4 campains 
 are pretty good though. I dont really reccomend this game because theres loads of others and you 
 should pick up one like age of mythology or AOE 2 or 3. Overall the game isnt that bad but i really 
 dont reccomend buying it (it may be cheap now though so check) get age of mythology or another 
 age of empires instead this isnt worth your time or effort.

Review:  This was a great break from playing Starcraft! I enjoyed playing this one for the simple fact that 
 the plot was in the ancient times. Using old cultures to build an empire. The graphics were in 
 need of help, but I had tons of fun playing! I was able to sneak this into work, and play on our 
 network with it with another co-worker. It's system requirements allowed us to... lol. Not that 
 hard to figure out, but the game handles just like any other RTS. Upgrade weapons, and at buildings, 
 and control mass amounts of troops to invade another race. The replay of this game lasted a long 
 time. I wouldn't mind playing this more. I have to shake AOE 3 now though. They had some cool cheats 
 to implement when I was tired of the same ting over, and over again. One I liked was the car!... lol

Review:  When I review a game as old as this now I will review it and score it appropriately as when I first 
 played it. I will not score this game according to the standards of today, rather, I will score 
 it according to the standards of ITS day when it came out. That is only fair to the game.
  
  Let me first start out with a most unobjective view: I love this series. I just love it. AoE 
 is the very reason why I am a PC gamer today. This single game did double duty on me. First, it 
 turned me on to PC gaming. And second, it made me cognizant of the RTS genre which, at this point 
 in time, was really just being born. THIS was the game I remember I wanted. History being one of 
 my favorite subjects this game was a perfect match. I remember reading the articles in magazines 
 and looking at the (back then) incredible screenshots of this game. Holy crap. No game had ever 
 made me want it so bad. I remember when I bought it, sitting in the car, turning it over in my 
 hands and looking at the screenshots on the back box cover. Then actually opening it and seeing 
 the enormous tech tree poster that was included. This was a totally new experience for me. Up until 
 then all my gaming consisted of consoles, but this was new. PC gaming. I remember I bought the 
 game not knowing (or even caring) if my 486 Pentium could even RUN it let alone play it smoothly! 
 But I didn't care. This game held some power over me.
  
  The premise was unique: You start out humbly in the Stone Age and must survive all manner of dangers. 
 From the environment to neighboring tribes. You must then build a successful civilization and guide 
 it through the four ages of Stone, Tool, Bronze and Iron. For each age you entered brought on new 
 technologies, buildings and wonders to discover. You could play the game however you liked. Will 
 you be hostile and build up your military, or would you be more laid back and try a economic approach? 
 It was all up to you.
  
  You built your thriving civilization on basic fundamentals such as wood, stone, food and gold. 
 Winning the game could be done through a variety of ways. Through straight up conquest and obliteration 
 of your enemies. Or you could amass great amounts of materials and build a wonder. If your wonder 
 stands for 1,000 years you automatically win. You could also win through economic means and by 
 cultivating a strong economic base. The options were suited to pretty much every type of player.
 
  
  Speaking of player, multiplayer is where the real action was. It was all right to face off against 
 the PC AI opponents, but nothing can beat a human vs. another human, and AoE shined in spades with 
 its multiplayer aspect. Being able to customize your maps to almost any design you wished, the 
 replay value was enormous. Setting different parameters and restrictions for each match ensured 
 that no two multiplayer matches would ever be the same. Up to eight players could play on-line 
 either on teams or one for all. It was often he who clicked the fastest clicked last as he would 
 probably be the only guy left alive after a heated match. It was definitely not for the weak hearted, 
 as there was a lot of strategizing and thinking on your feet that would determine the winner. Being 
 able to react at a moments notice and knowing exactly what to do if a situation turned for the 
 worse. These were moments that defined RTS multiplayer and are the reason it is so popular today.
 
  
  With each new age brought new military units as well. Upgrade your club toting barbarian to a semi-civilized 
 sword carrying militia. All the units of the different civilizations were balanced out well. Taking 
 a rock-paper-scissors approach, virtually every strong unit had a weakness against another, and 
 that unit a weakness towards another and so on. If you find yourself getting charged by cavalry 
 train some phalanx to take them out. Likewise if you're repeatedly dying from volleys of arrow 
 fire train up some cavalry to charge their ranks. You should experiment with the different units, 
 and don't get trapped into using just one since a successful army contains a balance of every type 
 of troop.
  
  The ancient world comes mildly to life with the sound effects. The music in AoE is nothing special, 
 and the various sound effects you'll hear - a villager answering your beck and call to a soldier's 
 last death throes - are serviceable. As far as graphics they were pretty impressive for their time. 
 The 2D sprites move fluidly and all the animations of the different units in different situations 
 are smooth. 
  
  Overall AoE has earned its place in gaming history. It was and still is fun to play for those craving 
 a bit of nostalgia to all the flashy 3D games out there today. A classic in its own right, AoE 
 set its own precedents back then, maybe subsconciously, but they were set. After that the RTS flood 
 gates were opened onto a new world in which to perpetuate themselves and become one of the most

Review:  Over all this is a pretty nice game to play i would rather play other RTS then this one. The AI 
 are really freakin stupid and not very hard at all. The map editor in this game would add some 
 bonus points, but every time i make a map the AI does hardly anything. The game doesnt really have 
 a great battle system all you have to do is take a few guys in at a time to destroy a whole city 
 just didnt make much sense to me. The campaign mode is decent no missions that are all that difficult 
 . Age of Empires 2 is a great game and adds alot that they forgot in this one.

Review:  Although this gamed tended to crash alot, this game was still enjoyable to play against the computer 
 and other people online. I was kinda disappointed in the fact on how much you could dominate people 
 with the catapults, especially witht the Hittites. But other than that, the game is solid. It has 
 some pretty nice music and there were a few good ideas for the first time around. Although they 
 do eventually improve on the farming techniques in the future, I wished they could have put the 
 farmer upgrade they have now in this game, then it would have been a way better gaming experience, 
 because I spend way too much time taking care of the resources. And that was another issue, the 
 resources tended to run out at the worst times. But by that time, you should have won the game 
 by then. A personal favorite unit was the War elephant. Man those things were unstoppable at the 
 time. Overall, A good game, decent graphics for the system it usually ran on during its time, pretty 
 good gameplay, but dont buy this now to play it, check out age of empires 3 instead. Good for your 
 collection or archive or whatever you want to call it.

Review:  For the time that this came out I was greatly impressed with the game. It had good graphics, sound 
 and AI. Also the fact that it was kinda the first in its sub-genre so to speak. Now adays there 
 are soo many RTS that do the ancient theme and I think that the AoA series has always done the 
 best job bar-none. In all honesty, I still have this installed in my desktop after all the years 
 that I have had it and just thinking about it I kinda want to go through and play it again. One 
 of the classics!

Review:  When I first played Age of Empires. I was so surprised. I was surprised how bad it was. It was 
 one of the worst games I have ever played. It had so bad graphics, it took me so long to understand 
 it. It also had bad graphics! I can say that, this was the game that also had the worst sound. 
 It would take me pages to tell, how bad this game was. However it got better in the series after 
 a time, and Age of Empires 2 came out. Way better graphics. I would say that it was the worst game 
 ever. I am disappointed

Review:  A good game that gets you hooked straight away!
  Its very easy to play. And there's lots of ways to play it!
  You got a good variety of quests, 
 levels, fighters-eg, warriers, bowmen, horse men, etc and can all be upgraded to bigger and better 
 things.
  You can pick up how to play the game straight away in about an hour at least!
  At first there seems like an endless amount of levels to complete, even later on you realize there 
 were a fair few.
  You feel in complete control of your civilisation and how you set it out. In my oppinion-its one 
 of the best simulation games to have ever have come out-a whole unique series!
  Graphics aren't bad for a simulation game.
  You don't need great graphics to enjoy the build 
 up and destroy the other civilisation thing. The graphics look like comic drawings in a way.
  Sound isn't too bad. A bit limited though. There could have been a bit more of a variety.

Review:  The first time I played this game I was hooked couldn't get of the computer. This game was the 
 first pc game I played I was so exicted when I first got it. The graphics could have been better 
 but who cares, the game was fun to play. There is a few downsides to the game its good when you 
 first play it but it can get a little boring. Then you find out the cheats and the is easy. But 
 after a while of not playing it you will want to try it again. I have had the game for years, and 
 i own over 300 games but sometimes I will get the game out. if you own a pc of any kind you should 
 this game. I recommend this game.

Review:  Age of Empires is an amazing game and series. This is the first installment in this series and 
 it is a great start. This game made me a fan from the moment I got the hang of it. AoE always you 
 to take your civilzation from its primative Stone Age tribe into a thriving Iron Age civilization 
 while all the while trying to conquer the known world. Depending on the game settings you must 
 win your chosen scenario by either building a wonder, collecting and holding artifacts/ruins or 
 crushing your enemies with brute force and military prowess.
  Age of Empires is a great game, but it needs to work on your allies. For some reason your allies 
 become offended and turn on you when their troops walk into you catapult fire - duh. Other than 
 that the game runs without any problems. Some might say the game gets monotonous when trying to 
 conquer the world, but ever strategy game starts over with each new level. Its part of the game. 
 I'd recommend this game to anyone.

Review:  Microsoft has decided to make a game about something that they are experts on, the rise of an empire. 
 At first glance, Age of Empires looks sort of like a cross between Civilization 2 and Warcraft 
 II, and that is a fairly accurate comparison. Age of Empires is a real-time strategy game set in 
 the eras from the formation of the first civilizations to the end of the iron age. Although the 
 time period of Age of Empires limits the technology available to the player, this is compensated 
 for by making a very detailed game world full of historical depth. 
  
  You typically start each game with a town center, a few peasants, and stone age technology. Your 
 first priorities are building shelter and, like the good hunter/gatherer that you are, hunting 
 and gathering food. With food and shelter, you are free to create more peasants who in turn can 
 be sent out to chop wood, quarry stone, or mine gold. Eventually, you build more complex structures 
 and are able to increase your technological level. Oddly, to raise your technology level, you do 
 not assign peasants to be scientists or scribes, but instead you spend food. I have never known 
 of a situation where food buys technological progress, perhaps the scientists won't work unless 
 you throw a banquet. 
  
  Increased technology allows you to construct more advanced units, of which there are many. There 
 are a total of 40 units, which is actually a great amount of detail for a historical period which 
 ends before the renaissance. There are 7 different types of archers, 9 types of infantry, and 11 
 types of boats. All in all, the many types of units allows Age of Empires to very closely model 
 the types of armies in use 2000 years ago. Age of Empires has 12 ancient civilizations available 
 to the player. Each civilization has certain units not available, however they gain certain bonuses 
 for whatever aspect that civilization excelled at. For example, the Greeks can produce advanced 
 infantry more quickly, while the Persians are excellent hunters. Microsoft obviously did its research 
 here, and the result is a well rounded, historically accurate product (at least for a game) . 
 
  
  The resource model of Age of Empires wins both praise and condemnation from me. Scattered across 
 the board are many different types of resources, including berry bushes, forests, quarries, mines, 
 wild game, and fish stocks. It is nice to see mankind's interaction with nature when gathering 
 resources instead of the simple 'ore harvester' or whatever. You can watch your little people pick 
 berries, cut down trees, mine gold, and hunt and butcher wild animals. One problem I have with 
 the resources is the lack of the bounty of nature. A typical game might last 10,000 'years' and 
 in all that time, animals do not reproduce, and berries and forests do not regrow. This basically 
 means that you are stuck with the amount of resources that the map comes with, leaving you with 
 no incentive to conserve for the future generations. If you started with 10 gazelles, you will 
 never get any new ones, you will only lose them from hunting and predation from lions. (I must 
 admit, it's pretty neat to see a lion eat a gazelle in a computer game) 
  
  Another problem with the resource model is the handling of food. No, I'm not talking about dangers 
 from undercooked meat, I'm talking about the food supply. It takes food to create villagers and 
 soldiers. I have no problem with that. I fail to see why it takes 30 villagers-worth of food to 
 upgrade a catapult trireme to a juggernaut. Also, villagers don't eat. Your populace can stand 
 around for thousands of years and never need a bite. This causes a problem with siege tactics. 
 The tired and true strategy of destroying farms to kill of the population just doesn't work. Also, 
 the units most useful when under siege, such as the catapult, require no food to create. 
  
  Despite its flaws, Age of Empires is great fun to play. The graphics and sound effects are 
 of high quality, and the computer plays a respectable game. In fact, there is a very large selection 
 of AIs to choose from in the scenario editor. Ah... the scenario editor. The scenario editor allows 
 you total control in the design of scenarios and campaigns, right down to the intro movies. Even 
 if you don't like the full selection of scenarios included with the game you have all the tool 
 at your disposal to create a scenario exactly to your liking. Its minor annoyances are just that, 
 minor compared to the game as a whole. For any fan of real-time strategy or historical simulations, 
 I would recommend Age of Empires.

Review:  Age of Empires was released in 1997, a year that saw Quake 2 and other future giants of gaming. 
 It was not easy for an RTS in 1997 to distinguish itself, especially with such hard hitters as 
 the previously mentioned Quake 2 and the RTS giants of such companies as Blizzard and Westwood. 
 To top it all of, Blizzard's Starcraft, one of the most expected RTSes ever (and which later became 
 the most successful RTS ever created) was coming out 4 months after AOE. However, with all these 
 hardships AOE still managed the impossible... to be so distinct, so refreshing and well made that 
 it spawned a genre by itself. This is the story of the first ''Age'' game ever created!
  
  Graphics: 8/10
  
  Rating the graphics of AOE is totally up to the players perception of good 
 graphics. The game sports extremely fluid animations and superbly intricate building and unit models. 
 The architecture of the 12 different nations is split into 4 distinct categories (Arabian, Chinese, 
 Greek, African) . All of these architectures sport different building models and different wonders 
 (The Hanging Gardens, Colossus, etc.) . The amount of detail that went into these buildings is still 
 impressive to this day. As is the high resolution and amount of detail given to the menial tasks 
 of the villagers (carrying gold, harvesting fruit, etc.) . These graphics were quite a blessing 
 in 1997.
  
  However, the graphics engine is far from perfect. The terrain you get to fight on seems a bit bland. 
 As do the building explosions and some (although very few) of the unit deaths.
  
  Overall though, these graphics were amazing in 1997 and are still pretty good to this day.
  
 
  Sound: 6/10
  
  Giving this category a 6 is being generous. The sound in Age of Empires is little more then specter 
 of what it should be. There are hardly any spoken responses from units and the music ranges from 
 OK at best to downright horrible at times. The sound effects, however, are well made and fit the 
 mood pretty well.
  
  Gameplay: 7/10
  
  This is the game that invented the genre, definitely not the one that perfected it (that honor 
 is reserved to the excellent AOE2) . As such don't expect this category to be perfect.
  
  The gameplay in AOE is truly basic by todays standards. You harvest a maximum of 4 types of resources, 
 gold, food, wood, stone; with your harvested amount you build citizens, armies, buildings, wonders, 
 etc. It's basic but at the same time it's hella' fun. The game has no barriers on how many people 
 can harvest a resource, however, resources themselves are extremely limited. This means that you 
 will have to fight often and as early on as possible to acquire more territory, thus more resources 
 since with the initial gold patches you will be building 2 ''armies'' at most. This actually keeps 
 the game moving at an unbelievably well crafted pace. You won't necessarily have 2 hour wait periods 
 (yes EE, I'm looking at you) in which you get prepared to rush with clubmen.
  
  Speaking about rushing this game's military aspect is great. There are a couple of dusin units 
 for you to chose from through the ages giving you a pretty good choice of what to use. There won't 
 be much of a problem choosing or deciding which forces to combine since the ''Paper-Rock-Scissors'' 
 (PRS) style of play reaches it's peak at the fact that horses are faster then archers. This leads 
 to some problems. Mostly the fact that extremely powerful (nation based) Cataprachs and War Elephants 
 can raze an army off the face of the earth in a matter of minutes. Which in term leads to some 
 pretty big unit imbalances. But this is 1997 people it's not like they knew how to perfect the 
 genre back then. And even as problems like these arise this games military component plays great. 
 There are a plethora of strategies to choose from, units have such stances as ''Stand Guard'' (which 
 was amazing for 1997) and better yet, groups can be made out of an almost endless pool of units. 
 And even without PRS style the game manages to balance itself out with the fact that advanced units 
 take a ton of gold to build and getting armies of super enhanced Cataprachs killed by catapults 
 and archers is never, ever a pleasurable sight. Now, mind you, a good tactician can obliterate 
 such possibilities out of the water. But, I guess what I'm trying to say is that this isn't C&Cs 
 50-Tank-Rush. NO! It's far more temperate.
  
  The tech tree in the game is pretty big. There are about 100 inventions (including military) to 
 research. In most games you won't even get to reach ''the end'' of the Iron Age, so there certainly 
 is no shortage of inventions to keep you busy through the game. But there is more then a reason 
 why I gave gameplay a 7 and not a 10. The tech tree is a pretty big part of my decision. More importantly 
 a little invention called ''Jihad''. See this little invention says that your citizens become faster, 
 get more hp, and more attack, etc. You research it (as it would seem logical) and then come to 
 the following conclusion: In exchange for lightning fast cities you sacrifice their carrying capacity 
 form 13-15 to 2-5... Nowhere ever in any part of the manual is this even as much as implied. It's 
 annoying as hell. And there are other small examples like this that you have to ''experiment'' 
 with.
  
  Civilizations themselves are balanced with the exception of a few thorns in ones back side. Mostly 
 the Chosens, Egyptians and Greeks. See each of these guys have absurd bonuses. The Chosen have 
 such powerful priest bonuses that by combining 12-20 Priests and 10-15 Cataprachs together you 
 will be dominating the map with a 100/50 pop limit (since priests can convert enemy units to your 
 ranks) . Another problem with the civs is that, with the exception of their building styles, the 
 only difference between them is the ability to purchase super upgrades such as War Elephants, or 
 Chataprachs. This gives people like the Greeks a huge advantage since they can develop Centurions 
 and Cataprachs while others can only develop, the relatively useless, Heleopolis (a huge super 
 ballista that hits 1/10000000000000000000000000 times) . Theses differences and unbalances do make 
 the game feel... well... different, for better or worse.
  
  Other general gameplay issues revolve around the boring as hell campaigns and the fact that wonders 
 are just for prettying up your cities since they don't do a damn thing. There are plenty of maps 
 to choose from, but the pop limit is way too small (50) . This was fixed in a patch, so at some 
 extent, that's not a problem anymore. A paper-thin diplomacy option also comes included in the 
 overall package. However, it's just about useless in anything but some campaigns and LAN matches.
 
  
  Multiplay: 10/10
  
  This game is a blast in multiplay. I have never experienced such superb gaming as the one found 
 while playing this game with 8 other people in a LAN party on a small map. Everyone bumping into 
 each other and forging alliances; switching tributes and fighting small skirmishes for 2 more food 
 bushes. It's all superb. Even with the unbalances and problems that the engine may have.
  
  Overall: 8/10
  
  This game started a genre. It was not perfect, and it still isn't. However, 
 it was stable, fun and a blast in multiplayer. This game won't be regarded as the pinnacle of RTS 
 gaming by many, but it sure as hell is at least a pillar.

Review:  This game was the first game I got for PC and the minute I started playing I got hooked. I loved 
 the strategy style of game play because you had to think before you attacked. If you attacked too 
 quickly then you could be beat by a stronger army. I also loved the strength's and weakness's of 
 every unit. This made sure you had a balanced army. The only thing that I did not like in this 
 game was that there was barely any special unit for all the tribes. The only tribes that had some 
 were the Egyptians and Persians. Over all I was amazed by this game even if the graphics are now 
 dated.

Review:  Maybe the graphics is outdated and the features limited.
  BUT it is just so addicting, i know people who had to throw out the game because they couldn't 
 stop playing. No game will ever beat AoE. 
  It is the root of all RTS-games. If anyone ever liked a RTS they should try AoE. It's pure gameplay 
 without all the unnesecarities.
  
  It's not that hard to learn, but it takes forever to master the game. When to buy the men, or maybe 
 a technology.
  
  It's pretty much like the later games (AoE II & III) but more simple.
  
  It's a classic and absolutely worth playing.

Review:  This game is ok if you are into war games, but the only bad thing is that you can't advance very 
 far into time. The worst part about the game is the low population limit that is set on all the 
 games you play. There is also a very hard to build an army and work on keeping your other units 
 occupied. This is due to the fact that for every unit you have being made you much wait for it 
 to be done for you can build another. The game is based around ancient civilization times. There 
 are many different civilizations that you may pick from. The idea of this game is to build up your 
 civilization and conquer the world and everyone and everything that stands in your way. There are 
 land units and water units that can be used to attack your enemies. There are villagers to whom 
 are used to gather resources and build buildings.

Review:  Graphics: 9/10
  For its time in computer technology, the graphics of Age of Empires is quite reasonable already. 
 Although units may get stuck or the game be slightly twitchy, the detail's certainly there and 
 each unit at least looks unique. The units are a little small though.
  Sound: 9/10
  No problems with the sound, though it can get monotonous, since there's only 1 sound effect associated 
 with each unit and building. The only unit where there are many sounds is the villager.
  Gameplay: 10/10
  Microsoft has truly broken down the barriers to RTS gaming with Age of Empires. 
 This game excels at both single player and multiplayer, something unheard of before, and is still 
 rare today. The replay value, as for any RTS game, is almost infinite, until you get bored of the 
 units and sound effects themselves. But that is a small drawback to the gameplay, when you consider 
 the dozens of hours you spend preparing armies to ambush opponenets or wage all out war. This is 
 a true strategy game that also mixes with motor skills as players race each other to build the 
 largest army using the most efficient means.

Review:  The Ice Age has ended and a population growth spurs. The abundance of food and resources such as 
 tin, copper, bronze, and iron lead to the development of centuries, cohorts, legions, economical 
 vexillari, and complex autarchies. However, you are one tribe out of the many, who vie also for 
 dominion. Let your tribe rise to great heights and may you slaughter all your opponents to be imperator 
 of all!
  
  Age of Empires is a game that offers a good 2-D polygonel graphics, a rich scenario campaign, an 
 excellent innovation of logistics, theorems and stratagems. Multiplayer is top knotch with a FREE 
 pass to MSN and a great variety of patches await your beckon and call.
  
  The graphics though 2-D were the 'lingua franca' during its initial release and is still good quality. 
 The units can be seen, with intricate details such as mesh and scutums. Arrows take flight and 
 whales jump out of the adamantine seas.
  
  The game provides a fine cosmopolitan taste of history. Battles such as that of Actium and Andrianople 
 are re-enacted. Characters like Julius Caesar and Vercingetorix are available to be held in thrall 
 to your imperium. Hoplites with their long sarissas and bronze shields as well as legionnaires 
 with their lorica segmentatas are at your disposal. Triremes and pentekonters scale the high seas 
 and juggernauts move at a methiodical pace. Numerous formations are available such as the phalanx- 
 a dense formation, and the ability to spread about. You can flank your enemies and catch them in 
 a pincer with your hastati at hand, slaughtering the opponent's legios.
  
  Multiplayer is FREE and offers a great contingent of players who are available at every hour of 
 the day. You are given a connection to MSN Gaming zone which requires an account (which is also 
 FREE) . No decadence nor boredom here.
  
  All in all, Age of Empires is a splendid game. A wide variety of features available are at your 
 command. May you be the Dux Bellorum and may your reign be filled with wisdom. Splendid game!

Review:  This was my very first contact with a strategy game. Me and my bro sat in front of the PC trying 
 to figure it out. And after an hour we could not even get ourselves away from the PC.
  
  Although the game now looks absolutely crap, this will go down in my books as one of the best original 
 Strategy games. Before it got all confusing with all the different type of units and upgrades and 
 weirdo game play that all development companies try to add to make their game look or feel better 
 or different
  
  The game is simple. Get resources, upgrade, build the army and attack. The units are great, the 
 buildings are great. What an absolute classic. Haha
  
  Yeah I know. I'm sad. But hey. First love is always the best.

Review:  The tutorial for the game was really good, it help me steadily learn the game, but as I got more 
 into the game I noticed that the trees never regrow or expand as you play, so when you are out 
 of wood you are out!
  The Troops were excellent but they never were in formation or attack using the brains!
  
  The 
 graphics of the game is brilliant, highly detailed but the sound could have been better, when a 
 unit dies, they could make it a sort of gory death sound.
  
  I would recommend this game to other who like stragic games.

 that. Greeks, Hittites, Egyptians, Carthaginians and much more armies to control. This game should 
 last you for a good amount of time and even the movie at the start is more war realistic than the 
 second game's movie. With 8 campaigns, even more difficult the first one to the last one, should

Review:  Age of Empires was probably one of the first games that i had tried for the real time strategy. 
 Age of Empires was what started it all and has changed how strategy games are played.
  
  this game is really solid, with all the things you can do in this game, make it a good tasting 
 surprise that will have your nose on the screen while playing it, for a long time. Whether it be 
 doing missions, playing against the AI, or facing your friends, it's really fun.
  
  The graphics were decent for its time, and were above exceptional and deserve at least a little 
 credit for '96.
  
  The music however, can get really boring after a while and really just can get irritating, because 
 we kind of want music that suits more combat then peaceful waters, fick.
  
  Overall, strategy fans should pick this game up as well as the expansion and the other age of empire 
 games. Doing so, will keep you busy during your free time for many months to come!

Review:  I'm a big history buff and love the olden days, so this game caught my eye a long time ago. Looking 
 at the screenshots suggested grand battles and the ability to command the famous hoplites in battle. 
 Until I played this game, I realized how foolish I was for thinking I can accomplish that feat, 
 and the back of the CD made it look so neat and organized. I have to give credit to the game since 
 it is AOE, the first one, and launched many like it afterwards. The concept is great, pitting historical 
 civilizations against each other and evolving through the ages. Each civ has their own attributes, 
 but when it comes down to my archer gets to shoot his arrow a square before yours, inflicting -1 
 damage, things like that really doesn't matter when you can just ride over my archer with your 
 horse, or worse, kill us all with a catapult. Yes, the catapults and other artillery are very annoying, 
 and they fire without permission. Units get lost on their way to some objective and don't try to 
 stop the army invading you if they're not directly in their way. The AI is horrid and controls 
 are very basic. Units are limited to 50 so battles are small. Great ambition, but fails to deliver 
 successfully. Also, have fun with the sound FX... you will never forget the priest's "wololo"s.

Review:  Age Of Empires has been released now for years. Literally years. It has spawned multiple expansions, 
 sequels, spin offs, and custom levels - and has become known as one of the best RTS games ever 
 made.
  
  Although this game can be said by some as having "problems" - this is only if you view it in light 
 of other more modern RTS games. For a simple, good, fun formula of a great game, look no further 
 than the budget bin at your local games store.
  
  But of course, Age Of Empires is having new life breathed into it. With the very low minimum system 
 requirements compared to almost all computers nowadays - anybody can get this working on their 
 pc or laptop. AoE makes for a fantastic timewaster on the train, lecture theatres, waiting rooms 
 - wherever you have a little while to waste - why not fire up the game and spend a few minutes 
 getting your army together, or doing that next attack on the enemy...
  
  If you have never played AoE, get it today, and play it. You will notice so many little elements 
 of the game that have become standards in todays RTS games, and so many little elements of the 
 game that have been looked over in more recent games.

Review:  This game is one of the Best i have seen.
  
  It has 12 (i think) different civs, all are very unique. Looing at the advantages, anyone may think 
 it is very similar, but just these 2 or 3 advantages come to a great strategical variation.
  
  YOu can choose the style you want to play, defensive (choson) agrressive (greeks) or economic 
 (Assryians)
  you can employ manyy different battle tactics, or defensive tactics.
  
  I personally think that this game is better than empires 2 and age of kings.
  
  If you can 
 bored playing single player, but you will never get bored of playing multiplayer.
  
  MOst of all, all civilisations are varied, but still very equal.

Review:  Age Of Empires, in my opinion, was a "revolutionary game".
  
  First, the games interactivity, is superb. The way you can upgrade your your civilization to be 
 super strong, is in my opinion the best. There are many technical advances for its time, like in 
 the barracks, when your can upgrade your on foot soldiers as the time periods go on. Sure the AI 
 isn't what you would call the most intelligent. Just makes it easier to slaughter others, which 
 is very fun! The graphics for its time, are very well processed. The one player mode isn't as great, 
 but the multiplayer mode is sweet. But it is practical for skills needed when doing random maps 
 or whatever. Scenario creating is a blast, as there are so many different ways you can create a 
 unique battleground. 
  
  The game is a great starter into real time strategy, for beginners and experienced gamers alike. 
 In fact I used to hate strategy games, but when I played this one, I played random maps with a 
 cup of coffee forever. To build the biggest empire out there was my main objective. Overall, this 
 game is great, and even with all the new games out there, I still play it.

Review:  Age of Empires, came out in 1997, when I was just 7, I have to say I grew up with that game, the 
 very first strategy game I played, and by the time, the graphics were wonderful. The gameplay is 
 just great, and the difficulty level, as it is adjustable, its just right for anyone. Even though 
 the graphics, sound and overall gameplay are surpassed by actual games such as Rise of Nations 
 and its predecessors Age of Empires II & III and Age of Mythology, AoE keeps being an excellent 
 game, considering the time when it was developed and all the years that have passed since then.

Review:  This is an ok game. Ensemble Studios put a lot of effort into it and it came out pretty good, being 
 that it was the studio's first game. The gameplay is pretty strong, though the biggest problem 
 is the AI of your own units and the computer player. Units often get stuck when going through different 
 types of terrain, and they don't always take the best route around obstacles. The AI seems to have 
 either two diffuculties: way to easy or way to hard. The graphics are pretty good, and you can 
 see lots of details on the units and buildings. The sound effects and music are good, and give 
 the game a sort of an "ancient" atmosphere. Overall the game is very ambitious, and Ensemble Studios 
 is off to a great start. You can probably find this game in any bargain bin by now, usually packed 
 with other strategy games. It's a pretty good deal, around ten bucks at most places. This game 
 gets my reccomendation.

Review:  This, and Small Soldiers, were my first PC games. It was the game which basically created the RTS 
 genre but it didn't give itself a good name until AOE 2 were it redeemed itself. The sound is mediocre 
 at best but back then the music for PC wasn't that good anyway. The graphics were ok but even then 
 they probaly could of been better. The gameplay is the only real good thing in this game and it 
 was quite addictive for a while. The story mode was good for about 2 hours but starting from scratch 
 and creating a little town over and over again gets frusrating and boring. Deathmatch is where 
 the real fun lies. Put the cheats on, get a massive army and conquer everyone is the best (and 
 funniest) way to play this game. If you want to get into RTS games or are looking for something 
 old skool, look past this one because it is not a nice site.

Review:  To be honest I don't understand why people give this game lower than a 8 
  but the ***** that gave it a 4 doesnt know anything about this game. 
  It's really beautiful, 
 fun , and every age of empires fan will love it!!!!
  Every moment I have waited for this game they made it better.
  Trust me if you like these games 
 buy it if you like shooters, rpg or very tactical game don't its just fun. 
  
  But there are a few not perfect things. first it plays nearly the same as the first two games of 
 age of empires and there isn't much changed. Second 
  before you get pretty grafichs you need a very good video card.
  But that's all that's wrong.

Review:  Age of empires is a nice game hence you get into it, yet hides very frustrating and sometimes laughable 
 gameplay.
  
  The installation is barely a wait (depending on what machine u are running) , so hurray it is a 
 saviour to laptops.
  
  the tutorial is somewhat boring and you will have to read alot, "This summer egypts lands are plentiful 
 with animals" , how often do you see that ? mistakes like this are common in the tutorial, although 
 the tutorial does a nice job on teaching you the basics and some handy tips, what i found most 
 drap about this tutorial is how poorly detailed the maps were, i mean put in the no fog of war 
 cheats in and bingo behold... nothin. a intresting adition is animated pixxar like movies at brief 
 points throughh out the tutorials and campaighn.
  
  moving onto the games objectives etc, basicaly build an empire and blow your opponnents to somewhere 
 unpleasent, the post game. firstly you get a few villagers at the start of each game, a town center 
 wich makes other villagers, and you cant pile villagers up so you have to make , ..... do something 
 while the villagers being made, like look for the villager u just lost a while back (thers no sort 
 of out line or indication that a unit is behind something) .. realy ennoying,
  finaly ur villagers here, set him to gather one of the few recources "gold, stone, wood, food" 
 , u should work on food, because villagers cost 50 food, it takes ages to get food, same with any 
 other recource, and because u take so long i bet the bots will be in the final age building a wonder 
 ( wich will in the end defeat u after 2000 years some how , how retarded ?) . after u have conquered 
 recources, build an army, they can help in killing big food holders like elephants (wich fight 
 back, and hte worst thing about them is they can destroy ur entire base if there are 3 of them) , 
 the first militery unit is the clubman (cave man ?, what on earth are elephants doing here) , there 
 is a wide spread of upgrades to improve most militery units buildings and other stuff u might be 
 intrested in (WARNING BIGGEST UPGRADE IS: 4000 food 5000 gold) .... balista, lethal....
  
  sound... quite good actualy one of the games best qualities, well yeh it sounds a bit polyphonic 
 every so often but the atmospheric sounds are good, egs country side eagles and animals roaring 
 when being attacked.
  yet hte downside is the near same sounds during an attack ... egs yay my catapaults here , no wait 
 a enemy catapault is attacking me, these things are very ennoying, and the naval units are way 
 too powerful, look at that i swerved out of topic because of flaws.
  the same music over and over again !!!!!!! i would shoot my self if i had to hear that weak keyboard 
 tune once more, the units voice acting could have had a bit of variety, egyptians say "homer" (simpsons 
 are older than i thought) and "rogan" (scoody doo har har har........ not) , the priests healing 
 sound and converting sounds are funny, and u have to admit its very awkwards , the old man chant.
 
  
  graphical terms, yes pretty good, yet not as good as sound, some effects are jagged and basicaly 
 poor, the water looks like its made out of play dough, some nice effects on the meches and skins 
 of units yet its too 2d, warcraft does a better job, i think.
  
  after all aoe does a nice job in boredome busting , yet i wouldnt buy this game for full price, 
 il get it as cheap as i can, not worth the money, i bet this will be a bargain buster more like 
 it 1 , $1.78,..... srry for making this like 20 mb or soemthin
  this will go down in history as a failed strategy, but a heck of a go.

Review:  Age of Empires was one of the first real time strategy games I came up across. I found it difficult 
 at first, but it all sank in some what after a few hours of play. The graphics on it are fairly 
 good for its time. The game itself had quite a few glitches, but being the first in their series 
 they where presumable. Having the various civilizations was also good since other real time strategies 
 I played where limited in that. Age of Empires is fun. If I had it on my computer Id probably 
 still play it once in a while, if I did not have any of the newer versions of course. Its quite 
 a step taken by Microsoft, and I think it was a winning step.

Review:  This game was a good start because Age of Empires 2 was a great game that I probably would still 
 be playing, but I lost the disk. However, this game is really not that great. I played it for about 
 20 minutes and just could not get into it. The graphics are bad and the controls are so weird. 
 If this game was remade fixing the mistakes then I would definitely buy it because the concept 
 of the game is great. The game itself is just not good.
  
  I really do not recommend this game, I think everyone should get Age of Empires 2 instead.

Review:  Age of Empires is a real-time strategy game based off of ancient civilizations. It's great to play, 
 really, but it just doesn't measure up to greats like StarCraft and WarCraft.
  
  The gameplay isn't anything that hasn't been done already. You take control of a civilization such 
 as the Egyptians or Romans and start off with a few villagers and a town center. You continue to 
 gather rescources to build more units and buildings unitl you meet the requirements for the next 
 age (stone, bronze, silver, gold) and then advance. Then after defending yourself from the aggressive 
 computer you go attack them and wipe them out when you have enough units. Strategy doesn't play 
 too huge a part in it, just make sure you have enough units to thrash the opponent (like in online 
 play in most RTS games) . There's an okay variety of units though, I think... I'll give them that 
 much. Oh, and a campaign editor... that's in StarCraft too.
  
  The graphics, they're not as good as Starcraft, though they're kinda 3D, and the music, although 
 pretty nice, gets a little repetative.
  
  Overall it's not really worth getting. RTS fanatics have already seen this gameplay and newer players 
 have better choices.

Review:  So, Age Of Empires, one of the first historic-real time strategy games ( probably the first ) is 
 an excellent game worth playing.
  If you agree to other people about warcraft being better you deserve a kick! Warcraft and Age Of 
 Empires have little in common. Warcraft is a fantasy strategy game, while Age Of Empires is real 
 history. See, the civilisations in Age Of Empires actually existed eons before you were born! The 
 game is true to its words. Believe me you will enjoy Age Of Empires.
  Although the gameplay can definitely be improved, ( the characters get stuck behind a tree or a 
 building sometimes! ) the game gives an overall satisfactory performance. The sound is excellent 
 and the graphics too.
  You have to appreciate what Microsoft has tried to do and if you are a history lover, you will 
 definitely enjoy.

Review:  There is no on line game that comes close to Age of Empires. It is simply the best game around. 
 Playing against the Computer all the time gets real tedious as it only has one strategy. Whereas 
 playing on line is superb and allows you to take on different skill levels and
  playing techniques every time you play. I normally wind up in www. zone. com which is the best 
 place to play. The only thing that really annoys me is the amount of cheats you get Who are only 
 out to gain an advantage in a table so they end up creating cheat units like Cars and laser firing 
 troops when All I have are catapults and Knights!!!
  Not fair!!! Why dont these people play fair???

Review:  For a game developed in '97, it was extremely well-developed. Granted, the graphics were a little 
 a behind the curve but other than that the game was ahead. The sound in the game was epic in voice 
 which is always a plus to any creation. The controls were easy to learn and were easily accesible, 
 which many RTSs lack. The learning-curve was slow enough that it was easy to learn, but hard enough 
 to keep you resetting some levels, because you got smacked-down. The replay value was nigh limitless, 
 because of the varying ways to cheat yourself into complete victory.
  So I say, why not rate AoE to at least a 8.5.

Review:  It may only be a few steps higher but enough steps to make me happy. Now this review is obviously 
 new and the game old but i bought the game when it first game out and I remember having lots and 
 lots of fun. So i reviewed this game as i would of many years ago - obviously the graphics arent 
 as good as they should be today.
  
  Age of Empires feels like a Realistic RTS. The units speeds and strength qualities are perfectly 
 balanced. Each nation in the game has its strengths and weaknesses.
  
  I never really touched the single player campaign, I just selected a map and an enemy and battled 
 it out.. some games only lasted a few minutes (either me winning or losing) and some lasted a few 
 days or even a week.
  
  Theres so many units and unit upgrades its hard to get bored with this game.
  
  The steam line 
 easy to learn map editor adds hours and hours of replay value.
  
  Multiplayer is a blast.
  
  You could pick up this game today for probably $10 or less and it 
 would totaly be worth it. This game is a total RTS classic.

Review:  What else is there to say? This game isn't particularly colorful, the animation isn't anything 
 to write home about, the sound effects are a little redundant, the units aren't very original/varied. 
 STILL the game is the run-of-the-mill style we've all come to expect. Build a town center, make 
 citizens. Work the citizens, make a military, make the military big, expand your city, advance 
 your city, after a few defenses, send your hulking army to crush your foe once and for all, and 
 END THIS WAR FOR GOOD! 
  
  Sounds like Warcraft? That's because it *IS* warcraft. Only from Microsoft, and with a less magical 
 "hoyo oyo" aura...
  
  Fun, but not a cult classic like Warcraft, or even the venerable Command and Conquer, which came 
 first.

Review:  Graphics: 9/10 
  Sounds: 8/10 
  Difficulty: 8/10 
  Playability: 8/10 
  Gameplay: 9/10 
  
  The graphics are very good, but it would be cruel to compare it with the 
 newer titles such as C&C Generals, because this is an old game. The graphics have okay details 
 and are in total 2D, which I think is just as good as the new 3D turn the camera 360 graphics! 
 What's the point of moving the camera all the way round or zooming in and out? You'll be impressed 
 the first time you play the game, but after a while you'll stick to the standard camera angle. 
 
  
  The sounds are good, with lot of sound effects, and some fine relaxing music. You never really 
 bother about the music because it doesn't want that much attention, which is good. You can then 
 focus on the actual game, and think strategic. 
  
  The gameplay is very good, though it's not as revolutionary as the first Red Alert, which really 
 is the mother of all strategy games. But Age of Empires was also one of the first strategy games 
 before everyone started making them. Now the market is filled with them: No mans land, Sudden Strike 
 2, Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring, Warcraft 3 and American Conquest are examples of games that 
 are pretty new really, and many of them look much of the same. AoE is a very good strategy game, 
 which is one of the best ever. 
  
  + 
  Good graphics, and fine music. You can control the Romans! The huge battles!

Review:  I got the demo of this game in Dec 1997 and for months me and my best friend did nothing but play 
 it (yes, nothing but the demo) . Some months later I actually saved up enough to buy the full game 
 and at the time it seemed so cool and interesting. I'd never played anything like AoE (I had just 
 gotten my first Windows PC round about then) and we were both totally addicted.
  
  Today, it seems dated and dull. Weird isn't it? I have AoE2 and it is much better but that too 
 already seems old hat compared with the screenshots of the forthcoming AoE3 (can't wait) . Even 
 with all the expansion packs available for this game it will never come close to the complexity 
 of the second sequel or even Age of Mythology. Buy it if you can find it dead cheap tho.

Review:  History is a great topic and historical wars where something else. Now you can take part in the 
 great civilizations that helped to shape the world as it is today. Age of Empires is all about 
 periods of history and this is combining historical fact into a war game. You get to command the 
 armies and take on the missions. This was a first in the way of warfare tactics and it spawned 
 an immense amount of games. 
  
  The graphics isnt much for 2005 but for 1997 it was pretty good. The game interface was simple, 
 straight forward and well made. The game itself was a piece of art. You had your pieces, like on 
 a chess board and you could move them into position and plan your attacks. With this in mind you 
 have strategy and the collection of different troops to gain, you had the ability. But everything 
 has a starting point and that is the technology in the game.
  
  You can research specific items, advance to the next level and become a new race. But you mustnt 
 forget one important fact and that is recourses, food, wood, metal and gold. These are the four 
 elements you need to build any of your civilizations in this game which increases the game play.
 
  
  So far so good, but after the initial fun you have the downturn and with any game you have to look 
 for some cons. So the first I shall pick is the sound, didnt think much of it, nothing special 
 there then. Really you must play this game in bits otherwise you will get bored. It seems to be 
 the same all the way through to me and it make for a rather repetitive feel.
  
  All in all its above standard and its a piece of art that will never be forgotten.

Review:  Sadly Age of Empires 1 is nowhere near as good as its sequels and is a very unbalanced and frustrating 
 game.
  
  AoE's graphics are fairly average. Some animations look stupid with weird shaky walking animations 
 for swordsmen and ships fire missiles despite having no weapons. Environments look pretty average 
 with the basic isometric view seen in many RTS games. Units and buildings do look semi cool.
  
  Sound is great and very age like. Units have funny little gibberish for their speech and it 
 sounds cool, particularly with priests that woololo sound effect is a classic that is also a taunt 
 in aoe2. Fighting sounds are very odd with swordfighting making a loud clang sound like smashing 
 rocks together, arrows make a weird loud whoosh sound. Dying units sound good with some suitably 
 painful sounding screams.
  
  AoE's gameplay pales compared to its sequels and to other RTS games. In AoE you start with a town 
 center and a few villagers in the Stone Age with the only solders being weak clubmen. You advance 
 through the Tool Age the Iron Age and then reach the Bronze Age that is set around roman times. 
 There are a lot of unit types such as siege weapons, foot solders, cavalry, archers and war elephants. 
 Each type can be upgraded, so clubmen can be upgraded to axemen then you discover shortswordsmen, 
 longswords then the centurion the ultimate infantry. There are lots of tech upgrades too like leather 
 armour inventing the wheel, better walls and many, many other things.
  
  The main problems with this system is that siege is way, way too powerful. Siege does a huge amount 
 of damage, able to single kill most units and fires very quickly. The projectiles seem to home 
 in on units a bit instead of just missing a moving unit. This leads to too much boring siege and 
 no infantry or cavalry since they will be crushed. Towers as well are hugely overpowered and once 
 you get ballista towers they will crush anything besides catapults. When playing one player skirmish 
 the computer always plays the same way and will just mass build towers and siege and effortlessly 
 crush any and every attack you send their way unless you just siege them. This serves to make gameplay 
 extremely boring and frustrating.
  
  Other major problems with AoE is the stupid logic units use after killing their selected target. 
 Instead of attacking other military units in their sight, they usually target villagers or buildings 
 ignoring the military units killing them. Also annoyingly enemies in campaigns usually team up 
 to kill you even though they also are enemies. I know this because a brown clubman and a yellow 
 one were fighting and the brown one died then more brown ones arrived and they teamed up with yellow 
 to kill all my clubmen. AoE also features the worst design decision I have seen in 16 years of 
 gaming. The dev team of AoE 1 made it so units that see other units being attacked will not help 
 them and engage the enemy meaning your forces will die since allegedly the creators wanted to make 
 AoE a hands on RTS and not automate anything. This is either some of the most misguided reasoning 
 ever or an excuse to cover up a design fault. Humans cannot be everywhere at once and its unrealistic 
 that solders wouldn't help friendly units being attacked.
  
  The game features online play on zone. com even though I haven't tried it and don't wish to since 
 it will be just mass siegeing and tower whores.
  
  As much as I love this series I really can't recommend AoE its poor balance, hopeless AI and cheap 
 tactics ruin it. These problems were common sense, and I fail to see how playtesting didn't highlight 
 them.

Review:  I got age of empire 2 before getting this one (as a gift) so i was expecting better than that. 
 I was like "the second is great so the first shouldn't be that bad!" well it is that bad! 
  
  There's a long time i didn't play this game but i remember some things. In the game, the fact 
 that you can choose your civilization is very useless because they all have the same troups. You 
 can build walls but not doors!?! 
  
  In fact, this game is great for the start of the age of empire series, but for a game, it could 
 have been better.

 a lot of upgrades and buildings, graphics are now severely outdated, its a classic if you want 
 to play it remember that, but i think you will be disappointed, this game is oooold.
  Campaigns are pretty much the same, and frankly AOE II has way better campaigns, the interface 
 is a little bit different from current RTS but it doesnt feel fully playable.
  --I personally liked this game, it came when i bought the limited edition AOE, i only played it 
 out of curiosity but quickly turned my eyes and face AOE II and COnquerors its expansion.

Review:  Welcome to 1997. A young, fresh game studio has just released a new game. Little did they know 
 that their game will sell over 3 million copies worldwide, and they'll be some of the most prominent 
 game developers in the industry.
  
  Age of Empires pits you against of the greatest civilizations of all time. In epic battles and 
 diplomocy, you'll lead your people to greatness. So, in order to do that, you gather resources, 
 build buildings, train troops, and then lead your troops against your rivals and hopefully defeat 
 them.
  
  That is the basic core of AoE. The strategy portion of the is game is pretty simple, and easy to 
 understand. But, it's too simple for many gamers to explore different options to win, and overall, 
 every game follows the same pattern: gather resources, build buildings, raise troops, etc. The 
 strategy portion is way too light, but still, it can be interesting and entertaining at times.
 
  
  Graphics were very good, but some path-finding issues and building scale cut down the score for 
 the graphics. Everything seems to come to life. Death animations were good, and the units were 
 detailed with some cool animations.
  
  Sound is a weak factor, with a weak soundtrack, horrible voice acting and battle sounds. They don't 
 sound extremely serious in any way, and sound cutesy for a game based on history.
  
  Overall, it was a good game.

Review:  The premise for this game was great. Start your empire from the ground up moving through the ages, 
 unlocking technology as you go. This was the first RTS I ever played and I was addicted for a long 
 time. However as new games came out I began to see how flawed it really was. 
  
  The bad: 
  
  Graphics- Even for its time these graphics were average. Also some glitches kinda 
 turn me off in this department.
  
  Not enough variety- The campaign isnt really something you play more than once, and you arent really 
 given choices as to how you are going to move forward in the game. Your tasks in the game... KILL 
 KILL KILL
  
  The good:
  
  Good game for begining RTS players- This is a good on to start out on, with a simple interface 
 and not too much to handle at once, anyone can pick it up and play.
  
  killing animated people with your animated people is cool- *see previous*
  
  with a host of 
 expansion packs and patches the minor problems in the game are easily fixable.

Review:  This is among the best RTS games to ever be released. It's fantastic.
  
  Graphics are nice and clean, with good attention to every unit and landscape. This will also run 
 on almost any computer as well. Campaigns are absorbing, and quick matches are also good, with 
 several modes of play. This wil last a long time, even if you are not an RTS fan. 
  
  Multiplayer is not to be overlooked as human opponents have mastered this game, and always provide 
 a great challenge. 
  
  Age of Empires is a great portrayal of historical battles and events, and is a must for the collection. 
 The pace is fast, the action is quick and brutal, and it really feels like you are buidling an 
 empire.
  
  Get this game.

Review:  I was out of gaming for over 10 years. A person at work had me download the trial for AoE and that 
 is how I became addicted again. RTS games are away to create an environment that allow for people 
 of all ages to enjoy gaming. 
  
  The great/bad part is the hours of time spend playing this game. The ability to play it over and 
 over again with a new experience each time is excellent!!!
  
  I have continued to follow the AoE expansion packs and the 2 version. Because of the first AoE, 
 MicroSoft has created a lifer gamer and I will continue to follow the series. I am going to be 
 one of those people pre-ordering the next AoE release.

Review:  Age of Empires was the first game that really caught my attention. I liked the idea of watching 
 the villigers gather resources, and actually seeing the units attack an enemy. I sat for hours 
 just watching my units and seeing what each would do. The units get old at the lack of variance 
 with each nation. Most units are the same from each nation including the buildings. If you like 
 a game that offers a little history, combat, and building things then this is the game you are 
 looking for. Even today it stands out against the others in its own category.

Review:  This game, well, sucks. It is fun at first because you are sooo excited and stuff about getting 
 a new game.... then, as you play it, you realize how, pardon my french, GAY this is.
  
  The graphics are somewhat decent, although the water sucks and stuff. The buildings, no matter 
 what civilization you are, are the same, and look really generic. The people talk like complete 
 retards...."Rogan"? Every civilization's people say that. I think.
  
  The gameplay of this is horrible. You cant order people to "attack-move" and if you are allied 
 toward someone while they are enemy toward you, your people wont attack back or anything. Its pretty 
 stupid. They cant find their way around anything, and you can dodge arrows and such easily. Why 
 should you dodge arrows in the first place...? I dunno.
  
  My last word is: Dont even bother buying this unless you are easily amused. If so, you will get 
 a kick out of this game.

Review:  I consider Age of Empires my introduction into computer gaming. A fellow student of mine showed 
 me this game on his computer one night and I was so impressed I bought the game the next day. I 
 played it for hours and hours, doing all the campaigns and then moving onto winning the game in 
 every way possible with every civilization they offered. Of course, the game does have it's limitations 
 as far as RTS's are concerned. However, I still come back to this game every once and a while to 
 play a round or two, for old times sake.
  
  The introduction and tutorial was helpful in getting a new gamer started, I had no trouble jumping 
 into the game after completing this.
  
  The campaigns are decent, they could have been a little harder, but fun to complete nonetheless. 
 The plots were good, but could have been improved and expanded upon just a little.
  
  I do wish they had more civilizations to utilize in the game and the interface was a little tedious 
 at times. It was hard keeping up with civilians when they finished work and just stood there and 
 sometimes the military units wouldn't attack an enemy when it attacked a nearby building. Of course, 
 these problems were dealt with perfectly in Age of Empires 2. 
  
  The graphics, at the time the game was created are fairly decent, though very dated now. The graphics, 
 however, did seem a little too small and the detail could have been better.
  
  Overall, I did enjoy this game tremendously.

Review:  When it first came out, a good RTS, but there are much better ones now. There really is no reason 
 to go back and play it again. Gameplay is painfully slow compared to what is out there now.
  
  If you have never tried an RTS, this might be one to start out with, but once you understand 
 how they work. Move on to something else.
  Even AoE 2 Age of Kings is a much better game. 
  I will say that it was AoE that got me interested in RTS games. I enjoyed managing a civilization 
 and trying to guide to victory. 
  I consider Age of Empires to be the Granddaddy of the RTS genre.

Review:  Few games have ever achieved such greatness as age of empires has. Few games are better then Warcraft. 
 Few games are ever so immerse. One of these few games that have done this is Age of Empires. Suprising 
 has Age of Empires been with a never ending game that has fun and realism packed together. Its 
 graphics and sound, back then, were pretty good and though they still lacked could be passed for 
 its gameplay and longness. You have probaly played other RTS's where you would pass through the 
 ages to create certain buildings and such. Guess where it oringnated? Yep, if you said Age of Empires 
 then you are correct! it combines everyting you want of a good RTS plus more and is part of the 
 video-gaming RTS history. No game has been this good since.

Review:  At first, I was amazed with this game. Truly fun gameplay, better graphics than any of my other 
 games, and it had multiplayer! (Of course this was years ago) However, after a few weeks it just 
 became too repetitive. 
  
  I have always enjoyed learning about ancient empires, so I really enjoyed being able to actually 
 play with those empires. There really isn't that much history involved, but it's still fun seeing 
 the different structures. Seeing all the different types of units in action was pleasant as well. 
 For it's time, this was a really good strategy game, but it really doesn't compare to games today. 
 
  
  After a few games, it was just dull though. Yes, you could attack with a different combination 
 of units, but it was still the same. There really wasn't 'another way' to do something. As with 
 just about all strategy games, there's numerous races, all of which have their own special abilities; 
 everything else is your basic strategy game as well. 
  
  It is old, so it's cheap, but there's so many better strategy games today there still isn't any 
 point in buying this game. If you like collecting old games, then this would be a great purchase, 
 but other than that I see no reason to buy this game.

Review:  Let me tell you this, if I had never played this I would have...
  never played this. But that isn't the point now is it, oh no. This is the game that got me into 
 stradegy games as this was the first one I played. I still play it even today. Here is the breakdown:
 
  
  Gameplay: 10/10 The game was challenging but not to where I couldn't win, which I like. The controls 
 are easy to learn, and the computer AI is pretty amazing. Thier really isn't much wrong with the 
 gameplay and the things that are, are just minor. I will not mention them.
  
  Graphics: 9/10 The graphics were great. The units looked fantastic and the buildings looked great. 
 It was all good, until you started fighting. The animation could have been a bit better. It didn't 
 look bad at all though. 
  
  Sound: 9/10 The sound was fantastic. It all made the game so lively.
  
  Value: If I didn't 
 have it I don't think this reveiw would exist and I would go and buy it so that I could review 
 it. If you don't have it get it.

Review:  I think Gamespot was a little off on this review. This game is a little under appreciated. Like 
 I said it's definitely not perfect but we are talking 1997 here. It spawned a bunch of similar 
 games in the genre of RTS with a ancient world spin, including it's great sequel AOE 2. 
  
  One thing that I really love in this game that I don't think get's enough attention is the campaigns. 
 You go on historic campaigns and can learn about all of the ancient civilizations you can play 
 in the game in a section of the game itself! We need more games like this where you play a fun 
 game and learn in the process. 
  
  Gameplay 6/10
  
  The gameplay is probably the part of the game that is really lacking all but that's it in my opinion. 
 Like the GS reviewer said, it sucks that you can't stack actions like creating villagers and farming 
 and so forth. But it is fun and the technologies are very interesting and make good sense.
  
  Graphics 10/10
  
  Pretty good graphics in this game. Seems very good for the time it came 
 out. The animations are very good also.
  
  Value 8/10
  
  Good, especially to learn some history, but you should probably get Age of Empires 2 instead unless 
 you plan on getting them both because the second one has queues.
  
  Reviewer's Tilt 10/10
  
  No regrets about buying this game.

Review:  Gameplay: The random map which is the normal game play mode can soon get boring. You have only 
 50 units available (!!!!) . Thankfully the designers managed to put in a great scenario editor that 
 really increases the games gameplay. There are no limits in the editor ( once i had a full legion 
 - 6000 soldiers against an enemy army...) so you can put on great battles. Gameplay- 9
  
  
  Graphics: The game looks good. Graphics - 8
  
  
  Sound: Quite boring unless fighting 
 a massive battle via the editor. The sound becomes great when you have hundreds of swords clashing. 
 Sound - 7
  
  
  Value: The editor is really worth yr time and money for the game. Value - 7
  
  Tilt - 7

Review:  It's a pity GS gave it such a low score. This game was amazing when it first game out. Sure, it 
 doesn't have a number of features that we have in more recent titles, and the graphics are now 
 outdated, but thats because it is such an old game. It still is a classic game. It started an incredible 
 series, so how could it be a bad game?! Worth getting, can be bought very cheap now along with 
 the expansion pack. Although there are more recent titles to get, so anyone buying it now would 
 be wanting to relive through some classic moments in gaming history. Worth having to add to your 
 collection. 
  
  The game is outdated now, but when first released it amazed many people and started a huge following 
 of fans which are still following (and loving) the Age of series.

Review:  Right, so here's Age of Empires. Here's what I think.
  
  Gameplay 7/10: It's fair at best. It can be very exciting, yet it can also be very boring. For 
 instance, a large battle is thrilling, yet watching your workers mindlessly move back and forth, 
 collecting resources, is mind-numbingly painful.
  
  Graphics 8/10: The graphics are OK, actually. The interface could be better, but its fine as it 
 is. They are one of the finer points of the game, with the clean textures, and good unit mapping.
 
  
  Sound 5/10: Yech. The sound is pretty bad here-as it gets repetitive. The same sword clang heard 
 for the 1,000,000th time is really, really damn annoying. The music is ok, though.
  
  Value 6/10: Id bet you could get this at a very good price somewhere. Even so, I wouldnt recommend 
 picking it up. There are plenty more good RTS games out there-ones that you should pick up instead.
 
  
  Tilt 7/10: Meh. Once youve beaten it, theres really nothing to go back to, unfortunately. Its 
 an OK game, just not a great one.
  
  So, in my final words: Let this one pass. Its sequel is so much better-get it instead of this piece 
 of failed ambition.

Review:  Age of Empires is a good quality RTS game that I found fairly entertaining. But in the end, the 
 game did not provide any innovations or twists to the genre to make it stand out.
  
  Gameplay: 7/10
  Like most games of its time, there is a fair amount of micromanagement. The queue 
 system is particularly helpful so that units can end up in locations that you prefer them... rather 
 than have them sit around doing nothing. There are many times however, that you have to keep track 
 of every unit, causing the game to be a bit frantic in later stages.
  
  Graphics: 8/10
  The graphics are rich in color and pretty detailed compared to other games released around the 
 same time. And for Microsoft's first venture into the genre, there is pretty smooth animation without 
 any glitches. The mapping is solid, as are the buildings and units. The most impressive are the 
 larger units.
  
  Sound: 7/10
  The sound quality is good, albiet a little repetitive. There is not a lot of variety in the ambient 
 sounds. However, the sound is well produced... just not anything special.
  
  Reviewer's Tilt: 8/10
  Overall it was a very enjoyable game. But it has finite replayability. 
 Because there is nothing that stands out above the pack, this game losses its appeal once you have 
 "beaten" it. Playing with other people can add some excitement. But there is too much manage, even 
 in comparison to games of the same year.
