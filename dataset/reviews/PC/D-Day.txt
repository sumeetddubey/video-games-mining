:::Review:::
At best, D-Day offers up a tepid serving of cookie-cutter RTS gameplay. At worst, it makes you descend 
 into micromanagement hell. 

  The Normandie Mmoire committee has designated Digital Reality's D-Day as the official commemorative 
 game of the D-Day 60th anniversary. The men who gave their lives for freedom deserve a far better 
 memorial than this lame real-time strategy game. There are already plenty of World War II RTS games 
 out there, so if you're going to release one, you need to do something special to set yours apart 
 from the rest. D-Day sets itself apart all right... by doing things especially badly. At best, D-Day 
 offers up a tepid serving of cookie-cutter RTS gameplay. At worst, it makes you descend into micromanagement 
 hell.  

          Can you tell these guys apart at a glance? Even with a closer look, it can be hard.    

  On first inspection, D-Day looks like it has the makings of a cool, tactical WWII RTS that eschews 
 base-building and resource-gathering for the nuts and bolts of combat. You'll field nine types 
 of infantry, like snipers, sappers, medics, and machine gunners. You'll head into battle with self-propelled 
 guns, flamethrower tanks, recon motorcycles, artillery pieces that you can haul with trucks, and 
 more. You can even commandeer enemy vehicles and guns. Armored units are rated for front, rear, 
 and side armor, and they feature different stats for main and secondary guns. An onscreen encyclopedia 
 fills you in on the historical units and their game counterparts. You can also read historical 
 backgrounds on the missions and watch short videos that feature D-Day veterans.  

  D-Day also offers the basic amenities you'd expect from any good RTS. You can pan, tilt, and rotate 
 the camera entirely with the mouse, so no fumbling with the keyboard is required. You can choose 
 from a variety of game speeds, and you can issue orders while the game is paused. You can quickly 
 select unit movements and combat stances, like "hold position" or "fire at will."  

  That's all good on paper, but once you start playing D-Day, the ugly reality starts to sink in. 
 The tutorial gets things off to a pitiful start. Instead of actually showing you how the interface 
 and commands work, the tutorial merely tells you how they work via a voice-over, where sections 
 of the manual are read as you sit there and twiddle your thumbs. Why aren't the interface buttons 
 and combat options highlighted and interactively illustrated as they're being discussed?  

  As for the actual meat of the game, it's undercooked and hard to swallow. You only get 12 single-player 
 missions and no skirmish mode or random map options (though you do get a user-unfriendly map-editor 
 utility) . At best, the missions are predictable, repetitive, and tedious. At worst, they're unbalanced 
 and unclear. Multiplayer offers three basic modes: deathmatch, conquer (that is, seize territory) , 
 and capture the flag. Good luck finding opponents, though. We never could.  

  Abysmal artificial intelligence can make playing against the computer a nightmare. The German troops 
 were apparently trained in WWII Japan, because these kamikaze soldiers will merrily stroll directly 
 toward a row of tanks that will fire upon them. In fact, mass suicide is the German troops' favorite 
 tactic. Meanwhile, your troops are happy to stand around, while doing nothing, just before letting 
 themselves be butchered. Your units have a hard time following orders, so you have to hand-hold 
 them while repeatedly reissuing commands. Severe pathfinding problems mean that just getting a 
 few units down the road can be a real chore. Consequently, major traffic jams are common on the 
 dense maps. Historical accuracy gets thrown out the window, too, so instead of armor units having 
 dedicated crews trained for the job, you crew your tanks with whatever infantry you have handy. 
 This leads to disconcerting oddities, like clicking on a Sherman tank and hearing, "Rifleman at 
 your service, sir."  

  D-Day's interface makes things worse. It can require too many button presses to carry out simple 
 operations. Why, for example, do you need to press a couple of buttons before you can make a flak 
 gun fire at ground targets? Worse still, it's nearly impossible to tell the different soldier types 
 apart without careful examination. What on Earth is the point of having medics, scouts, and so 
 on if you can barely tell them apart, even when zoomed all the way in on the action? Why not include 
 some large, clear icons to differentiate them? Instead of encouraging sophisticated tactics based 
 on different unit abilities, D-Day encourages you to throw up your hands in despair while resorting 
 to the old "band-box 'em and chuck 'em into the meat grinder" technique.  

          Bold GIs defend Carentan from rooftops.     

  Outside of the severe problem with the 
 confusing soldiers, Digital Reality's graphical efforts are pleasant, if not particularly memorable. 
 Models are admirably well detailed, and colorful textures abound, though in the end, there's nothing 
 really inspiring to see. The game boasts an evocative musical score, with a rousing main theme, 
 but beyond that, the audio can be as bad as the game mechanics. Some voice-over accents are dubious, 
 repeated shouts of "Die, Krauts!" or similar cornball lines get old fast, and the cries of dying 
 men are so campy that they invite laughter instead of concern.  

  If you're looking for a real-time WWII game, you can safely (and wisely) pass on D-Day. You'd do 
 better with Blitzkrieg series or Codename: Panzers, for example. Or try the hybrid turn-based/real-time 
 Combat Mission series. D-Day, by contrast, is a victory for bad game design.

Review:  D-Day isn't quite the ideal RTS, but it beats the stuffing out of just about anything else on the 
 shelves.
  
  Too many of today's 'simulations' are simply FPSs in an RTS setting. D-Day has challenging gameplay 
 supported by a database that is well-researched and well-executed. Yeah, it's easy to lose. But 
 it's not hard to learn how to play the game well.
  
  The graphics are not quite up to snuff, especially in the cut scenes between the briefings. Using 
 old footage is neat, but there's a distinct choppiness to the playback. Any my PC is not slouch. 
 Oh well.
  
  What would make it better? A more intuitive interface, so you don't need to click five times just 
 to have some engineer lay a mine. That's certainly not a critical flaw, given the ability to issue 
 commands while paused.

Review:  I am serious here, this game will make you cry. 
  
  This game needlessly complicates things, difficult in a sense where you can't get any better, requires 
 too much micro-management, and simply sucks. The graphics and sounds are good, but that's not what 
 makes a good game.
  
  It is a traditional strategy game, but they did a great job making it a strategy game where the 
 player cannot deploy any type of strategy.
  
  I'm sure glad those poor boys at normandy didn't have to worry about micromanaging 20 different 
 classes at once which you can't even FRICKIN SEE!
  
  Save your money and get a much better WWII game like Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2, or their 
 upcoming sequel, Faces of War.

Review:  Yes, the demos looked good. Yes, the graphics aren't too shabby and yes it's a little different 
 to all the other WWII RTS games... but... I just don't like it.
  
  The overhead view is not nice at all. Even the first level of the Scenario based games had me annoyed 
 with selecting men, moving men, getting shot at by the enemy who can see me but I can't see them... 
 I had no tanks either (maybe I've been playing Codename Panzers too long) .
  
  Anyway, see for yourselves what you think but I'd save your hard earned cash for Half Life 2.
