:::Review:::
Its technical problems are a real shame, because when it comes to every other aspect of game design, 
 Y2K is actually quite good. 

 Given its name and December 1999 release, it would be easy to chalk up Y2K: the Game as the brainchild 
 of some shameless marketing-department executive that was rushed onto shelves in a last-minute 
 bid to cash in on everyone's obsession with the ubiquitous computer glitch. I certainly had suspicions 
 along those lines - suspicions that were strengthened after I loaded the game and was treated to 
 a hiccuping audio track and multiple skips in animation during the expository opening sequence. 
 And after a couple hours of wandering around the same two locations, as my frustration began to 
 reach the boiling point, I became convinced that the only thing that worked in this graphic adventure 
 was the blinking LED on the front of the box.  

 But I stuck with it, and after finally solving the first significant puzzle - a tricky affair involving 
 scores of potential number combinations - I found myself enjoying a nice little adventure game. 
 In fact, I began having so much fun that I actually felt sorry that Interplay made the decision 
 to slap the notorious "year 2000" acronym on the box: Given that everyone considers Y2K a nonevent, 
 it's reasonable to expect that a lot of potential customers will let their gaze slide right by 
 the title.  

 As you might expect, Y2K: The Game is set on the first day of the year 2000. You play as Buster 
 Everman, a nebbish accountant at Dharke Electronics, a company founded by gothic horror writer 
 Aleister Dharke that's now involved in robotics and artificial-intelligence technology. After Dharke's 
 death, the company used his mansion as a testing ground for creating a computerized home management 
 system, complete with robotic servants controlled by a master computer. When Dharke decided to 
 nix some of its more "radical" research projects, the company put Dharke Mansion up for sale - 
 at just about the time that Buster won the lottery and went house shopping.  

 Buster got a good deal all right, but in his eagerness he decided to move in before the house was 
 ready, so he could celebrate New Year's Eve in his new palace. Of course, just about every function 
 in the house is controlled by some type of microchip - and the vast majority aren't Y2K-compliant. 
 When he awakes after a night of revelry, the main computer warns him of an intruder in one of the 
 rooms - and then it locks him inside when he enters to investigate. Fortunately, Buster wasn't 
 partying alone: His girlfriend Candace joined him to ring in the new year, and even more fortunately, 
 she's developed an upgrade for the house's computer system that'll put everything back in working 
 order. Now Buster's got to find a way out of that room, explore the house, find Candace, and implement 
 the upgrade. Though you control Buster from a third-person perspective, the movement interface is 
 essentially the same as in a score of other adventure games: You move between a series of hot spots 
 in each room, and once on one of the hot spots you can pan your view all over the room in search 
 of objects to pick up or use. Such a system has its problems - Buster travels to the closest hot 
 spot before moving on to the next rather than simply going where you want him to, and for some 
 reason he can examine some objects at a distance but not others. But these problems could be overlooked 
 if he'd just pick up his feet and move a little faster. Buster might be the slowest-moving character 
 ever to star in an adventure game, and his leaden pace is exacerbated by constant loading screens 
 - just looking closely at an object in a room leads to a big yellow "loading" sign being plastered 
 in the middle of your monitor.  

 That might sound like nit-picking, but once you solve a few puzzles where the requisite objects 
 are very close by, you'll have to roam all over the mansion in search of clues and objects, and 
 the sheer time it takes to do so is likely to make some gamers give up on the whole affair just 
 as things are getting interesting (a fair amount of disc-swapping doesn't help matters either) . 
 And there are some other aspects of Y2K that'll grind on your nerves: They're simple things like 
 the fact that the Interplay and Runecraft animated logos can't be bypassed when you load the game, 
 the way Buster freezes in midstep the moment he reaches a hot spot, the choppy frame rate when 
 more than a single object or character is animated, and the lack of options to adjust graphical 
 detail to improve performance (don't even think of running the game on the minimum system) . Such 
 problems, in addition to the tedious pace of the game, play a major role in keeping it from being 
 much more enjoyable.  

 Its technical problems are a real shame, because when it comes to every other aspect of game design, 
 Y2K is actually quite good. The inventory interface is efficient and simple to use; the plot gives 
 you enough information so that you're never left wondering what to do next; and the good voice 
 acting is made even better by some of the funny dialogue. The computer's taunts keep getting funnier, 
 and Buster comes up with some pretty clever lines of his own ("I hate to quote Prom Night, but 
 I would love to be able to see what's in those drawers!") that are all delivered with energy and 
 style. And the dialogue between Buster and Candace is first-rate. With the exception of the first, 
 the game's puzzles generally start out on an elementary-school level, but things get considerably 
 more interesting when Buster finally learns where Candace is trapped.  

 You won't need to put down much dough to give Y2K a try. It's only $19.95 direct from Interplay, 
 and there's a good chance it'll be marked down even lower soon enough. If you're the patient type 
 - the extremely patient type - and have been searching for something new from the adventure game 
 genre, then Y2K's a good way to start the new year.
