:::Review:::
FIFA 2000 delivers on almost every front and is a fast-paced, enjoyable, andchallenging soccer game 
 with numerous options and lots of depth. 

 Soccer has never been very popular in the United States, if only because its 45-minute halves of 
 continuous action are unlike the frequent start-stop dynamic of pro football, baseball, and basketball. 
 Throw in the typically low score of a soccer match, and it isn't difficult to understand the general 
 lack of interest in the game. That being the case, computer and video soccer games have traditionally 
 been designed for foreign markets and later released in the US in hopes of making some additional 
 sales. But EA Sports changed all that with FIFA for the Sega Genesis console, which proved to be 
 successful both in Europe and the United States, and started one of EA Sports' most important brands. 
 And judging by FIFA 2000, this high-quality soccer franchise is still going strong.  

 FIFA 2000 adds the 12 teams of the MLS to the existing roster of countless other leagues from around 
 the world. Now you too can fulfill the soccer matchup urologist's dream of pitting the Kansas City 
 Wiz against the Dallas Burn. The game's strange opening sequence of old-time players meeting the 
 new cyber soccer athlete can be forgiven thanks to a great soundtrack that includes UK musician 
 Robbie Williams' hit It's Only Us.  

 Get past the intro and you'll find there are four basic modes in FIFA 2000: exhibition, tournament, 
 season, and training. It also contains three levels of play: amateur, pro, and world class. There 
 is a big difference in the computer's skill level between the three settings, most noticeably in 
 the speed of the opposing players. Great weaving runs will win matches for you in the amateur level 
 but will become obsolete at the pro level in which short, crisp passing becomes the order of the 
 day. The training area is a good place to try to adjust to the different speed of the players at 
 the higher levels. In addition, you can practice various set pieces, such as penalty kicks, throw-ins, 
 and free kicks.  

 Exhibition mode lets you match one team against another, and with teams available from such soccer-loving 
 countries as England, Scotland, Germany, and Italy, plus classic teams from the past and a large 
 number of international squads, the exhibition mode is almost a game in and of itself. However, 
 the tournament mode offers more variety. Single-elimination tournaments are rare in US sports, 
 and yet they generate huge excitement throughout the rest of the world. FIFA 2000's tournament 
 mode lets you make a custom single-elimination tournament of the teams you want. I particularly 
 enjoyed matching up the lesser English Premiership teams with teams from Scotland and Major League 
 Soccer. But different combinations of teams from any of the available leagues can be put together. 
 In addition, there is a custom league option that allows complete mixing and matching. For example, 
 I took the teams from Scotland and Sweden and put them in a 22-team league, but I was disappointed 
 that the game ended after one season.  

 The regular season mode lets you take a single team through the entire season of competition. For 
 instance, if you're playing a great team from England, then you play not only league games, but 
 also domestic and European cup competitions. Of further note, FIFA 2000 includes various classic 
 teams, such as the 1968 Manchester United European Cup winners and the brilliant early-'70s Ajax 
 squad. EA made a curious aesthetic decision to use a brown-colored tint when two of the old-time 
 teams play, as if to re-create the look of a grainy old film reel. But this effect merely interferes 
 with the gameplay - specifically the appearance of the pass direction arrow, which is in all other 
 cases unobtrusively color-coded - and it should have been an option rather than the default.  

 
 Once you get into the game, it's high-octane sports action at its finest. The motion-captured animation 
 is superb overall and completely captures the essence of movement in soccer. Great crowd animations 
 and stadium chants also add to the atmosphere. The varied heights of the players, their realistic 
 facial expressions, and even their hairstyles all make you believe you're actually watching your 
 favorite team.  

 FIFA 2000 not only looks good, but it also plays well. For instance, the controls are very responsive. 
 You can perform a variety of kicks, tackles, and headers with various button presses and combinations. 
 As you move with the ball, the pass direction arrow clearly points toward offscreen players and 
 indicates the chances of the ball getting through to them. However, EA Sports could have improved 
 FIFA 2000's player-management and simulation aspects. While it is possible to move players between 
 teams, there are no filters to prevent lopsided moves. Each team has a certain amount of money, 
 so you can't buy all the players you want, although it is still possible to pick up an entire team 
 of good players. It would be nice to see an active intelligent trade market and managers making 
 deals based on need. FIFA 2000 lets you play up to three seasons in a league, but without this 
 active trading there is really no point, since the same teams remain powerful. This may be why 
 the customizable league stops after one season - but it would be nice to have active trading and 
 leagues that could continue year after year.  

 EA Sports brought on MLS commentator Julie "Rowdy" Foudy of the United States Woman's World Cup 
 team to provide the color commentary along with ESPN's Phil Schoen. While FIFA fans have become 
 familiar with the commentary style of respected English commentator John Motson, Foudy is pleasant 
 enough, although it is disorienting to hear her talk about tackles on a football field (meaning 
 American football) within the context of a soccer game.  

 While there is some room for improvement, FIFA 2000 delivers on almost every front and is a fast-paced, 
 enjoyable, and challenging soccer game with numerous options and lots of depth. Though you may 
 find yourself wishing FIFA 2000 offered even more, it is ultimately a must for any soccer fan.

Review:  I love soccer games that are exactly like this. They're classics and fun to boot. I have had this 
 game since I was just a kid and I used to think it was the greatest soccer game ever. Now I know 
 that World Soccer Winning Eleven games are the best soccer games on the market. I still love the 
 FIFA games, but they aren't as good as the other series. The gameplay in this game is unbeleivablely 
 irresistable. It's a big challenge to put this game down, even if it is kind of an easy game to 
 get into. I know that every game in the FIFA series gets remade every year, but this would be impossible 
 to remake no matter how hard the developers try.

Review:  this is the by far best soccer game ive played to date. this game has it all great graphics for 
 its time, awsome music and commentary, smart and simple gamelay, and good thematics.
  this game is almost the obosite of the winning eleven. this game is realist but yet much easier 
 to score. this games user ai makes the shoot as hard and as long as it needs to be. 
  for when this game was made it was an inovationand a novelty. the only thing this game is missing 
 is a create a player node.
  THIS IS A MUST OWN FOR ANY VIDEO GAMER.

Review:  Simply put this is one of the best sports games ever. When I was younger I was very into sports 
 as well as video games. But now that I am older this is the only real sports game that scratches 
 my video game itch. After years of new games coming out most sports games are overlooked, and forgotten 
 about. Hell seeing as this is the first reader review to be written on this game one can tell that 
 after a couple years no one cares about sports games. But this one is truly one of the best sports 
 games ever, and after a year of buying them this is the only one I cared enough to keep.
