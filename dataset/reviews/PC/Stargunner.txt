:::Review:::
There is plenty of action, but it's a fight we've all won before. 

 This retooled space shoot-em-up preys on a participant's nostalgia of some manic conflict far in 
 the past in an attempt to achieve contemporary glory. There is plenty of action, but it's a fight 
 we've all won before.   

 Despite the hackneyed gimmicks found throughout, Stargunner is fun to play. There are three difficulty 
 levels and 33 stages set in stellar, terrestrial, and aquatic arenas - with each stage lasting 
 a few minutes. The bosses move in pre-programmed patterns. Some are difficult to beat without copious 
 reloads of the game. The ability to restore a game at any time via the game's one-key save and 
 load anywhere feature proves useful in such situations. The game's interface is nearly as simple 
 as pumping quarters into an old Defender machine. Mouse, stick, and keyboard controls are all supported 
 and configurable by a single keystroke.   

 The story is lifted right from the script of The Last Starfighter. You are an elite pilot from the 
 planet Ytima. Your mission is to single-handedly destroy a virtually infinite number of Zilion 
 warships and prevent certain invasion. Destroying enemy ships gains you power-ups and credits, 
 both of which must be picked up in mid-air. The latter may be redeemed at the end of each stage 
 for engines, weapons, smart bombs, and the like. While this adds an interesting twist, it is incongruent 
 with the story. Why would a planet on the verge of destruction not equip its best pilots with the 
 fastest ships and biggest guns? An arcade style plot sans the meaningless 3-D animation sequences 
 would have worked better.  

 The game has a few quirks. Terry Gilliam-esque clouds fly behind Chopper Command helicopters in 
 the terrestrial stages. I could have sworn I beat some of these bosses in the 1992 Turbo Grafx 
 game Gate of Thunder. The not-quite techno soundtrack is uninspiring and the disjointed voices 
 beg for deletion. "Spend more money" is squeaked out with annoying inflection while you're shopping 
 in the equipment store. Another voice warns, "And now for something completely different," which 
 can immediately be recognized by the entire English speaking portion of the galaxy as a blatant 
 Monty Python reference.   

 The genre begs for something new and Stargunner fails to deliver. You probably already own several 
 games almost exactly like Stargunner. Why buy another?

Review:  There are some people who just don't appreciate shooters too well. Hey, I could stand here and 
 name every shooter that was or is like Star Gunner, but that would be pointless. What they don't 
 get is that each shooter is unique. Provided, that yes, shooters all play the same and have the 
 same concept, but they each have their own style and how the powerup's are used.
  
  GRAPHICS
  =========
  Very well done. Although a little simplistic, simple can be good. Animations 
 are smooth and flowing. A lot of the ships, weapons, and powerups are all very well detailed. For 
 a DOS game, this game is a classic to have.
  
  CONTROL
  =========
  Controls are simple and easy to manage. Gameplay is very good and you will love how simple it is 
 to control the ship around the screen. The fact that you can buy powerups and upgrades is a very 
 nice touch. Most shooters allow you to only make a selection from a set of pre-set weapons and 
 powerups. This game allows you to choose your weapons and powerups as you see fit and fashion the 
 ship the way you want it.
  
  OVBERALL
  =========
  This is a classical shooter that you would love. Powerups, items, lots of ships to fight, tough 
 bosses, plenty of ways to play the game. This is a shooter lovers delight.
