:::Review:::
The game moves incredibly well, and looks fantastic in the process. 

 Originally released for the PlayStation in 1996, Wipeout XL is a futuristic racing game involving 
 speeding antigravity ships, winding tracks, and powerful weapons. The PC version's Direct3D support 
 gives this new release a nice face-lift, while still keeping intact the fast action and stylized 
 graphics that console players have come to know and love.  

 There isn't much of a story behind Wipeout XL. The year is 2097, and, well, apparently that's all 
 the reason you need to hold a series of insanely fast races. The game has eight tracks in all (two 
 of these are hidden) , ranging from lush jungle scenery, to oil refineries in disrepair. You pick 
 from five vehicles (one is hidden) , each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The various craft 
 are rated in acceleration, top speed, turning ability, aerodynamics, and shield strength.  

 Graphically, Wipeout XL improves quite a bit over its PlayStation counterpart, which isn't much 
 of a surprise, considering the game requires hardware acceleration. The game moves incredibly well, 
 and looks fantastic in the process. There is still a little bit of pop-up in the distance, and 
 the ships' shadows look more than a little weird at times, but everything else, from the long blue 
 engine trails to each track's unique scenery, is top-notch.  

 Wipeout XL plays like most other racing games. Checkpoints are spread throughout the tracks, and 
 passing one replenishes your timer. The ships' shields can be replenished in a pit area near the 
 beginning of each track. How do the shields get depleted? Aside from the normal collisions and 
 bad steering decisions, there are a number of one-shot weapons that can be picked up by running 
 over large X's on the track. Some of the weapons are simple missiles and mines, but there are also 
 electric bolts that short-circuit opponents, and a huge earthquake missile that sends a rippling 
 wave up the track, heavily damaging anything within its range. The best Wipeout XL players are 
 those who not only race very well, but can also effectively use the various weapons to eliminate 
 their enemies.  

 The music in Wipeout XL is good, but pales in comparison to the original PlayStation soundtrack, 
 which was filled with amazing tracks from then up-and-comers such as the Chemical Brothers, Future 
 Sounds of London, and The Prodigy. These tracks helped make the PlayStation version's music one 
 of the best video game soundtracks of all time. In June, Psygnosis made it public that the music 
 would be missing due to the technical complexity involved in translating the game from its original 
 PlayStation incarnation, which would lead one to believe that the PC version would either make 
 use of a MIDI soundtrack, or contain no music at all. But the PC version's music is on the disc 
 in full redbook audio, which presumably means that Psygnosis couldn't regain the license to the 
 original soundtrack. It's really a shame, because while the new music is competent, it doesn't 
 approach the roller coaster ride delivered by the previous music.  

 All in all, Wipeout XL is a good racing game that makes great use of the Direct3D API. It delivers 
 the kind of fast moving gameplay that until recently was only available on console systems. Game-starved 
 3-D accelerator owners should definitely check it out.
