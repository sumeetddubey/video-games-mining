:::Review:::
It's something to goof around with when you have 10 minutes to kill, but if you want any more than 
 that, you should look elsewhere. 

 Tired of playing Windows Solitaire? If you want a similarly light and vaguely amusing game with 
 which to while away a few spare minutes, then R/C Helicopter Indoor Flight Simulation might be 
 the game for you. Like 2000's Airfix Dogfighter, R/C Helicopter lets you do what you couldn't get 
 away with as a kid: fly motorized scale aircraft through the house. Created by Japanese developer 
 Aqua System, R/C Helicopter is, in a way, a decent example of how to create a budget game. Very 
 few budget games can compete with the big boys in the prestigious shooter or racing genres, for 
 instance. R/C Helicopter instead sticks to a very simple but unusual concept. Unfortunately, the 
 game is so simple and so dogged by design problems that it's hard to recommend to serious gamers. 
 Casual gamers might find it mildly entertaining for a little while, though.           Fly over 
 and under desks and chairs to collect stars in the adventure mode.    

 In R/C Helicopter, you'll control 1:48-scale helicopters such as the McDonnell Douglas MD520N, Italian 
 Augusta A-109 K2, the Japanese Air Force's Kawasaki OH-1, the US military's AH-64 Apache, and others. 
 You'll get to unlock more helicopters as you progress through the game. Each one has noticeably 
 different flight characteristics, so the array of helicopters isn't just for show.   

  You can control the helicopters with either your keyboard or a joystick. It requires a lot of coordination 
 to manage a helicopter's unusual mode of flying in real life, and the same is true in this game. 
 Unfortunately, you can't alter the low sensitivity of the keyboard controls or the high sensitivity 
 of the joystick controls. Whichever you choose, you're bound for some frustrating flying.   

  R/C Helicopter offers just two simple modes of play: challenge and adventure. Challenge lets 
 you unlock successively tougher levels with four trials each, and you can complete the trials in 
 any order. The tasks begin with simple maneuvers, like landing on a small raised platform in the 
 middle of a large empty loft. As you progress, you'll need to circle around poles, dodge or destroy 
 balloons, shoot targets with the Apache helicopter, land on moving platforms located perilously 
 close to the ceiling, and so forth. You'll need to beat a fixed score to pass each challenge, with 
 the score based on time taken and the accuracy and smoothness of your landing. These challenges 
 are just barely interesting enough to keep you occupied for a while. They're certainly no great 
 test of your intellect or reflexes. As long as you have a very steady hand and lots of patience, 
 you'll do fine.   

  But some of these challenges can be frustrating, not just because of the game's poor controls, 
 but also because of the poorly implemented camera system that lags behind the chopper and gets 
 blocked by the scenery. Get ready to rip the rotors off your helicopter more than once as you bash 
 into walls or the ceiling. R/C Helicopter would have made a great children's game because of its 
 simple goals and lack of violence -- if only the controls and camera weren't so trying.   

  Along with the challenge mode, you get adventure mode, in which you fly through a house filled 
 with chairs, bookcases, desks, stereos, and the like. Your goal is to collect stars hidden about 
 the rooms, searching them out in drawers and cabinets or under furniture. You'll literally unlock 
 new rooms as you collect all the stars in a room, with doors now granting access to previously 
 closed sections of the house. Like challenge mode, adventure mode offers very little in the way 
 of sophistication or diversity, and the camera and control problems become even greater hindrances 
 than in the challenge mode because of the many cramped areas you'll need to navigate.          
  Flying around one of the obstacles in challenge mode.    

 Visually, R/C Helicopter will remind you of early 3D tech demos or student computer art projects: 
 pleasant but nothing memorable or close to cutting edge. You do get some mirrored textures, like 
 polished wood floors, but for the most part, the textures and objects all look fairly simple, if 
 not simplistic. What most hurts the visuals is the monotonously bright and unrealistic lighting. 
 At least the helicopters themselves are fairly well modeled and animated, which helps offset the 
 general blandness of the other graphics.   

  The game's sound matches the visuals: It's competent enough to get the job done. The sound effects 
 are fairly convincing but extremely basic -- you'll mainly hear just the helicopter engines. The 
 soundtrack largely sticks with disposable electronic dance pop.   

  The lack of audiovisual richness and imagination is indicative of R/C Helicopter as a whole. The 
 game's design is simplicity itself, though that's not necessarily a bad thing as long as you know 
 what you're getting. R/C Helicopter is more an amusement than a true game. It's something to goof 
 around with when you have 10 minutes to kill, but if you want any more than that, you should look 
 elsewhere.
