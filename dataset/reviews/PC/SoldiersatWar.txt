:::Review:::
If you're not looking for a time-intensive, stat-heavy WWII experience, then Soldiers at War is 
 definitely worth a spin. 

 Random Games came very close to making a great game with last year's Wages of War. The engine, a 
 detailed isometric view of a battlefield, showed great promise, with its Jagged Alliance meets 
 X-COM style. A fairly clumsy interface, bugs, and a lethally slow pace conspired to ruin this promise, 
 but the same core technology is now back and largely fixed in SSI's Soldiers at War.   

 Think "X-COM in World War II" and you have a general idea of what Soldiers at War offers. The perspective 
 on the battlefield is a finely detailed god's-eye view of your grunts as they shoot, stab, and 
 explode their way through a series of WWII missions ranging from Sicily to Normandy. All battles 
 cover the European theater in small maps and can be played either in a campaign or single missions. 
 The benefit of the campaign is that you can carry your already-equipped squad from mission to mission 
 and rack up kills. Units gain rank and medals over campaigns, thereby earning more action points. 

 Each mission has specific goals, and action covers street fighting, building-to-building combat, 
 assault, defense, and special ops. You may, for instance, have to find a map or rescue a trapped 
 unit. Action begins with selection of a squad from a large roster of soldiers, each with varying 
 skills. Some are better shots, while others are tougher, and so on. The unit selection screen is 
 a weak link, since you need to bring up a dossier on each soldier to see its ratings, instead of 
 being able to tell at a glance or scroll through them all. After a squad is formed, it is equipped 
 with a wide array of weapons, including several types of guns, flamethrowers, grenades, knives, 
 and explosives. Medikits, radios, minesweepers, and other tools are also available.  

 Units move and perform actions in turns, with enemy actions either shown (if they are in your line 
 of sight) or obscured (if not) . Units can kneel, crawl, walk, run, shoot, throw grenades, set explosives, 
 reload their weapons, take over tanks, and generally do just about anything by expending combat 
 points. The use of tanks is a bit off in the game: You can hop inside and fire the gun, but you 
 can't drive them around. Plus, not all tanks can be used, which is disconcerting.   

 Interaction with your soldiers has its strong and weak points. A simple pop-up menu gives you access 
 to all commands, but there is minimal keyboard support. I would much rather play this game without 
 the mouse, but only facing and a few minor interface commands have hotkeys. More annoying is the 
 separate status menu, which obscures almost half of the screen when open. It is unnecessarily bulky 
 and doesn't even have the benefit of including most commands. While this sliding screen does eliminate 
 the need for a framework interface, allowing the game to run full screen, it could have been made 
 more useful.   

 As a value, Soldiers at War has some hits and misses. The campaign game is too short at 15 missions, 
 and though some extra scenarios and multiplayer-specific maps are included, it just doesn't seem 
 like enough. This is more than balanced by SSI's continued release of missions free on its web 
 site, as well as by the custom mission editor. The editor enables the creation of custom maps and 
 scenarios, and while the interface is a little clumsy and performance flaky (I experienced some 
 palette shifts and crashes) , it is a potent tool for extending game life. Four-player Internet 
 multiplay also helps. A bug that prevented the Bulge mission from ending has been fixed in the 
 current patch.  

 This isn't a realistic WWII tactical sim like Close Combat or Steel Panthers. It's more like a World 
 War II movie, with plenty of dramatic sets and missions (think Aldo Raye in Battle Cry) . The combat 
 model will not appeal to tactical wargamers at all, since it is grossly simplified. This doesn't 
 affect the fun factor, however, which is extremely high. Random Games is slowly realizing the flaws 
 in its initial Wages of War design. A more streamlined interface and better keyboard support are 
 still in order, as are faster pacing and larger maps. We can hope Random Games will include some 
 of these refinements in the Warhammer game it's making with the same engine. (And ditch the tacky 
 Clutch Cargo commander intros.)  

 If you're not looking for a time-intensive, stat-heavy WWII experience, then Soldiers at War is 
 definitely worth a spin. It's attractive, entertaining, and challenging, and while it may lack 
 the depth of Jagged Alliance, it is at least as satisfying as the tactical mode of X-COM.

Review:  I got this game back in 98 or 99 in one of those 4 game packages with Panzer General 2 and Steel 
 Panthers. Anyway I installed it and played the tutorial and just fell in love with it. It is a 
 very difficult game where you make one mistake and you can expect to just reload and start again. 
 This is a game where patience and intelligence are key. I have a big fascination with WWII and 
 this game just fit right into my world. The single player campaign mode is simple. You select your 
 8 men to take into the mission out of the 32 possible all with different qualifications and ranks. 
 If you lose a man in combat he will no longer be there to select in the future missions, hence 
 the reason to reload saved games instead of forcing a victory with few men. It was the strategy 
 that always gave me problems when I first played the game. I use to love using the Thompson, but 
 as I have went back to play this game being older and wiser I realized that was a fools move to 
 even carry one unless deamed necessary. Also the scenario creator/editor was a huge addition to 
 this game. Being able to create your own battle fields and decide how many soldiers would fight 
 or appear on the map and which side you would fight as or what would be the reason for the battle/encounter. 
 Also if you wanted you could play all sides or take turns with a friend letting one control a side 
 while the other controls the opposite side. Endless situations of course they would get boring 
 for anyone but the point is that this game gives the player the opportunity to be creative and 
 gives the game more life. Been said that Soldiers at War was great for its time but I still believe 
 its great even now. So if your looking for a squad turn-based strategy then do your best at finding 
 this to pick up for cheap and try it out, are sure to not be dissappointed!

Review:  I've spent I don't know how many hours playing this game, and if I could find it nowadays, I would 
 definitely give it another run. I was perhaps 10 when I started playing it, and I have to say, 
 it was the first computer game I ever bought, and I didn't feel ripped off. The campaign missions 
 are aggreeably tough, but they're all unlocked right away, so you can choose to replay a favorite. 
 Also, there is a fairly substantial editor, where you can spend alot of time creating your own 
 scenarios. It is tough at first, but you will get the hang of it.

Review:  This game is one of the most hardest and worst made World War Two games that I've ever bothered 
 to play. Its really hard to get the hang of the game. The gameplay is so ridiculous that I quit 
 and removed this game from my PC. I was on the first level when I frigging got stuck in the barnhouse. 
 I only had a few bullets, so I killed the enemy on the street. Then the game went in a sequence 
 where the enemies and civilians took their turn. The only thing that is actually okay is the graphics. 
 They are between poor and great. I don't recommend this game to any gamers, even if they like strategy 
 or shooting games.
