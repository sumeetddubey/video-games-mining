:::Review:::
EA's NHL series once again ups the bar, not only for hockey games but for all sports games. 

 
 The level of realism in this year's crop of sports games is both frightening and exciting. Even 
 without taking the unbelievable graphics you get with a 3D card into consideration, 1997 is shaping 
 up to be a breakout year for the genre. Computer-controlled players are smarter, physics are better, 
 and gameplay is more exciting than ever. Throw in awesome graphics and audio, and sports games 
 are finally coming into their own.  

 NHL 98 is one of the front-runners in this bumper crop of sports games. Each year, this game gets 
 so good, it's hard to fathom how it could get better; not that past versions of the game were perfect, 
 but compared to other sports games, this hockey series has consistently been one of the best.  
 

 The major improvement in the '98 edition comes in the area of control. It's about time EA Sports 
 got around to supporting more than a two-button control scheme. You can do a lot more with a couple 
 more buttons, and all EA needed to do was take a look at console sports games. With just this one 
 simple addition, as well as a few other improvements, EA's NHL series once again ups the bar, not 
 only for hockey games but for all sports games.  

 The four-button control scheme makes doing some moves easier than before. The designers removed 
 the need for double clicking on the gamepad, and some of the moves that previously relied on double 
 clicks, like speed burst, are now assigned to a single button. Maybe someday EA will decide to 
 include full eight-button support for the aging Gravis GrIP or the Gravis GamePad Pro.  

 Finally, the game includes some strategic elements, although not many. You can choose among four 
 different offensive and defensive strategies - and you can select these from the ice instead of 
 always having to exit to the menu. The game is still a bit shallow on the coaching side, but the 
 inclusion of any options at all is a welcome improvement.  

 The physics have improved so you get a greater sense of a player's size and momentum, making it 
 important to know how big your player is before you decide to go for a hard body check. Plus, the 
 puck doesn't seem to pass through players as much as it did in the past. You can even choose to 
 deflect a pass into the net instead of always using the less-subtle "one-timer."  

 For those who want to keep track of your season's statistics, EA has included the NHL 98 This Week 
 area, accessible while a season is in progress. It's a great way to keep up to date on injuries 
 and trades going on in your personal league. This is particularly helpful if you have several players 
 participating in a single league, which is made possible via the Internet or a local-area network. 

 Although AI is better, it still needs a little work. The goalie will now leave the net to stop the 
 unnecessary icing call, and players are smarter about going offsides or receiving a two-line pass, 
 but the game still has a few hitches. Still, play isn't stopped nearly as much as in years past. 
 There are also moments where computer-controlled players will not go after a loose puck - it's 
 like they don't see it or are not paying attention.  

 Apart from these improvements, everything else is pretty much standard fare for the series - which 
 is by no means a criticism. With only one or two potential threats on the horizon, NHL 98 is a 
 strong contender for the best sports game of the year.

Review:  When a game is part of a series, it has to be improved with the passing of time. The developers 
 of the NHL series do know their job very well, proved with the quality of this year's NHL.
  
  What is mostly improved is the graphics machine of the series, being more realistic than ever. 
 Furthermore, the sound engine is better than ever, allowing you to hear each and every single sound 
 on ice. Another major improvements this year is the AI which got even better. The skaters seem 
 smarter and do make better and more logical moves than ever before. The addition of new controls 
 is the most attractive new feature of NHL 98. The designers managed to introduce these keys which 
 are quite useful, while they avoided to make them useless, irritating and complex. It was, definately, 
 a major success for EA. It is a pity, though, that the coaching options are yet to be expanded 
 to a satisfying point. The problems the game faces are too minor to refer to and I am sure that 
 they will be fixed with 99.
  
  NHL 98 is a result of work doe with plaesure and passion. Personally, I hope that all games, sports 
 or not will be designed like this masterpiece.
