:::Review:::
All in all, the games were faithful to their tangible counterparts - and often as addictive. 
 

 There's a reason why people have been playing chess, checkers, and backgammon from time immemorial 
 - they're fun. And in essence, Sierra's success with Hoyle Classic Board Games depended on translating 
 favorite games to the computer as exactly and as completely as possible - leaving the time-honored 
 gameplay well enough alone and adding just a few little computer-aided perks. Happily, Sierra has 
 done just that.   

 Checkers, Chess, Chinese Checkers, Battle Ships, Snakes &amp; Ladders, Yacht, Backgammon, Pachisi, 
 Zen Bones, and Dominoes are collectively the names of the game. They're all true to their board 
 game counterparts, but each has a little computer enhancement - your dancing animated piece in 
 Snakes &amp; Ladders, for example, or the very cool clear board for Battle Ships that's more fun 
 to play on than Hasbro's official Battleship game.  

 All the rules are quickly and immediately accessible from a pull-down menu, which is convenient 
 when you forget the rules for removing a stone from the middle in backgammon. Additionally, the 
 game comes with a handy and informative little book that provides histories of each game as well 
 as rules; if you need a little background info or always wondered if Chinese checkers really did 
 get its start in ancient Persia (it didn't - it was Sweden) , you can just check the book and find 
 out.   

 You have a number of options to increase your playing pleasure, including changing the music (options 
 include fall, detective, and Eastern among others) , the background texture, and the shape of the 
 shadow that represents you (the jester was particularly appealing) . And best of all, you control 
 the level of chattiness of the 12 other players, who include an annoying lawyer doing his best 
 Mr. Howell imitation, a sweet grandmotherly old lady who'll metaphorically skewer you with her 
 knitting needles if you present her with the opportunity, as well as the more unusual alien twins 
 and Gax, who alternately metamorphoses his green face into Elvis and Marilyn Monroe (Boop-boop-bi-do, 
 baby) .   

 Each AI player has three settings - beginner, intermediate, and expert. The problem was that changing 
 the level of difficulty sometimes didn't seem to do much. I lost at chess no matter what level 
 I was on (I'm admittedly a terrible, horrible player) and won easily at Chinese checkers on each 
 level. Backgammon had subtle shades of changing intensity, as did pachisi, which made them significantly 
 more fun - and as for games like Yacht and Snakes &amp; Ladders, how much skill is really involved 
 anyway?   

 All in all, the games were faithful to their tangible counterparts - and often as addictive. And 
 since you're launched into a new game each time the old one ends, you may find saying "Just one 
 more game" to be way too easy.
