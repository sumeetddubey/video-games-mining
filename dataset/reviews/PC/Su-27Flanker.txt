:::Review:::
Developed in Russia, SSI's Su-27 Flanker is one of the most elaborate and realistic flight simulators 
 ever released. 

 Realistic flight sims are hard to come by, and for a long time hard-core flight sim fans have had 
 only Falcon 3.0 and a few others to turn to. Well, Falcon just got blown out of the sky by Ivan. 
 Developed in Russia, SSI's Su-27 Flanker is one of the most elaborate and realistic flight simulators 
 ever released. It's also tough to master and very unforgiving, and you'll have to spend some time 
 to learn to fly it right.  

 Sukhoi's Su-27 is one of Russia's front-line air superiority fighters. Its state-of-the art features 
 include a complex fly-by-wire system, great maneuverability, jam-proof radar, helmet-mounted 
 target designator, and standoff look-down/shoot-down capabilities. Plus, the well-designed air 
 frame and set of engines give it good stability and the ability to perform some awesome maneuvers. 

 Su-27 brings the Flanker to life with detailed, clean graphics (though some might call them plain) , 
 showing all moving control surfaces and providing some sweet explosions. Flight modeling is second 
 to none, with handling characteristics that feel like the real thing. Enemies are smart, and the 
 network of SAM batteries and enemy aircraft that oppose you on any mission make for some thick 
 action.  

 Missions are controlled from a stark main menu based around a map of Crimea, where the action takes 
 place. You can edit all mission parameters (loadout, wingmen, even threats) , making for a high 
 degree of control over each mission and allowing you to create your own scenarios. The interface 
 is somewhat cumbersome and clunky, but it's worth spending some time to get to the meat of Su-27. 

 When it was first released, Su-27 was plagued by bugs and problems. These have been fixed in version 
 1.1, which adds numerous features as well as head-to-head play. This review is based on this version, 
 and it makes Su-27 the best flight sim in town. At the risk of provoking cries of heresy! 
 from flight sim nuts, I'd say it's better than Falcon 3.0. It's that good.

Review:  This was one of the first video games that i ever played. First off, let me say, if you are interested 
 in planes at all then the game manual is a great read, whether you play the game or not. 
  This game will probably crash your computer a few times, but when you actually get into the flow 
 of the game it is quite a fun game.
  One very bad thing about this game is how bad the main menu design is. It is straight out terrible. 
 It is very hard to actually get started on a mission, and sometimes when you start a mission, you 
 will have no clue what you are supposed to be doing, or where you are going. 
  On the plus side, for its time this game was revolutionary. Its flight physics are outstanding. 
 I have never liked flight sim games, but this is teh bomb.
  So, if you want to have a throwback game, check out SU-47 Flanker.
