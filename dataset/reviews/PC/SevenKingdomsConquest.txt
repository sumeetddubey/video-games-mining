:::Review:::
Bugs and bottom-drawer RTS gameplay tarnish this latter-day addition to the Seven Kingdoms series. 
 

  The resurrection of an old game franchise is never without pitfalls, and Seven Kingdoms: Conquest 
 seems to plummet into just about every one of them. Enlight Software's latest has nothing to do 
 with the historical-strategy epic that turned a lot of heads back in 1997, and has moved from a 
 complex empire builder to a simplistic, fantasy-oriented real-time strategy game that pits humans 
 against demons. Beyond that, the game is clearly unfinished and has a tremendous number of serious 
 bugs, few strategic choices during gameplay, and campaign missions that amount to nothing more 
 than skirmishes by different names.  

            Building farms, building mines. We're guessing that you've probably done this before. 

  Instability is the biggest problem. Seven Kingdoms: Conquest is, to use the technical term, buggy 
 as hell. Just getting the game to start is a challenge, and glitches can bring everything to a 
 halt at any time. Not only did every one of these frequent lockups require an Ctrl-Alt-Del escape 
 to the Windows desktop, but they also seemed to cause some sort of lasting graphical corruption 
 that prevented a successful restart of the game. The game would load, but with a black background 
 screen in the main menu and lots of visual artifacts and stuttering music. Only a full uninstall 
 and reinstall got the game working again... at least until the next big crash.  

  Other serious problems plague the game even if you get it running properly for a few minutes. The 
 human tutorial mission is so messed up that it's unplayable due to scripting errors, such as a 
 gate that refuses to open. Some campaign and skirmish missions with annihilation as the objective 
 can't be won even if you wipe out all of your enemies. Pathfinding is awful for the most part, 
 which means that units easily get stuck behind buildings. And any sort of adjustment to the visual 
 settings seems to cause the game to crash even sooner than it usually would. This actually serves 
 as a kind of trap, given that you're bound to go into the video-options screen eventually in search 
 of a way to improve the gloomy, horrifically pixelicious visuals, or at least to change the default 
 resolution to something supporting widescreen monitors. (Don't bother, the game's limited to 1024x768 
 and 1280x1024.) To make a long story short, wait for the patch.  

  Or not. There isn't much here worth hanging around for, actually. Although the original two games 
 in this franchise were hardcore strategy epics that blended real-time battles with intricate empire 
 management and economics, Seven Kingdoms: Conquest is a generic RTS that pits humans against demons, 
 and it features generic resource gathering and base building. You don't even get to play with the 
 seven kingdoms that gave the franchise its name. Instead of the partially realistic, diverse ancient 
 powers that gave the first game its depth, such as the Chinese and the Persians, you're stuck with 
 a handful of nearly identical human factions given historical names such as Hittites and Saxons. 
 The only appreciable difference between these nations is the visual appearance of units in the 
 interface. (As an example, Egyptian troops wear those famous desert headpieces.) Troop and building 
 options change as you move forward from the starting Early Bronze Age through the closing Middle 
 Age, but even then it's not as if you're thrown any curveballs. Bowmen turn into crossbowmen, and 
 catapults become trebuchets -- that sort of thing. At any rate, the human factions play the same 
 no matter what age you're currently undergoing.  

  Stereotypical characteristics such as flame, ice, plague, and shadow make the seven demon-realm 
 factions more interesting, but there isn't much to choose from no matter what faction you're commanding. 
 Admittedly, some of the monsters are pretty cool in an old-school D&amp; D fashion, given that you 
 have the ability to summon troops like yeti, plague demons, and naga. Nevertheless, each realm 
 uses the same two basic units, larvae and succubi, and you get only a handful of unique options 
 to choose from when building the unit-summoning hellgates. Resource gathering has a more intriguing, 
 darker vibe, although collecting the blood needed to summon monsters is about as creepy as pumping 
 oil, and the facilities that gather stone are just mines under the spookier name of "stone shrines." 
 Monotony grows fast.  

  Game options do nothing to alleviate this sense of boredom. The human and demon campaigns consist 
 of skirmish missions given opening screens and voice-over intros that recount soldiers' diaries. 
 The voice acting is surprisingly good considering the low-budget nature of the game, although the 
 gritty effect is ruined when these first-person accounts wrap up with mention of dates like "756 
 BC." Uh-huh. At any rate, the "campaign" missions all task with you building up a base, cranking 
 out troops, and killing everything in sight. The actual skirmish missions do the same, but they're 
 a little better than the campaigns because you at least have the option to pick a faction to play, 
 along with your opponents, a map, and the starting age. You just can't take skirmishes online, 
 at least not without knowing an opponent's IP in advance, because there is no matchmaking service. 

           Demon hordes on the attack. Look really closely and you can see some horns.      

 
  Gameplay in both modes rarely varies from the RTS formula, with the only real difference being 
 the need to deal with neutral villages and cities. Maps are dotted with these settlements, which 
 can be attacked or brought over to your side with human ambassador or demon succubi units. Not 
 that you ever really need to resort to diplomacy. The AI is so incompetent that it never mounts 
 anything resembling a reasonable attack or defense, particularly in larger maps. Enemy cities will 
 crank out troops, but they're sent on what seem to be mindless raids against you and the odd neutral 
 village, more like they're pillaging marauders than a coherent army in the field. Computer-controlled 
 foes also never seem to bother with the monster-guarded treasure hordes and demonstones (mana-providing 
 resources) scattered around the maps.  

  Essentially, Seven Kingdoms: Conquest is a disaster in just about every imaginable fashion. A few 
 patches may yet round it into some kind of playable shape, but right now this is simply another 
 cookie-cutter RTS loaded with serious bugs and unfulfilled potential.

Review:  This is easily the worst strategy game I have ever played. First off, while many RTSs nowadays 
 are developed based on some storylines, this game does the absolute opposite. There is hardly any 
 story in the Campaign and this mode looks like a series of tutorials and skirmish to familiarize 
 players with the game. Besides, the technology system provided is quite complex and requires us 
 to upgrade our towns many times. Unfortunately, most of the skirmish or multiplayer games will 
 not last long enough for players to use half of these techniques, making them totally redundant. 
 One more funny thing of this game is the AI. If you have enough patience to play through Campaign 
 Mode, you will surely receive a surprising gift from the AI: you machine opponents will automatically 
 destroy each other, giving you victory without any effort. Well, these are not all the flaws of 
 7 Kingdoms Conquest, but I guess it's enough for me already.

Review:  Remember the good old days when you could research leaders, ballistas, cannons and manufacturing 
 techniques in Seven Kingdoms? Well, forget that and welcome to the crapola known as Seven Kingdoms 
 Conquest aka Warcraft 3 lite.
  
  I was expecting the usual affair that Seven Kingdoms is famous for but I'm left sorely disappointed. 
 Seven Kingdoms was all about economics management, leadership development, diplomacy and some of 
 the best damn RTS game play I have ever seen. 
  
  Well, now economics management such as setting up markets, creating trade caravans are all thrown 
 out in favor of digging for gold. There are three mining techniques that you can research but other 
 than that, there aren't any more. The problem with this research is that you have to research one 
 mine at a time instead of all at once, which is kind of stupid. And where the hell is the market 
 in all this, oh yeah it doesn't exist anymore. 
  
  Remember when you can move people onto a caravan and start up a new town? That's gone too. So much 
 for the population intricacy that is prevalent in previous 7k installments. 
  
  Remember the research tower where you can research multiple weapons like cannons, ballistas, mining 
 techniques and manufacturing techniques? Well, that's gone too. 
  
  Remember when you could hire people in inns? Well, that's gone too. Remember when you could built 
 different forts around town to train generals and soldiers alike? Well, that's gone too. 
  
  Remember those colorful beings that people could summon up from the seat of power? Well, that's 
 gone too. 
  
  Remember the factories where you can control the workers and move them to the next factory as soon 
 as the mine is dried up? Well, that's gone too.
  
  So, enough about what Seven Kingdoms Conquest is missing. Let's see what it has. It has terrible 
 scrolling for some reason, half of the time I thought I was looking at the town when I was far 
 off in the distance. 
  
  Enough of the problems, let's focus on some of the gameplay and units in this game. Let's start 
 off by talking about heroes, they are great for tanking because they can learn the ability to heal 
 people around them and they have lots of hit points. You can assign a bunch of troops under it 
 for good measure so it gets protected well. 
  
  Another good unit in this game is the priest, they are sort of like this games equivalent of the 
 witch doctor in Warcraft 3 but they don't have that 30 seconds of continuous healing but rather 
 just 100 points of healing and they only can heal twice per full bar given their 200 points of 
 magic. 
  
  You do get some diplomacy in this game, but it's just half assed. It actually costs you 230 golds 
 just to create three ambassdors, send them over to the nearest village and propose alliance to 
 them. Sometimes they accept, but other times they refuse. It's better if you just send an army 
 over to the town and conquer it. That way, it's actually cheaper.
  
  That's pretty much sums up the skirmishes, let's talk about the campaign. The campaign is really 
 nothing to write home about either, since there isn't central heroes like in AOE 3 that attracts 
 you or draw you in. There is not much of a plot to the campaign either, something that Ensembles 
 need to fix badly since the beginning of Seven Kingdoms. 
  
  All in all, Seven Kingdoms Conquest is one horrible game that has spit on the great tradition that 
 it once has. So for any serious Seven Kingdoms fan, please skip this game if you want to remember 
 Seven Kingdoms for what it was instead of what it turned to. If you want to be masochistic, then 
 by all mean buy this game and play it as long as you want.

Review:  Seriously, if you've never played any of the Seven Kingdoms before, do not get this one. Buggy, 
 frustrating and terrible AI are just some of the many pot holes that litter this game. Good points 
 (of which there are few) is that they are actually trying to keep the Seven Kingdoms brand alive, 
 but in this case have made things worse and damaged its reputation as a result. If only they would 
 stick to the style and play of the original Seven Kingdoms instead of going into unknown territory 
 where they make a great dog's arse of the situation.
  
  Get the original Seven Kingdoms over this tripe any day as this game is a waste of time, money, 
 effort and space. It may sound a little bit harsh but that is my honest opinion and this is a game 
 that did not live up to my expectations.

Review:  I usually don't agree with gamespot reviews but this is a rare moment that i must. This game is 
 horrible!!! The name, brand and everything else has nothing to do with prequel. Bugs everywhere, 
 (even in tutorial for gods sake) , AI is catastrophic, unit movements are incredibly stupid (unit 
 circles half a mile around the target and then hit it, instead of just turning around) and lots 
 of other stuff I won't even mention. This game was not meant to be sold, but studied to show other 
 developers how crappy your game can be. It's a laughing stock on game market. Thank god I live 
 in country where piracy is not illegal yet, so I didn't bought this garbage.
  
  But still, as I go through games today I see a lot of these kind of unfinished, buggy and unplayable 
 games build up in numbers. It's seems that quality has been traded with quantity. It's like: "Hey 
 we made some game. Lets sell it no matter it lacks everything the game should have. Put some famous 
 name on it and thats it." Sucks, but it's truth.

Review:  In the beginning you and I were promised humans vs. demons, from the bronze age to nanotech and 
 stuff. And here it comes, and the whole battle ends with middle ages. No tanks vs. demons, which 
 would be awesome, because the only place where demons meet heavy armour is W40K. And now the best 
 troops in the field are medieval swordsmen and such. Despite these shortcomings, much can be done 
 with proper campaign. And since this game aims for the stars of crapdom, there is none. Well, there 
 is such choice in the main menu, you can chose between human and demon one. But they only have 
 about 5 separate missions, which have no link between them, no chracters, nothing. You just get 
 thrown into a skirmish map. Sins of a Solar Empire may have gotten way with it by being a superior 
 game, but someone as weak SKQ just can't stand the beating. 
  Let's not forget graphics. While it may look nice and nostalgic for players of Age of Mythology 
 and maybe Battle for the Middle-Earth, but judged by today's standarts (ignoring Age of Empires 
 3, which didn't look that good) it is weak and outdated. And intro might have been in place in 
 the age of Diablo (the First) .
  The sound. Well, nothing good here. The shouts of heroes, the speech pf demonic instructor are 
 plain annoying. 'Nuff said.
  If you have money to spend, you can get a better product almost without looking. Warcraft 3, Age 
 of Mythology and many games in 2D.

Review:  pros: (took me 10 min to think of this)
  after nearly a decade of eager anticipation. hardcore seven kingdoms series fans ( me my self and 
 handsome i included) finally get to have our hands on the latest installment in the once popular 
 series. 
  
  cons: (take a deep breathe) 
  -absolute **** gameplay in comparison to its fantastic predecessors (which were arguably 2 of the 
 greatest rts games in history) . The fine noobs at Enlight took away all the well crafted features 
 found in the previous 2 games which made them so popular and implemented a warcraft 3 wannabe gameplay 
 system. End result = a terribly broken game that has no replay value what so ever.
  
  -crappy graphics totally sux even with all graphic settings on max + hdr. (would be acceptable 
 if released a few years earlier, but not in 2008 thank you very much) .
  
  -no widescreen support wtf? in this day and age.... this is totally unacceptable ... developers 
 go spank ur own arses .
  
  -frame rate is very unstable even on a relatively uber system. (dipped into low 20s with no apparent 
 on-screen activity with a geforce 8800gtx rig ) .
  
  -crappy sound effects are well below standards. some of the demons sounded like that they were 
 getting gang banged when given commands. (last time i checked this ain't no hentai game) .
  
  -Computer AI (even on the hardest difficulty) is so noob that my hamster can pwn its arse and 
 awp it in the head with eyes closed. ffs i trashed the hardest computer player (some random demon 
 race) in my second skirmish game. that should tell u something.
  
  -took Enlight developers 9 years to create this piece of junk?... plzzzz noobs... try to do ur jobs 
 properly, bludgers like you guys are the reason why the world is in an economic recession.
  
  -totally ruined the fine reputation of the seven kingdoms series.
  
  overall this game 
 sux **** not just any ordinary ****.. but deep demon ****

Review:  The reason is the following. I can overlook the thing that it has less then average graphics (even 
 spellforce 1 and warcraft 3 had better) . I can overlook the sound of this game, where units don't 
 speak words but they just go "ARRRGHHH, AYAAAAH, WOOOOH" when you click on them. Or I can overlook 
 the fact that the tutorial is bugged that you can't even finish the HUMAN tutorial of the game, 
 since there is a magical wall between you and the city you are sent to atack.
  But what I cannot overlook is the fact that they butcherd seven kingdoms. They Took everething 
 wich made the game good in the first place and they simply removed it. There is NO DIPLOMACY anymore.... like 
 that is the first thing I think about when thinking of sk2, it was one of the first games who had 
 the diplomacy context in it. 
  But then there is also no forts, no ability to train soldiers as time passes, or no ability to 
 get certain troops of certain profesions to level their profesion as they keep working. Like miners 
 geting beter miners when stayng in a mine, or reserchers leveling up their skill while reserching. 
 NOTHING. 
  To be honest if it was not for the title you would never in a million years think about comparing 
 this game with sk2. And if you think that I am joking, go buy the game and try it out because I 
 am not. 
  Now that I mentioned it I can't even think of one single thing that would be in sk2 and sk conquest, 
 not one.

Review:  First of all I'd like to mention that I enjoyed the old 7kgd and I spent many hours trying to beat 
 (in my opinion) the smarter AI. Why do I continue to kill you guys with this AI, well from my point 
 of view this series focused on tactics and trying to overcome your opponent, not today, not in 
 this game. I don't know why but when I first played the game, I hoped that I'd get a serious pounding, 
 but in return I played against a 3y old that has more skills in CS than in Real Time Strategy. 
 What I noticed was the random way the computer seems to think. First of all he starts like anybody, 
 trying to get some resources some gold there some food here ( some blood everywhere, if he plays 
 with the Daemons ) but then, instead of trying to build something more powerful or advanced, he 
 built the same old basic Spearman that doesn't even count. I had like 3 heroes , the computer was 
 attacking me with, guess what, lots of spearmen. Boy, the impression the game left me, was that 
 the general idea is, build as fast as you can, train as fast as you can, doesn't matter what, just 
 click something, click your pet, click your parents, just click man. That has nothing to do with 
 tactics. I'm sorry if my opinion towards this game is a little harsh, and of course many of you 
 might say that the AI is better later in the game, well honestly I don't think I'll have the patience 
 to reach that far in the game. But hey at least the graphics are decent, the sound is nice, but 
 that isn't enough right now. Maybe with some patches this game can be on the right track. I donno 
 about the rest of you, but I don't a good strategy game without a worthy opponent. Maybe its just 
 me and I am wrong. All in all if u want an easy game with good graphics and that will keep you 
 busy when you wanna waste some time, maybe this game is for you, if not i suggest playing RTW or 
 MTW2 or even the 2005's not so well known Knights of Honor. More fun games with an opponent for 
 you.
