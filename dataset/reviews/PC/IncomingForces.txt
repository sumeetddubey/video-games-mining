:::Review:::
Though it's certainly not bad, Incoming Forces isn't likely to inspire much excitement in anyone. 
 

 Released in the summer of 1998, the visually stunning Incoming was primarily a showcase for what 
 was, at the time, the new trend of using 3D accelerated graphics in computer games. In fact, the 
 original Incoming was a standard pack-in game for new graphics cards for a while. Four years later, 
 graphics in new PC games have advanced significantly, but Rage's sequel to Incoming, Incoming Forces, 
 doesn't really reflect that fact. Still, it's at least incrementally better than its predecessor 
 in virtually every respect, and as an arcade-style time waster, it's fitfully engaging enough to 
 more or less warrant its budget price. If a friend were to ask you to describe the experience, 
 you could probably sum it up best with a shrug and a dismissive, "Eh."           In Incoming Forces, 
 you play as aliens under attack from human forces.    

 In the first game, you assumed the role of humans fending off an attack by aliens. The plot of the 
 sequel is basically the same, except now you're aliens warding off humans who are still evidently 
 upset about the events in part one. Though the perspective has done a perfect 180, the action remains 
 essentially the same. You'll pilot an array of ground and air vehicles while shooting at enemy 
 air and ground vehicles.   

  The game is spread across 16 long missions. Each mission is broken into a linear series of five 
 or six secondary tasks such as escorting friendly vehicles, defending installations, and defeating 
 groups of attackers. You'll occasionally have more unusual goals, such as defending equipment or 
 destroying an opponent's shields without actually destroying its ship, but these are rare. Each 
 secondary task begins with a suggested vehicle, and though you're always free to switch to any 
 friendly unit that you find, it's usually best to go with the recommended one.   

  The vehicles include a few variations of fighter jets, artillery tanks, hovertanks, and turrets. 
 The plane control is decent enough, but the tanks seem awkward and sluggish, and they make turning 
 and firing a chore in the heat of battle. Your progress is permanently saved only at the end of 
 each mission (though there are two or three "soft" saves within each mission) , making the sometimes-sluggish 
 control more frustrating than it otherwise would be. Occasionally, you'll have wingmen you can 
 issue basic orders to. It's not an innovative feature, but the presence of autonomous friendly 
 units on the battlefield provides a real sense that you're in the middle of a pitched fight between 
 two actual forces.           The game has a few good special effects, but it's no graphical powerhouse. 
    

 For the successor to a game known primarily for its visuals, Incoming Forces' graphics are pretty 
 average. The game has some good special effects -- there's a nicely rendered penetrable cloud layer 
 over the terrain, some well-done water, and a few impressive particle-effect explosions. But overall, 
 the game's visual design is consistently bland and repetitive. The sky changes colors, there are 
 varying degrees of height in the terrain, and sometimes it rains, but generally speaking, every 
 level looks a lot like every other level. And unfortunately, every level of Incoming Forces also 
  plays  a lot like every other level.   

  The game has a few multiplayer options, including eight-player deathmatch and team deathmatch modes. 
 However, the game doesn't have a built-in server browser, and there's no support for the simultaneous 
 use of ground and air vehicles -- a server can only implement one or the other. Considering that 
 there are just four available maps on which to play the game, Incoming Forces' multiplayer component 
 just doesn't compare to other, more high-profile multiplayer action games.   

  Though it's certainly not bad, Incoming Forces isn't likely to inspire much excitement in anyone. 
 It's competent without being very imaginative or thrilling, and as such it's the type of thoroughly 
 generic action game that's best played in small doses, if at all.
