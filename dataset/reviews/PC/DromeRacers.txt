:::Review:::
If you're a fan of futuristic racers, there's probably nothing in Drome Racers to enjoy that you 
 haven't already seen in a better game. 

 It's hard to say exactly when Legos started copping an attitude. Regardless of when it happened, 
 though, there's no question that the Lego people have worked tirelessly to create an edgy image 
 for their brand of interlocking toy building blocks. If you're looking for proof, look no further 
 than Drome Racers, a futuristic racing game that uses actual Lego Racer-brand car designs. Why, 
 exactly, Drome Racers came to be isn't quite clear, but one thing is for certain: Whether you fondly 
 recall building little medieval castles and moon bases with your Legos, or this is your first exposure 
 to the brand, Drome Racers probably won't leave you with a very glowing opinion of futuristic racing 
 games  or  the Lego brand.           You're presented with a career mode consisting of increasingly 
 difficult racing leagues.    

  Developer ATD obviously did its homework and played plenty of Wipeout, and perhaps some off-road 
 racing games, as Drome Racers features all the trappings of your average futuristic racer, with 
 a couple of dirt tracks thrown in for good measure. As is expected from the genre, you're presented 
 with a career mode consisting of increasingly difficult racing leagues. The game also throws in 
 the occasional challenge, in which you'll face a single opponent in a one-off race. Another curious 
 deviation from the futuristic racer formula is the qualifying drag race. Before each set of races, 
 you're given the chance to improve your starting position through a series of drag races. Though, 
 if you already have a good starting position, or you just don't care, the qualifying races are 
 entirely optional.   

  Your standard race usually goes three laps, and each track is chock-full of speed-boosting pads, 
 health pick-ups, and offensive power-ups. The offensive power-ups appear in the form of a floating 
 red orb, and most of the weapons are pretty standard stuff. You'll get mines, guided and unguided 
 missiles, and so on. There are some unique power-ups, like the flare attack, which blinds your 
 opponents for a few seconds, or the repulsor, which turns your car into a hovercraft, giving you 
 better speed and handling, but even with these unique touches, Drome Racers just seems like it's 
 going through the motions. What little originality it has, like the qualifying drag races, is seriously 
 underplayed, and most of the experience comes off as generic.   

  It would have been nice to say that the uninspired design and presentation of Drome Racers are 
 offset by some superbly executed gameplay, but this is not the case. The races alternate between 
 off-road and paved races, but all the cars have oversteering problems and have consistently unreliable 
 control from the start. Though you can improve the attributes of your car as you progress through 
 the career mode, the impact of these improvements is modest. Also, it seems that the collision 
 detection always favors your opponent, because whether you're getting nudged or are the one doing 
 the nudging, you'll more often than not find yourself with your grill kissing the wall. The core 
 gameplay is summarily unenjoyable, and you'll probably find yourself going through the qualifying 
 drag races simply because they add a touch of variety.           The overall visual style of Drome 
 Racers borrows heavily from the countless other futuristic racers before it.    

  As far as looks go, the overall visual style of Drome Racers borrows heavily from the countless 
 other futuristic racers before it, applying a thin layer of quasi-futuristic style to the typical 
 desert canyon, snowy mountain, and cityscape levels. More care has been taken with the cars, which 
 look nearly identical to their real-world Lego counterparts. But the final retail version of the 
 game suffers from some bad frame rate problems, as well as the occasional missing texture and a 
 few other weird graphical glitches. In ideal conditions, the sound is a decent blend of futuristic-sounding 
 vehicle noises and a spacey, electronic soundtrack. But our standard hardware configuration revealed 
 some bad sound bugs, where certain sound effects would drop out and reappear randomly, the fidelity 
 of the sound effects would drop noticeably, and occasionally all the sound would be reduced to 
 a white hiss. Despite these technical issues, Electronic Arts has no patch for the game at this 
 time.   

  So, Drome Racers is a futuristic racing game of middling quality that, for some inexplicable reason, 
 carries the Lego license. If you're drawn to this title because of the Lego name, just know that 
 there are better futuristic racing experiences to be had. If you're a fan of futuristic racers, 
 there's probably nothing in Drome Racers to enjoy that you haven't already seen in a better game.

Review:  This was pretty much the first videogame I ever owned so I have many fond memorys associated with 
 it that might effect what my score was. That now might be different but I still realy love it and 
 like racing games. There are special weapons and speed boost you can use by crashing through red 
 orbs and green orbs restore health. There are many diffirent sets of races that increase in challenge 
 as you progress. Other racers can challenge you to a special 1 on 1 race in which you can earn 
 money to buy and upgrade your cars. Great racer in my humble opinion.
  
  - Zelda, Golden Sun and the Terminator movies rock.

Review:  The graphics are nice, gameplay is average, sound is kinda nice. I will sadly have to say with the 
 way everything goes, if you wanna buy it for 20$$, you are a nut. The game is fun when it starts, 
 but after a while the game will end up in the back of your CD shelf. I think it has a lot of cool 
 powerugs in races but i mean thats is like notin. In short ladys and gentlemen, Drome racers will 
 apeal to all at first, then at the end, it will only appeal to some. When i first got it , it was 
 so fun the first week or two weeks, then after that it was all just to hard to be fun.
