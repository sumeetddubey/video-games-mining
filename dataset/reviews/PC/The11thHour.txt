:::Review:::
Trilobyte has released a game that is somehow dated and innovative at the same time. 

 The 7th Guest was one of the biggest selling CD-ROM games ever made, and many cite it as a major 
 reason for the explosion in CD-ROM drive sales around the time of its release. That was almost 
 three years ago; reported sales results of The 11th Hour suggest that history will not repeat itself. 

 After spending two-and-a-half years in development, Trilobyte has released a game that is somehow 
 dated and innovative at the same time. It seems dated because its puzzles are only beautiful, 3-D 
 renderings of puzzles that have been around since time began. Moreover, the game's overall structure 
 and objective make it nearly identical to its predecessor. The 11th Hour is innovative, though, 
 because it includes loads of well-produced video clips that make up the game's storyline - and 
 also because that video plays so fast at full-screen that it could be mistaken for television or 
 movie-speed images.  

 Not surprisingly, these conflicting aspects of the game go together like oil and water. The only 
 way the game designers could think to link these disparate parts was by creating an out-of-place 
 sci-fi prop: a personal digital assistant, called the gamebook, that plays events back in full-color 
 video. As you move deeper into the game, the gamebook's role becomes increasingly undefined, as 
 it also serves as a communication device for Stauf, Ms. Morales, and an unknown entity who provides 
 clues to help you solve puzzles if you can't figure them out by yourself.  

 Even apart from this inconsistency, Trilobyte still fails to deliver on its promise of "broadening 
 the interactive entertainment market by creating and delivering original, high quality products 
 with mass-market appeal." The 11th Hour does not broaden the market; in the end, it looks and feels 
 like any of a number of games that have borrowed from the 7th Guest formula. And as far as mass-market 
 appeal, it's unlikely that more than a handful of gamers will have the patience to sit through 
 the game's glacial movement from point to point and its equally slow plot progression, much less 
 figure out its overly difficult logic puzzles that seem to have little or no relation to the story. 

 On the technical side, The 11th Hour often requires a lot of dancing around inside your PC to pull 
 off the game's high video frame-rate at full screen. In my case, I spent some time with Virgin's 
 adept tech support staff to get the game running smoothly.  

 Without meaning to, The 11th Hour has taught the gaming industry a few valuable lessons: First, 
 the sequel isn't always as successful as the original. Second, pretty graphics and cool video sequences 
 do not ensure a good overall gaming experience. Third, and perhaps most importantly, game creators 
 should stay true to their claims, or they'll disappoint their audience in the end.

Review:  Having played The 7th Guest, I expected a lot of The 11th Hour. At that time it couldn't uphold 
 the quality The 7th Guest had. But, nevertheless it was worth playing it every minute of your time.
 
  Using more videos/movies with real life characters it somehow managed to get me more into playing 
 and finishing the game. It wasn't scarier than its predecessor. Then why still play the game? Well, 
 there is not 1 game that you could put next to this one that year in my opinion. So if you have 
 played all the games you posses and you don't have anything to do, try these two games (The 7th 
 Guest, The 11th Hour) for fun and please don't compare them to what we have now.

Review:  The 7th guest was breathtaking and brilliant, while the 11th hour is basic and boring. 11th hour 
 really fell short of the mark as many of the best elements of the first game were removed. There 
 are still puzzles, that drive the game, but in addition and even in front of this the game is driven 
 by a treasure hunt. You will get a clue which indicates an item you must locate within the house. 
 To unlock items that you can select to answer the clue you must complete a puzzle.
  
  Though the puzzles are almost on par with the ones in the 7th guest the treasure hunt clues are 
 nowhere near as fun or engaging.
  
  Where the 7th guest blended video elements into the game which made the game that much better, 
 the 11th hour removes you from the game to separately watch a movie. This change really took a 
 huge part of the excitement away from the experience. The higher quality video though pleasing 
 didn't come close to making the video's enjoyable.
  
  One failing of the 7th guest was that it didn't delve into the story enough. 11th hour really gets 
 into the story, but as the story is nowhere near as interesting as the first game's, this wasn't 
 really a positive.
  
  The one last thing I need to mention is that that tries too hard to be scary. The first game's 
 amazing atmosphere is replaced by straight blood and gore.
  
  Having said all that I still enjoyed the game, mostly for the puzzles, and the story though greatly 
 underachieving the previous stories greatness.

Review:  This game takes place inside the same mansion as The 7th Guest. The mansion is more dark and detoriated 
 than the previous game, and your character uses a flashlight while he moves around. The gameplay 
 is exactly the same as The 7th Guest. Pointing and clicking along, you must solve puzzle after 
 puzzle in order to continue on deeper in the mansion and figure out more of the story.
  
  + Puzzles are well thought out, seem new and fresh, fun to solve
  + Graphics are extremely well 
 done, still hold up today 10 years later
  + Creepy dark atmosphere successfully achieved
  + Multiple endings
  
  - Less supernatural than The 7th Guest, could have been ALOT more scary
 
  - Some puzzles may get too tough and you need a walkthrough
  - Lacks a Personality , game is very bland compared to The 7th Guest
  
  Many fans of The 7th 
 Guest will still have fun playing this game, it just very much lacks the charm and personality 
 of the masterpiece it tries to emulate.

Review:  So, it being my first really owned game, you probably think I just have a special feeling for it, 
 and that I am going to praise it till there is no tomorrow. Well. That is actually right, I am 
 very fond of the game, it was a pretty sweet game with nice puzzles, and it required some demanding 
 attention and dedication of the player.
  
  The graphics are pretty nice to. Difficult level is pretty good also. What one really has to ad 
 to a review of this game, is that it is a sequel to The Seventh Guest also by virgin and Trilobyte. 
 It adapts perfectly, and after a while you realize you will not have lived the real 7th Guest experience 
 where there no 11th Hour to complement it this good.
  
  The game has 4 CDs because it is heavily loaded with movies of the game itself which are played 
 in the cut-scene. What really is an issue to this game is that the sound-card really is 100% compatible. 
 I installed it 3 times, one with win95, win98 and XP. all 3 on different machines and the sound 
 was not quite perfect.
  
  I recommend this game, if you have the time to play a totally worth it oldie, this is the one you 
 should choose.

Review:  I've seen a lot of games like this on the market years back... click what you want to see, you move 
 over to it. Click near the left, you'll turn left. 11th Hour is like that, with your little moving 
 flashlight looking around as you move. Maybe a little scary, but that's not the point. The point 
 is the riddles and the puzzles. You will recieve a nearly impossible riddle to solve, which pertains 
 to an item in the house. And if you find it (which there is almost no chance of by yourself) you 
 will just have another one to solve, just as hard (or harder) than the last one. The game also has 
 tough and frustrating puzzles for you to solve, which may open a secret door, etc.
  
  The game is a little old, too. Seeing women with long hair down the back is almost '80's style, 
 considering the game is supposed to take place in the mid-'90's. There were lots of other things 
 I didn't think were invented until now or not at all!
  
  Overall, unless you like being frustrated most of the time and just a little bit scared, I recommend 
 not getting 11th Hour.
