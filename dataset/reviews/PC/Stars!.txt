Stars! may not be the best-looking game in town, but strong gameplay and designmake it a sure winner. 
 

 Stars! is something of a cult phenomenon. With extensive Web coverage, its own Usenet group, and 
 a dedicated group of followers, the original shareware game from Jeff Johnson and Jeff McBride 
 has been a solid hit for some time. Now, partnered with Empire Interactive, "the Jeffs" have spiced 
 up Stars! quite a bit to make it the best low-rent space strategy game around, edging out the previous 
 leader, Spaceward Ho! 4.0  

 Conquer-the-galaxy games are as ubiquitous as ticks on a redbone hound, and one interesting offshoot 
 is the category of simple "beer-n-pretzels" games. These have modest graphics, few stylistic flourishes, 
 straightforward gameplay, low hardware requirements, and, usually, a high degree of play depth. 
 VGA Planets and Spaceward Ho! are two of the best known, and Stars! is clearly in their company. 
 It features a solid Windows interface, plain graphics, a wide range of custom options, deep strategic 
 content, and compulsive playability.   

 Stars! follows the tried-and-true premise that the universe is your oyster so you might as well 
 slide that sucker down your gullet like a Blue Point. Explore, expand, colonize, exploit, crush, 
 kill, destroy, and then expand some more. As with similar games, you exercise your manifest destiny 
 through the use of a star map and several menu screens. Beginning on a home planet, you build a 
 fleet to explore other planets and discover a) how habitable they are and b) if they have any worthwhile 
 minerals to exploit. Planets with poor chances for supporting a colony can be remote-mined. If 
 you have the technology, you can attempt to terraform them to support life. Planets with good atmosphere 
 can become home to a new colony, which will grow and expand.  

 The home planet begins by producing things like factories and mines, which in turn create the resources 
 that go into making ships and researching new technology. It's all painfully straightforward, and 
 managing everything is made relatively simple by a single screen interface that keeps all relevant 
 controls and information in front of you at all times. As you click through turns, year by year, 
 you get messages for every action that has been taken, and can go straight to the locus of that 
 action to nudge it further along.   

 Directing the action of your various space craft, which will include probes, transports, colony 
 ships, warships, and other treats, is extremely satisfying. Both complex (in terms of what you 
 can do) and simple (in terms of actually implementing the orders) , giving ships waypoints and orders 
 is the heart of the game. If you give ships the same orders repeatedly (go to planet A, pick up 
 minerals, go to planet B, drop off miners and pick up colonists, return to planet B, etc.) , these 
 can be stored in default files and easily implemented for numerous craft. Space combat, while abstracted 
 and not under user control, has a similar degree of custom control to it. You can set specific 
 orders for dealing with each conflict, setting target types and tactics.  

 Gameplay is eminently customizable, with the ability to build new ship designs from the ground up 
 based on your current needs and tech levels. Races are extensively customizable, with an elaborate 
 "race creation wizard" that walks you through the complex process of creating a new race by setting 
 various attitudes, attributes, and skills. Everything is open to tweaking in one way or another, 
 which is just the way a game like this should be.  

 Low-bandwidth games like this are perfect for Internet play, so it's lamentable that the developers 
 of Stars! opted not have native Internet support for multiplayer. With a LAN IPX driver already 
 in place, it would not have been too much more work to create a front end for TCP/IP play across 
 conventional ISP.   

 This is precisely the kind of game that develops a strong following. While Master of Orion II often 
 wallows in excess and is buggy to a fault, Stars! shows you why less IS more. A ridiculously extensive 
 tutorial makes understanding it all very easy, and a fat manual and large online help files make 
 getting into the workings and tinkering around a snap. Stars! may not be the best-looking game 
 in town and it may lack the chrome many gamers expect, but strong gameplay and design make it a 
 sure winner.
