:::Review:::
Origin, the other big boys in Texas, have used the canvas of a Doom-like first-person 3-D engine 
 to paint a master work of their own in this comic-book action game. 

 At first glance you might dismiss CyberMage: Darklight Awakening as just another Doom clone. But 
 Origin, the other big boys in Texas, have used the canvas of a Doom-like first-person 3-D engine 
 to paint a master work of their own in this comic-book action game.   

 The interface expands greatly on the Doom model. The three dimensional world lets you crouch, as 
 well as look up and down, skills that will enable you to find cleverly hidden items and give you 
 proper perspective as you make perilous leaps across dangerously high platforms. Like Doom, CyberMage 
 also pits you against hordes of enemies who come from every direction, but power-ups and new weapons 
 are harder to come by than in most 3-D games, requiring you to think strategically and use both 
 your conventional and magical weapons sparingly. Restocking can be tricky, as you must find standard 
 ammunition to reload your conventional armament, and rest occasionally to replenish the drain of 
 your magical weapons on your superpower.  

 On-screen readouts keep you abreast of your ammo supplies, health, magical power, and armor strength. 
 You'll often find that there's too much information on the screen at once, but you can toggle through 
 different views so that only the most important gauges are left on the screen.  

 CyberMage's two most notable improvements over most Doom clones are its ability to enter and operate 
 vehicles, and the development of story through other characters' digitized speech. The vehicle 
 modes are very simple, and the game designers wisely keep the action moving by not introducing 
 a complicated set of keys for vehicle operation. Key characters in each level approach you and 
 give you information or orders that advance the plot. Thanks to excellent sound design, these speech 
 passages are surprisingly realisticif you turn while someone is speaking to you the voice 
 will be louder from the left or right speaker respectively.  

 CyberMage's comic-book story tie-in is a little hard to swallow because of the conflict between 
 the blocky nature of 3-D games and the colorful art that is the hallmark of comics. Even so, CyberMage 
 remains a triumphant example of successfully applied creativity in an existing game genre.

Review:  Cybermage is a FPS set in a cyberpunk future where magic powers are controlled via body implants.
 
  
  A difficult game where you have to face many waves of enemies strongly armed: soldiers, police 
 man, zombies, robots... with the only help of your power, weapons and vehicle. Yes, in Cybermage 
 you could have some rides such as a tank or a flying police car.
  
  Pros:
  - Immersive: set in a world really living, dangerous and dark
  - Gameplay innovative for that 
 time
  - it's a Dos game :-)
  - Very difficult...
  - Graphics
  
  Cons:
  - Forget to run it into DosBox, we have to play on a strong real Dos machine
  - Strange control 
 system
  - ... too difficult
