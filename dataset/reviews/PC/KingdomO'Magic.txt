Kingdom isn't a ground-breaking or brilliant game, but it's surprisingly fun. 

 Sometimes you feel like you can tell if a game is junk just by looking at the box and reading the 
 blurbs. Often you're right. Sometimes you're wrong. Kingdom O' Magic is a case in point. Few packages 
 in recent memory have had turkey written on them as clearly as this one.  

 But it pays not to jump to conclusions. Inside the crappy packaging of Kingdom O' Magic is an often 
 funny, very conventional fantasy-adventure game that will remind many players of the Monkey Island 
 games. There's no real story to Kingdom O' Magic, just a series of stand-alone quests and two goofy 
 characters to play as. You can choose to play the easy Good Old Fashioned Traditional Quest, in 
 which you wander about the kingdom trying to do-in a dragon. Then there's more difficult Magnificent 
 7-11 Quest, which requires that you find between seven and eleven of the toughest characters in 
 the kingdom to protect the floating Flake Town from an imminent invasion. Finally, there's the 
 hardest adventure: The Bizarre &amp; Slightly Twisted Quest. Here you have to recover the Lost 
 Lava Lamps of the Ancients, which are in the possession of King Afro.  

 Each quest involves a number of shared and recurring characters who pretty much stay to their places 
 in the town (the bar, the wig shop, etc) . Each also involves some subquests, such as retrieving 
 the Grail for Afro to help free the Lava Lamps. Playing as either the wisecracking lizard Thidney 
 or the well-endowed Shah-Ron won't change the game too much, just some of the dialog and wisecracks. 
 The artwork in the standard side-view adventure perspective is top notch, as are the rendered scenes. 
 There are the familiar commands - talk, use, take, hit, examine, and cast spell - plus the familiar 
 inventory manipulations (use paper bag on the parrot, etc) .  

 The adventure game aspect of Kingdom isn't terribly difficult - no more so than Monkey Island - 
 but it's certainly enough to keep you busy, and definitely better than the twiddle-the-lever games 
 we've been force-fed for the last two years. The dialog is funny more often than it's stupid, and 
 because it's hard to create a funny computer game at all, this is quite an accomplishment. There 
 are heavy borrowings and homages (and some downright thefts) from Monty Python, and the entire 
 tone is going for that kind of Python/Douglas Adams weirdness. Kingdom isn't a ground-breaking 
 or brilliant game, but it's surprisingly fun. Maybe this has to do with the low expectations I 
 had going in, or maybe it's just a good old-fashioned adventure, just like mom used to make.
