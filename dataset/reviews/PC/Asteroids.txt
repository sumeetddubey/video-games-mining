:::Review:::
Rather than alter the Space Colonel's original recipe, Activision has opted to simply outfit Asteroids 
 with gobs of bells and whistles. 

 If the continual revolution of gaming were instead a Maoist revolution, some of us reactionaries 
 would be put to death. "When I was your age, we played Tomb Raider with real tombs." But it's true. 
 When I was a kid I couldn't wait for technology to advance to the point where Pac-Man ate real 
 food, and the worker droids of M. U. L. E. delivered precious ores to my door if I won. Oddly, rather 
 than harnessing new technologies for a teleologically perfect Pong, developers have for the most 
 part spent their time coming up with entirely new kinds of games. And imperfect classics like the 
 vector graphics-driven Asteroids were buried, first by side scrollers, then by 3D.   

 With Asteroids, Activision is attempting to satisfy the crotchety old man in all of us by bringing 
 the old game back to the future with the core of its gameplay intact. And Asteroids succeeds in 
 doing just that. This is definitely Asteroids. Lots of big rocks. One tiny ship that reappears 
 on the left when you exit stage right. This is 2D folks, despite the 3D look of the spinning asteroids 
 and miscellaneous debris. And while the rocks do look prettier, and the black background has been 
 replaced with various handsome nebulae and a panorama of space dust (didn't they figure out that 
 stuff was actually ice?) , the gameplay itself is faithful to the original and in no way iconoclastic. 
 The basic controls are the same as in the original. It's simple: rotate (left and right) , thrust, 
 shields, a 180-degree flip, fire, and hyperspace. Come to think of it, that sounds like a lot for 
 1979. At any rate, then and now it was (and is) a simple but effective recipe for blistered fingers. 
 Rather than alter the Space Colonel's original recipe, Activision has opted to simply outfit Asteroids 
 with gobs of bells and whistles. That sounds like a mistake, but it's not, and gameplay is only 
 enriched for the power windows and fuel injection. There are more enemy ships, but they're still 
 more cute than threatening. Special asteroids, like the regenerating Crystal Asteroids and the 
 aptly named Indestructible Asteroid, make for an interesting diversion. The environment is made 
 slightly more rocky with the advent of black holes (mild ones that suck you a little ways toward 
 your doom) and stars that occasionally spurt deadly hydrogen gas. By far the coolest addition to 
 the formula is the inclusion of power-ups. Lots of them. Ramming shields, homing missiles, smart 
 bombs, and my favorite, the GunSat, a gun turret that orbits your craft, blasting indiscriminately 
 and blocking incoming objects. There are dozens of different power-ups, and they're all very cool. 

 Though not much to look at when compared with most of today's games, one can't help but feel like 
 anything flashier would have altered the game's feel or, worse yet, its play mechanics. That said, 
 the ships aren't much to look at, though the simplicity of your primary weapon's tiny green dots 
 of light is nicely understated. The sound of the original is echoed here rather tastefully: Enemy 
 craft still sound oddly like tiny alien police sirens, and asteroids burst asunder with a reasonable 
 and modest crunch. One thing I could never figure out about the original stand-up: For a game about 
 battling giant, potentially world-destroying boulders, why did everything feel so tiny? That cuteness 
 is in full force in the remake and somehow makes some kind of cosmic sense.  

 It's great that somebody is remaking old games and making them better, rather than just licensing 
 names and tacking them onto non sequitur first-person shooters. Activision has a winner here. Asteroids 
 is 100 percent true to the feel of the original, with terrific new power-ups to spice things up. 
 Though not likely to make anyone quit his day job - how many times could anyone want to clear another 
 screen of debris? - it's fun to give a damn about high scores again.

Review:  Graphically, very nice to look at, and once in play, you feel like your in for a treat, then the 
 action starts......... This is probably one of the worst conversions to play. If you are using 
 XP, make sure you run the game in Windows 95 mode, not like its going to help much. XP and this 
 game have issues, so get ready, you might just have too reboot your machine when your done playing 
 it.
  
  Your mission, is too clear a path through space, so its safe for travellers, and let me tell ya, 
 you got your work cut out for ya. You have a choice of ships to choose from. They all have sheild 
 capasity, thrusters, warping capabilities, and cannon. Each one is more better suited in some areas 
 than others, but the original ship design is there and avaliable. Now onto the gameplay. The keys 
 to move your ship are very akward. They will take alot of getting used too. And no, you can't change 
 them during game play. If your lucky, your 3D graphics accelerating hardware will take hold of 
 the game, so eveything should look nice and crisp. But if not, and it has happened, you will need 
 to run the game in software mode. This option can be reached at the primary menu, I believe, if 
 not, just reinstall. You probably would be better off. You can't just move your ship like you could 
 with the old one. You need to rotate, then thrust in that direction. You have a small burst of 
 Auto-Sheilds, but if a small enough Asteroid comes your way, hold the sheild button down, and it 
 should reflect off you. But when the great big ones come your way, you are screwed unless you take 
 it out within a 2 second window, your sheilds will colapse, fast!
  
  You know something.... this game had alot, and I mean, alot of potentional to be an awesome remake 
 of the classic. It sounds challenging, it certainly nice to look at, you have more options to help 
 you fight your way thru space, but once its all put together on your screen and you start playing.... 
 it just doesn't work out well at all. Believe me, I have given this game dozen of chances over 
 the years, but am disappointed every time.
