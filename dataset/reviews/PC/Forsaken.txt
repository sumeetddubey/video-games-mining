Forsaken is, at its core, a Descent clone. But stunning graphics, a dazzling array of weapons, and 
 above-average level design make the whole thing seem fresh. 

 Remember Descent? You know, the crazy zero-gravity first-person shooter that put you in the cockpit 
 of a small ship and forced you to reenact the end of Return of the Jedi over and over again? Forsaken 
 is, at its core, a Descent clone. But stunning graphics, a dazzling array of weapons, and above-average 
 level design make the whole thing seem fresh.  

 The simple scenario sets the game on a postapocalyptic Earth. Most of the planet is in ruins, complete 
 with loads of goodies ripe for the taking. You play a scavenger on a hoverbike, and you'll traverse 
 military installations, nuclear reactors, refineries, temples, and more in search of gold and crystals. 
 This may sound like a cakewalk, but Earth's automated defense systems are still intact, littering 
 your path with all kinds of annoying drone ships, tanks, and turrets. Rival scavengers will also 
 pop by from time to time in an attempt to take out their competition. While none of the enemies 
 proves to be a threat on its own, their sheer numbers make the game incredibly difficult. While 
 most of the levels are of the "just get to the exit" variety, a few are timed. The time given, 
 however, is incredibly generous, so there's never a real race against the clock.  

 The weaponry in Forsaken is unique. Each weapon has three levels of power, depending on how many 
 power pods you've found. The Suss gun is a spread-fire weapon that quickly shoots a mess of projectiles 
 in your enemy's direction. The Trojax is a charged weapon that gains power (and sucks ammunition) 
 when you hold down the fire button. The Pyrolite is a beautiful-looking flamethrower. Transpulse 
 shots can bounce off walls, making them good for surprise attacks in multiplayer games. The Beam 
 Laser simply emits two monstrous beams of death. It requires pinpoint accuracy, but it does insane 
 amounts of damage. Secondary weapons include the Scatter missile, which causes the victim to drop 
 all of his weaponry. The Multiple-Fire Rocket Launcher quickly spits out tons of small missiles. 
 The Solaris homes in on its target. The Gravgon missile creates a vacuum at its point of impact, 
 sucking enemies into its gravitational field and holding them in place for you to take out at will. 
 The Titan is the most devastating weapon in the entire game and will frequently take you out as 
 well if you aren't careful. There are also three different types of mines that will help you keep 
 enemies off your tail and a nitro boost that will allow you to escape from sticky situations.  
 

 The multiplayer feature in Forsaken is well done in some ways, but in others it's a mess. The largest 
 oversight has to be the lack of a dedicated server option, which would make it a bit easier to 
 find a game. If you're looking for a Forsaken game on the Net, chances are you'll have to venture 
 into a chat room and hope someone is advertising a game they're hosting. However, some of this 
 hassle is offset by the server machine changing when necessary. If the current server quits or 
 crashes, the game finds another suitable machine in the game and makes it the server. This makes 
 finding a game to join a bit harder, though, as a game that started out on one IP may now be running 
 on a different IP. Another problem, which Acclaim is working on, is that the multiplayer mode tends 
 to crash from time to time. I frequently encountered crashes when changing levels, and on more 
 than one occasion I became disconnected from all the other players, leaving their bikes seemingly 
 unattended in the middle of the level. Forsaken is pretty modem-friendly, but you'll want the server 
 machine to be on at least an ISDN line - if not a cable modem or a T1 - if you're planning to play 
 with more than eight players.  

 The graphics in Forsaken look pretty good unaccelerated, but once you throw an accelerator board 
 at it, it looks simply outstanding. Colored lighting abounds, and it really sets an appropriate 
 mood for the game. Weapon fire is beautiful, and the shockwave generated by the Titan looks really, 
 really good. The sound in Forsaken is also well done. There are several different characters and 
 bike computers to choose from, resulting in a mess of different voices for power-ups and damage. 
 A few of the characters swear, but only if the mature content is enabled from the options menu. 

 If you're a Descent fan, well, you probably stopped reading about four paragraphs ago and you're 
 already halfway to the store. You won't be disappointed, especially if Acclaim can work out the 
 multiplayer bugs. Acclaim is currently working on a Forsaken level editor that will surely extend 
 the game's life - but the great graphics and difficult yet exciting gameplay are already enough 
 to keep you interested for a fairly long time.

Review:  forsaken is a futurisic still shoot them up, your on hover bikes but its 1st person shooter style 
 is great. You can play single player or multiplayer online. You can take the role of around 8 characters 
 all with different attributies etc. There is many different games to choose from deathmatch to capture 
 the flag. Your main aim is to win. The graphics are good for the time it was made as this game was 
 released back in 1999. The gameplay is excellent when you are on mulitplayer, i tend to play it 
 over the lan with collegues at work. We play the deathmatch were its a free for all killing spree. The 
 weapons in the game range from machine guns to titans which is a big rocket that fires little ones 
 from it.
