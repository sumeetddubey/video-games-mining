:::Review:::
If you try playing Total Knockout and you're looking for something beyond an exaggeratedly buxom, 
 watered-down revisit of Punch-Out, you may decide to hang up your gloves. 

 I'll admit that I have a certain affinity for female protagonists in fighting games. In fact, Kitana 
 (MK2) is perhaps my favorite femme fatale to step into the killing arena. Any character with sex 
 appeal who can also hurl razor-sharp fans at her opponents, sending them into a blood-drenched 
 recoil, receives my vote. Even some of the characters in Virtua Fighter and Toshinden, who can 
 only be described as immanently "cute," ultimately prove that cuteness can be deceiving - deadly 
 deceiving. In contrast, the female boxers in Starhill Production's Total Knockout aren't just unthreatening, 
 they're kind of offensive.   

 Basically, TKOB is a rehash of Nintendo's "Mike Tyson's Punch Out," except that you're dealing with 
 an all-female cast. Before each round, you're treated to irrelevant centerfold-style statistical 
 information about each contender (i. e., bust size, turn-ons, etc) . In the game, you play 
 as Daphne "the Drill" D'Marko, and your object is to seize the world title by pummeling the crap 
 out of your international competitors. Like Punch Out, you're rendered as a transparent wire-frame 
 model, enabling you to see through to your opponent. Your character can execute high or low punches, 
 block, and duck to the left or the right. Daphne can also perform two "special" moves that cause 
 more damage - a double-uppercut and a windmill punch - the execution of which require the extremely 
 dexterous coordination of tapping a single key or button.  

 Your opponents, again following in the tradition of Punch Out, hail from locations all over the 
 world, each with different fighting attributes and special moves in their bag of tricks. You begin 
 by duking it out with the Russian boxer Illiyanna "the Sickle" Moroskova, who will perform a Russian 
 dance on your head if you're not careful; there's even an Australian boxer who "BOOM"-erangs around 
 the ring, clobbering you at each pass. You have to knock out these opponents twice to beat them 
 and step up another rung on the ladder to victory.   

 The main problem with this game, besides its over-attentiveness to the fighters' bodily dimensions, 
 is its failure to capture the simplistic intensity and humor of Punch Out. While the graphics are 
 more robust than Punch Out's, the gameplay leaves something to be desired. It's pretty easy to 
 defeat most of your opponents, and even though a few of them pack more of a punch, the game really 
 isn't engaging enough for you to care to beat them. This game actually ends up being more reminiscent 
 of Catfight than Punch Out - cheapening the valor of the "female fighting character" for the sake 
 of a bad gimmick. If you try playing Total Knockout and you're looking for something beyond an 
 exaggeratedly buxom, watered-down revisit of Punch-Out, you may decide to hang up your gloves.
