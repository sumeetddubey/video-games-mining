:::Review:::
While it lacks originality and has rather bland graphics, Power Spike is still an entertaining, 
 budget-priced volleyball game. 

  Volleyball games aren't exactly commonplace, probably largely because volleyball games really haven't 
 changed that much over the years. Power Spike Pro Beach Volleyball is a perfect example of this, 
 as it doesn't offer anything substantially different from or better than what's found in preceding 
 volleyball games -- other than the inclusion of real-world volleyball professionals like Gabby Reece, 
 and an easy-to-use targeting system for spiking the ball or making passes to teammates. While it 
 lacks originality and has rather bland graphics, Power Spike is still an entertaining, budget-priced 
 volleyball game with a relatively small learning curve, which means it'll be easy for players of 
 all skill levels to jump right in.           It may not look like much, but it's fun to play.  
   

  Power Spike Pro Beach Volleyball has all of the basic modes of play you'd expect from a sports 
 game, including exhibition, championship, and practice modes. There's also a player-editor mode 
 that lets you create your own volleyball player, but it's fairly shallow in what it lets you do. 
 You can change very few physical characteristics and disperse points to a few different player 
 attributes. The ability to create something more unique than a color-palette-swapped version of 
 other characters from the game would've been much more desirable.   

  The lackluster customization mode is mainly a consequence of the game's poor graphics. The player 
 models are simplistic and lacking any discernible detail, and with the exception of Gabby Reece 
 herself and the obvious differences between male and female players, most of the player models 
 look virtually the same. In addition, the animation for these models varies widely. Animations 
 for bumps and sets are generally smooth, while spike animations look very choppy, so much that 
 it seems as though the players don't even make contact with the ball. Some of these animations 
 can have a detrimental effect on gameplay, as they can make it difficult to judge how quickly you 
 can get to a ball in a short period of time. For example, if the opposing team spikes the ball 
 onto your side, your players may launch into any one of a number of different bump animations -- some 
 take more time to execute than others. There's also an odd lighting problem that causes parts of 
 the player to constantly flicker when in an idle position, and you'll also notice some polygonal 
 clipping as parts of the player models will pierce through barriers that surround the court whenever 
 you go for a ball hit out-of-bounds.           Power Spike is straightforward and easy to get into. 
    

  Though Power Spike's choppy animation is somewhat disappointing, the gameplay is still executed 
 quite well, and it's incredibly easy to get right into. Essentially, whenever the ball comes into 
 your side of the court, you have a number of different options to choose from to keep your opponents 
 off guard. You can bump the ball to your teammate and setup a spike that exploits holes in your 
 opponents' defense -- if the opponents are playing shallow, then you should hit the ball into the 
 back of the court, or if they're playing deep or to one side, you can try to hit the ball close 
 to the net and in the opposite direction of the opponents. All of these strategies are easy to 
 execute thanks to the game's easy targeting system, which displays a small target that you can 
 use to aim all of your bumps, spikes, and passes before your player makes contact with the ball. 
 This system works well, though you might initially tend to overcompensate and hit the ball out-of-bounds, 
 but you'll get a better feel for it with some practice. If there's any real problem with this system, 
 it's that it can make the game seem a little too easy even on the hardest difficulty -- but Power 
 Spike tries to counteract this by making the ball and the passing icon behave a little more realistically 
 on the hard settings than they do on the easier settings.   

  Power Spike Pro Beach Volleyball isn't a remarkable volleyball game, but it does just enough to 
 be entertaining. The graphics are lackluster, as it's clear that the developer didn't put much 
 effort into making the players look realistic. Animation ranges in quality depending on the type 
 of move your players are performing -- some of the moves look very lifelike, and others don't. Sound 
 is nearly nonexistent in the game -- there's only a brief introduction from an announcer and a few 
 lines of banter between players. There are no network multiplayer modes available, though two players 
 can play at the same computer. Even as shallow as these features are, the gameplay in Power Spike 
 Pro Beach Volleyball is executed well and has very few actual problems, such that volleyball fans 
 should have fun playing through the game's tournament mode repeatedly.
