With such limited gameplay, it's good for little more than a weekend's worth of entertainment.

 Tom Clancy's push into the gaming market continues with ruthless. com, a strategy game all about 
 intrigue, unconventional business practices, and political maneuvering. The thing is, you're not 
 the leader of some newly democratic republic teeming with under-the-table deals and bribery. In 
 fact, this seedy world of ill repute is none other than the computer industry. But even if Tom 
 Clancy is trying to make a statement about the morality of operations between the hi-tech firms 
 of today's market, ruthless. com is too limited to be worthwhile.  

 As CEO of a computer corporation, you are presented with a board game-style map showing you and 
 your competitors, and you're given two actions each turn in which you decide what will help your 
 company earn more market share, boost profits, and raise stock value. To accomplish these goals, 
 you'll need to work with the buildings that represent your company. Each building can house up 
 to six departments from R&amp; D to marketing, which act as your tools of doing business. Product 
 departments generate cash, while other departments are more military in nature. For instance, the 
 legal department can sue and establish patents, the R&amp; D guys come up with the new ideas and 
 QA products, and the computer department establishes and maintains your digital security and hacks 
 into your enemies' mainframes. You also have a set of corporate orders that revolve around setting 
 up new facilities and managing their departments.  

 Underneath this simple frame is a somewhat complex industry model that is explained thoroughly in 
 the manual. Income is gained through selling products and making sure that yours are the highest 
 quality in the market. The more products you have, the more revenue you gain and the more expensive 
 orders you can execute. As you continue to generate assets, investors add to your available cash, 
 and your operations can expand accordingly.  

 Unfortunately, certain acute design flaws limit the game's potential. For one thing, the campaign 
 is really short. The designers intended the campaign to be just a free-for-all game where there 
 are no restrictions on play. It allows you to play as a start-up corporation and slowly grow to 
 become an evil empire of the computer industry, and while it's cool, it only takes about three 
 to four hours at most. The individual scenarios in the game are also unsatisfying because there 
 are only six of them, with each one taking about an hour and a half. After that, you're left with 
 just the multiplayer options. While there is some consolation to be found in that the multiplayer 
 mode is about as much fun as turn-based multiplayer games can be, the game confines you to one 
 of the six scenarios for multiplayer and so doesn't give you the open-ended feel of the campaign. 
 This lack of replayability is what severely detracts from any long-term value.  

 What Clancy and company did seem to get right are the graphics. The interface is well designed, 
 and the accompanying graphics are an inventive postmodern art-funk representation of an industry 
 that otherwise has little visual appeal. The different building designs, the executive profiles, 
 and the color schemes all work amazingly well together.  

 But in the end, it's the value that counts, and that's where the gaming dollar is considered most 
 sacred. If ruthless. com had given more bang for the buck, it could have been a contender. But with 
 such limited gameplay, it's good for little more than a weekend's worth of entertainment.
