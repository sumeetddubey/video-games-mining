:::Review:::
It's a very strong contender for strategy game of the year. 

 Death, doom, and destruction - presented to you in real time. Another typical night of CNN? Think 
 again. The culprit responsible for bringing this entertainment experience to your PC is War Wind. 
 SSI has released a real-time, multiplayer strategy game in the style of Warcraft II and Command 
 &amp; Conquer. War Wind adopts the best elements of these, and adds some fascinating new features 
 of its own. It's magic, it's mayhem, and it's murder - even against your friends, if you like. 
 Who could ask for more?  

 War Wind is simply breathtaking to behold. A native Windows 95 application, it takes advantage of 
 DirectX to provide reasonably fast cinematics and gameplay. Your installation choices can take 
 from 5MB to 80MB of hard drive space, though the minimum leads to very long pauses during the game 
 (usually in the middle of combat!) . Once you are up and running, you get to watch an animated introduction 
 reminiscent of Command &amp; Conquer. After this, the regular game screens you encounter are simply 
 stunning at 640x480 resolution.   

 Once you've chosen one of four alien races to play, you can choose between a campaign mode (seven 
 missions) or an existing scenario (one of three different missions) . A good read-through of the 
 manual is important before jumping into the campaigns. Each race has different advantages and disadvantages 
 that make your race selection somewhat difficult as well. The interface is mouse-driven, and many 
 options for unit selection are like those in a previously mentioned game. Since combat occurs so 
 rapidly, you should learn some of the Hot Keys in order to survive. Your job is to complete the 
 mission goals - no matter what. In case you forget, the Options screen lets you review what you're 
 supposed to be doing.  

 Your basic job is to mine resources (sound familiar?) while avoiding being overrun by your opponent. 
 Several nice touches are the presence of neutral and hostile wildlife, the ability to train and 
 upgrade your units, and the Fog of War that closes down on areas as you leave them. Your computer 
 opponents will seem to have two modes: PATROL and KILL. If you succeed in a mission, you can select 
 some of your people - er, creatures - and place them in the Hall of Heroes, which will allow you 
 to carry them forward in future missions. If you get bored with your campaign, you can use the 
 Scenario Editor to create your own single- or multiplayer missions.  

 War Wind is outstanding, but I do have a few quibbles with it. Combat is frequently hand-to-hand, 
 and the view makes it difficult to see what's actually occurring. The Walk Through/Quick Start 
 is not much of a walk-through (hint: look at the readme. txt file before starting a campaign) . The 
 campaigns could also be longer. Otherwise, it's a very strong contender for strategy game of the 
 year.

Review:  I know it has been more than a decade since this game came out, but I had longed to track down 
 a copy and complete this game ever since I lost track of it a decade ago.
  
  Playing it again, I realize the reason for my attraction to it a decade ago; this game is entirely 
 different from the many Warcraft II and C&C (Tiberium Dawn) clones around the time that I played 
 it. Granted, training and obtaining the more powerful units was infuriating, and spamming attempts 
 with just one type of unit was frustrating and fruitless endeavors (which caused me to drop this 
 game and chuck it to my now incommunicado friend - the fool that I was) .
  
  I realize that DreamForge was one of the first few developers to actually think of of some sort 
 of unit experience mechanics and some RPG elements for an RTS game, as well as some semblance of 
 squad-based infantry units.
  
  Of course, all these ideas were unfortunately botched up with rather poor implementation. The unit 
 experience was relegated to some unit promotion crap that uses resources, the RPG element in the 
 form of unit level-to-level transfer is only restricted to the regulars and group-based movement 
 is a total mess.
  
  Another particular flaw that has to be mentioned is the rather convoluted tech tree. All four factions 
 practically obtain the same vehicles, yet their different methods of obtaining them are bewildering, 
 to say the least.
  
  Perhaps, the more interesting and noteworthy ideas are the influence (or prestige) feature, which 
 is earned (& lost) in battle, and is probably the forefather of Battle Realms' odd yin-and-yang 
 thing. However, the developers realized that getting influence through battle is a double-edged 
 sword and included a pointless resource-spending feature to bolster influence.
  
  War Wind's story is also surprisingly mature for RTS games of that time. Sadly, it was damaged 
 by rather odd design decisions, such as the videos that were narrated by a character with an obviously 
 alien language, yet by default have no subtitles displayed.
  
  Nevertheless, SSI, the game publisher that brought us gems like Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate and Epic: 
 Final Liberation (and suckers like Rites of War) , was the first publisher to recognize the value 
 of games that are not run-of-the-mill - too bad the average so-called gamer is too dumb to consider 
 having some diversity, and should be credited for that.
  
  SSI is understandably no more, but SSI always had in mind the goal to make RTS games serious affairs, 
 unlike its many "peers" of that time who were out to milk the RTS genre. In any case, it seems 
 that their goal has permeated to many other present-day publishers and developers, most notably 
 Relic, and this is well indeed.
