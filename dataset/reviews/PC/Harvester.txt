This is a creepy game featuring tried-and-true adventure mechanics with entertaining twists and 
 some truly disturbing full-motion video segments. 

 Harvester has been a long time coming. A year ago, or two, or whenever we all got excited seeing 
 the first ads for this game, it might have been a cutting-edge title. Since then, we've 
 seen Darkseed II and Phantasmagoria and games of that nature, so Harvester isn't cutting-edge any 
 more.  

 At least - heh-heh - not that way.  

 Steeped in the kind of diseased, '50s small-town Americana one might expect to find in a David Lynch 
 movie, Harvester tells the tale of Steve, an ordinary, clean-cut '80s kind of guy who wakes up 
 one morning to find himself in a picket-fence nightmare. He has no memory of who he is or how he 
 came to be; a freakish town of Stepfordesque luddites surrounds him; and he discovers that he is 
 mere days away from a pre-arranged marriage to a local girl of whom he has no memory. The townsfolk 
 of Harvest (population 51 and inbreeding) speak in awed tones of The Lodge, a local secret order, 
 initiation into which is the lifelong goal of many. But just what is The Lodge, and what can it 
 tell Steve about his new and tainted reality? That's for them to know and you, the player, to find 
 out.   

 Harvester is a point-and-click, full-motion-video-sprinkled adventure game very much in the vein 
 of Darkseed II, set in a kind of Twin Peaks meets the Andy Griffith Show reality. Lynchian touches 
 abound: Consider the Wasp Woman, inhabiting an abandoned house that is one large, dilapidated, 
 insectarium; the town fire station, staffed by lisping, effeminate flame specialists 
 who spend the day sketching nude male models; the grade-school class full of children with mis-shapen 
 heads, the result of corporal punishment administered with pithy platitudes and a baseball bat; 
 the abdomen-less, commie-hating commander of the local nuclear missile base, who might have stepped 
 whole and breathing from Dr. Strangelove; and the local meat-packing plant, reeking with hanging 
 maggot-riddled carcasses of dubious origin. Interaction with the townsfolk is via a keyword interface 
 (with the option to type in special terms or questions as the situation seems to warrant) and, 
 usually, a selection of two responses for each question posed by various characters. While the 
 horrible/comic tone of these encounters is entertaining and often unsettling (the seriously entomophobic, 
 for example, should probably skip Harvester altogether) , the railroading nature of the response 
 scheme is restricting and takes a little away from the exploratory mystery, which is the point 
 of the whole game. Defining the acting as good or bad is, happily, a moot point here, because the 
 player spends much time in conversations with characters who are not merely bent but actually sprained 
 - what defines a good portrayal of a complete loon?   

 There's nothing actually revolutionary going on in Harvester, but it's a creepy game featuring tried-and-true 
 adventure mechanics with entertaining twists and some truly disturbing full-motion video segments 
 that will follow you to bed and snuggle up nice and cozy in your dreams. To enhance the warped 
 game experience, you could wait until all your friends go away and then play Harvester in the dark, 
 alone, with your back to an open screen door banging in the wind... but it doesn't sound like a 
 really good idea.

Review:  HARVESTER i would have to say is one of my all time favourite games.
  it has many things we all looked for in a game and still look for even today, i am glad i still 
 have my copy of HARVESTER, my brother gave it to me when i was i think 17 this is when he sold 
 his windows98 pc to my mum i was warned dont play this in front of my younger brothers and sisters 
 but i didnt see why until i got abit into the game.
  i was hooked from day one of playing this lmao, i lived in an old dark house that used to be owned 
 by the land owner about a million or so years ago thats just me going O. T. T. but the house didnt 
 even have a date on it so what can i say, it had pictures on the wall hanging the sort you see 
 in games like SILENT HILL &amp; RESIDENT EVIL games so this game also had a point of being horrible 
 not in a bad way but i found it hard to sleep sometimes lmao jk jk.
  so yea i love HARVESTER i love the characters in it with their twisted and mentally impaired or 
 just plain dumb brains,
  i love the puzzles that (i wont mention any names) some people couldnt even figure out but maybe 
 petty crime never introduced itself to them,
  in ways this game is right but also so damn wrong, HARVESTER has the ability to make you laugh 
 when you shouldnt but i know many who have laughed at what i showed them when i did play it so 
 maybe its not so wrong.
  i heard from my brother that HARVESTER was banned here in the UK shortly after it release i can 
 see why too as some rules have been broken in the making of this game.
  basically its a cult game but can be enjoyed if you have a strong mind and arent like alot of the 
 idiots who cause games to be banned, you know the sort that forget the reason some games come out 
 is to do things you cant imagine doing in real life in other words fantasy, and that is where these 
 things should stay.
  one thing i hate about this game though isnt anything in the game but WINDOWS XP, bleedin bill 
 gates always has the need to upgrade all the time but doesnt think yes i can still make a classy 
 faster more efficient pc giving users more freedom to express themselves and play classic pc games 
 on it no no its more like hi im bill gates im your boss your goal for today is make money forget 
 about reminiscing in old games just play new games all the time forget the games that made you 
 play them.
  ON TH WHOLE HARVESTER IS A TRUE CLASSIC IF YOU CAN GET THE CHANCE TO PLAY IT PLAY IT ( BUT REMEMBER 
 ITS OLD SO DONT TRY XP I THINK IF I RECALL ITS 95 98) BUT I WILL UBDATE IF IM WRONG I GOT MY COPY 
 IN STORAGE STILL

Review:  This is the type of game that I want to play so often that I get really really sad because there 
 are not that many games out there like it. My computer is getting newer and newer and this game 
 is venturing into that PC Game Out of Date territory. What a shame. This is a point and click Horror 
 Adventure that truly delivers on BOTH accounts. Adventure: The whole town can be explored, all 
 its people can be interacted with or talked to, and many items / weapons can be picked up and used. 
 (Even on people for some off the wall results) Horror: This game delivers in full motion video 
 more blood and gore than most horror movies out there on the market today.
  
  + All the characters are real actors, town seems more realistic
  + Outstanding sense of dark 
 humor
  + Town is fun to explore, lots of things to do and people to talk to
  + Very Original concept
  + Well thought out story, amazing multiple game endings
  
  - Control 
 while using weapons needs a little bit of fine tuning
  - Humor and gore will turn off some people
  
  I will never stop playing this game, it is one 
 of a kind and doesn't hold back any punches. We NEED NEED NEED more games like this !!!

Review:  This was one nasty game. Playing it was like being inside an H. P. Lovecraft story. It's dated as 
 far as graphics, sound, and gameplay go, but it was fun. And creepy. It is an early example of 
 a combination adventure/action game - before video was truly integrated into the story line. This 
 is another game that I'd like to see remastered onto todays media. If you can find a copy that 
 can play, it's worthwhile diversion. There are some PC games (like T7G) that should be played by 
 people who consider themselves 'students' of PC gaming - this is one of them.
