:::Review:::
Mode is likely to gather dust on your shelf after only a couple of hours of gameplay. 

 Money can't buy everything, and mega-software company Corel's recent "interactive" movie, Mode, 
 is the best proof. The game places you in the middle of an ultra-hipster fashion event to mingle 
 with the natives. You interact with people by using a MoodBar (a multi-colored bar at the bottom 
 of the screen) . If you're feeling nice, go to the far right and click on the color green. If you're 
 feeling downright pissy, go with red. In many situations, it doesn't even matter.   

 Since your only way of modifying the situation around you is to click on this bar, your conversations 
 are completely one-sided, and to make matters worse, they're pretty boring as well. Sitting on 
 your can while staring at talking heads gets old fast. And they truly are talking heads: to save 
 space, only the character's head is video - the rest of them is just a still image. (So much for 
 body language.) It's especially humorous when the character's head moves slightly, because it will 
 actually go outside the border of the video frame. In other words, someone is rambling on, suddenly 
 moves a little bit, and half of their head goes missing. Looking for more badness? Okay, there's 
 also no way to stop a video clip unless you back completely out of the game. And to top it all 
 off, you'll see better acting performances in the movie Showgirls. Rinky dink.   

 I don't want to bash til I'm blue in the face, and in all fairness I must admit that there is a 
 tale to be told in this game. If you're patient enough, it's interesting to piece through the character's 
 speeches to gather clues and figure out what's going on. The game's plot is unique - not many other 
 games will let you troll around the underbelly of a make-believe fashion scene. And the more people 
 you talk to, the more you can move around, and the more you learn. Some characters are interesting 
 enough to at least keep one of your eyes open. And since the story isn't linear, you can explore 
 any of the plots going on at once, although none of them is edge-of-the-seat riveting. The game's 
 overall video quality is pretty good, too.  

 Unless you're a complete digital videophile, Mode is likely to gather dust on your shelf after only 
 a couple of hours of gameplay. (And we use the term gameplay liberally.) If you're set on playing 
 this, do yourself a favor: either invest in a jukebox CD-ROM player, or take juggling lessons. 
 Spread out on three CD-ROMs, this game takes up more space than many of Corel's gigantic clip art 
 collections. All in all, there's not much to do with this game except click and listen. It's interactivity 
 at a bare minimum, and you'll probably get bored quickly.
