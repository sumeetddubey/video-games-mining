:::Review:::
The charming, uniform graphics also invoke the warm nostalgia of a bygone era. 

 The American Youth Soccer Organization, or AYSO, is a youth soccer league whose goal is to build 
 character through such tenets as balanced team play, positive coaching, and good sportsmanship. 
 While these are admirable traits, the organization should also be warned about the peddling of 
 poor quality merchandise to unsuspecting youths. The spirit of good sportsmanship, however, has 
 inspired a positive spin on this review.  

 Like a walk down memory lane, AYSO Soccer's opening DOS installation reminds us of how much fun 
 it is to edit your config. sys and autoexec. bat files and struggle with sound card compatibility 
 issues. The charming, uniform graphics also invoke the warm nostalgia of a bygone era - namely 
 the age of the 8-bit Nintendo system - with 22 pixelated boys, who are entirely uniform except 
 for a slight variety in skin color, kicking and chasing a soccer ball around a bright green field. 

 Showing off is not encouraged, so the sound quality is kind enough to lower itself to the level 
 of the graphics, producing a grand total of three muffled sound effects: the slide, the kick, and 
 the ball hitting the post. Not wanting to single anyone out, the play-by-play man reserves comments 
 like "That's not much of a tackle" for completely inappropriate times, either well later than or 
 completely unrelated to the action actually happening on the field.  

 It's good to remember that it really doesn't matter if you win or lose, particularly because every 
 member of every computer team is faster than every member of any team you control, and they have 
 the ability to stop their kicks before they go out of bounds, slide tackle two or three of your 
 players at the same time, and curve shots at impossible angles into your goal. Good sportsmanship 
 is practiced as well as encouraged, as evidenced by your goalie's willingness to let a soft shot 
 rebound right to an opposing player in front of the net and by your defender's pounding the occasional 
 loose ball directly into your own goal.  

 While there's not much good here, there are several tournament and season modes if you're so inclined. 
 Also, real AYSO player names and teams were included in the making of AYSO '97, so young soccer 
 heroes around the country will be able to look through the rosters and find their names; a player 
 editor lets them change their name or appearance if they're embarrassed.
