:::Review:::
F-22 Raptor is essentially F-22 Lightning II reissued. 

 Last year NovaLogic released F-22 Lightning II, a diverting arcade-like sim that made inflated claims 
 for the realism and accuracy of its flight model. After F-22 hit, NovaLogic managed to cement a 
 relationship with Lockheed Martin for the rights to create sims based upon its aircraft, attempting 
 to shut out other manufacturers in the process. (NovaLogic later denied that it was trying to freeze 
 out the competition, but its initial releases featured the phrase "exclusive rights" prominently.) 
 When the flight sim community rose up in outrage over this (particularly in light of NovaLogic's 
 complete inability to create a flight model more realistic than that found in, say, Descent) , NovaLogic 
 backed off. But it still had this swell deal with Lockheed and needed to start making it pay out. 

 F-22 Raptor is the result. It is essentially F-22 Lightning II reissued. The radical differences 
 in the two games made a whole new release essential. Differences such as the "Lockheed Martin Fighter 
 Series" label on the box and, um, let's see. Oh yeah, the textures don't pop as much. And, er, 
 well, it is native Windows 95. There's MMX support. The interface art looks a bit different. I'm 
 reaching here, folks.... Help me out.  

 There have been some very minor enhancements made. Some new textures and fogging effects have been 
 added, and the engine seems to run a bit smoother. Ground textures have some filtering on them, 
 for that nice angora sweater look, instead of the slight pixelization of the original. Texture 
 popping is less of an issue than in the original, where I'd watch mountain tops draw. But these 
 are things for a patch, not a whole new game. The cockpit and view modes have not changed at all. 

 There have been some slight modifications made to the flight model in order to inch it closer in 
 the direction of reality, but turns still feel off. I know we don't have the reports on the F-22 
 yet, so it's very difficult to comment on the way Raptor handles. Some drag and fuel consumption 
 codes appear to have been added, and there is some speed bleeding. The fact is, we can't be certain 
 about the flight model since the advanced design of the F-22 may indeed have many automatic and 
 self-correcting features. But the physics of the world just don't feel convincing, and the avionics 
 are certainly simplified.  

 The cockpit is set up in such a way that you cannot easily monitor instruments. The one pop-up screen 
 offered is the attack/nav display, which only serves to highlight the failure of NovaLogic to create 
 a convincing and useful information display. There isn't enough range or target information to 
 make the display usable. Plus, it only offers the 90-degree forward-facing sensor arc, not the 
 360-degree defensive display, which is crucial to situational awareness. This means that you'll 
 spend a lot of blind time glancing at instruments. I had a great deal of trouble tracking inbound 
 missiles with these instruments. Either create a proper set of overlays (a la Navy Fighters) , or 
 keep the instruments visible in the cockpit view at all times. Like Interactive Magic, NovaLogic 
 has also failed to include a moving map display. This means that if you suffer navigation systems 
 failure, you can't finish a mission using VRF. Does the F-22 have an MMD? If it doesn't, the pilots 
 at least have knee boards. An in-game map is essential.   

 On the plus side, there is some modeling of individual system failures. Enemy AI is vigorous, and 
 wingman AI is improved over past NovaLogic titles. The graphics are sharp and smooth without 3Dfx, 
 though they are not up to the current standard of hardware-only titles. The campaign is semidynamic, 
 with some store tracking and a persistent battlefield (destroyed objects stay destroyed) . Missions 
 are still scripted, rather than dynamically generated. The five minicampaigns all run together, 
 as you begin in Angola, then move on to Jordan, Russia, Columbia, and Iran. There is also a number 
 of training and stand-alone missions.   

 Raptor is not done with a great deal of depth or complexity, but it is done in an entertaining and 
 accessible way. The feel is most like US Navy Fighters, with a  
 approach. Its ease of use and simple controls make it an ideal midrange sim for many. The debatable 
 claims for hard-core realism aside, Raptor still suffers from a few problems, such as the avionics 
 and map display issues. Furthermore, it feels like a rip-off. There is simply not enough that's 
 new or different to justify a whole new game. This is the game owners of Lightning II deserved 
 in the first place.

Review:  I think that this game is the First Grade of its Genre og games.
  
  I did not find much games in simulating the Aircrafts riding or combat like this game.
  
  I 
 do not say that it is the best in Graphics or Reality but think about that you are talking about 
 a game released in 1997.
  
  It is really very generous to still playing a game from 1997 till now.
  
  I really would like 
 to ask NovaLogic company, why do not you upgrade this game with new techniques &amp; release a 
 new game with the powerful new Graphics in 2007. I think it will be very successful &amp; generous 
 game.
  
  Please, take this review seriously.
  
  I wish to hear from NovaLogic soon about developing this Game &amp; see F-22 Raptor II...
  
 
  Thank you very much for your attention...

Review:  Jets Everywhere!! Well here is my little review on F22-Raptor which by far is in Instant Classic 
 in the Jet Sim Series. Read on to see more about my review and how I felt about this game:
  
  Gameplay:
  8/10 because it has alot of Variety but falls short in some places which sometimes 
 is a total letdown.
  
  Graphics:
  8/10 Not the best but at least it tried hard enough to have some reputation in the gaming history.
 
  
  Sound:
  10/10 Because these are one of the best sounds I have ever heard in my life and feels great.
 
  
  Value:
  Just download the shareware version and your off to playing a really cool game.
  
  This was 
 my little reveiew on F22-Raptor, I hope you like it Gamespot

Review:  
  gameplay-The shooting is tedious but satisfying, the physics are good, the missles are alright, 
 the counter measures are alright. The enemies can be difficult and there are secret ways of bombing 
 their base. Overall, not enough weapons, not enough baddies. It gets boring flying around and launhing 
 missles though. At least the landings fun.
  
  graphics-good for its time but the explosions framerate is terrible, also the resoultion doesnt 
 look that great. Other than that, I liked the debris and the red/black out effect. The fog and 
 clouds wasn't bad either. The textures could use some touching up, though.
  
  sound- nice dialogue, occasionally funny, and some good sounds. The music is midi. On top of that 
 there are only 5 songs.
  
  value-sort of outdated. if you are a aircraft geek you might want to buy.
  
  tilt-i am writing 
 evrything in lowercase. Want to know why? Ask my doctor...
