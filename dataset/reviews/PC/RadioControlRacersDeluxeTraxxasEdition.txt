While the graphics and sound could have been better, the fast-paced gameplay and circuit options 
 make the game interesting and enjoyable. 

 Radio Control Racers Deluxe: Traxxas Edition is an improved version of the popular 3D Ultra Radio 
 Control Racers game that was released last March. The game is based on racing one of four types 
 of radio-controlled cars around a variety of off-road tracks. The Traxxas Edition adds several 
 new tracks to the previous game as well as two new R/C battle modes: soccer and battle ball.   
 

  The 14 racetracks included in the game are fun, and they emphasize the diminutive proportions of 
 the cars. Races take place on traditional R/C off-road tracks as well as on a miniature golf course, 
 in a haunted yard, at an Aztec temple, and in many other entertaining locations. The difficulty 
 of the tracks varies; several of the more straightforward tracks have basic turns and jumps, while 
 other tracks are filled with obstacles and traps. Power-ups are also scattered along the tracks. 
 These power-ups can be items that increase the performance of your car, such as turbo boost or 
 ghost drive, or they can be offensive items used to slow down other cars, such as bottle rockets, 
 firecrackers, and oil slicks. Many of the tracks also contain humorous (and often frustrating) 
 traps that can severely damage your lap time, although they do not permanently damage your car. 
 For instance, the backyard track has a doghouse, and if your car drives too close while whipping 
 around a hairpin turn, the dog will jump out and gnaw on your car for a couple of seconds. This 
 delay can often mean the difference between coming in first or last place during a close race. 
 The traps and power-ups can be turned off individually for a simplified racing experience.   

 
  The basic view in the game is a semi-isometric overhead perspective that remains centered on your 
 car and pans (but doesn't rotate) across the track to show the surrounding area and upcoming turns. 
 The graphics are adequate but a little disappointing; while you can customize the look of the cars 
 using the custom paint-shop options, the cars themselves are so tiny during the races that the 
 effect is almost imperceptible. Many of the 3D tracks also have corners that are difficult to judge 
 because of the point of view.   

  The game includes a variety of typical sound effects, announcer dialogue, and musical tracks that 
 are unique to the individual racecourses. The sound effects, music, and dialogue can all be adjusted 
 or turned off individually. The musical tracks are fast paced and often fit the theme of the racecourse, 
 whether it's a construction site or a frog pond. The R/C engine noise is an appropriately high-pitched 
 whine, and all of the power-ups have suitable sound effects as well. The announcer gives lap-by-lap 
 updates, congratulates you on winning, and chastises you for losing.   

  The game makes up for its average graphics and sound with enjoyable gameplay. It supports various 
 game controllers, but the default keyboard commands work well. Simple arrow-key controls, along 
 with two keys for boost and power-ups, let you negotiate your way around the tracks. Although the 
 game has just two difficulty settings, it has enough other options to let you adjust the game to 
 fit your preferences. The difficulty settings adjust the skill of the computer-controlled opponents 
 as well as the handling of your car, which makes the racetracks far more difficult to negotiate 
 on the harder settings. The basic always-on-the-gas style of driving that will lead you to victory 
 in easy mode will lead you straight into a wall in hard mode.   

  One of the best features of the game is the circuit option. You can select the amateur or pro circuits 
 or a custom circuit using your choice of tracks. There's a qualifying round before each race, and 
 you are placed in the main event based on the results of the qualifying round. A good qualifying 
 time will place you in a higher main event, which means more prize money. You can purchase upgrades 
 to your cars with your winnings, such as better shocks, tires, or engines. As you purchase more 
 upgrades, you will see a substantial improvement in your car's performance. In the circuit mode, 
 there is also a wear-and-tear option, which reduces the effectiveness of your upgrades with each 
 race, making it more difficult to maintain a high level of performance in your race car.   

  While the game does not include any kind of Internet multiplayer option, a two-player split-screen 
 mode is available that lets you race head-to-head against a friend on the same computer. In addition, 
 two sports games are included: an R/C car version of soccer and battle ball, a game in which you 
 herd balls into a central goal by hitting them with the cars. While these alternate modes add some 
 variety to the typical racing formula, they do not seriously increase the appeal of the game.  

  Radio Control Racers Deluxe: Traxxas Edition is a fun arcade-style racing game. It offers a large 
 number of tracks and circuit options and enough difficulty to keep skilled racers challenged for 
 many hours. While the graphics and sound could have been better, the fast-paced gameplay and circuit 
 options make the game interesting and enjoyable.
