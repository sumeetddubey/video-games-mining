:::Review:::
While there is a lot less that's new in 1503 A. D. than you would expect in a sequel released three 
 years after its predecessor, the core gameplay that made the original game engaging remains intact. 
 

  German developer Sunflowers' previous game 1602 A. D. was a bestseller in Europe, and the developer's 
 newest game, 1503 A. D., follows closely in its footsteps. Unfortunately, the new game is largely 
 the same as the previous game; while it's true that 1503 A. D. does have a number of changes and 
 improvements over the original game, it's really just more of the same, but fleshed out a bit. 
 Then again, that's not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you enjoyed the original game's engaging 
 and leisurely gameplay. One thing we will note: 1602 A. D.'s voice-overs are, in fact, a bad thing. 
           The game's main attraction is building up your own colony.    

  You could conceivably call Sunflowers' games "real-time strategy," but they aren't really traditional 
 real-time strategy games in the vein of Starcraft and Command &amp; Conquer. Instead, 1503 A. D. 
 is a "culture-builder" that resembles Blue Byte's Settlers series, in which your task is to carefully 
 nurture your civilization by building different structures and letting your little pioneers expand 
 and grow. Most games begin with a single ship, from which you must establish your colonial empire. 
 This can take a surprising amount of time, and considering the fact that the campaign has 12 missions, 
 the single-player game offers quite a bit of gameplay. 1503 A. D. also includes individual missions 
 and an open-ended sandbox mode -- so the game gives you plenty to keep you busy for a while. The 
 only problem is that, despite some improvements, you've seen most of this gameplay already in 1602 
 A. D..   

  If you haven't played 1602 A. D. for some time, you might actually think you've loaded up the old 
 game the first time you play 1503 A. D. While the new game has somewhat improved graphics, it's 
 still hardly state of the art and doesn't dramatically change the way the game looks. 1503 A. D. 
 sticks to the original game's presentation in almost every way, from the recycled voice-overs to 
 the tab-heavy interface. You might even recognize some of the musical effects that the previous 
 game "borrowed" from Heroes of Might &amp; Magic II. However, you might have problems with the 
 game's lousy voiceovers.   

  The game's pace is best described as languid. You set things up and then tweak them as necessary. 
 Your basic task is to start from the contents of a single sailing vessel and develop a thriving 
 settlement (or settlements) on a variety of different terrain types. Your success comes from satisfying 
 your colonists' needs and advancing them through four levels of social strata to the fifth level, 
 aristocrat. This system remains unchanged from the original game, but it still provides a solid 
 foundation for the gameplay. You need to be mindful of issues like city layout, trade relations, 
 and economic planning, which are all influenced by the rather indirect method of placing buildings 
 and setting up trade routes. Half the fun is watching your little colonists go about their business. 
   

  However, the previous game had a number of problems, and 1503 A. D. addresses only a few of them. 
 One of the most annoying problems in the previous game was its interface -- buildings would all of 
 a sudden sprout giant, rotating question marks, alerting you to a problem without describing what 
 it was. 1503 A. D. at least addresses this by including an icon indicating whether the building 
 is being over- or underutilized, but the game remains far too opaque in terms of feedback that 
 you can use quickly and easily. Rather than including more-comprehensive interface screens or instant 
 pop-up windows, the game relies on tooltips that are only usable because of the game's incredibly 
 slow pace. Until you become quite proficient with the system, figuring out what has gone wrong 
 with your economy (or, rather, precisely how to fix it) can be frustrating and may put off less 
 dedicated players. For extremely patient players, figuring out exactly how to fix problems in your 
 settlements can contribute to a sense of discovery as you figure out exactly why things work the 
 way they do. For others it will just be frustrating. At least the new game has "temperature bars" 
 to indicate the relative desirability of building locations, but on the whole, 1503 A. D.'s interface 
 still isn't ideal.   

  As you play the game, you'll probably notice the many opportunities the developers could have taken 
 to expand on the previous game. For instance, the game lets you trade with a number of different 
 civilizations (each with its own buildings and attitude) , but you're stuck with the same single 
 European civilization you played in 1602 A. D.. That's really unfortunate, because there were a 
 lot of things from the original game that really should have been expanded but, for whatever reason, 
 weren't. Instead, the main difference you'll notice in the sequel is that the combat system has 
 been expanded. But even this isn't a huge expansion, because while there are significantly more 
 unit types and combat formations, the whole thing still seems very primitive.   

  First of all, calling the game's combat controls "unwieldy" would be an understatement. Cumbersome 
 formation commands, awful pathfinding, and the lack of simple tools such as waypoints make the 
 combat system seem primitive; the naval combat is particularly clumsy. Secondly, while the campaign 
 forces you to fight in certain missions, the open-ended games try to teach you some moral lessons 
 by having the AI respond directly to your level of militarization. If you want to play without 
 any military whatsoever, the AI will politely refrain from arming itself and will restrict itself 
 to trade. If you decide to raise an army, the AI will too. While this lets you, to a large extent, 
 choose whether or not to get involved in combat, it makes the whole military system seem a bit 
 tacked on, since any military challenge by the AI seems self-inflicted.           These formations 
 look good but are impossible to maintain because of the poor combat interface.    

  1503 A. D. is at its best when you play to develop your settlements, just like its predecessor. 
 The game has a linear campaign with a predictably irrelevant story and a series of goal-oriented 
 missions. The campaign does a decent job of giving you different objectives in each mission (you'll 
 do everything from building a colony to rescuing a mismanaged settlement to chasing down a sailing 
 fleet) , but the game is really at its best in sandbox mode, in which you simply try to create a 
 settlement and nurture it into a trade empire.   

  While there is a lot less that's new in this game than you would expect in a sequel released three 
 years after its predecessor, the core gameplay that made the original game engaging remains intact. 
 It may seem like a clich for game reviews, but if you enjoyed the previous game, you'll probably 
 enjoy 1503 A. D. The new game's slow pace and emphasis on trade and economy over military operations 
 might not seem too exciting for fans of traditional real-time strategy, but those looking for something 
 different may want to give it a try.

Review:  This game isn't for everyone. It get repetitive and boring to some people very fast. This game 
 is a great simulation in city building. What makes it unique is that its based on island expansion 
 and not a single land with a lake. To build a thriving city you will have to take over islands, 
 establish trade routes and protect all of your islands with fleets.
  
  This game isn't something flashy but it can be very interesting if you like these kind of games. 
 You will have to build city or cities depending on your play style. Get resources to your city 
 to keep your citizens happy and increase your income. Overall its a very good economical sim.
 
  
  Campaign is very hard. It will take you some time getting used to it. Having a positive balance 
 sheet in this game is difficult. You will have to balance many aspects of the game to succeed. 
 If you like Building simulators with a twist give this a try. It will be challenging.

Review:  1503 A. D. The New World is one of these games that you can always back and play. Spending hours 
 and hours planning and building your settlement and later city... Great graphics for that age when 
 is out, hard micromanagement implanted in the game made this game truly hard for beginners, but 
 i recommend it to everyone. Game have lot of charm in it that you cant find novadays. Building 
 a city from a least beginning then slowly upgrading it to the even bigger city while you managing 
 your army and set points for trade over the sea and land. Managing your army is easy to handle 
 and you are ready to war, when you wish to conquer more lands... its up to you then...

Review:  Anno 1503 (known in the Americas as 1503 AD) is a game with both real time strategy and city building 
 elements, developed by Germany-based Sunflowers Interactive Entertainment Software company. It 
 revolves around building and maintaining a 16th century colony in the New World. It is the sequel 
 to the similar game Anno 1602.
  
  Gameplay
  Anno 1503 begins with the player in control of a ship filled with men and material searching for 
 an island to settle. After finding a suitable site city building begins. Resources begin as food 
 and cloth, but progress into more complicated and different goods. Eventually, citizens become 
 Aristocrats, and require at least ten different goods and numerous services, such as access to 
 a large church or a bathhouse. The game is constructed around one human player and three computers. 
 Like Anno 1602, the AI computers are progressive, meaning that they advance along with the human 
 players. The computer players also have adjustable personalities, which the player customizes before 
 the beginning of a game. Each different player, human or computer, is represented by a color.
 
  
  The game is amazingly detailed and realistic as to modeling real life. [citation needed] The complex 
 processes needed to support a population requires intense development and planning skills; therefore 
 the game is extremely popular with people fond of micromanagement. [citation needed]
  
  Economy
  The economy in Anno 1503 is built on selling different goods to colonist citizens. It 
 begins with the sale of cheap goods, and progresses in civilization levels throughout the game 
 leading to more advanced goods. Since the game is built on different levels of civilizations (pioneer, 
 settler, citizen, merchant, aristocrat) , each civilization level requires more goods and more balancing 
 skills and finesse.
  
  The aristocrat level is not considered the highest level. [citation needed] Instead, it is a bonus 
 level that advanced players can upgrade to. Besides being able to build a custom designed palace 
 in the aristocrat level, the entire population at merchant level is more strategically sound. [citation 
 needed]
  
  Technology
  Technology of Anno 1503 begins on the pioneer level. After giving citizens basic goods like food, 
 cloth, and alcohol, they develop into Settlers, the second civilization level. The second levels 
 allows the player's settlers to build more advanced buildings; however, settlers require more goods 
 to stay alive. Buildings in the game do not necessarily have a specific function for the player, 
 but have an implied or under effective function for settlers in the game. Building abilities are 
 amplified with expansion, meaning larger populations have more effective building powers.
  
  The military form of this game is more complex than that of Anno 1602. The game has more than 
 seven different types of units as opposed to Anno 1602 with only four. Thus, during battles, the 
 game experience becomes more intense as deploying different units becomes key in strategy for winning 
 a battle.
  
  The buildings in the game are more extensive than those of its prequel. This is mainly due to the 
 fact that the game play area and islands are many times bigger than that of 1602. Thus, it makes 
 it possible to have many more plantations and diversity of farm houses. With the original houses 
 and farms featured in the prequel, this game also has many more extensive farms for gems, silk, 
 whale blubber, lamp oil, medicinal herbs, hops, wine, indigo, coal, hides, leather and salt, increasing 
 gameplay difficulty. Building and house graphics are improved over the prequel.

Review:  For strategy game fans, 1503 has some interesting features. Probably the most interesting part 
 of the game is the need to plan and position your colony's buildings with great care so that you 
 build an efficient town; this gives an extra dimension that many other games lack. Unfortunately, 
 however, the game contains too many little annoying 'features', causing a fair amount of frustration. 
 For example, you spend fifteen minutes collecting the money and equipment necessary to train an 
 army only for half of them to get 'lost' on their way to the awaiting ships. If you can stand the 
 repetition that arises from such bugs, the game can be entertaining - but not enough for me.

Review:  If you love fast action and lots of shooting, 1503 A. D. is NOT for you. However, if you enjoy spending 
 hours perfecting the layout and economics of your empire / city, then you have found a game to 
 love.
  
  I play this game all the way through at least once a year, and have yet to get bored with it. There 
 are islands to explore and settle, buildings and streets to build, trade agreements to sign and 
 meet, pirates to evade or defeat, all at a pace that is entertaining and engaging.
  
  The tutorials are easy to understand and teach you the basics. From there, you can make your settlements 
 as simple or complex as you like.
  
  Don't forget to download the Metropol scenario (in the Downloads tab) and build a city great enough 
 to earn yourself a Palace!
  
  Enjoy!

Review:  I was one of those who found 1602 well after it was released and loved it. What I had come to expect 
 from 1503 was essentially a refinement of the good stuff and maybe less of the bad stuff. What 
 I got was actually a step backwards. First of all I was disappointed in that your only option to 
 play is through the canned scenarios. There are no open ended game choices and frankly that was 
 the long lasting appeal for 1602. This is made worse by the lack of any kind of map/level editor. 
 So instead of getting hundreds of hours of game play I was looking at **maybe** tens of hours. 
 Even when you play the canned scenarios, your choices are limited. You are stuck with the assigned 
 player color and there is very little in way of scenario options to change up a scenario in an 
 attempt to make it fresh. The original included multiplayer from the very beginning, but they had 
 long announced that 1503 would ** not ** include multiplayer at release but that a multiplayer 
 add on would come soon thereafter. Well that ** never ** happened. On the other hand the expanded 
 variety of natives, resources and structures were nice as were the detailed 3D graphics. However, 
 if I just want to look at pictures I will go to a museum. Ultimately it was a complete and utter 
 disappointment and I eventually wound up going back to playing 1602 (which is a very bad sign for 
 any sequel) .

Review:  Some years ago when the first Anno game was released, it looked pretty nice for that year and offered 
 lots of pleasurable hours of building your cities, armies and economics.
  Anno 1503 offers new refreshing aspects to the old version of the game in many ways.
  
  Gameplay 
 is really the highest priority in this game. Everything is about building those great cities with 
 get it's rich influence from the fields and labours. Also the armies in this part are way better 
 then in the last part, altough it still isn't the battle-type game, you can use pretty much everything 
 to effect the way your city will develop and progress.
  
  The graphics don't really seem to be superior, but it does outraces it's predecessor. The build-up 
 of the landscapes are really that kind of style what you see in many other games, a static system 
 that makes the landscapes look pretty nice.
  
  About the sound. The main sounds are pretty nice, everything has some unique sounds and the music 
 really is worth the listening. A bit of old middle ages styled music.
  
  Anno 1503 is, in my opinion, really a game that pleasures those that love econmics in games, the 
 most!

Review:  Gameplay: Gameplay is solid. You have all the normal options of an RTS. There are plenty of different 
 buidings and your population keeps you busy. Combat is great in this game. You have all the normal 
 units and computer opponents put up a good fight.
  
  Graphics: They are the biggest improvement over 1602 a. d. Turned up on the highest setting they 
 are great.
  
  Sound: The sound is good. Hovering over a populated area you can hear the bustling population moving 
 about. Music reflects the mood well. In combat cannon and musket fire sound pretty good.
  
  Value: By know this game is fairly cheap so it is well worth your money. You will find plenty of 
 fun in this game to take hours away from your life.

Review:  I don't know why it isn't very popular, because it's a great game. It's much better than Age of 
 Empires or 1602. The graphics and sound are much better than 1602's and I think the music actually 
 ads more to the gaming experience. The game can be a little difficult if you are the kind of person 
 who does not like to use cheats, but if you do use cheats it's really fun and there is a whole 
 lot less stress from worrying about food and other staples. One of the problems with the game is 
 that you can only have about 30 - 60 soldiers at most in your possession at once, and con only 
 control 30 of them at one time, but that's about all you'll ever need so I guess it's not too bad. 
 All together it's a great game and definitely worth your money and time.

Review:  In this game you build a colony in the "new world." You build homes, mines, workshops, ports, doctors 
 office, statues, roads, farms, mills, ports, theatres, mansions, and even your own palace when 
 you get rich enough. With a fort/castle you can build pikemen, swordsmen, and other troops (provided 
 you have made their weapons with mines and workshops) . You can build cavalry and even musketeers. 
 You can build ships and arm them with cannon (if you have built cannons) . You venture forth and 
 build colonies on other islands to collect their special resources for your peoples happiness and 
 to sell them for cash. These resources include tobacco, spice, wine, gold, ect. Here's how it works: 
 you see a field of tobacco on an island, you build a port on that island (so you can bring them 
 back to your colony) and start to build farms for that tobacco. You can then either ship it back 
 to you home colony for processing or do it on the island by building a tobacco workshop (which 
 turns the gathered tobacco leaves into smokable tobacco) , and ship it back home. certain classes 
 of citizens in your colony demand tobacco, and if you have more than you need you can sell it for 
 cash. By the way, you can also fight and declair war and conquer and destory in this game, but 
 you will be spending most of your time trying to keep from going bankrupt! Overall a great game 
 to play, and a must-have for strategy fans.

Review:  This game is a step backwards in many areas. Namely, there is no editor, and multiplayer functions 
 will be released as a patch. I've been waiting several months now for this legendary patch (the 
 primary reason I've been with-holding my review) , and yet they still have no idea when it (the patch) 
 will be ready for release.
  
  This game is essentially 1602AD with more units, cultures, and buildings. Released more than a 
 year after the original release date, I had expected a lot more than what I've seen. Replay ability 
 is very limited. After about 8 hours of play, I've sent this one to the dust bin.
  
  On the plus side, the new units are pretty fun, the combat is far better and the economy has been 
 expanded to other areas, although managing the economy on any level but the near bottom is almost 
 impossible.
  
  Bottom line, if you liked 1602AD, keep playing it, it's far better than this game.
