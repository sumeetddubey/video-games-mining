:::Review:::
Team Factor couldn't have been released at a worse time. 

 2002 has been a remarkably good year for both single-player and multiplayer PC action games. Several 
 of these games have been exceptional examples of advancements in innovative gameplay, great sound 
 effects and music, and impressive 3D graphics. Unfortunately, US Special Forces: Team Factor from 
 Czech developer 7FX isn't among these games. The game might have been innovative or graphically 
 impressive if it had come out about five years ago, but unfortunately, it's 2002 and Team Factor 
 couldn't have been released at a worse time.           Team Factor's character classes aren't all 
 that interesting.    

  As its name suggests, Team Factor is a team-based game. It's a first-person shooter that lets you 
 play on one of three teams as one of four character classes: the sniper, the machine-gun-toting 
 soldier, the heavy-weapon specialist, and the support scout. The main difference between each class, 
 as in most other realistic team-based shooters released in the past two or three years, is its 
 primary weapon (the sniper carries a sniper rifle with a zoom-in scope, the scout carries a submachine 
 gun, and so on) , though all four classes can also carry pistols and knives, and some can also carry 
 grenades and sensors used to hack into computers. Each class also has slightly different physical 
 attributes that ostensibly affect their health and accuracy, but they don't really have a noticeable 
 effect on the actual gameplay.   

  In Team Factor's 22 maps, your team will have to hack into computers, capture briefcases full of 
 intelligence documents, or simply wipe out opposing teams. Each of the game's maps has a different 
 objective that you'll learn about by reading the briefing just before the game starts -- there are 
 no separate gameplay modes in Team Factor, so you can't actually choose to play capture the flag, 
 deathmatch, or anything else. Beyond that, if you've played a team-based first-person shooter like 
 Counter-Strike in the past two or three years, you won't really see anything new in Team Factor. 
   

  Furthermore, if you've played a new team-based shooter in the last two or three years, you've definitely 
 seen and heard better. Though Team Factor's maps have a surprising amount of variety, including 
 jungle, desert, and swamp areas, the game generally has simple level geometry (the buildings in 
 many of the game's city levels aren't much more than large, simply textured rectangles) , stiff 
 character animation, and poor special effects (muzzle flashes look like jagged orange stars cut 
 out of cardboard, and the actual shots are represented by an opaque yellow line) . You'd think that 
 Team Factor's minimalist graphics would at least let the game run at a high frame rate, but even 
 on midrange and high-end systems, the game's performance is choppy.   

  This may sound like an extremely critical assessment of Team Factor's graphics, but it's difficult 
 not to focus on them because of the game's extremely sparse sound. The game has music at the opening 
 title screen, but nowhere else. No music of any sort plays in the actual game, and though Team 
 Factor has a voice-command menu that lets you issue orders to your teammates, you probably won't 
 make much use of it. Otherwise, the only sounds you're likely to hear in a session of Team Factor 
 are gunfire and grenade explosions. These sounds are loud and clear, but the sound effects for 
 each weapon aren't especially distinctive, nor do they give you a good idea of where they came 
 from.           The game's graphics look extremely dated.    

  These problems don't help Team Factor's multiplayer or single-player modes much. There are very 
 few servers that host the game online, so you may not even be able to find a game, but if you do, 
 you'll find that a multiplayer game of Team Factor is much like a single-player session, jerky 
 frame rate and all. And since Team Factor doesn't have any separate play modes or any kind of single-player 
 campaign, playing a single-player game of Team Factor isn't all that interesting either. To the 
 game's credit, Team Factor's bots are actually pretty decent -- though they'll occasionally get stuck 
 on walls, they'll often run straight for their enemies and mow them down efficiently. In fact, 
 in larger games with teams of five or more, you'll practically feel like a useless spectator as 
 your computer-controlled teammates sprint out of sight and annihilate your enemies before you even 
 have a chance to get your bearings.   

  Even though developer 7FX spent a long time developing the game, time (not to mention all the great 
 games that have been released in the past few years) has worked against it. Team Factor's dated 
 graphics, sparse sound, and lack of interesting play modes keep it from measuring up to action-game 
 heavyweights like Counter-Strike, Battlefield 1942, and Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, and even 
 to budget-priced shooters like Serious Sam. In and of itself, Team Factor isn't a horrendous game, 
 but considering all the other outstanding games that are on the shelf right next to it, it just 
 can't be recommended.
