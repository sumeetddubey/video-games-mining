For those of you who have always considered strategy games a trifle dry for your tastes, I give 
 you Z, the alcoholic, head-banging, gap-toothed, punch-drunk, inbred cousin of Command & Conquer. 
 

 For those of you who have always considered strategy games a trifle dry for your tastes, I give 
 you Z, the alcoholic, head-banging, gap-toothed, punch-drunk, inbred cousin of Command &amp; Conquer. 
 Z's opening movie tells the sordid tale of two Bill-and-Ted robot supply ship pilots, late (again) 
 for their scheduled delivery to a combat zone. The player is dropped without ceremony into said 
 combat zone, which at first appears to fall within recognizable C &amp; C operational parameters. 
 After two or three miserable failures, the player realizes that this is not the case. Enemy territory 
 is not captured in the meter-by-meter fashion of other real-time strategy games, but via a Capture 
 the Flag scheme; the Z battlefield is, for some inadequately explored reason, divided into grids 
 of territory, which may partially explain the wonky AI (see below) . Z is a game that has what I 
 euphemistically call "the personal touch." As the battle progresses, robotic grunts in the field 
 make the expected reports ("Moving out!" "Let's get 'em!") , as well as the less-expected requests 
 for support ("They're all over us!" "For Christ's sake, do something!") , and the still less-expected 
 direct verbal abuse ("Moron!" "Asshole!") as your beleaguered installations get reduced to their 
 component molecules.   

 While it is not possible to construct combat installations, structures such as robot factories and 
 radar sites may be taken with chunks of territory. At set intervals, these installations will produce 
 more combat robots or vehicles such as jeeps and tanks, while unattended installations, vehicles 
 and/or packs of weapons are scattered about the battlefield, waiting to be captured or destroyed. 
 Although the game is largely tactical in scale, these neutral pieces of - pardon the pun - Virgin 
 territory add a strategic element, encouraging players to scramble for position and property before 
 the destruction begins. This element is made even more important by the fact that the player who 
 is in control of more territories will have factories that produce units at a higher speed. Players 
 who can grab a lot of land in the first few minutes of the game, and then hang on to it, will have 
 many more units than their opponents in a very short time.   

 Which brings us to the subject of the game's AI, which certainly is noteworthy. Another word would 
 be singular. Still another would be weird, and that's probably the best one. The AI here is weird. 
 The click-and-select method of movement and combat is present, but the routes taken between a cluster 
 of robotic soldiers and an unattended box of grenades are often questionable. Even to line-of-sight 
 targets, straight lines are often completely avoided. But on the positive side, your soldiers are 
 also capable of making intelligent decisions (like jumping into tanks or assault guns) without 
 you telling them to. Anyway, Z features some pretty neato bonuses, such as the ability to snipe 
 enemy troops right out of their vehicles (allowing the subsequent capture of said vehicles, a really 
 hateful thing to do to a networked opponent) and - my personal favorite - the ability to simply 
 blast and tear your way through obstructive terrain that may be getting in your way, which is something 
 many an infuriated C &amp; C player has wanted to do for a long time now.   

 Z is a real-time strategy game for the less-obsessive and less-serious among us. Territories are 
 easy to capture, easy to lose, and often just as easy to recapture, and the sheer numbers of units 
 that the player must keep track of are quite a bit less bewildering than those found in some of 
 Z's more steely-eyed, rock-jawed cousins. Also, the inherent humor in the game will probably surface 
 as two or more human opponents face each other via a networked game - at the very least, the verbal 
 abuse will then come from someone you know.

Review:  A great classic. I remember playing this game when it first came out in 1996, along side of doom 
 and heretic. Just found the game again on ebay after many years of not playing and am enjoying 
 it today as much as I did when I first had the game on my 166mhz. The game starts off easy giving 
 you time to think and react to the oncoming AI but level after level the difficulty really ramps 
 one. Its a CTF RTS you send out your troops in the very beginning to capture all the factories, 
 guns and vehicles you can then you start building an army with those factories. You advance as 
 you destroy or get destroyed and loose territory. One great thing is shooting an enemy unit out 
 of a jeep or a tank and caputering that vehicle. This game does not reward failure and stars to 
 beat on you comically for loosing. Another great thing is the games are rather quick. Lasting anywhere 
 from 10 minutes to 1 hour considering how many other RTS can go for quite a while per game. This 
 game will keep you coming back and trying over and over to beat the crap out of it. Still one of 
 my favorites in the RTS game sections. Along side with Starcraft and Earth 2150. If you ever have 
 the chance to play or purchase this game please do so, you`ll enjoy it even today. Now get out 
 there solder. !

Review:  Well instead of managing resources or much else, Z is simple. There are territories with factory 
 output, blank nothing, fortress, and the occaisional derelect or other item. What really makes 
 this game fun is the fact your in control and things are always produced despite any costs, the 
 only factor is how many zones you control. You can produce the amazing Psycho, or the Medium Tank! 
 Get happy go lucky fight for your life type game. Truely a blast and something only the patient 
 should play due to it's extreme difficulty if you fail to snap out at the right time.

Review:  i remeber my brother got this game when it came out i was 6 and i used to play it, it was really 
 fun you are in control of your own army and your goal is to get to the other side to destroy your 
 aponents fort a simple point and click but alone the way you have to keep your men alive, bring 
 in reinforcements, get tanks, cars and wepons, very advanced for the time i think. along the way 
 you will fight in the desert to iceland and if somthing is in your way just blow a few holes in 
 it were talking mager fire power, so if you have the old 95/98 computer then you should play this 
 thats if you can find it for sale somplace :)
  
  im not so sure if i have the attribute right its been a long time

Review:  Well, what can I say? For me this is possibly one of the greatest games ever. It could be called 
 a CTF version of C+C but thats where the comparison stops. You've got 10 types of infantry, 10 
 types of vehicles and about 4 gun emplacements. Not to mention the errr... abusive AI. The graphics. 
 For its time, the games graphics were revolutionary. Even today it would put games like 'Big Rigs' 
 to shame (although that isn't exactly hard) . The game play. This was amazing really. Again it was 
 years ahead of its time. There has been no game like it since. Which was odd considering how well 
 it worked. It was a pity that its sequel was a bit of a disappointment. The levels get progressively 
 harder and the AI progressively stronger. For a first timer you'll be struggling by Level 5. Considering 
 that there's 21 levels, you may think this is stupid, but its to do with getting your troops going 
 fastest, don't worry about the close in bases, just go straight ahead. The AI, abusive, smart, 
 annoying. These are all words that can describe this odd AI. Its great in most sections of the 
 game, but occasionally it becomes a bit of a joke.
