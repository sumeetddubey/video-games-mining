Dogs Playing Poker might not be as clever or as funny as it could have been, but it's still a decent 
 alternative to solitaire. 

 Artist C. M. Coolidge's unusual early 20th-century painting  Looks Like Four of a Kind  (commonly 
 referred to as "dogs playing poker") has become a part of American kitsch culture, and it is now 
 the subject of ValuSoft's new poker game for the PC. In the game, you play as a human player who 
 shares a card table with "18-plus dogs and one crazy cat," though the game also includes a few 
 other critters, like a robot dog and an illiterate iguana. Dogs Playing Poker features a total 
 of five poker games, plus two additional variations, so it doesn't have a lot of breadth, but since 
 it retails for only $10, it actually packs in a surprising amount of value.           Dogs play 
 poker, and apparently, so do enthusiastic robot dogs.    

  The game itself features a total of five poker games: five-card draw, five-card stud, seven-card 
 stud, Texas hold-'em, and Omaha hold-'em. You can play each poker game with up to five computer 
 opponents who will be of beginner, intermediate, or advanced skill levels, and you'll generally 
 play each game until you bankrupt everyone, until you get bankrupted yourself, or until your boss 
 walks into the room, forcing you to Alt-Tab out of the game before you get caught playing games 
 at work. Dogs Playing Poker also has comprehensive tutorials that do a good job of explaining each 
 game. The game lets you choose to play a default beginner, intermediate, or advanced game, or set 
 your own custom options, including which opponents you play against, which of the game's four backgrounds 
 you'll play in, and your betting amounts. And Dogs Playing Poker plays decently well for a poker 
 game, though you'll find that your computerized opponents have the rather suspicious habit of putting 
 together rare hands like full houses and straights a lot more often than you will. And unfortunately, 
 you can't fully customize your play options -- you're forced to use the game's preset options for 
 each player's starting purse, each game's ante amounts, and each game's wild cards, for instance. 
   

  Dogs Playing Poker looks and sounds decent. The game's interfaces are minimal, but they're clean 
 and easy to use. The game has only four different backgrounds to play games in: a kitchen, a casino, 
 a poker table, and an executive office. They're all colorful, but there are simply too few of them. 
 The dogs (and cat and robot and iguana) themselves are chunky 3D models that look surprisingly 
 decent, and they're animated with a peculiar humanlike quality -- the same kind you may have seen 
 in recent television commercials that star computer-generated animals that act like people. Unfortunately, 
 these critters are mostly silent. They'll occasionally let out a brief yelp or a bark, though there 
 seem to be very few sound samples in the game, and the same samples are often used for different 
 dogs. In terms of music, the game has only five tracks -- one for the menu screen and one for each 
 background -- but they generally consist of appropriately goofy big-band music (with a tuba providing 
 oompah-pah-pah bass) that's suitable enough for the subject.           Your opponents might have 
 been more fun to play against if they were more dynamic.    

  As you might expect from glancing at the game's box, Dogs Playing Poker is a quirky, humorous game. 
 And it actually has some character, though unfortunately, the developer apparently didn't go far 
 enough in trying to give the game personality. The dogs themselves are disappointingly static and 
 silent -- rather than have speaking lines, they have static "cartoon thought balloons," and though 
 they'll periodically shuffle the deck, toss chips into the pot, and occasionally shift in their 
 chairs, they don't really move around all that much. If your opponents had been more lively, had 
 featured more sound samples, and had generally looked and sounded better, Dogs Playing Poker could've 
 had quite a bit more in the way of personality and charm.   

  Then again, you get dogs, five games of poker, and fairly good music for 10 bucks, so it's a decent 
 enough package. Dogs Playing Poker might not be as clever or as funny as it could have been, but 
 for its price, it's a decent alternative to solitaire if all you're looking for is a quick Windows 
 desktop game.
