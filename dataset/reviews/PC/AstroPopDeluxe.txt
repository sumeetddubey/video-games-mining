:::Review:::
If you want to invest $20 in a block-matching game, AstroPop is a strong choice 

  AstroPop is a conventional puzzle game, in the sense that it relies on the familiar mechanic of 
 block-matching -- in this case, you're attempting to make like-colored groups of four blocks or more, 
 causing them to disappear and award you points. You've probably played games like this many times 
 before... but you should make room for another one on your desktop, because AstroPop's gameplay 
 and quality level are both exceptional. Your ship, which jumps from column to column at the touch 
 of a mouse, can vacuum up anywhere from one to six blocks of the same color, attaching the stack 
 to its prow. You can then discharge the blocks towards the top of the screen, setting off cascading 
 combos if you hit the right spots. This game's many interesting specialty blocks -- some power-ups, 
 some hindrances, and others pernicious traps -- add a lot of spice to the experience. So do AstroPop's 
 cheerfully psychedelic visuals and pounding trance music soundtrack. AstroPop is one of the best 
 block-matching games around, and the full version is worth a $20 investment.

Review:  Gameplay: Well, its a kinda like reverse Tetris.. with the abulity to move the blocks to where 
 you want.. The game is pretty hard for beginners, although playing it more and more will make you 
 get better.. it isn't as good as other Popcap games in the series.. You reach checkpoints after 
 ever 5 lvls.. but reaching the next checkpoint will be EXTREMELY challenging.. 7 good gameplay
 
  
  Graphics: Very good.. very colorful and runs very well on older systems.. so very well optimized.. 
 I give this a 8
  
  Sound: excellent, no complaints.. 9 easy
  
  Tilt: I give this game a solid 6 ... its a fair game but not a good game... in essence I didn't 
 find it very enjoyable.. and more frustrating than fun .
  
  This gives the game an overall rating of 7.5...
  
  I wouldn't buy this game.. but I bought 
 it as part of a package over STEAM so thus my money wasn't really wasted .. but I would not recommend 
 it as a single purchase.. even though it does run VERY well..

Review:  As always, Popcap never fails to deliver a casual game that has high replay value. While such games 
 cannot fight against games by Blizzard, EA or such, these games are good alternatives to Solitaire 
 or Minesweeper, if you get what I mean.
  
  AstroPop boasts of relatively reasonable graphics and sound, considering that the game takes up 
 no more than 25 MB of system space. That is to say, don't expect cutting-edge effects.
  
  The classic mode allows you to play as 4 different characters, but they do not affect the gameplay 
 much other than having a different ability. You can replay the characters to increase the potency 
 of your special ability.
  
  The survival mode is never-ending, as long as you manage to stay alive. Nothing much to be said 
 about that since it's not much different from the classic mode.
  
  It would be nice to see a multiplayer mode similar to that of Bust-A-Move. Overall, AstroPop is 
 a simple, yet addictive game. Try the free 60-min demo if you've got the time.
