:::Review:::
It's really just a shoot-'em-up game that gives you targets to shoot at but restricts your movement. 
 

  B-17 Gunner: Air War Over Europe is essentially an arcade shooter in which you take the role of 
 a gunner on a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber as it flies bombing missions over Europe in World War 
 II. There is no flight simulation aspect to the game: You simply man the guns and shoot down enemy 
 fighters. Each mission begins with your squadron already in the air, and the mission ends before 
 you land. It's really just a shoot-'em-up game that gives you targets to shoot at but restricts 
 your movement.           Bombing runs are a point-and-click affair.    

  Gameplay in B-17 Gunner is exceedingly straightforward. Six positions in the B-17 are modeled: 
 nose gun, top turret, ball turret, right and left waist guns, and tail guns. You can jump between 
 gunnery positions by hitting the number keys, and each gives you an appropriate view as you're 
 looking out of the aircraft. Your job is to man these guns and protect your plane from enemy fighters. 
 As your squadron loses escort planes, the enemy comes to focus increasingly on you. German fighters 
 come in waves, and the deeper your mission into Germany, the more fighters you face per wave (although 
 the length of the missions doesn't appear to measurably increase) . At the beginning of the mission, 
 you're shown a picture of your target. When you approach it, you are automatically shifted to the 
 bombsight view and must center and release the bombs on the target you were shown in the mission 
 briefing. At the end of each mission, you obtain a score based on successful bombing and defense 
 of your aircraft. The goal is to live through 25 missions and be sent home. An indicator at the 
 lower right of the screen shows your position in the plane. When gun positions get "knocked out," 
 they become inaccessible.   

  While you're in control of all your gun positions at the start of the mission, you won't find them 
 all equally useful in practice. Some guns have very limited deflection (for example, at the nose 
 and waist positions) , and the persistent cloud layer really limits the effectiveness of the ball 
 turret. Because the intercom sounds are mostly just oft repeated, canned phrases, it's often hard 
 to determine where enemy attacks are coming from without constantly jumping from one control position 
 to another. Instead of having other gunners call out locations ("Bandits at three o'clock low!") , 
 they usually simply repeat a limited set of phrases, like "Jeez, they're all over the place." Consequently, 
 it's usually better to simply sit in the top turret (which has the most freedom of fire) for the 
 entire mission. Since enemy planes tend to attack from high positions, this is the most effective 
 defensive strategy. Unfortunately, it gets fairly boring. Because guns reset their positions when 
 you switch to a new station, flipping quickly between the waist and ball turret, for example, doesn't 
 work because when you switch back into the ball turret, you'll find yourself facing aft (even if 
 you were facing port when you left) , and you'll have to waste time rotating the guns. Sticking 
 to the top turret is the way to go.   

  The missions are essentially all the same, no matter what your target is or how deep it is inside 
 Germany. Bombing is simply a case of squeezing the trigger while the crosshairs are over the target. 
 While crewmembers will call out damage to the aircraft, this doesn't appear to affect its performance 
 in any way. The aircraft is shot down only when all the gun positions have been eliminated.    
        None of the six gunner positions in the plane make for much fun.    

  As if this weren't enough, the game has fundamental technical problems that make it very frustrating 
 to play. Despite the lack of detailed graphics and absence of any need for a flight model, B-17 
 Gunner stutters worse than some detailed flight sims that tax the computer far more than this simple 
 arcade game. Even with a full installation, the game jerks, stalls, and stutters to such an extent 
 that the graphics engine becomes a bigger obstacle to shooting down enemy planes than the planes' 
 evasive actions. This stuttering persisted on two test systems that more than met the minimum hardware 
 requirements, even after full hard-drive defragmentation and reinstallation. Considering the limited 
 appeal of the gameplay in the first place, this is a crippling flaw.   

  Despite its simplicity, B-17 Gunner could have been an enjoyable, if mindless, arcade romp that 
 you'd fire up for 20 minutes here and there to shoot down some planes and bomb some targets. Unfortunately, 
 B-17 Gunner's numerous problems make it a product with little value, even at its reduced retail 
 cost of $20.

Review:  Okay, let's see, how can I put this in a nice way. B17 Gunner: Air War Over Germany is basic. Very 
 basic. Incredibly basic. Well... okay, it's arcade basic. B17 Gunner: etc, etc.... besides having 
 a long title for a basic game, is in itself, such a... basic... game its not funny. In the least, 
 it's dull. I find this game a fair filler to kill sometime at home, while waiting for my laundry 
 to finish a load. But other than that, there is nothing of value regarding a game dealing with 
 the subject.
  
  This game doesn't fall into the flight sim category, even though it is sometimes listed as such. 
 You do no flying in the game, just gunnery. And it's gunnery where there is a spot available. You 
 have a choice of positions, but as the crew begin to die off, your choices slip as fast.
  
  The graphics are basic, the dialogue is fun the first few times and the music is, frankly, lame.
 
  
  For me, I bought this because I like having these types of games in my collection for the era they 
 represent. But it was a surprise to find it to be so... basic. Pick this game up if you got some 
 extra cash just burning a whole in your pocket. Other wise, pass on it.
