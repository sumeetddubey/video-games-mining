:::Review:::
Not-so-exciting gameplay, not-so-absorbing missions, and not-so-hot graphics... 

 Virgin Interactive Entertainment, in an attempt to merge the realism of a flight sim with the excitement 
 of an arcade flying shooter, have brought us Agile Warrior F-111X. I am sorry to say wait! 
 But I'm not sorry to say that this game falls far short of being exciting, immerseful, or any of 
 that other positive game jargon you frequently come across in gaming rags. Put simply, when I was 
 playing this game, my knuckles weren't white because I was clenching my fists with excitement - 
 they were white because I was pulling my hair out in handfuls.  

 Okay, that was pretty harsh. On a more positive note, the game actually does offer some mildly entertaining 
 (with emphasis on "mildly") arcade action. You fly through missions, blasting away every tank, 
 MiG, cargo plane, guy, or whatever else you want removed from the screen. Blasting is performed 
 with a variety of weapons, picked up in the form of floating icons, that range from rockets, to 
 seekers, to napalm, to let's-be-exceedingly-rash nukes. The terrain is pretty darn monotonous; 
 however, gunning down a swooping F-16 and proceeding to impale its poor ejected paratrooper on 
 a rocket may prove slightly amusing to some.  

 Now, time to get harsh again. I was really pulling my hair out over how disappointing the graphics 
 were. Even flying around in lo-res, they seemed a bit choppy and unwieldy. But here's the real 
 clincher: The game supports a number of 3-D accelerators, so - being the fair, accurate, but strict 
 reviewer that I am - rather than chuck the game out the window after an hour or so of playing, 
 I decided to test it out with one of the higher-rated chip sets we have lying around the office. 
 I opted for the Rendition Verite, a really good accelerator, and boy, what results! Suddenly, my 
 cruddy pixelated game was endowed with graphical enhancements that would at best receive the SuperNintendo 
 stamp of approval. I thought that at any moment, a two-dimensional Yoshi would suddenly appear 
 in the sights of my F-111X.  

 I don't want to cast the Rendition card in a bad light - I think it's excellent. It's Agile Warrior 
 that's the problem. What can you say about a title like this? Every element in the game can be 
 described by tacking a "not-so" in front of it: not-so-exciting gameplay, not-so-absorbing missions, 
 and not-so-hot graphics. So here's the result: a not-so-hot review.

Review:  I haven't played this game for such a long time it will be hard to do a review. Ahhh lets see the 
 graphics stink. The gameplay stinks. The sound stinks. Everything about his game stinks. You fly 
 one plane with horrible sound. You can't even crash. The game is filled with glitches of every 
 kind and not good ones! The game is so hard I couldnt beat it when I was 9 I can't beat it now! 
 There are like 3 levels. That were not well designed. The creators of the game along with the game 
 itself shoud be buried. This game since it was made in 1996 can't stand up to todays jet sims! 
 In no way what so ever! DON'T BUY DON'T BUY!!!
