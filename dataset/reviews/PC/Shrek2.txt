:::Review:::
Shrek 2 for the PC is strictly for kids, though considering its clunky controls and short running 
 time, it's not even a terribly good game for them. 

  Since the ushering in of the current generation of consoles, multiplatform ports have become extremely 
 commonplace. Though the level of visual quality may fluctuate, you can pretty much expect the same 
 thing from the PC, Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube versions of most multiplatform releases. This 
 makes it a bit surprising that Activision, when making its games based on  Shrek 2 , chose to create 
 a unique title for the PC. Granted, the Luxoflux-produced console version of Shrek 2 was a little 
 short and a little simple, but the PC version undercuts that title with poor visuals, rougher, 
 shallower gameplay, and an outrageously short running time.  

          Shrek 2 may be bad, but fortunately, it's also pretty short.     

  In keeping with 
 the "Take  that , Brothers Grimm!" tone of the Shrek movies, the game kicks off with the opening 
 of a leather-bound storybook and an appropriately gentle English narration. This quaint scene is 
 quickly bulldozed by Shrek's wiseacre sidekick, Donkey, who provides us with some fast and dirty 
 exposition concerning the newlywed ogre couple of Shrek and Fiona heading off to Far Far Away to 
 meet Fiona's royal parents. The game goes on to loosely follow the story of the movie, with Shrek, 
 Donkey, and Puss In Boots trying to rescue Fiona from the grasp of the king, the queen, and the 
 fairy godmother. One of the few edges the PC version of Shrek 2 has over its console counterparts 
 is slightly sharper writing. The Shrek films are still funnier, to be sure, but the PC game has 
 a decent ratio of good jokes to bad jokes, with plenty of knowing winks to silly video game practices, 
 as well as a lot of the standard storybook stuff. The problem with irony, though, is that making 
 fun of trite, repetitive gameplay conventions doesn't make them any less trite or repetitive.  
 

  And, boy, is Shrek 2 ever rich with trite, repetitive gameplay conventions, and the actual content 
 of the gameplay alternates between incredibly basic platform hopping, some switch flipping, and 
 combat sequences that require you to mash on the attack button until everyone is on their backs. 
 The game controls like a stripped-down third-person action game, complete with the standard WASD-plus-mouse 
 control scheme and standard abilities. You'll alternate between controlling Shrek, Donkey, Puss 
 In Boots, and a gigantic gingerbread man, and for the most part, their controls are identical. 
 Each character can double-jump, perform simple combo attacks, climb ledges, and shimmy along ropes. 
 The simplicity and familiarity of the gameplay formula are made worse by the fact that the game 
 simply doesn't control very well. The timing on the jump and the double jump seems a little awkward; 
 the animation of your character climbing a ledge doesn't always match up with the level geometry; 
 lining up your character with a rope to shimmy along is needlessly fickle; and the combo attacks 
 don't really match up with your button commands, which creates a disconnect between the controls 
 and the onscreen action.  

  There are also pieces of the game that are, quite simply, useless. You can collect coins from crates 
 and downed enemies and spend them at drive-through-style menus that periodically appear throughout 
 the game on a variety of power-up potions, but at no point does the game become challenging enough 
 to make these coins necessary -- in fact, if you simply ignore all the coin collection and stay focused 
 on getting to the end of the game as fast as you can, you'll easily shave a good half hour off 
 your game time. The game actually shows off a little inspiration near the end, such as when you 
 lay siege upon the castle as a gigantic gingerbread man, but there just aren't enough moments like 
 these to carry the game, which is otherwise painfully easy and wickedly short.  

  One of the things that the console version of Shrek 2 really nailed was the visuals. The levels 
 weren't huge, but they were full of detail, and the characters looked great and animated nicely. 
 Alas, this is not the case with Shrek 2 for the PC. The levels look pretty bland throughout, and 
 a lot of the elements repeat -- there's actually a sequence near the end of the game where you play 
 through different parts of a level as three different characters, which leads to some pretty egregious 
 recycling. The main characters are pretty rough approximations of their motion-picture counterparts 
 and act as a fine example of why the details count. It's the small stuff, like the clumsy animation 
 transitions and the somewhat stingy character models, that keeps the characters from looking quite 
 the way they should. The enemies you'll face look decent, and considering the game's length, or 
 lack thereof, there's a decent variety of foes.  

          It remains a mystery why Activision would develop an entirely unique Shrek 2 game for the 
 PC.     

  One of the few things that's shared between the console versions and the PC version of Shrek 2 
 is the voice cast. Some of the stand-ins for the actual celebrity voices heard in  Shrek 2  the 
 movie don't quite match up, but the cast is generally pretty adept, and they're given some decent 
 material to work with, too. The voice work shines the most during cutscenes, and there's some good 
 in-game voice work too. However, the characters feel the need to talk a lot, but don't have a lot 
 to say, leaving you to hear the same speech clips over and over again. The soundtrack suits the 
 game for the most part, using lots of lute-and-flute arrangements to give the game a nice storybook 
 feel, though about halfway through the game, the soundtrack veers off into wah-wah-driven funk 
 that would seem more appropriate as the opening theme to a '70s cop show -- it's actually pretty 
 good stuff, it just seems wildly out of place. There's not much to say about the in-game sound 
 effects. They're serviceable, in that they don't betray the feel of the environments, but they're 
 not terribly spectacular, either.  

  What makes the Shrek movies fun for the family is the inclusion of something for everyone -- there's 
 plenty of slapstick and scatological humor for the kids as well as some sly pop culture references 
 for the older folks. But Shrek 2 for the PC is strictly for kids, though considering its clunky 
 controls and short running time, it's not even a terribly good game for them.

Review:  The plot is terrible, the controls are horrible, and the overall atmosphere and mood of the game 
 ruins the original intent of the movie. For example, the jump action is very ill suited, and there's 
 no way for me to set it to the 'spacebar' option. Other than that, the level system is awkward, 
 there is little substance especially with AI. And the mouse control is terrible. At least I got 
 it for only 2 bucks at marshall's or otherwise i would have asked for a refund. The installation 
 was also confusing and uninstallation of the game took too much time. If your kids loved the movie, 
 don't even think about buying this game because they will HATE it. In summary, the game might have 
 been better (maybe a 3 out of 10, tops) if the controls actually WORKED, but I guess I get what 
 I paid for.

Review:  The game is about Shrek, obviously, but you can also play as other characters such as Donkey or 
 Puss in Boots, and even though being a game based on a movie which usually means crap it's a totally 
 okay game to play when you're bored and got nothing better to do. Don't buy it, I don't think it's 
 that good and there are lots greater games out there, but if you get a chance and you're bored, 
 do play it. You may find it helpful.
  
  In the game you simply follow the storyline of the movie with the same name as the game ("Shrek 
 2") with a few extra forest scenes like in all from-movie-to games. The original voice actors from 
 the movie has returned and made new, original soundtrack for the game, but as it just repeats over 
 and over it gets very annoying. And the quality of the graphics don't really help.
  
  Play Shrek 2 only if you find it when you're bored, don't actually buy it.

Review:  This game is supposedly strictly for the kids? That is such a lie I think pinochio would be jealous 
 of gamespots nose right now. I think that kids and PC games don't mix for starters. But Shrek is 
 an ideal game for anyone, possibly the whole family. I brought this game when I was 24 and maybe 
 oh just maybe I am a big kid at heart but this game was friggin awesome. I found the controls well 
 developed and the storyline enjoyable and a good laugh through out. The sound is great and the 
 graphics superb. I completed the game, which I like to do with games because in the end of the 
 day they are only games. So if I pay up 30 I want to be able to complete the game. The game is 
 fun, its exciting at parts and its original. 
  Well like everything you will only know if you like playing the game. I would recommend it.
  
 The only flaw is that once I completed I saw no reason to play it again. So the gameplay life isn't 
 infinit and yet being non-addictive certainly has an air of dignity about it. Not knowing I am 
 addicted to a game is pretty good. If you are a 'hardcore gamer' 'PKer' or just generally that 
 calls everyone a 'noob' even the next doors cat. Then its not for you, but if you like games, then 
 play it. What more you won't be disapointed. And the happy ending isn't that far away.

Review:  Game Play: I got this game when I was somewhere around 13 years old and I thought this game would 
 be mega fun since I love Shrek so much, but this game turned out to be really strictly for kids.
 
  
  Graphics: The graphics are really bad for a PC game. The game is really colorful and nice to look 
 at but Shreks head is like a box and it is kinda scary to look at.
  
  Sound: The sound is good, but I think there is a glitch in this game where the characters sometime 
 start repeating what they said like 20 times in a row (no lie, really happened to me once and I 
 had to turn the game off in order to stop it) .
  
  Value: If you love your kids then buy it for them because I think they will really love it.
  
 
  Tilt: Hey once again I will say this game is really easy and is strictly for kids. I beat it the 
 first the first day I got it and was really surprised, but it was fun and I still think that the 
 kids will like it.

Review:  This is cute little game, and even though it has a childish ring to it, still its so nicely made 
 that I would recommend everyone to play it. Its a short game and lot of fun to play. The game 
 follows the storyline from the movie, and as its a game, there are.. lets put it like this (assume) . that 
 there are deleted scenes from the movie, lol (even though they havent got anything to so with 
 the original storyline) .
  
  You not only play with Shrek in this game, you play with Donkey and Puss in Boots too and the best 
 thing about all this is that the timeline of events is very well defined. For example of the three 
 characters get separated, you play with each of them and rendezvous at a specific place, the good 
 thing about this is that it seems boring but turns out to be pretty funny. The graphics and sound 
 effects are pretty basic. There are quite a few potions that you can use on your enemies during 
 the game and each one of them makes you laugh. Even though its basically a game for children, I 
 think everybody should play it and the gameplay is just about 10 hours.

Review:  Well, everyone's favorite anticipated animation film is coming back to the big screen with Shrek 
 2. This time Shrek finds himself meeting Fiona's parents. Now you can experience the fun of Shrek 
 2 by playing the new PC game called Shrek 2. I have no problem with giving an honest review here 
 so here it goes.
  
  Q: Does playing the game ruin the movie experience?
  A: I really do not think that playing the PC game will ruin anyone's movie experience when they 
 go see the film on May 21. The reason is because there are many scenes that are only spoken of 
 in the game but will be acted out in the movie, so you will still have that desire to see the film. 
 It's not at all like playing the LOTR games before the movie comes out where there are spoilers 
 and scenes from the film. While the game does give you the basic storyline of the movie, it does 
 nothing at all to ruin your movie-going experience.
  
  Q: What are the graphics like in the game?
  A: The graphics, scenery, and movements are similar 
 to that of the Harry Potter video games, which I actually like a whole lot. If you are expecting 
 Morrowind, Halo, or Half Life graphical detail, then you will be disappointed. The great news is 
 that because the graphics are not as high in detail, you won't have to run out and buy a new PC 
 to play it.
  
  Q: Are the controls easy to use and work?
  A: Absolutely. The controls are very easy. In fact, some games take away from the Gameplay because 
 their controls are much too complex and take longer to learn. By the time the user has the controls 
 down, they already expired in the game numerous times. The great thing about Shrek 2 is that the 
 controls are easy to learn, fast to memorize, and very simple. So you spend less time reading the 
 huge reference guide that accompanies most games and more time enjoying the storyline and game 
 itself.
  
  Q: What is the sound like? Is it movie quality?
  A: No, the sound is nothing like you would find in the movie. The theme song is basically the same, 
 the voices are narrated by other voice over actors (not the original celebrity voices) , and the 
 environment sounds are comparable to the Harry Potter games. But never fear because even though 
 the character voices are not done by the original celebrity actors, they are still very convincing, 
 very well done, and almost seemless.
  
  Q: Why would anyone want to buy this game?
  A: That's easy to answer - because it is fun. Sure it's not a full forced Knights of the Old Republic, 
 Halo, or Half Life experience, but it is very entertaining and fun nonetheless. I love the game. 
 I think you will too. You get to play as different characters, use combo fighting moves, collect 
 coins to buy potions, find hidden health boosters, and more. It's definitely worth the $29 that 
 you pay for it. The other great thing is that it doesn't hog up all of your computer resources. 
 Remember when you bought Far Cry and found out that your system doesn't even come close to having 
 the resources needed to play the game correctly at the medium setting? Well, you won't have those 
 frustrations or worries here. It's just good old fashioned fun and if you love the Shrek films 
 then you won't want to miss the game.
