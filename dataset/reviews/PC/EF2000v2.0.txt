:::Review:::
The best-looking, most engrossing flight sim this side of Longbow. 

 EF2000 was released two years ago, producing a mixture of awe and disappointment: awe at the flight 
 model, graphics, and dynamic campaign; disappointment at the bugs, faulty AI, unrealistic damage 
 routines, and other issues. Over the past two years DID has diligently patched and added to the 
 initial release with modules such as the GraphicsPlus and Tactom expansions. EF2000 V2.0 gathers 
 all this together into one extravagant package that almost fulfills the publisher hype: "setting 
 the standards by which future simulations will be judged."  

 The original EF2000 is reviewed elsewhere on GameSpot, so I'll just touch on its major features 
 here. It is a simulation of the Eurofighter 2000, a multi-role jet fighter commissioned by a group 
 of European nations, set to go online in the next century. It is a twin-engine, single-seater with 
 thirteen hard points packing a wide array of cutting-edge smart weapons, including the S-225 stealth 
 missile. The simulation of this extraordinary aircraft is by DID, who did TFX and is working on 
 an F-22 simulation. It is easily one of the finest recreations of jet flight for the PC.  

 Version 2.0 of this landmark game is the best-looking, most engrossing flight sim this side of Longbow. 
 Many of the crucial problems from the original have been fixed, from oddball damage assessment 
 to tepid wingman and enemy AI. Stability has been improved overall, though some sporadic crashes 
 are still experienced. The game now comes in both native Win95 and DOS modes, with online help 
 available in the Win95 mode. Full 3Dfx and Rendition-based 3D card support has been added to the 
 DOS modes, creating a flight experience like none ever seen.  

 The hallmark of EF2000 was its "look around" cockpit, which enabled you to look anywhere in the 
 cockpit to inspect instruments or check your six. The problem with this was that it slowed down 
 the gameplay, and many instruments were not very readable at the old resolution. The 3D card support 
 smoothes these bumps and provides an interactive cockpit that is easy to look at and use. The 3D 
 enhancements are most noticeable in the terrain graphics and special effects, which are stunning. 
 You could spend hours just flying around the landscape looking at the scenery.  

 A more substantial change to the gameplay comes in the highly expanded tactical mission-planning 
 mode. The campaign in the original EF2000 was already a leading edge dynamic system that created 
 new missions on a constantly updated battlefield. With a new editing utility, you now have complete 
 control over every element of the air war in this campaign. You can set the composition and loadout 
 of the strike force, designate mission types, set waypoints and even altitude, and assign the individual 
 targets for each group. A 3D image shows each target in a location, from buildings to units. You 
 don't even need to fly the missions - you can just be an air commander. This is what simulations 
 have been building to: unprecedented control over the battlefield.  

 More enhancements add further to the value of the package. A quick custom-dogfight builder has been 
 included. Modem and serial connections have been added. Friendly and enemy AI is better. Weapons 
 and aircraft performance envelopes have been completely overhauled. EF2000 is an embarrassment 
 of riches. Realistic, good-looking, customizable, and complex, it reaches heights flight enthusiasts 
 only dream of.
