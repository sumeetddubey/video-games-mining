:::Review:::
It's little more than a cosmetic overhaul to an already classic product. 

 Over the years, rival software publishers have tried to steal the thunder from Mindscape's Chessmaster 
 series in a lot of inventive ways. Electronic Arts turned to the hugely popular Garry Kasparov 
 (Kasparov's Gambit) ; now-defunct Capstone focused on "neural network technology" and an AI that 
 was supposed to learn from mistakes (Grandmaster Chess) ; Interplay tried everything from animated 
 fantasy figures (Battle Chess) to getting the endorsement of the United States Chess Federation 
 (USCF Chess) ; and even using the name of the most famous figure of modern chess didn't help Mission 
 Studios (Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess) .  

 But the Chessmaster shrugged off these parries and thrusts as easily as a grandmaster humbles an 
 A-class player, until finally there was only one last opponent: himself. Once you've crammed everything 
 you can think of into an interactive chess program and then wrapped it all in a clean, elegant 
 interface, there just aren't too many ways to make the next version more attractive to the target 
 market: chess players ranging from rank novices all the way up to low-level national masters.  
 

 Mindscape's answer to this dilemma wasn't simply to add more games to the program's already immense 
 database (which it did) or create a better method for evaluating players' approximate ratings (which 
 it also did) . Instead, it chose to give the game a face-lift - and the results are at once satisfying 
 and disquieting.  

 At first glance, it looks as though the cosmetic changes were pretty drastic. In place of the spartan 
 pull-down menus of previous Chessmaster games is a "frames" interface featuring readily available 
 icons along the left side of the screen that take you to the program's seven main components. At 
 any point during play, you can immediately access the game room (for unrated games) , the classroom 
 (tutorials, drills, puzzles, ratings exam, and Josh Waitzkin's games) , the tournament hall (rated 
 games against computer and human opponents) , the library (classic games, openings database, and 
 chess glossary) , kids room (with features for younger players) , database (a mind-boggling array 
 of move variations) , and Chessmaster Live (for multiplayer games) . Click on one of these icons, 
 and in addition to the main window featuring a chessboard for play or a database for study, you 
 also get a "shortcuts" menu to make it easier to access features within that particular component 
 of the game.  

 Mindscape is clearly trying to get users into the online mindset with this new interface, but I 
 actually found it less efficient than before: The shortcuts window takes up space that could have 
 been used for more important windows such as chess clocks or captured pieces. Besides, you can 
 still access all the functions from the old pull-down menus at the top of the screen. And the backgrounds 
 that someone apparently thought would liven up the presentation - blue-tinged montages of chess-related 
 photos - just make things look ugly. Even the chessboards and pieces, impeccable in all previous 
 incarnations, look worse because of the addition of this extra glitz.  

 The only other big change is the beefed-up emphasis on children's chess. Josh Waitzkin (subject 
 of the book and movie Searching for Bobby Fischer) is the host, and his easygoing demeanor is sure 
 to make the sometimes-intimidating world of chess seem a lot more inviting for younger players. 
 But beyond that, about the only substantive things that differentiate the kids room from the standard 
 classroom are the kid-friendly boards and pieces and the allotment of "Master Class" points. The 
 manuals says these are "similar to gold stars that you often get in school when you do well on 
 a test, or when you help the teacher clean the white board after class."  

 Chessmaster 7000 now features a full suite of multiplayer options - LAN, modem, and TCP/IP - along 
 with Mplayer support, but unfortunately no sort of matching service is provided for players to 
 exchange TCP/IP addresses for Net play or phone numbers for modem connections. That wouldn't be 
 a problem if Mplayer had a more active Chessmaster 7000 community, but when I logged in three nights 
 in a row, four was the maximum number of players I found - and none of them seemed to be in the 
 mood for playing or chatting.  

 The big questions are these: Should you buy Chessmaster 7000 if you don't have a chess program? 
 And should 6000 owners spend the $19.95 to upgrade? If you already have Chessmaster 6000 and don't 
 have a kid who wants to learn the intricate game of chess using dinosaur pieces, I can't really 
 recommend spending money for what's little more than a cosmetic overhaul to an already classic 
 product. And you may even find that you prefer Chessmaster 6000's clean and simple interface to 
 this update.

Review:  Chessmaster 3000 is yet another chess game for the pc, we all know chess and we have all tried 
 to play chess at some point.
  The good thing in chessmaster 3000 is the tutorial. it will teach chess in such a way that everyone 
 will understand it (but who dosnt already know chess?)
  
  The game has not only the normal chess peices, you can choose whatever you want as your peices, 
 should it be dinosours? metal? just choose :) but it dosnt do anything special to the game though.
 
  
  also, the board can also be changed... 3d or 2d overview
  
  What about the enemies then?
  well... chess noobies should try to beat the monkey. he just understands 
 how the peices move around. but thats it. if your a chess master try to beat the chessmaster... 
 he is very hard.
  
  overall:
  get it if you love chess or would like to learn it.
  
  DO NOT GET IT if you never really liked chess... you will get more from just throwing money out 
 of the window

Review:  ChessMaster is simply the best game of chess, you can buy. It offers all levels of competition 
 for everyone, from beginner to Expert.
  
  Its not just a matter of picking your skill level (easy, medium, hard) . No, you actually get to 
 pick an artifical person to play against. You can play against an average 10 year old child, named 
 Billy. Or you can play against one of the best players in the world. Each Computer player has their 
 own style and schemes. Some players are aggressive, some are prone to make the same mistake over 
 and over, they act like real people (including mistakes) .
  
  The developers really have created a good set of artifical personalities to play against. And you 
 can play against them in a single match, or in tournaments. In additions, the game keeps score. 
 Every players has a score (example: 750 is average) . Winning a match will increase your score, 
 and losing a match will decrease your score. So you always have a ranking to judge your skill by. 
 And your oppenents are also listed by skill level, so you will know which players you should be 
 playing against. (beating a much weaker oppenent will not help your score. You have to move up 
 to harder opponents, if you want to continue increasing your skill ranking) .
  
  The computer will help you (if you need it) with hints and training.
  
  So, Chessmaster 7000 
 offers a good game of chess. The AI is just fine. The problem with the game is the presentation. 
 Your choice of 3D and 2D chess boards is very limited. And none of them seems to give the feel 
 of a real chess board. And many of the chess pieces are vague, and you might confuse your pieces 
 (with some of the sets) . You can not adjust the angle that you view the board from, so if you dont 
 like the default viewing angle... TOUGH!
  
  And on a technical note: The game frequently crashed, back to the desktop.

Review:  Chessmaster 7000 is, as is obvious, a chess game. The learning curve will first depend on whether 
 you know how to play chess, then how much you know. The game offers an extensive tutorial from 
 the most basic starting lessons to advanced strategies and theroies that even an expert can learn 
 from.
  
  That is really the selling point of the game, the amount of information packed in. Everything else 
 is just allright. Graphics are all right. There are a few different boards and pieces to use but 
 none of them are really spectacular. Sound is also the same. There are a few different game types 
 to play, from just a single game to tournaments, all of which keep track of your stats.
  
  As I said, there is alot of information provided. There's a whole help index of chess definintions, 
 opening moves, general strategies, you name it. There's also a huge database of legendary games, 
 wether just interesting or proving a point, that you can watch the computer play out. There's also 
 numerous challenges, such as finding the check mate in one move or two, that you can undertake 
 to see how your skills are improving.
  
  If information is what you like, this is the chess game to get.
