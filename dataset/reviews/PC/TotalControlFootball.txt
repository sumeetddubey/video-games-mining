I'm not sure if there was a demand for it, but here it is: a football simulation for pigskin fans

 I'm not sure if there was a demand for it, but here it is: a football simulation for pigskin fans 
 who love micromanagement. It's called Total Control Football, and in this instance the name really 
 says it all: You're in charge of almost every aspect of running a National Football League franchise, 
 from setting ticket prices to hiring equipment trainers. About the only things you can't do in 
 this new football sim from Philips Media is hire attorneys for players who've run afoul of the 
 law or set up questionable endorsements with soft-drink companies.  

 The task before you is almost overwhelming, mainly because you're actually taking on the roles of 
 both head coach and general manager. If you choose to start a Custom League (read: fictional players) , 
 the game opens on March 1, giving you nearly six weeks to get your house in order and scout potential 
 draft prospects. Choose the Default League (read: real NFL players and rosters) , and the draft's 
 a done deal; since you wouldn't want to fire an assistant only four weeks before the season opens, 
 about the only thing you can do is trade players or sign free agents. (Oddly enough, in a game 
 as thorough as this, when it comes to player acquisitions, there's no waiver wire where you can 
 pick up cast-off role players.)  

 Folks, this is the other side of football - the dollars and cents side, where you have to sign quality 
 players that fit your offensive and defensive schemes but still stay beneath the salary cap. And 
 that's not all: You've got to hire and fire offensive and defensive coaches, decide on equipment 
 trainers, hire scouts to cover both the college and pro ranks, set ticket prices, build luxury 
 boxes, choose orthopedic surgeons... the list goes on and on.  

 But wait - there's more. If you like, you can go in and actually determine the makeup of offensive 
 and defensive sets, formulate game plans based on your opponents' tendencies in given situations, 
 and decide whether or not you should override your coaches' decisions once game time comes around 
 and it's all on the line.  

 Yes, it's pretty daunting stuff. But the truth is that the job you must tackle in TCF is probably 
 harder than if you had the gig in real life, mainly because you're more or less doing all this 
 stuff all by your lonesome. A real GM can tell his assistants, coaches, and various gofers to round 
 up and organize a mind-boggling amount of information and present a concise report outlining the 
 best options, but in Total Control Football almost all of this work is laid on your desk.  

 Sure, you can delegate draft picks and roster cuts to the coaches you've hired, but that's a drop 
 in the bucket compared to your workload. Draft picks and free agents? You have to negotiate salaries 
 for each and every one, a process that's fun at first but quickly becomes mundane and boring. How 
 do you know which free agents to go after? By reading the stats and bios on every single one yourself. 
 It would make things much simpler if your coaches and scouts would at least rank these guys based 
 on the impact a given player would have on your chances of success next season. Without your assistants 
 pointing you toward players you want and need, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the task of looking 
 at reams of ratings and player bios - which is made even more difficult by the fact that players 
 are rated in categories that don't even relate to their position. Who needs to see the pass-blocking 
 rating for a free safety, or the kicking accuracy of a wide receiver? Another problem is the lack 
 of true stats for players; all you get are numeric ratings, rather than hard numbers such as how 
 many picks a defensive back made or the yards-per-carry average for a running back.  

 This same lack of depth carries over into the regular season. The stats you can view once the season 
 starts are woefully inadequate, with no numbers for interceptions or TDs thrown by quarterbacks, 
 yards-per-pass attempt/completion, fumbles by running backs, yards-per-carry - it's a statistician's 
 nightmare. While it's true that football isn't nearly as stat-oriented as baseball, the numbers 
 are still a good indication of problem areas and a pointer to good and bad performers.  

 Once the season starts (or if you choose to play an exhibition game) , you have the option of controlling 
 the players on the field - but here again TCF is plagued by niggling problems. If you truly want 
 to play the role of coach by calling the plays and letting the computer carry them out, you're 
 out of luck: If you assign CPU control to the players, play-calling is automatically assigned to 
 your offensive or defensive coach. Amazingly, there's no option for any kind of head-to-head play, 
 an omission that automatically drops this title several notches behind the competition. The play-by-play 
 is choppy and uninspired, especially Matt Millen's color commentary. He's not my favorite color 
 commentator, but this game does Millen a real disservice - his slow, muffled speech reminds me 
 of my attempts to talk my dentist after a few huffs of nitrous oxide.   

 Convert a point-after attempt, and the announcer says "no good!" before announcing the score that 
 contradicts what he just said. Almost every PC gamer is accustomed to hitting the ESC key to stop 
 the action, but do it in TCF and you're rudely kicked out to the desktop or DOS with absolutely 
 no warning (this applies to the GM/coaching screens, too) . There's no way to jump and catch a deflected 
 ball; opponents' punts are almost always coffin-corner kicks; and penalties (except by encroachment 
 by a human-controlled player) are practically non-existent.  

 There are good things about the on-field action. Running the ball, for instance, is a true joy because 
 you can actually see holes develop in the defensive line which you can break through for daylight 
 and big gains. Another nice feature is that wide receivers aren't always caught from behind, as 
 they are in Madden NFL 97. Hit a wideout in this game, and if he has a couple of yards on the cornerback 
 then he's going to stay in front of him most of the time, a realistic touch I really appreciate. 
 And your coaches do perform as you expect them - when I overrode my defensive coach's suggestions 
 I was nearly always burned.  

 But on the whole, the on-field action isn't going to impress too many gamers, and the micromanagement 
 duties will overwhelm newbies and players more interested in the X's and O's than the red and the 
 black in the ledger. That's not to say Total Control Football is a failure; it's actually pretty 
 impressive that so much stuff has been crammed into a single product. The only question is whether 
 you want to tackle the minutiae with so little help from the program. If you do, you probably won't 
 be too perturbed by the shortcomings of the action game, and will revel in the work involved in 
 the front office; if you don't, you already know this game's not for you.
