:::Review:::
Because of the game's, um, different interface, the two 3D views are interesting in application 
 but almost useless in practice. 

 According to the publisher's propaganda, Armor Command breaks away from standard real-time strategy 
 game because of the "revolutionary intuitive interface," a "new brand of information warfare," 
 with "multi-perspective design," 3D card support, and four-player network games. Plus the game 
 is from the codesigner of X-Wing and TIE Fighter. Sounds like a pretty appealing package, right? 
 Unfortunately, many of these additions don't necessarily make Armor Command a better game.   

 
 The story is pretty straightforward. Earth is at war with an alien civilization called the Vrass, 
 intent on destruction. Fleets from each race battle for a nebula full of planets. Large fleets 
 cannot easily maneuver this nebula, so battles for each of the resource-rich planets must take 
 place on the ground. You can play either the United Terran Federation or the Vrass Empire, each 
 with its own selection of training missions and Tour of Duty campaign (22 missions per side) . Full-motion 
 cutscenes are interspersed between the various missions, forming a more coherent and interesting 
 plot.  

 First off, Armor Command is a real-time strategy game with some interesting twists and turns. It 
 utilizes 3D acceleration through Direct3D (or other in-game software routines) and has direct support 
 for a number of 3D cards. The graphics should be pretty familiar to you: great textures, multicolored 
 source lighting, and so on, similar in quality to other recent Direct3D games. Unlike other real-time 
 strategy games, Armor Command offers a "floating camera" of sorts, including four different points 
 of view: a top-down high view (what most real-time strategy players are used to) , top-down close 
 view (zoomed in) , main low-angle 3D view, and high-angle 3D view. The 3D views are supposed to 
 make the game unique, offering a more down-to-earth and personal point of view. Because of the 
 game's, um, different interface (see below) , the two 3D views are interesting in application but 
 almost useless in practice.  

 The problem is that Armor Command requires both the mouse and keyboard, and proficient use of both 
 is required in order to do anything useful. A left-mouse click will set a path for the target to 
 move to, a right-mouse click will select the current target. Sounds simple? Well, a control/left-click 
 will allow you to add waypoints, a shift/right-click will select that vehicle for control, and 
 a shift/left-click will split or join vehicles into the current group. That's not too bad, but 
 the problem is everything you have to do with the keyboard. Controlling your resources and building 
 strategies are done only through a bevy of keyboard commands. You can't jump to different locations 
 on the overhead map with the mouse.   

 The problem is exacerbated in the 3D view, because the camera angle is determined by the cursor 
 that directs your vehicles. If you want to look behind you, you have to slowly scroll the view 
 around with the mouse. If the designers had done things the other way around, say used the mouse 
 for the interface/command functions and the keyboard for helping scroll around the map (as in Myth: 
 the Fallen Lords) , Armor Command would have been tremendously better.   

 Some of the other features work a little better; radar and vehicles provide information on targets 
 up to a certain range - a bit beyond that range the enemy units appear as symbols so you don't 
 know what type they are. Certain constructs like mining vehicles and fixed gun batteries can be 
 packed up and easily moved. While the two sides look pretty different, there isn't much diversity 
 in the types of units available, so they fight pretty similarly. The artificial intelligence is 
 about average for a real-time strategy game.  

 So let's go back to the main question: Is it all worth it? Well, yes and no. The 3D view looks nice 
 for a few minutes but is discarded for practicality's sake. There are multiplayer modem and LAN 
 games to add some spice to the 40-plus or so missions, but that's about it as far as replayability 
 goes. Armor Command in many ways is no different from a generic real-time strategy game: direct 
 troops, destroy the enemy, develop your base of operations, exploit resources, and move on to the 
 next scenario. If you're new to the real-time genre or you're just completely addicted to them, 
 it might be a nice distraction from the standard fare. But veteran real-time strategy players will 
 not find much to impress them.

Review:  This was my very first game that i played on AMD 500 processor back in those days this game had 
 everything. Player can play both sides close to 50 missions. Can change the map to 3 views and 
 also to a 3rd person view. As a 1998 game AI programming was extremely good. this game provides 
 various vehicles, like air, ground attacks &amp; ground defense.
  also units can be grouped &amp; can sell (send back to the mother-ship)
  any unit that you dont 
 want in the battlefield. This game also had a good story line compared to the other games back 
 in those days.
