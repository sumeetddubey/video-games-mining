Fair Strike isn't all bad, but it buckles under the weight of many problems. 

  There are times when trying to play Fair Strike: Anti-Terror Helicopter Corps feels like the gaming 
 equivalent of having bamboo slivers shoved under your fingernails. It's relatively easy to live 
 with the game's silly title, weak background story, and simple combat; it's much harder to accept 
 its control problems, choppy frame rates, bugs, bland graphics, and long load times, among other 
 issues. In theory, Fair Strike is a neat game. After all, it's not often that you see a modern 
 helicopter game that boasts six flyable choppers, sim and arcade modes, co-op play, and more. But 
 with so many major flaws, any of the game's strengths are hard to find and appreciate for any length 
 of time.  

          One of Fair Strike's only highlights: lots of destruction.     

  Fair Strike plays out in the year 2005, pitting some vague international task force against global 
 terrorist threats. Despite the halfhearted introduction in the manual and the clumsy cutscenes, 
 you don't get any feeling of fighting real enemies in the real world -- you just head from one navigation 
 point to the next, blowing stuff up. There's little radio chatter or other elements to draw you 
 into the gameworld or to make you feel like a real pilot on a real mission.  

  That same generic feel applies to the game's six flyable choppers: the AH-64A Apache, RAH-66 Comanche, 
 PAH-2 Tiger, Ka-50 Black Shark, Ka-52 Alligator, and Ka-58 Black Ghost. The choppers look different 
 and can carry different weapon loadouts, but the controls and handling are roughly the same for 
 all of them. Their cockpit panels are mostly window dressing with no interactivity and limited 
 utility. For instance, many of the gauges are only labeled in Russian.  

  The game doesn't even bother to give you any background information or stats for each helicopter. 
 In fact, a lack of information is one of Fair Strike's biggest failings. The skimpy manual is inadequate, 
 and you don't get any tutorials. This all makes learning the game a chore instead of a joy. You'll 
 be at an even bigger disadvantage if you're unfamiliar with military acronyms or the names and 
 functions of a real helicopter's controls since there are no glossary or explanations.  

  Controls prove to be another of Fair Strike's big problems. Despite repeated efforts, we could 
 never get the game to accept our desired control configurations for our joystick -- a popular Logitech 
 model, no less. We eventually had to give up and opt for mouse control, which ultimately proved 
 easier but less immersive. We also ended up playing the game mostly in arcade mode instead of the 
 so-called simulation mode since the latter just added a few extra frustrations instead of a palpably 
 greater sense of realism, detail, and immersion.  

  Once you actually get the controls set up more or less how you want them and then puzzle the game 
 out, Fair Strike proves to be a fairly bland, mediocre experience. You can outfit your choppers 
 with different weapons and select from different paint schemes, but flying the helos is too easy 
 to be interesting, and combat is ultimately a simplified point-and-click affair in sim and arcade 
 mode alike. The novelty of firing off a salvo of rockets at an antiaircraft battery wears thin 
 after the first or second go. Weapons do have a few different modes and options, but the inadequate 
 instruction will leave you to figure those out on your own.  

  The problems don't end there. You'll be flying with wingmen, but they add little to the game. You 
 can issue a few simple orders, but the radio message menu screen can disappear before you've finished 
 reading the options, and your wingmen sometimes have a hard time following directions well, anyway. 
 It's not even clear what some orders do: When issuing a "patrol" order, exactly how and where will 
 your wingman patrol? On top of that, mission goals can be unclear or misleading, sending you on 
 wild goose chases or telling you to wipe out certain buildings, but not others, without making 
 it clear as to which building should be demolished and which should be left untouched. The missions 
 can last a long time, too, and if you do everything right but get killed near the end, you'll have 
 to start from scratch since there's no way to save a mission in progress.  

  Even bigger problems arise on the technical side of things. If Fair Strike doesn't freeze up or 
 crash first, it can become so choppy that it is unplayable. Patching the game and lowering the 
 graphics detail settings provided only minor relief. Sleep-inducing loading screens add insult 
 to injury.  

           Bland terrain is the order of the day.     

  The game's presentation doesn't have much going for it, either. The music, done in the style of 
 a Tom Clancy game or movie soundtrack, adds some much-needed ambience, but weapon and rotor sounds 
 are mostly uninspiring and lack real oomph. Voice-overs don't properly synch up with the subtitles 
 and images during the cutscenes, and they suffer from some mispronunciations and hokey accents. 
 The graphics feature some nice cloud cover and helicopter models, but the terrain looks sparse, 
 bland, and dated even when the graphics detail sliders are maxed out. At least you'll see some 
 dramatic little touches like trees catching on fire from nearby explosions.  

  Fair Strike isn't all bad. Its 30 missions are reasonably diverse, offering a decent bang for the 
 buck. It's a shame that the game buckles under the weight of so many problems, though. At its best, 
 Fair Strike is merely a mediocre, uninspired action game. At its worst, it's more punishment than 
 entertainment.
