:::Review:::
While the game has its merits, it really doesn't have the firepower necessary to make an impact 
 in the PC shooter market. 

 Fur Fighters is the PC port of a game released for the Dreamcast console earlier this year. It's 
 a cutesy third-person shooter that pits a band of heroic stuffed animals against the villainous 
 General Viggo and his army of Stupid Bears. While the game has its merits, it really doesn't have 
 the firepower necessary to make an impact in the PC shooter market.   

  The game begins with General Viggo - who appears to be a cougar or some similar creature - kidnapping 
 all of the babies from a small village. This village is the home of the Fur Fighters, a small group 
 of stuffed animals that apparently have military training. Viggo plans to take over the world, 
 and he doesn't want the Fur Fighters interfering, so he hopes to keep the babies hostage to force 
 the Fur Fighters to stand down until his plans for global domination are realized. It wouldn't 
 be much of a game if his scheme worked, so you take control of a Fur Fighter and begin the two-pronged 
 quest: Save the babies, and defeat General Viggo.   

  The Fur Fighters team includes six members: Roofs the dog, Chang the fox, Juliette the cat, Rico 
 the penguin, Bungalow the dim-witted kangaroo, and Tweek the dragon. Under the supervision of General 
 Bristol the walrus, you must guide all of these creatures during the course of the game. Much like 
 in the console game Donkey Kong 64, certain areas of Fur Fighters are only accessible by certain 
 members of the team. So when you need to reach a particularly high place, you'll rely on Bungalow's 
 jumping skill. Or when you need to swim underwater you'll rely on Rico. At key points in the game's 
 30 levels, teleporters let you switch the team member you control. Each teleporter is set up for 
 a specific character, so if you enter an area where you need Juliette's climbing ability, a teleporter 
 for her will be somewhere nearby.   

  The gameplay itself is a cross between a typical shooter and a platform game. You'll run into plenty 
 of enemies to shoot, and you have access to more than 20 weapons with which to shoot them. However, 
 most of the time, instead of just fighting you'll be picking up power-ups and tokens that help 
 unlock additional levels of the game. Having to go out of your way to open later levels becomes 
 fairly tedious early on, especially when you have to follow an otherwise silly path - such as going 
 through countless levels of a fire escape - to track down some tokens. Of course, you'll also be 
 spending your time trying to find the missing babies, which can only be rescued by the team member 
 that matches their species. So when you stumble across a puppy, you need to control Roofus to free 
 the little tyke.   

  The combat is not particularly difficult in Fur Fighters, so long as you know how to strafe. The 
 enemies will dodge a rocket every once in a while and roll out of the way, but overall the enemies 
 are not very crafty. Veterans of shooters will have little difficulty mowing down the meddlesome 
 bears while searching for babies and tokens.   

  The most impressive aspect of Fur Fighters is also one of its downfalls: the level design. The 
 maps for each level are nicely arranged and quite creative. The use of multiple floors, secret 
 areas, and scripted cinematic events is quite effective throughout the game. Unfortunately, the 
 colors and textures used in most areas range from garish to just plain ugly. Some subtle effects 
 are well done, such as the water in the beginning village and the snowfall in New Quack City, but 
 the overall look of the game is not likely to impress you.   

  Nor is the multiplayer mode, despite its support for up to 16 players. Fur Fighters can be played 
 over a LAN or the Internet (via GameSpy Arcade or direct links) but offers nothing particularly 
 new or exciting in terms of multiplayer gameplay, which was much more noteworthy on the Dreamcast. 
   

  Other problems with the game include its annoying use of gibberish in place of what should be actual 
 dialogue exchanged during the in-game cinematics. Instead of real voice-overs, you'll be subjected 
 to strings of silly noises that are presumably supposed to be humorous. They might seem that way 
 at first, but the charm will probably wear off before the opening movie is finished.   

  Fur Fighters is a harmless, uninspired addition to the many PC action games released this year. 
 The game can often be humorous, especially if you pay attention to the details in the scenery and 
 the minigames you'll occasionally come across - but it still isn't especially exciting. And considering 
 its tough competition in the genre, these sorts of details won't be enough to win over too many 
 players.

Review:  There are other shooters but what stops this game from being good just because there are better 
 ones? Nothing this is an sweet game. The story is good, the guns are nice, and the levels are sick! 
 I think this is a good game and now (7/05) the rice is great. I had the DC version and that one 
 is just as great but I sold my DC. I saw this 1 for a good price and picked up. It is funny, fun, 
 and overall a good game. If u want a fun shooter instead of a really serious 1 this is for u! If 
 your in the store just get it! The multiplayer is hard to get into because there is no 1 playing. 
 You should change that
