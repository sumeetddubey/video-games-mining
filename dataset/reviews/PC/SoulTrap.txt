:::Review:::
SoulTrap's innovative gameplay, large levels, and seemingly endless variety show great potential. 
 

 Based on a promising concept, Microforum's SoulTrap attempts to incorporate three-dimensional movement 
 into a traditional 2-D platform game. Unfortunately, a few fundamental flaws leave this promise 
 largely unfulfilled.   

 As was the case in Sega's Bug!, much of SoulTrap's gameplay revolves around giant floating "mazes" 
 in the sky. These polygonal platforms are home to all manner of strange traps, creatures and puzzles 
 - each of which represents the fears and anxieties harbored by your character, Malcolm, in the 
 real world. It is your job to guide Malcolm across these lofty bridges, outwitting and outshooting 
 any obstacles that try to block your path.  

 Unlike the platforms in Bug!, there are no guardrails or mystic forces to prevent you from taking 
 a plunge off the side. While this convention allows great freedom of movement, it also highlights 
 a conceptual flaw within the game itself: Namely, the act of guiding Malcolm along the narrow platforms 
 is too difficult - and too unforgiving - to be fun.   

 Contributing to this problem is SoulTrap's sensitive control scheme which makes maneuvering much 
 more difficult than it is entertaining. While standard joystick support is included, a mouse/keyboard 
 combination gives players the greatest control over both the camera angle and the onscreen character. 
 Even with this set-up, however, a simple tap on the directional key can send your character on 
 a suicidal path. Fortunately, SoulTrapallows you to save and restore from any point within a level. 
 As a result, an untimely demise can be remedied with a "restore game" cheat. (Of course, had Microforum 
 simply placed guardrails on the walkways, cheating would not be necessary.)  

 Although the polygonal graphics in SoulTrapfall short of the standards set by Id's Quake, they are 
 more than adequate for the task at hand. Each of the 11 levels has its own set of objects and textures 
 that comprise a central theme (such as the Gothic World, Water World, etc.) . This seemingly endless 
 variety prevents the game from ever becoming visually stale - despite the rather primitive nature 
 of the polygons themselves.   

 In conclusion, Microforum's SoulTrap is the best title to come from the Canadian publisher in a 
 long time. Its innovative gameplay, large levels, and seemingly endless variety show great potential. 
 Unfortunately, the sheer difficulty of simply staying atop the hovering platforms condemns this 
 platformer to mediocrity.
