:::Review:::
Dig Dug Deeper's lack of difficulty, levels, and extra features make it difficult to recommend to 
 even the most ardent fan. 

  Remakes of classic games usually take one of two routes. One route involves slightly changed gameplay 
 mixed in with revamped graphics, while the other route is just a graphical overhaul of the original. 
 Infogrames chose to take the former route with its remake of Dig Dug named Dig Dug Deeper, which 
 isn't necessarily for fans of the original arcade game. A number of factors, including a lack of 
 difficulty and a relatively small number of levels, should make you think twice before making a 
 purchase. 
 
 Dig Dug Deeper has only one single-player gameplay mode that's very similar to the original arcade 
 game -- there are no multiplayer modes or secondary modes that offer variations on the main game. 
 This single mode contains six worlds, and with the exception of the last level, each is divided 
 into several substages, which are divided even further into individual digging areas. Other than 
 the obvious visual changes, the only substantial difference between the levels in the original 
 game and those in Dig Dug Deeper is that Deeper's stages have a miniscule overland map that essentially 
 serves as a transition point between underground areas and nothing more. So at the beginning of 
 every stage, you'll start at the overland map and wait a second or two before a pooka -- one of the 
 game's enemies -- erupts from one of several holes visible on the surface. After it leaps out and 
 dives back down into its hole, you give chase and enter the underground digging area where the 
 pooka and the rest of its cohorts are located.
 
 In the original Dig Dug, pookas and fygars could be disposed of in a few different ways, and that 
 remains true in Dig Dug Deeper. As you dig through the underground area and encounter enemies, 
 you can either use Dig Dug's trusty drill or use objects found within the environment -- rocks, poisonous 
 gas, and lava can all be used to kill the enemies if you use a little strategy in the way you dig. 
 Using any of these objects usually results in more points and different kinds of power-ups that 
 give Dig Dug additional speed or drill power. This creates a little extra incentive to be an inventive 
 digger, but most players will probably plow through the levels using Dig Dug's regular "pump" attack. 
 In the end, Dig Dug Deeper's core gameplay is still basically the same as that of the original 
 Dig Dug, which may not be a bad thing for hard-core fans of the original arcade game. But those 
 looking for a game offering a progression in the Dig Dug style of gameplay will probably be disappointed.
 
 
 Even if you're a huge fan of the original game, Dig Dug Deeper's lack of difficulty is still a problem. 
 Most players should be able to get through all six of the game's worlds within a matter of hours 
 on the normal difficulty setting with the default number of lives, but increasing the game's difficulty 
 level to hard only raises the speed at which pookas and fygars run and float through the underground 
 world, so it's not really that much more difficult -- especially if you've already played through 
 the game. 
 
 In fact, Dig Dug Deeper's spotty control is really the only thing that makes the game at all difficult. 
 Unfortunately, Dig Dug is incapable of making sharp or precise turns, so more often than not, you'll 
 run right into fygars, pookas, and natural obstacles and die completely by accident, rather than 
 have your enemies successfully trap you. It's frustrating, especially in the later levels, when 
 you're up against 10 or more enemies.
 
 While this new game's graphics have been revamped to take advantage of 3D hardware, Dig Dug Deeper 
 still looks like it was developed sometime around 1997. The soundtrack offers nothing particularly 
 noteworthy, except for one segment in particular that sounds like some sort of demented canary 
 chirping. In addition, Dig Dug Deeper's relative lack of difficulty, levels, and complete lack 
 of extra modes and features make it difficult to recommend to even the most ardent Dig Dug fan.
