:::Review:::
All the components for a great game are here, but it just doesn't mesh. 

 Shadows of the Empire tells a substory in the Star Wars universe, taking place during and after 
 The Empire Strikes Back. From the get-go, Shadows was planned as a cross-media item. It started 
 out as simply a book, but shortly after that a soundtrack was released. As strange as a soundtrack 
 for a book sounded, it all began to make sense when the game was released on the Nintendo 64 late 
 last year. The game faired well on the software-starved Nintendo system, and now it's available 
 for the PC.  

 The gameplay in Shadows varies. The first level puts you, as Dash Rendar, behind the joystick of 
 a snowspeeder, protecting the Rebel's escape from Hoth by shooting probe droids, AT-STs, and of 
 course, AT-ATs. This level is absolutely incredible in every way, from blowing up the smaller droids 
 with laser fire to tripping up AT-ATs with tow cables. It's really too bad that the majority of 
 the game is filled with drab first-person (or Tomb Raider-style third-person, depending on your 
 preference) levels, which are filled with lackluster design, boring enemies, and poor aiming control. 
 Most of the levels involve running somewhere, going up a few elevators, blasting a storm trooper 
 or four, crawling through some sort of ventilation duct, shooting a couple of droids, then flipping 
 a switch or running through a door that either ends the level or brings on a silly boss, all of 
 which are ridiculously easy to beat. The only one that gave me any trouble was Boba Fett's Slave-1, 
 which was easily dispatched once I woke up enough to realize that it, like almost every other boss, 
 was totally fooled by circle-strafing. Other levels place you in the gun turrets of Rendar's ship, 
 the Outrider. In these levels you must shoot TIE Fighters, Bombers, and other craft. The graphics 
 here are great, but again, it's little more than a dull shooting gallery.  

 Graphically, Shadows of the Empire looks very nice, which isn't much of a surprise, seeing as how 
 it requires a Direct3D compatible card to run. Everything from the overly repetitive wall textures 
 to the dumb look on Dash's face is rendered perfectly. The soundtrack is your typical Star Wars-type 
 music, and the sound effects are nicely done, including speech that was unavailable on the N64 
 version.  

 All in all, this version of Shadows is much improved over the original N64 game, with the possible 
 exception of control. The N64's analog stick was perfectly suited for the game, but PC players 
 with digital pads will occasionally have trouble drawing a bead on targets. All the components 
 for a great game are here, but it just doesn't mesh. Unless you really want to take on the AT-ATs, 
 your best bet is to save your money for the obviously better (and more focused) Jedi Knight.

Review:  I first played this when it was originally released on N64. I recently re-read the "Shadows of 
 the Empire" book, so I decided I wanted to replay this. Having lost my N64 copy, I tried the PC 
 version and so far, it's been a decent port. The game always had a few camera and platforming quirks 
 that made it difficult, and the PC version maintains most of these, though some segments are a 
 bit more streamlined, like the sewers. A fun nostalgic romp for those of us who grew up on the 
 Rogue Squadron series for N64 or like the Shadows of the Empire saga.
  
  Apparently, this review is not sufficiently long, so I will say that I wish there had been more 
 development time devoted to improving the cut scenes for the PC version to make them have more 
 zazz.. That aside, a manually manipulative camera device would be nice to have as a keyboard option 
 for moments when the game does not set you up properly to perform a platforming task, like jumping 
 onto moving platforms whole shooting.

Review:  Back in the old days of Nintendo 64 this game was the one that kept me from the others until it 
 came out for the PC and I bought it 7 years later. 
  
  Shadows of the Empire is actually a Star Wars novel taking place between The Empire Strikes Back 
 and the Return of the Jedi. The novel also happened to be made into a game.
  
  Now these are the things that Game reviewing sites generally don't appreciate since 1. Apparently 
 everything back then was about jumping into cannons, shooting yourself and picking up oversized 
 bomb characters (Instant 9.0+!) even though the camera is pretty much the same and 2. Was Star 
 Wars really that big back then?
  
  This is before Episode I came out in theaters so I'm sure the idea of Star Wars games was getting 
 stale without a refreshing new introduction to the series. 
  
  Graphics-
  These graphics at the time were amazing. It was the first game to implement the Battle of Hoth 
 so well and make usage of the Snow Speeder's tow cables (without looking like complete butt) . The 
 laser animations were very well done and some of the levels were simply breathtaking. Beggars Canyon 
 was amazing, Hoth was amazing, the modeling of the Outrider and the Skyhook/Star Destroyer battle 
 was amazing. 
  
  Story- The story of the Black Sun and the chasing of Han Solo (when Boba captured him) was the 
 most immersive story ever for a Star Wars game. They fully included Dash Rendar in the story without 
 treating him like a piece of trash side character with a striking resemblance to Han. Nope. He 
 was his own pure character who had an excellent artist, because he was a likeable protagonist.
 
  
  Sound- Wow. I was so tired of terrible music coming from industrial grade Yamaha electronic keyboards 
 that sounded like they were purchased from Toys R Us. This was the first Star Wars game to make 
 use of the soundtrack. The actual music from the Star Wars movies. FUN FACT: The Shadows of the 
 Empire soundtrack was made for the novel. Which doesn't make much sense right? But the novel was 
 done so well they decided to throw in a soundtrack for it. George Lucas greatly liked this novel 
 and regretted not having seen the story for Shadows of the Empire first, otherwise he would have 
 made it a film.
  
  This game also takes tracks from the Shadows of the Empire OST and plays them during the times 
 that correspond to the book. It's flawless and innovative execution that does not deserve a piss 
 poor 5.6 anywhere remotely near it.
  
  Value- Incredible bang for your buck even at the time it was 40+ dollars. You could play this game 
 over and over because of the in-ship and out of ship levels it had. With a great story, fantastic 
 music and great speeder bike chases this is the Star Wars experience you are looking for if you 
 don't want to listen to Factor 5's terrible renditions of Star Wars music in the later Rogue Squadron 
 series.
  
  9.5

Review:  I remember playing this game 7 years ago... and I reinstalled it recently just to feel how it was 
 again...
  
  It's a nice game, has reasonable graphics for its time, classic star wars music and sound, nice 
 story and limited, but fun gameplay.
  
  10 levels (11 actually, including the 'bonus' level) with pretty distinct enviorments. Space, palaces, 
 hoth, ground stations, trains, space stations... and also, a lot of different ways to play the 
 game. On space, ground, etc.
  
  So, basically, it's an old-school game... offers good graphics, sound, gameplay for its time... 
 that is still fun to play nowadays.
  
  Uh I don't recommend anyone to buy this though, unless it's out there for really, REALLY low prices 
 ;)

Review:  I used to love this game, it was the first 3D computer game I owned and my father was even forced 
 to buy a 3D accelerator card (back when they were optional heh) . I remember liking the Hoth level, 
 the in-ship turret levels, and the speeder bike level.
  
  Graphically, this game used to be pretty beautiful (compared to its peers at the time) and for 
 something like this, you can't really compare it to the games today... at least graphically.
  
  Honestly I still like this game even though it's almost 10 years old. Wow I feel old typing 
 that. This game came out a decade ago? I'm gonna be dead before I know it at this rate.
  
  Anyways, despite its obvious flaws (namely the awful horrible and terrible controls) I still love 
 this game.
  
  The rating I gave it is based more on how I would've had I written this review 10 years ago.
