:::Review:::
In his latest project, Torin's Passage, Lowe has cast aside the bathroom humor and created a game 
 suitable for adventurers both young and old. 

 Sierra has been perfecting their brand of computer adventure games for over fifteen years, and game 
 designer Al Lowe has been a major part of that evolution. His ribald Softporn Adventure, re-made 
 into Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards, was religiously played by every teenager 
 with access to a computer. In his latest project, Torin's Passage, Lowe has cast aside the bathroom 
 humor and created a game suitable for adventurers both young and old.  

 The script tries to stray from Lowe's usual vulgar jokes, but still includes playfully overstated 
 poo and hemorrhoid mentions. And while it's thankfully devoid of his usual sexist fare, you should 
 be prepared for a lot of corny humor mixed in with a few clever lines.  

 Although Lowe maintained control of the writing and game design, he employed over forty specialized 
 artists to create the game's visual artwork, music and sound effects, and it shows. Every scene 
 in this adventure is beautifully crafted using a hybrid of hand-drawn cell animation, oil paint 
 backgrounds, 3-D rendered objects, and the less fluid computer-generated art. While this may sound 
 hodgepodge and gaudy, the overall effect is harmonious. Digital music, sound effects, and speech 
 are flawless on a fast machine, but a major slowdown will occur below 75MHZ.   

 The puzzles, and there are plenty, come in two varieties: contextual (place gum on stick, use stick 
 to pick up coin from grate) and exploratory (push the red button and the bridge lowers halfway, 
 the green one makes it raise halfway) . In an interesting (and pleasing) development, Sierra included 
 on-line hints for all of the game's puzzles. This means no more long-distance calls to a hint-line 
 or frustrating weeks of being stuck in the same place, but wanting to continue the game. Veteran 
 adventurers might weave their way through the game's difficult logic puzzles, but novices will 
 definitely need to use the on-line hints. Though this game is aimed at a younger audience, it may 
 be too difficult for all but gifted children. Even so, the storyline and characters should keep 
 the young ones enthralled while older siblings or parents wrestle with the puzzles. A fine family 
 play.

Review:  brilliant story and voice acting. really immersive, graphics are rich and colourful, really draws 
 you into the world and the story. i remember spending months as a kid exploring the worlds in this 
 game... some of the best times i remember. an amazing game for its time, enjoyable puzzles and 
 good humour. i found this game again on wikipedia after so many years and it brough back a flood 
 of memories... i still have the original disc and it's a treasured possession.
  
  REALLY wish they made a sequel... they were going to make five games, but adventure games were 
 on the way out so they didn't go ahead with it. oh well, can't have it all. at least they made 
 this one.

Review:  The game has a standard storyline. Your parents are kidnapped by an evil sorceress and you're to 
 rescue them, but the plot has many twists and turns. You travel thorugh five nested worlds: The 
 Lands Above, Escarpa, Pergola, Asthenia and Tenebrous.
  
  The gameplay: you pick up objects and use them as requiered. You must figure out when and where 
 to use the objects you find. Also you must solve puzzles in order to continue your journey. The 
 inventory has a "log", a holographic proyector (see the objects you have in 3D!) , a help system 
 and a points counter. You use points in exchange for help. This may come in handy for extremely 
 difficult situations, like a puzzle in Pergola which left me stuck for months.
  
  The characters are 2D while the background environments are 3D in its mayority.
  The voice acting 
 is good enough to keep you convinced and the other sound effects are just fine.
  The tilt 10 years ago was big. Now I'm a little dissapointed. I finished the game in two hours 
 now, 10 years ago it took me half a year to finish it.
  
  What it dissapoints me most is that the game should have had a sequel, but it was cancelled because 
 it didn't sell too much. That leaves some questions unaswered.
  
  I had the best days of my life with this game. I would reccomend it for first time adventure players.
