It's a decent value for players looking for computer versions of the real-life games. 

 Game Room from Sierra Sports is a game bundle that includes simple versions of six popular games: 
 pinball, pool, shuffleboard, table tennis, darts, and table hockey. While the graphics and sound 
 in these games are uninspired, the package as a whole is a decent value for players looking for 
 computer versions of the real-life games. Although Game Room doesn't include the advanced features 
 found in games that are devoted entirely to only one game, like games dedicated to pool or pinball 
 games, it does include enough options and difficulty settings to keep the casual player engaged 
 for a good amount of time.   

  The game begins with a simple scene of a game room, which includes a pool table, some dart boards, 
 a Ping-Pong table, a shuffleboard table, an air-hockey table, and a couple of pinball games. All 
 you need to do is mouse over the desired game and click to enter that game. It quickly becomes 
 evident that more work went into some of the games than others. The darts and shuffleboard games 
 included in the package are fairly good versions of these two games, and the pinball game is a 
 stripped-down version of 3D Ultra Pinball Thrillride. The pool option brings up a basic version 
 of Maximum Pool, which has a fairly complete range of options and different perspective settings. 
 The table-tennis and air-hockey games are both fairly simple representations of these games.   
 

  Most games let you choose from a list of options so that you can cater the game to your particular 
 interest. In pool, you can choose from standard eight ball, nine ball, and snooker games, while 
 the darts game includes options for cricket, 901, 701, 501, 301, 101, and baseball. Most games 
 include options for multiple players on the same computer, and some support online multiplayer 
 competition.   

  The controls for most of the games are simple and, for the most part, appropriate. Games such as 
 darts and shuffleboard use an intuitive mouse-driven gesture control system in which you click 
 down, make a quick mouse movement, and release in one motion. Although this takes some getting 
 used to, it works well as a substitute for the real thing. Controls for table tennis are oversimplified, 
 since the paddle is fixed at a specific altitude above the table and the mouse moves the paddle 
 only in a flat plane. This makes the computer game a fairly poor representation of the real-life 
 game. Air hockey is an extremely simple game with extremely simple controls, and it can be fun 
 for a short period of time, but the computer version of the game has no added features to make 
 up for the lack of intensity found in the real thing. The pool simulation is fairly complex compared 
 with the others; plus, it features multiple perspectives, aiming aids, tips, and other features, 
 all of which help new players learn the rules and skills necessary to play the game.   

  One fairly entertaining part of Game Room is your selection of computer opponents. You can choose 
 from five opponents, which appear on the screen in short video clips, and they say things like 
 "Houston, we have a problem" and "This is bad." It's a shame that the game includes only a few 
 clips for each character, so they often repeat. This inclusion nevertheless gives the game a little 
 bit of personality that it wouldn't otherwise have. Unfortunately, the characters actually pop 
 up on the screen only while playing Ping-Pong.   

  Overall, Game Room is a decent bundle of games, the best of which are stripped-down versions of 
 previously released stand-alone games. The graphics and sound for most of the games are only adequate, 
 but the package as a whole is appropriate for those who are looking for simple versions of the 
 six featured games. The options included in the package provide enough variety to keep fans of 
 the games happy for several hours, and the inclusion of the online multiplayer mode provides an 
 added challenge. While Game Room isn't a completely realistic platform in which to train for the 
 real-life games, it does provide an easy way to jump into a quick game for a short period of time.

Review:  There are six games here: table tennis, shuffleboard, pool, darts, table hockey, and an Amusement 
 Park Pinball. Each game is a little hard to control, but after a while you get the hang of it. 
 On the 2 player games, there are several characters that each have their own unique styles. This 
 takes a lot of thinking. However, it gets to be fun when you learn how to understand their styles. 
 This is deep thinking. It's like chess with a video game twist.
  
  If you understand it, it makes the game a lot of fun, but you gotta play thirty minutes at a time, 
 not five hours in a row.
