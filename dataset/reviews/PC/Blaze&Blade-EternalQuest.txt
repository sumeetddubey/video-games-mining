:::Review:::
Blaze & Blade is a pointless PC conversion of a substandard console role-playing game. 

 Blaze &amp; Blade is a pointless PC conversion of a substandard console role-playing game. It squanders 
 its scarce few good ideas by quickly degenerating into mindless, repetitive, and boring action 
 sequences.  

 Blaze &amp; Blade is a port of a PlayStation game, and it shows. Although the game can run in a 
 high resolution, the graphics' simple polygonal geometry and the flat, plain texture maps make 
 it look crude. The game's anime-inspired graphics may look cute but otherwise have little to recommend 
 them. The four squat characters you'll control, as well as the various creatures and characters 
 they'll encounter throughout the game, all look silly at best and unrecognizable at worst - that 
 is, you might find it difficult to discern what exactly you're fighting. You'll wonder whether 
 what you're up against is a bird or a fish and why the game's so-called demons look like teddy 
 bears.  

 The game sounds at least as plain as it looks. You'll hear the same repetitive yet forgettable sounds 
 over and over again, just as the game's soundtrack drones on and on to the point that you'll either 
 shut it off or just learn to ignore it. As such, it's a mixed blessing that the laughably mistranslated 
 dialogue text throughout the game isn't audible speech.  

 The mediocrity of Blaze &amp; Blade's presentation is also at the core of the gameplay. Blaze &amp; 
 Blade starts out fairly promising: The character-creation process lets you choose from various 
 traditional fantasy standards such as elves, dwarves, sorcerers, and rogues, and then you get to 
 name the character, choose his manner of speech and his natural protective element, and finally 
 assign bonus points to his attributes. Unfortunately, in practice, none of the character-creation 
 process's details really matter much. That's because once you start playing, you'll realize that 
 Blaze &amp; Blade is essentially just a poorly executed action game. The gameplay is reminiscent 
 of Square Soft's Super Nintendo action-RPG The Secret of Mana, in that you'll guide the designated 
 lead character through all kinds of enemy-infested areas while the leader's companions follow closely 
 behind and assist in battle. Unfortunately, unlike in The Secret of Mana, the continuous combat 
 in Blaze &amp; Blade just isn't any fun for a variety of reasons.  

 For one thing, there's no real collision detection in the game. You can essentially walk right through 
 your enemies, and the only indication that your characters' badly animated attacks are even connecting 
 with their targets are the white numbers that pop up indicating the amount of damage you delivered. 
 Each character in the game has merely one type of attack, and the few rudimentary special abilities 
 available to some of the character classes, such as the ability to defend with a shield or use 
 medicinal herbs, aren't interesting to use. The magic spells in Blaze &amp; Blade don't look good 
 and aren't very interesting either, and they're too difficult to switch between in the heat of 
 battle. And furthermore, unless you're directly in control of a spellcaster, he won't even use 
 his magic. In fact, most any character class except the bow-wielding hunter is more a liability 
 than an advantage in battle if you're not controlling him. Your characters will stay in single 
 file the whole time and will only attack when something gets close, which makes them tactically 
 worthless. They won't even heal themselves if they get hurt.  

 The problem of your companions' ineffectiveness is alleviated if you play Blaze &amp; Blade with 
 three other human players on a single computer, but doing so won't rid you of the boredom of trudging 
 through its boring areas looking for keys and such while fending off hundreds of mindless monsters. 
 And because your characters gain levels so quickly and so often, even the typical role-playing 
 reward system of progressing through a game to gain more levels becomes trivial and unexciting 
 in Blaze &amp; Blade. In fact, since your enemies magically reappear onscreen a few seconds after 
 you clear them out, you don't even have to progress through the game to level up. You can just 
 stay in one place and keep beating the same weak foes to keep getting more levels.  

 Blaze &amp; Blade even has a cumbersome interface and an inexplicably confusing manual, which makes 
 it impossible to justify the game's learning curve in light of how utterly simplistic the game 
 really is. Blaze &amp; Blade might appeal to a scarce few younger role-playing gamers who like 
 anything that looks like anime, but most everyone else will be struck by how plain and unenjoyable 
 it is.

Review:  And by that I mean its a 100% port. I remember having a blast playing this game with my friends 
 years ago on ps, so after all these years I got this for pc while hoping the same kind of fun.
 
  
  It delivered. And I mean completely but not in the way i was hoping it would. Since this game is 
 almost unplayable solo you will need 3 friends to play with. On playstation this is no problem 
 since you can just hook your controllers and go at it. It would have been logical to add an actual 
 lan/ip multiplayer to this game but no. The multiplayer is 100% the same as it was on ps. If you 
 want to play this with your friends you will need to play from the same friking monitor and hook 
 up 4 usb pads to play this game. No whats up with that? Trash!
