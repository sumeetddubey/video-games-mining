Control problems, micromanagement, and other flaws often make Riot Police a lot less fun than it 
 could have been. 

  Riot Police is one of those games that are usually more fun in theory than in practice. This real-time 
 strategy game requires you to use different police units to quell angry mobs. Using nonlethal weapons, 
 you engage in running battles with incensed union activists, enraged student protesters, wild football 
 fans who rampage after a game, and more. You'll have to take crowd psychology into account or you'll 
 do more harm than good if you use the wrong tactics and whip outraged bystanders into a frenzy. 
 On paper, this game features some neat ideas, but control problems, micromanagement, and other 
 flaws often make Riot Police a lot less fun than it could have been.  

          So much for that protest.     

  In Riot Police, you work through a linear series of 
 16 missions and a bonus mission. Superficially, at least, the missions are varied enough to make 
 the game moderately interesting the first time through. They gradually introduce different units 
 and feature varied goals, like keeping damage under a certain dollar amount or arresting a particular 
 troublemaker among a crowd of vicious thugs. Unfortunately, there's only one game mode and no multiplayer 
 options. There are no difficulty levels, which is a problem since some missions are very poorly 
 balanced. On top of that, scripted events seem to play out the same way every time. All told, there's 
 not a whole lot of depth, variety, or replay value in the long run.  

  You get six unit types with different strengths and weaknesses. Heavy riot police, for example, 
 can set up cordons with their shields to knock onrushing hooligans backward. They're most effective 
 en masse, and they run slowly, so you'll need to anticipate trouble spots early if you want to 
 get them there in time. Standard riot police are a lot faster and can arrest people instead of 
 just knocking them to the ground, but they can't endure much punishment. Other units can fire rubber 
 bullets, tear gas, or other painful but nonlethal weapons.  

  Facing off against the boys in blue, protest leaders stay above the law while egging fellow demonstrators 
 on, hooligans set out to destroy shops and vandalize cars just for kicks, and everyday citizens 
 look on at your actions with satisfaction or join the lawbreakers if they get too agitated by the 
 violence or think you've crossed the line. In fact, crowd control in the broadest sense is part 
 of what makes this pretty simplistic and repetitive game more interesting than it would otherwise 
 be. For example, indiscriminately firing tear gas into crowds or beating up everyone in sight can 
 cause law-abiding passersby to join in the violence. Suddenly, you'll find your men grossly outnumbered 
 and taking a beating. Colorful icons help you track these mood shifts among the populace.  

  Trying to coordinate your units is one of the best and worst things about Riot Police. On the 
 one hand, it can be fun to try different tactics to ensure that your men work together to the best 
 advantage. It's satisfying to send all the troublemakers packing and save the city from devastation. 
 On the other hand, control and micromanagement problems often sap fun out of the game quicker than 
 a rioter can hurl a brick. The controls feel clunky, often requiring multiple presses of the same 
 button for it to register. You can zoom the camera in and out with the mouse, but you have to reach 
 for the keyboard to swivel it. The minimap doesn't adequately display certain vital locales you'll 
 need to protect. You can only hotkey four groups of men, which is often wholly inadequate for the 
 large tasks at hand. Couple all that with pathfinding problems, weak artificial intelligence, and 
 very limited line of sight, and it means you'll be doing lots and lots of babysitting if you want 
 your cops to have a chance. Without your direct intervention all the time, they'll often stand 
 by and do nothing as people burn down a store across the street or smash a nearby car. Needless 
 to say, this can get very frustrating in a hurry.  

  On top of all that, you can't pause or save a game in progress. The lack of saves, in particular, 
 is a real problem since hooligans can keep coming out of the woodwork on some missions until you 
 somehow manage to arrest or drive them all off at once. Missions can drag on interminably.  

          Hooligans suffer as mounted police launch tear gas at them.     

  At least there 
 are plenty of neat things to see. The game wisely adopts a bright, cartoony style instead of trying 
 to treat protests and police conduct seriously -- those cans of worms don't really need to be opened 
 in a basic action strategy game like this. The graphics sure don't push any technological limits, 
 but they're nicely detailed and memorable. Animated signs flash or rotate above businesses, riot 
 vehicles' water cannons send protesters tumbling across the street, charred cars remain in the 
 wake of looters, and activists bend over and puke comically big green puddles onto the pavement 
 after a tear gas grenade explodes nearby. The audio works nicely, too. The music is totally forgettable, 
 but the voice-overs lend character to the game. For instance, when you clear an area of rioters, 
 you might hear one dejectedly mumble, "Hey, let's go back to the dorm," as he skulks away.  

  Nevertheless, Riot Police is unlikely to hold your interest for very long, despite its unusual 
 premise, a few good units, some interesting tactical possibilities, and nice little graphical and 
 audio touches. Ultimately, it's a one-trick pony, and it just doesn't perform that trick particularly 
 well.

Review:  This game is your average person pleaser game it keeps you entertained except there was a problem. 
 There was no tutorial or anything you just started and theres no random game or custom map or nothing 
 just like 15 mission of police riot that why the replay value is just low because the mission are 
 pretty hard and they get harder and harder and with no random games just missions this game was 
 just boring after a while but when you do play it you find it quite fun and may I say at least 
 this game did good for its topic you RARELY I mean RARELY see riot games like this the last riot 
 game I can remeber was state of emergency and that games interactivty and play was just sad do 
 missions where just shoot and deliver no real fun no real choice of sides or anything that game 
 I would give like a 7.4 but all in all this game is more of a renting game but for its low price 
 why not buy it its a good game challenging with fun but very limited no choice of weapons random 
 game or much of anything but oh well for 20 bucks sure ill get my fun.
