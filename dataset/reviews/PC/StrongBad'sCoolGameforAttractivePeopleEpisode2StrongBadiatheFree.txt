:::Review:::
Improved gameplay structure makes for a markedly better -- and funnier -- second episode. 

  When Strong Bad made his episodic-gaming debut last month in Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive 
 People: Homestar Ruiner, his signature sense of humor was stretched disappointingly thin across 
 the open-ended structure of the game. The second episode, Strong Badia the Free, has a more linear 
 layout that not only makes for better gameplay, but allows the humor to get a foothold as well. 
 These improvements make this adventure game both funnier and more fun than its predecessor.  

 
           Strong Bad's moves are significantly sweeter this time around.      

  Civil unrest flares up in Free Country, USA as the King of Town levies the kind of unfair taxes 
 that make honest men dress up and throw midnight tea parties. Strong Bad lights the powder keg 
 of revolution, and the land is soon splintered into a number of republics ruled by various familiar 
 characters. As you struggle to unite the disparate factions under the serpent &amp; tire flag of 
 Strong Badia, you'll make your way through different areas and try to win over each newly minted 
 monarch. To assimilate each territory, you'll have to find a few key items and figure out how to 
 use them to persuade, intimidate, or bamboozle each unique ruler. The solutions are generally well 
 hinted at, but you'll still chuckle happily upon reaching them. You have to complete certain areas 
 before proceeding to others, and this progression creates a much-needed sense of pace that helps 
 keep point-and-click fatigue at bay.  

  The story and structure provide the backbone of the game, and this support puts less pressure on 
 the humor to carry the show. Whereas the first episode faltered by trying to squeeze new laughs 
 out of a worn-out plot (Strong Bad messes with Homestar... again!) , the second episode succeeds 
 by creating a self-contained new plot. No longer forced to prop up weak gameplay, the jokes seem 
 to find better places to fit in, and some of the lost comedic pacing is restored. Characters such 
 as Strong Mad and Homsar create surprisingly amusing nations, and even the 8-bit FunMachine minigame 
 (Math Kickers, featuring the Algebros) offers some entertainment value. Some tired jokes are still 
 tired, but there's enough organic, well-wrought humor here to make you laugh often.  

  It's immensely heartening to see that improvements have been made on the subpar first episode, 
 and it makes the future of this series look brighter. Developer Telltale Games seems much more 
 on point this time around, and even adds a few nice presentation flourishes (like the triumphant 
 WWII newsreels) . There are still some disappointments -- notably the lackluster final challenge -- but 
 Strong Badia the Free gets most of the important stuff right. It ends up feeling more like a proper 
 game than a cash-in attempt, and should earn a look from anyone interested in a few hours of lighthearted 
 adventuring.

Review:  The second of this 5-part series improves upon the first episode through refinement. Of course, 
 you expect "Teen Girl Squad" to show up in a Strong Bad Game (which appeared in the first episode) , 
 but "Cave Girl Squad?" Furter, wheras the first episode used the jokes and gags to drive the narrative, 
 the second episode returned to its original form by making commentary at the people, places, and 
 predicaments that the story led Strong Bad to. That is, the jokes sprang from the story instead 
 of creating it.
  
  The puzzles seemed much more intuitive; I rarely found myself wondering what to do next. That's 
 not to say that they were too easy, but there certaintly felt less obtuse.
  
  The collections (not neccessary for story progression) seemed more straightfoward and predictable 
 too. 
  
  Telltale could have gone overboard with this and made the puzzles and collecting too easy, but 
 they struck a middle path of interesting but not overly-difficult.
