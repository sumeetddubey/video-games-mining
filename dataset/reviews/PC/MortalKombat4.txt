:::Review:::
Fans of the other versions of MK4 won't be disappointed with this excellent translation. 

 The Mortal Kombat series is one of the premier arcade series around today. The series, which until 
 now utilized digitized actors to give the game an extra layer of realism, has been the topic of 
 comic books, movies, action figures, and even Senate hearings. The fourth time around the game 
 has gone polygonal, giving the developers much more leeway when it comes to adding new moves, holds, 
 and characters. Also, weapons have been added into the mix, with each character possessing a different 
 sword, club, or staff to beat his enemies with.  

 The storyline of MK4 picks up the loose ends left behind by both MK3 and the console-exclusive MK 
 Mythologies: Sub-Zero. With Shao Kahn defeated, Shinnok picks up the slack as the main bad guy. 
 However, he is also a selectable character, which left arcade players with no big boss to look 
 forward to. To remedy that, the home version contains MK1's four-armed bad boy, Goro. Goro looks 
 terrific in 3D, moves very fluidly, and has all the great moves he had in MK1, as well as a few 
 additional ones. He isn't selectable from the start, but a code makes him (as well as Noob Saibot, 
 another hidden character) playable. Returning characters include Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Liu Kang, 
 Johnny Cage, Sonya, and Raiden. Most of the old characters retain their old moves and add a new 
 one here and there. The new characters fit very well into the MK universe, a welcome change from 
 most fighting game sequels.  

 While the graphics may not be quite as detailed as the arcade version, they are very close, and 
 the game runs very fast with hardware acceleration. The software-rendered graphics look pretty 
 blocky, although a patch has been released that allows a higher resolution in software mode. The 
 music comes off the CD, resulting in an arcade-perfect soundtrack. The character voices, while 
 occasionally goofy sounding, are all present. The arcade version's endings used the game engine, 
 but they have been redone for the PC version, and the results look fantastic. The game now plays 
 the high-quality rendered FMV endings instead.  

 Whether or not the game plays like the arcade version all depends on which controller you use. You're 
 going to need at least a six-button gamepad to properly play the game. The Sidewinder pad works 
 perfectly, although some of the game's fatalities are hard to do on any controller other than the 
 arcade's. MK4's combo system has been greatly simplified when compared with previous MKs. Each 
 character can start a combo the same way, and some of the more damaging moves in the previous games 
 (the uppercut, for instance) have been weakened. The introduction of weapons seems silly at first, 
 but once you've played for a while and gotten used to using them, they really do add a new dimension 
 to the game. Each character has two fatalities, and there are two stage fatalities. The fatalities 
 look nice, but too many of them are merely 3D updates to old fatalities, and the new fatalities 
 in MK4 simply aren't that great. It would have been nice to see some more innovation here. A few 
 modes have been added to the game, including a practice mode, which shows all the characters' moves 
 and fatalities. There are also three types of endurance fights, a team battle mode, and a tournament 
 mode.  

 If you aren't a fan of the previous Mortal Kombat games, this one won't make you a fan. It's pretty 
 much the same game but with a few 3D elements tossed in. But fans of the other versions of MK4 
 won't be disappointed with this excellent translation.

Review:  Ah, Mortal Kombat. Senseless violence, brutal fatalities. Love it or hate it, the MK series has 
 left its mark on gaming.
  
  Ever since the early 90's, Midway has kept us hungry for blood and gore. In 1998, they decided 
 to take another approach: to take the big step to 3D.
  Mortal Kombat 4 would be the first in the series to prove that MK might as well work in a 3D environment. 
 Or did it?
  
  The overall gameplay in MK4 is as usual in MK games.
  Usually, you have things like uppercuts, roundhouse kicks, sweeps, and special moves for each character.
 
  
  MK4 is no exception. It's very similar like its prequels, but this time some new combos are introduced, 
 you can sidestep, and use weapons! Every character has their own unique weapon with many different 
 moves. It adds to the gameplay, as you have some more toys to play with.
  
  The controls are responsive, when you press punch your character punches, when you press kick your 
 character kicks. It all works. The special moves and fatalities are very easy to pull off.
  
  The graphics are OK for its time. They look a bit blocky, but this is completely understandable 
 because it was the first of its kind.
  
  The music is a bit repetitive, and the character sounds are pretty awful. You might consider turning 
 down the volume for this game, as most of the things you'll hear aren't really enjoyable.
  
  Overall, MK4 is a good addition to the series and set the standard for all 3D MK games to follow. 
 I'd recommend to rent it first, just to be sure.
  
  Bottom line: Good and innovative with some flaws, but its fun gameplay more than makes up for it.

Review:  As I have said, it is one of the few Mortal Kombat games on the PCs, but lives up to its expectations. As 
 usual, it's a 3D fighting game, so not much to say here.
  First of all, the graphics are crappy. I know its an old game, but since you can play these kinds 
 of action games forever, you wished they looked better. But the game-play is solid. There are plenty 
 of playable characters including Lu Kang, Sonya Blade, Rayden, Scorpion, Sub-Zero etc. Each has its 
 own '' fatality '', a move you can pull out when your opponent is nearly dead and look cool in the 
 process. There are 4 or 5 difficulties to chose from, in each the number of matches required to win 
 to win the tournament gets increased. You'll have a hard time beating Goro, before you can pulverise 
 the final opponent-Shinok. Weird, but the final fight is not challenging at all, especially if you 
 are playing with Rayden, my personal favourite.
  The sound could have been better, to make defeats more painful, but its not that bad either.
  Its 
 a quite playable game, especially with a human opponent, with some really difficult moves to pull 
 off, but together in all, the end result is great !

Review:  
  
  This is a great version of MK4. The graphics look much better and clean than the Playstation version 
 and the game works just fine with the gamepad.
  
  The AI is much better than on previous MK games, it's not cheap and doesn't detect and counter every 
 move you try to do like on MK games before it. On normal difficulty, the AI is challenging, but fair.
 
  
  The new characters are great, such as Tanya who uses speed to overwhelm you. Reiko stuns you with 
 sharp projectiles and it allows him to have a free hit on you (similiar to what Sub Zero and Scorpion 
 do with their projectiles) . Fujin is the God of wind. The last member of the black dragon named Jerek 
 makes an appearance and he has a spinning attack similiar to Kano. Shinnok is the new boss and an 
 elder God. Quan Chi is an evil sorcerer who works with Shinnok and has a few tricks up his sleeve (he 
 does the job Shang T Sung used to) There is more new characters and all of them are selectable (even 
 Shinnok) .
  
  Goro returns as the monster you must fight (non selectable)
  
  Sub Zero returns with his famous ice projectiles and he can once again do his famous head rip fatality. Scorpion 
 is there too, and can do the harpoon and still yells ''come over here''. Other classic characters 
 such as Lui Kang, Raiden, Johnny Cage, Sonya, Reptile return too.
  
  The combos are unique now, when you use Scorpion, you can run up to an opponent and twist their leg 
 twice in a row before they can defend themselves, and the rest you can see for yourself.
  
  The 2 on 2 combat makes battles more exciting and can even be used for story mode. Against the bosses, Goro 
 teams up with Johnny Cage and Shinnok teams up with Quan Chi to keep things fair. Too bad it doesn't 
 have a proper tag team though.
  
  The only major flaw with the game is I think their is some character balance issues eg Raiden is 
 a bit overpowered, when Raiden does that move where he flies through the air and smashes his opponent 
 into the wall, it does alot of damage and is hard to block/avoid because it's so fast.
  
  But otherwise great MK game.

Review:  ---------
  Pros and Cons:
  ---------
  +Fatalities are cool and funny.
  +Plenty of blood and gore.
  +Reptile is a great character.
  -May seem depthless at times.
 
  -Graphics look horrible on other systems.
  
  
  
  
  The 4th generation of "the most violent fighting game 
  ever" has finnally come, and its better 
 than ever.
  
  
  You can consider me a Mortal Kombat fan. I can't tell you how many hours Mortal Kombat has kept 
 me to be honest. I remember playing N64 Never played an MK game? Then this probably won't be a 
 good place to start; MK3 might be a bit gentler.
  
  
  Why I say that is, as I stated above, Mortal Kombat plays like any ordinary fighting game, but 
 what makes it so unique and addictive is the exessive amount of blood and gore put into a fighter 
 game (At most times, its action or FPS that does that the most) . Punch somebody, and you can expect 
 to see blood flash. Kick him high in the sky with a powerful kick, and you'll see even more blood. 
 At any rate, that blood and gore.
  
  
  
  
  I won't spoil the story for you; Innitially, you pick a fighter to fight with, out of a good selection, 
 and begin fighting in a 2D manner, but with 3D graphics. The Graphics themselves look pretty good 
 on PC or N64, but if you happen to buy the PS verison, the graphics will look like runescape.
 
  
  
  
  Another thing that is mainly addicting to MK series is Fatalities. Fatalities are the violent ways 
 of finishing off your oppenent. In most fighting games, you'd expect to just see K. O. on the screen 
 at the final round, but not for MK. Instead of K. O., you'll get a "Finish Him/Her" phase. With 
 that, performing a rather hard combo will result in your fighter performing a gruesome finishing 
 move that, well, kills the other person. These finishers can be from smacking his head off, to 
 severing his body into peices, but either way, they're obviously the most likable part of Mortal 
 Kombat, and its always been that way.
  
  
  
  
  Sound has alot of screams with it. In fact, some of the screams during fatalities are actually 
 quite funny and goofy, along with the disturbing shock music at the end of the fatality. The sound 
 is at it's best, and anybody who begs to different has apperantly never played crappy runescape.
 
  
  
  Bottom line: Go get it.

Review:  I remember playing this game. I have always enjoyed the Mortal Kombat series and I enyoyed this 
 game a lot. Im not a really big fan of arcade fighters but I liked this game a lot. I enjoked MK3 
 a lot too, and what's disappointing about MK4 is that the game hasnt improved, it only changed 
 from 2D to 3D. I dont mean that's a bad thing, making the game 3D has made it more enjoyable. If 
 your not familiar with the MK series, the game is a fighting game, which includes many different 
 characters which have their own powers. For example Raiden has the power of lightening. All the 
 characters are fun to play with, because they play differently and they all have different cool 
 moves. What i liked about the game is its brutality. I dont know why, but i seem to enjoy brutal 
 games. I just love games where you can chop people's head's off, or blow their head off using a 
 gun or anything similar. Some people dont like that but i do, i think its more realistic if u see 
 a lot of blood and u can chop or blow enemies head's off. Its fun and realistic, but it aint appropriate 
 for kids. My favourite part of the game (which unsurprisingly includes brutality) are the finishing 
 moves called fatalities. they are so fun to do. After your enemy's life/hp is depleted, you get 
 like 5 secs to finsh the guy off. If you want you can perform a fatality or u can just punch or 
 kick the guy, but of course performing the fatality is much more fun. The fatalities are really 
 brutal and full of blood (hehehe) which i just love. they r fun to watch and they give the game 
 a more scary/bloody feel. they dont change the gameplay in anyway, which is why many people dont 
 pay attention to them that much. The fatalities are just fun, you just perform the fatality and 
 watch, it doesnt require skill or anythin, actually it doesnt affect the game in any way, just 
 makes it more fun.
  If anyone already owns MK3, and they arent big fans of the MK series, i dont recommend buying this 
 game. But if your looking for an enjoyable fighting game, with good graphics, fun characters, brutal 
 moves and fatalities, then this is your game.
  
  (personally i think all fighting games should have some brutality in them because imagine u kick 
 and punch a guy like 50 times, and he still looks the same and no blood comes out of him. That 
 is so unrealistic. In MK4 if u punch a guy a lot, he doesnt look that different but blood is present. 
 Even in shooting games, blood should be included, but it should probably be an option. Dont get 
 me wrong, i dont want all games to b like MK4, but to make a game realistic, things like blood 
 and blowing heads off should b present. Anyways i enjoy all kinds of games, they dont hve to b 
 brutal)
  
  MK4 is a very old game. If ur looking for a fighting game, there are many good games out there. 
 I knw Def Jam Fight For NY is a wrestling game, but i highly recommend it. Its truly amazing and 
 really fun to play, and guess what it has finishing moves, but not as brutal as MK4 or MK Deception, 
 but the finishing moves are still fun to watch. And btw, if u want a more recent MK game, buy Deception, 
 also amazing, includes many new cool features.

Review:  Mortal Kombat 4 was the first fully 3D Mortal Kombat game made. You have to admit, at that time 
 this game's presentation was great. The only problem was they tried to sell the game in arcades 
 when that industry was already crashing. Waste of money. A direct port to home consoles would have 
 been the smarter move.
  
  Visually, MK4 is good (on the arcade anyway) but home parts had choppy models and some disappointing 
 textures. For some stupid reason the PC port was just as crappy as the PS version. There was no 
 reason the computer version of MK4 couldn't support the graphics (or at least close to the graphic 
 detail) of the arcades. It did not have to be chopped down to the Playstation version. 
  Thankfully, they got rid of stupid finishers and stuck with two fatalities per character and cool 
 new stage fatalities that are a definite improvement to MK3's dust ball. Even though all the blood 
 looked very unrealistic and there were no bones to characters when being chopped in half, they 
 were still great. At the time, all that detail didn't seem feasible in a convenient manner.
  
  The music went back to the good ol' MK roots and fit the fighting stages well. Not as disappointing 
 as MK3/UMK3. The sound effects are a bit questionable, but not too shabby.
  This game definitely had an interesting character roster, brought in some new fan favorites like 
 Quan Chi, Shinnok, Reiko. And of course returning classics like Sub-Zero, Goro, Sonya, Cage, Scorpion. 
 There are a whole bunch of other characters, take your time to view the screen shots.
  
  The fighting mechanics are pretty basic, as usual. No real unique style for each character. The 
 animations were not distinct at all, which was present in MK3 to make each character have their 
 own martial arts style. But MK4 everyone fights the same with the exception to special moves. This 
 is a very big drawback to MK4  a stupid mistake to be honest. It takes away from potential eye 
 candy that could make the game more interesting to play especially when it comes to replay value. 
 If you master one player you can master the entire roster. That is not fun at all. But the pace 
 of the fighting is very fast and enjoyable. 
  
  The weapon system kind of sucks, but it was their first attempt, so I suppose they did a good job 
 considering the game came out a while ago. You can pick up and throw weapons as well as objects 
 laying around in the stage. The only crappy part is the that it's very easy to disarm your opponent 
 which makes it a bit frustrating to have cool weapon to weapon battles. In a way its good, considering 
 weapons take off so much life  but that could have been balance by just toning down the amount 
 of damage a weapon does.
  
  One thing I have to point out is the terrible AI when on harder difficulty (which has been a problem 
 and seems to be a problem that never gets fixed with MK games) . Just like before, if you're trying 
 to throw an opponent they immediately do a throw before you, the same thing goes with bone breaker 
 moves. It is so frustrating to use the arsenal of attacks the game developers provide you when 
 the poorly programmed AI overrides your every attack like it can read your damn mind.
  
  Overall I was pleased with the games despite a few flaws which can be easily overlooked. By now, 
 you won't want to play it unless you're an old fan who loves to go back to the roots of MK and 
 play some of the classics that helped bring about the evolution of current MK titles. Appreciate 
 this game.

Review:  MK4 practilcally has no competitor on the PC. The gfx ain't pixel perfect but still it's still 
 very enjoyable, extremely fast paced and especially enjoyable to play with friends .All the special 
 moves and specially the fatalities are some very enjoyable features and it also has a nice list 
 of characters to choose from. There isn't much to say about MK4 except that its pretty darn solid. So 
 if anybody out there hasn't tried it yet ....... what the hell were u thinking!!!!!!!!!!! There is 
 nothing more fun than to kick ur friends butt sitting right beside him. Would have been better if 
 it would have had a multiplayer feature over the internet.

Review:  The game is an awesome mix of brutal, fatal fighting and mastering the different combination attacks 
 and special fatalities of every character is absoutely enthralling. It makes one hell of an experience.
 
  
  The game is extremely addictive and has many characters you can use and playing versus one of your 
 friends is also a lot of fun. The game can be mastered at 4 levels and you can test yourself to 
 the limit of difficulty. You will find yourself making one of the players, your favorite. The gameplay 
 is extremely smooth and really makes the game experience a lot more enjoyable. The game has good 
 graphics for its time and the sound is also very good quality. The game is very enjoyable on the 
 whole and is really great and is worth every PC gamer's expreience.
  
  This game is one of the best classics on the fighting genre for the PC and is a must for all.

Review:  Mortal Kombat 4, a game by the infamous John Tobias and Ed Boon, has surely met with the requirements 
 of a true blood thirsty, fighter game.
  It definetely earned the title ,, The Balance of Mortal Kombat''.
  Mortal Kombat is a old, but 
 fairly good game. In the game you can choose between 17 characters ( 2 unlockable only by cheats 
 or hacks ) each unique in its own way. Some Characters have elemental powers, and mostly are effective 
 when casting spells then fighting from close, though they are not **** and can surely break a few 
 or more bones. Some characters are totaly stupid in range, and must run to the oponent so they 
 can clobber him/her/it. The character fighting style, as you can see, varies. Sonya, for instance, 
 is exellent in air combat, with 3 skills useful in air, while Jax likes to grab his opponents and 
 smash them on the ground and then beat the god out of them. While Shinnok can do all that, since 
 he can transform into other characters ( Exept Goro and Noob Saibot ) . This skill was later removed 
 from Shinnok, as people complained that he is too strong. The graphics are very nice for that age, 
 the sound gets kind of irritating and dull, but it will not make you quit the game. Just turn off 
 the sound and play songs in Winamp or whatever. The weird fact is that sounds are already set, 
 and can not be changed. U will break Reiko's back and he will shout : ,, Oh my Legs!!!'' Weird...
 
  But, allas, like in every game, there are some negative things. And Mortal Kombat 4 is no exeption. 
 The game can sometimes get suprisengly hard.
  I don't know why, but sometimes when you are winning, and you have 6 wins in a row, the computer 
 kind of, i don't know, sences that you are too powerfull, and starts doing things you can't even 
 imagine of doing. At that moment it will be impossible to win, and you will loose ( Most likely, 
 not every time ) , and get frustrated. At least i did...
  Then, there is the fact that Goro is just... aw how should i put it... TOO DAMN HARD TO BEAT!!! 
 It is funny that Goro, who is some kind of a guard to Shinnok, is way way way harder then Shinnok 
 himself. In order to beat Goro you must draw your weapon and never let him rise up, so that he 
 doesn't kill you. Sounds simple, but not so simple. The computer sences that you will kill Goro, 
 and then, suddenly, rises Goro quicker than you can rise, so that he has 0.258370389 seconds more 
 to do stuff. Those 0.258370389 seconds cost you your life. Stupid.
  But overall, Mortal Kombat 4 is a classic, and it is still installed on my Computer, and i still 
 like to play it when i have nothing better to do.
  
  It's not a war on drugs, it's a war on personal freedom, thats what it is. Keep that in mind please, 
 thank You.

Review:  Mortal Kombat 4 is cool. It is a very good fighting game. I vs my friends and families lots of 
 times and most of the times I am the one who actually wins because I am totally the best at this 
 so so cool fighting game, but there just one thing I have got a friend that sometimes beats me 
 at this game. The good thing about this game is that you dont need a tuned up computer to play 
 this game even an old graphics card can play this game, not that mine is sucky I'am just saying. 
 So what I'm saying is that this game is off the hook!.

 mortal kombat 3 &amp; 4 .
  Now i'm very happy when i play it on the pc , the sound effects are cool and the graphics are great 
 too but I hoped to find a 600x 800 or 1024 x 768 screen resolution in the options .
  by the way you can view the options by pressing F2 .
  the tournament is good also , cause you 
 can choose a long or a short one .
  I liked the practice option so that the player can improve his ability any time he wants.
  Finally 
 let me thank the great pc games company MIDWAY to bring this game to us.

Review:  Mortal Kombat 4 is a simple kombat game. It is 2D but sometimes it gets 3D. I gues that the guys 
 who made it watched too many violent movies. This game has more blood than a human has. Very well 
 designed moves but bad graphics (today) but good when it was made. The blood isn't very well made 
 its just a red thing. The fighters have all powers a weapon, moves and alternate costumes. You 
 can play P1 on P2 but if no P2 play in the arcade mode. You'll have to chose a character then adestiny 
 (oponents you fight) . Well the last two are the greatest. One is Goro, a 4 handed monster that 
 can jump on you .... and the last is Shinnok the master!!! He can copy every ones moves and powers 
 but he relays more to combos!!!
  Sound pretty good. What I liked is the conection to the screen. Sometimes blood gets on the screen, 
 or when you slap em' witha a bat a... they stick to the screen. What is also cool the blody fatalities. 
 They all have 4 fatalities. 2 are available on certain lairs. 2 can be always used. . They always 
 take their heads they smash their body they take the body apart like in half or the head arms body 
 and legs. ooooohhh blody game......
  
  So thats all folks!!!!! Bye-Buy

Review:  When it came out it was the hyoe amongst every one in the neighbourhood. I mean everyone was challenging 
 their neighbour and all. too bad there was no multiplayer mode in it otherwise it would have been 
 the best online game around.
  GOOD: The Good is that it's 3d, where all the other MK games were 2d this was the new innovative 
 one, the graphics were awesome, and special moves and new characters as well as hidden characters 
 made it more exciting
  
  BAD: Just that midway Could have put in a multiplayer mode in to the game, and increased the number 
 of characters in the game.
  
  Overall one really good adictive game which would keep you and your friend challenging each other 
 for hours on end.

Review:  Welcome to the world of the 3D Mortal Kombat. 
  
  At last Midway released a 3D version of the hit Mortal Kombat series. And must may I say that I 
 am truly exited about it.
  
  After playing this game for hours and hours and hours I found myself hooked in the worst kind of 
 way.
  
  The graphics are good, but it doe feel a bit like a MK version of Tekken. Not all the PC's support 
 the game and I found I had a few issues with the sound and some of the graphics.
  
  The characters are great. You got some new ones and some older more well known ones like Liu Kang. 
 The Fatalities are great as well. 2 per character is awesome. Some of the stages have Stage fatalities 
 which are also nice. 
  
  The game also brought back a very interesting character. I don't know why, but they put Goro back 
 in the game. 
  
  If you liked Mortal Kombat all your life, as much as I do, then get the game. But while I am writing 
 this review, I am thinking don't buy it. MK Deception is out there. Rather get that. :D

Review:  Gameplay: As MK goes 3-D, So do the fatalitys. MK4 has some of the greatest fatalitys ever. As 
 other MK games this doesnt go easy on gore. It can take months on hard tranning to master this 
 game.
  
  Graphics: At the time the graphics were superb. Cool looking fighters and 3-D brings Goro to life. 
 The Environments are cool and you can pick up weapons of the ground. Mwahaha the gore is excellent 
 with arm rippings and decapitations. It revolutionizes Mortal Kombat into 3-D. Quite simply Superb.
 
  
  Sound: The sound is good with classic bone-crunching uppercuts and awesome voice acting like Superb, 
 Fatalitys etc. Awesome scores see this game to its Greatness.
  
  Value: As all Mortal Kombat Games, This will last you for months. It will take ages to gather up 
 all the skills to play in tornaments etc. I am still playing this game in 2005 lol.

Review:  There was a time when PC was the most preferred platform for most game developers. The consoles 
 were far inferior in graphics producing, and developers would attach visual enhancements and other 
 experimentations with the PC release of a console game. But things have changed drastically now. 
 MK4 is a really, really old game, and yet it remains as the last 3d fighting game that came out 
 for PC.
  
  MK4 was a courageous shift from a dying, yet respected and adored 2D franchise to a promising 3D 
 one. Most people know about MK: Deadly Alliance and MK: Deception, but few know that MK4 was the 
 first 3D Mortal Kombat game that gave Midway the confidence to desert the 2D platform and go ahead. 
 
  
  Long term fans of the series (including myself) were skeptical about the 3D transition in the beginning. 
 There were new characters, and not too impressive ones. Some old favorites were there, but they 
 were also modified to some extent. There was no Shang Tsung, there was no Kitana, Kano, Kung Lao, 
 but there was Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Raiden, Reptile, Sonya, etc. 
  
  But my initial skepticism vanished as soon as I started playing the game. The game was fast, the 
 AI was shrewd, and there were lots of moves and strategies to play around with. The game supported 
 both styles of play. It had a lot of elements for the combo happy people, as well as for the old-school 
 players. 
  
  The coolest feature perhaps was the ability to take use weapons during a match. Each character 
 had its unique weapon, and weapon spawning could be initiated via a special button combination 
 (unique in most cases) . Some of the weapons like Scorpion's sword, Sub-Zero's ice club, Reiko's 
 Spiked Club and Reptiles double sided axe were deadly effective, and the characters also had special 
 moves involving weapons. One could throw the weapon at the opponent anytime during a match. Such 
 attacks were high life consuming, and fairly effective if timed properly. There's was nothing more 
 satisfying than knocking off an opponent with the weapon, just after he had landed from a mistimed 
 jump attack. 
  
  Also, some environmental objects (mostly rocks) could also be picked up and thrown at the opponents. 
 Some familiar stages like the talking forest and Goro's lair is featured in the game. The other 
 arenas are also cool. Two stages allow stage fatality, and both of them look really cool, in a 
 sadistic way, though. 
  
  Extreme blood and gore has always been the main selling point for MK games, and MK4 lives up to 
 this name quite well. Every single hit or combo names your opponent spew some blood, and most predictably, 
 the fatalities in 3D are highly detailed, and damn bloody. Kano's descendent Jarek pays his homage 
 to his master by pulling out the heart from his opponent, and Liu Kang's famous Dragon fatality 
 got better than ever. It felt really good when I made Scorpion turn into a real Scorpion and sting 
 and bite his opponent. 
  
  Each character had a decent storyline, which would reveal once the game was completed with that 
 character. These end sequences were detailed FMVs and once viewed, they could be viewed over and 
 over through a theater feature, which is a great addition. 
  
  The game also featured 2 vs 2 mode, tournament mode, and a practice mode. All these features are 
 useful and fun, in their own way. 
  
  There are a number of difficulty levels as well, which further increases the replay value. Many 
 popular fighters from MK3 had been dropped here, but the new characters weren't bad at all. Reiko, 
 Fujin, Tanya, Quan Chi turned out to be very memorable characters, and Quan Chi even managed to 
 be the co-boss of the next title in the series. 
  
  Now in year 2005, there is not much point to go back to this game. But it still remains as a masterpiece 
 PC game, and it will remain being one until a better game gets released for this platform. The 
 game was originally developed during the 3dfx era, and was specifically optimized for glide. 
 
  
  I guess one will need an old PC to play this game now.

Review:  Mortal Kombat 4 is undoubtedly the best fighting game I've ever played. What make it so good? The 
 way it moves. It moves fast. When you click on a button, something happens immediately. A round 
 can end in less than 20 seconds. It's all about reflexes. You see the enemy do a move and you have 
 less than a second to react, that's what make it so fun. The graphics are, of course, dated, but 
 they serve their purpose. It's overall a very addicting game that gives a feeling of satisfaction 
 when you win. The only downside of the game is the rather small selection of fighters (especially 
 compared to its predecessor, MK Trilogy) , but even so, I can still play this game many many times 
 and not get bored.

Review:  I remember playing this game. I have always enjoyed the Mortal Kombat series and I enyoyed this 
 game a lot. Im not a really big fan of arcade fighters but I liked this game a lot. I enjoked MK3 
 a lot too, and what's disappointing about MK4 is that the game hasnt improved, it only changed 
 from 2D to 3D. I dont mean that's a bad thing, making the game 3D has made it more enjoyable. If 
 your not familiar with the MK series, the game is a fighting game, which includes many different 
 characters which have their own powers. For example Raiden has the power of lightening. All the 
 characters are fun to play with, because they play differently and they all have different cool 
 moves. What i liked about the game is its brutality. I dont know why, but i seem to enjoy brutal 
 games. I just love games where you can chop people's head's off, or blow their head off using a 
 gun or anything similar. Some people dont like that but i do, i think its more realistic if u see 
 a lot of blood and u can chop or blow enemies head's off. Its fun and realistic, but it aint appropriate 
 for kids. My favourite part of the game (which unsurprisingly includes brutality) are the finishing 
 moves called fatalities. they are so fun to do. After your enemy's life/hp is depleted, you get 
 like 5 secs to finsh the guy off. If you want you can perform a fatality or u can just punch or 
 kick the guy, but of course performing the fatality is much more fun. The fatalities are really 
 brutal and full of blood (hehehe) which i just love. they r fun to watch and they give the game 
 a more scary/bloody feel. they dont change the gameplay in anyway, which is why many people dont 
 pay attention to them that much. The fatalities are just fun, you just perform the fatality and 
 watch, it doesnt require skill or anythin, actually it doesnt affect the game in any way, just 
 makes it more fun.
  If anyone already owns MK3, and they arent big fans of the MK series, i dont recommend buying this 
 game. But if your looking for an enjoyable fighting game, with good graphics, fun characters, brutal 
 moves and fatalities, then this is your game. 
  
  (personally i think all fighting games should have some brutality in them because imagine u kick 
 and punch a guy like 50 times, and he still looks the same and no blood comes out of him. That 
 is so unrealistic. In MK4 if u punch a guy a lot, he doesnt look that different but blood is present. 
 Even in shooting games, blood should be included, but it should probably be an option. Dont get 
 me wrong, i dont want all games to b like MK4, but to make a game realistic, things like blood 
 and blowing heads off should b present. Anyways i enjoy all kinds of games, they dont hve to b 
 brutal)
  
  MK4 is a very old game. If ur looking for a fighting game, there are many good games out there. 
 I knw Def Jam Fight For NY is a wrestling game, but i highly recommend it. Its truly amazing and 
 really fun to play, and guess what it has finishing moves, but not as brutal as MK4 or MK Deception, 
 but the finishing moves are still fun to watch. And btw, if u want a more recent MK game, buy Deception, 
 also amazing, includes many new cool features.
