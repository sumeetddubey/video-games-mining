:::Review:::
You'll need to learn lock picking, security-code deciphering, and computer hacking; it's like job 
 training, albeit for what seems like a really, really fun job. 

 In Daydream Software's Traitors Gate, you play Raven, an operative for an organization called ORPHIA. 
 Your employer suspects that one of its high-ranking operatives is planning to break into the Tower 
 of London to steal the crown jewels and has hired you to commit the crime before he can. Your task: 
 to sneak in, steal the jewels, replace them with replicas, remove all traces that you were there, 
 and then get out.   

  Cat-burglary is an inherently great premise for a game, as Looking Glass Studios' excellent Thief 
 games have proven. But Traitors Gate has little in common with Thief. In fact, it has much more 
 in common with Activision's Spycraft: The Great Game. Like Spycraft, Traitors Gate gives you a 
 selection of intriguing tools and devices and puts you in a situation where you must learn to use 
 them. You'll need to learn lock picking, security-code deciphering, and computer hacking; it's 
 like job training, albeit for what seems like a really, really fun job.   

  What's even better is that unlike in most adventure games, in Traitors Gate the illogical obstacles 
 that tend to plague even the best games in the genre are absent. Instead, it presents you with 
 a series of logical challenges that can be readily solved, as long as you understand the tools 
 at your disposal. That's not to say Traitors Gate is easy - at times, it can be quite difficult. 
 But it's refreshing to play an adventure game where a padlocked gate can be opened with a pair 
 of bolt cutters rather than by something like a frozen fish tied to a honey-covered balloon.   
 

  However, aside from the nature of its puzzles, Traitors Gate is an adventure game through and through. 
 It uses the standard point-and-click interface, and you move from node to node in the Tower of 
 London in the same way you moved through the environments in other first-person adventure games 
 since Myst. At each location, you can look around in a full 360-degree radius. The graphics aren't 
 especially remarkable, but the amount of attention paid to rendering each room and item is noticeable. 
 Those who take their time with Traitors Gate are sure to get the most out of it; the whole tower 
 has been re-created in detail, and you'll find yourself reading plaques and placards that detail 
 the history of the site despite the fact that very little of the information has anything to do 
 with your mission.   

  But there are bits of information that are not only important - they are also crucial. Computer 
 passwords, keys to secret passages, and the like can all be found among the facts presented along 
 your path to the jewels. Luckily, you can photograph anything and send it back to ORPHIA for analysis. 
 Your many tools also include a global-position system (which comes in very handy) , a set of lock 
 picks, a keypad-code analyzer, a mechanical rope lift, knock-out gas, a crossbow, a grappling hook, 
 and much, much more.   

  It's learning to use these tools in various situations that makes Traitors Gate enjoyable. Waiting 
 while your PDA deciphers a security door's password adds tension to the game, and using your crossbow, 
 grappling hook, and rope lift together to move from one high window to the next is really exciting. 
 And the subtle music heightens the suspense, particularly when it mimics classic spy themes like 
 Mission Impossible when the situation gets tense.   

  Although the game can be exciting, it can also be frustrating at times. Most of the frustration 
 comes from the fact that Traitors Gate is so unstable. On one of the test systems, the game would 
 only start about one out of every five tries. And the game requires two different versions of Quicktime 
 to run - 2.0 and 3.0. The game was plagued with problems using Quicktime 4, and the in-game video 
 (such as walking guards) won't run unless you install version 2 as well. Furthermore, the game 
 takes up four CD-ROMs, and you'll switch between all four frequently.   

  Even so, it's good fun once it's actually working. Traitors Gate is admirable for being both logical 
 and nonlinear. The latter is especially noteworthy - you could easily play through the game several 
 times and take a different route each time, at least until the somewhat linear endgame. And if 
 you don't mind the unrewarding ending, you'll most likely want to play it more than once just to 
 see all of the locations you missed the first time. Traitors Gate isn't an excellent game, but 
 it's very good.

Review:  Traitors Gate puts you in the shoes of "Raven", a highly skilled operative who has to break into 
 the Tower of London to snatch the British crown jewels. The story is a bit muddy on this issue, 
 but it seems that your employer suspects that the jewels will be stolen by somebody else, and sends 
 you in to steal them instead, to spoil the attempt.
  
  In the game you move between fixed locations, which can be seen in QuickTime VR-like 360 degrees 
 views, that you can rotate freely. Once you click an "exit" from you current location an animation 
 shows you walking to the next viewpoint. This kind of interactivity is reminiscent of games like 
 Myst and Riven, and the game does manage to catch some of the same mystique, even though it is 
 located in a real environment. 
  
  You will be moving around and solving puzzles inside the ancient tower of London (which is actually 
 made up of a large number of different towers) . The game's strong point is the attention to detail 
 in recreating these towers, and their hallways, rooms, corridors and historical objects within 
 - and solving their secrets in order to move on. 
  
  But here the praise ends. The game does not manage to present as interesting (or difficult) puzzles 
 as some of the other titles I mentioned earlier. While it's exiting to sneak around as a cat-burglar, 
 the fixed-position gameplay just doesn't make for exiting stealth action. Theres no "hurrying into 
 the shadow" when a guard comes, you are either caugth or not. 
  
  In the end it seems more like you are walking a round a "Virtual Tower of London" infotainment 
 CD-ROM, than actually playing a game.
