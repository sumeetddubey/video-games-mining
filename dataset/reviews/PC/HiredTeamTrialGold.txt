:::Review:::
Hired Team: Trial Gold has arrived at about the worst possible time. 

 Better late than never? Not where Hired Team: Trial Gold is concerned. This game, which despite 
 its ambiguous title isn't a demo or time-limited shareware program, was originally released in 
 Russia back in 2000 and has now finally seen the light of day in the US. If you're a shooter fan, 
 you'll want to shove Hired Team back into a dark hole and forget about it. Hired Team is a shameless 
 mishmash of Quake III: Arena and Unreal Tournament, two great games that helped redefine the shooter 
 genre in 1999 with their focus on pure multiplayer carnage over single-player action. Even if Hired 
 Team had been released back then, it would have been crushed by those illustrious, hugely popular 
 competitors. It would have been too far behind the times in terms of both gameplay and technology 
 back then, and it's doubly so today.           It's Quake II all over again, with bland textures 
 and lots of lava.    

 Like Quake III and Unreal Tournament, Hired Team technically has a story -- a truly disposable one. 
 It's the year 2064 and crime is out of control, so a new team of supersoldiers needs to be trained 
 in virtual reality combat arenas. The "Trial" portion of Hired Team: Trial Gold is the equivalent 
 of a single-player campaign, in which you work your way through progressively tougher levels, fighting 
 with and against computer-controlled bots. Game modes include old standbys like deathmatch, team 
 deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and domination. You also get infiltration mode, a watered-down version 
 of Unreal Tournament's assault mode, with just one simple objective: capture or defend a single 
 flag. Playing these modes online against humans, bots, or a mix of the two is no easy task. The 
 game's server browser either doesn't work, or there simply weren't any servers out there (the latter 
 is a distinct possibility) . Even when you're hosting a server, you should be ready for some lag. 
   

  Hired Team plays out in a motley assortment of arenas, including factories with industrial hazards, 
 castles, and the now-obligatory neo-gothic cathedrals with cheesy heavy metal names like "Halls 
 of Suffering." All told, you'll get 28 maps, which would be all well and good if only you could 
 remember any of them five minutes after playing. For the most part, they're uninspired, unoriginal 
 forays through terrain that every shooter fan has seen countless times before. Imagine third-rate, 
 fan-created Quake II maps, and you'll get the idea. A few bounce pads, elevators, and vats of deadly 
 goo are about all that the levels offer in the way of interactivity.   

  Hired Team's arsenal similarly works hard to prove that there's nothing new under the sun. You 
 get a predictable assortment of boring weapons, like a pistol, a shotgun, a rocket launcher, a 
 grenade launcher that works and sounds remarkably like that of Quake III, and so on. None of these 
 have the alternate firing modes that make the weapons of Unreal Tournament so much fun, nor do 
 they have the visceral power and colorful visuals of Quake III's weapons. They're also horribly 
 unbalanced. The default pistol, for instance, is so wimpy as to be essentially worthless. Most 
 all of the other weapons are grossly overpowered and can kill opponents almost instantly.   

  You'll find extra ammo scattered liberally and arbitrarily throughout the levels. The same goes 
 for armor and health items. It's a shame there aren't more inventive items or even just the equivalent 
 of something like Quake III's quad damage or Unreal Tournament's antigrav boots. Hired Team is 
 so dull that it seems to desperately need that kind of variety.   

  When a shooter jettisons storytelling, scripted events, and the other trappings of single-player 
 games to focus on pure combat, it needs to sweat the small stuff all the more. As in most departments, 
 Hired Team falls far short where finer points like physics are concerned. Character movement speed 
 is spot-on for a game of this type, neither too slow nor too frantically fast. On the other hand, 
 the "feel" of the weapons, their apparent heft and strength, leaves lots to be desired, since you 
 never get any sense of your weapons' power. You don't get any decent feedback on damage taken or 
 doled out, either. You'll have to settle for a few generic groans when someone gets blasted. The 
 fact that characters simply vanish when killed (in deference to the game's virtual reality back 
 story) sure doesn't help matters.           Now it's cut-rate Quake III: Arena, with a lame gothic 
 cathedral.    

 Hired Team doesn't do nearly enough with its computer-controlled bot opponents, either. You'll fight 
 a few boring-looking humanoid robots and a few humans with evocative names like Ron. You can select 
 from four bot skill levels that affect their basic combat abilities but sure don't make up for 
 their lack of smarts where coordinated games like capture-the-flag are concerned. You can issue 
 commands to bots through a branching menu, but they seem to ignore your orders. Adding bots to 
 an online game is a tedious chore, requiring you to select each one individually and assign its 
 team manually.   

  As far as its presentation goes, Hired Team offers loads of fancy graphics configuration options. 
 However, they don't matter, because the game's graphics engine can't compete with today's shooters 
 built around the Quake III, Unreal, or Serious Sam engine. A lack of technical polish could have 
 been overcome with artistic imagination and skill, but Hired Team adamantly refuses to offer that. 
 Instead, the game has ugly weapon and character models and boxy maps gratuitously filled with garish 
 lights and mirrored textures like some futuristic disco. The game's sparse, amateurish sound effects 
 similarly fall well short of the mark.   

  Hired Team: Trial Gold has arrived at about the worst possible time. It's a budget-priced game, 
 retailing for around $20, but these days you can buy Quake III or Unreal Tournament for about that 
 price. With either of those, you'll get a vastly better game served by a huge mod community. What's 
 more, Unreal Tournament 2003 is just around the corner, which is sure to make Hired Team: Trial 
 Gold look that much more like the uninspired, antiquated, and poorly designed copycat it is.
