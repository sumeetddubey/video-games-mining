:::Review:::
It's a faithful and occasionally challenging adaptation of the game show, though it's doubtful that 
 many players will get excited about winning imaginary money and prizes. 

 The new edition of Wheel of Fortune from Infogrames attempts to convert the popular American TV 
 game show to a computer game format, and it does a decent enough job. Wheel of Fortune 2003 is 
 quite colorful, and the lovely hostess Vanna White does about as good a job as can be expected, 
 but the game has some pretty low production values and a few annoying technical issues. Beyond 
 that, Wheel of Fortune 2003 is a faithful and occasionally challenging adaptation of the game show, 
 though it's doubtful that many players will get excited about winning imaginary money and prizes. 
           The classic television game show returns, along with hostess Vanna White.    

  The  Wheel of Fortune  TV show has been on the air for about 20 years now, and it lets three contestants 
 attempt to solve a word puzzle by revealing an unknown phrase one letter at a time, with the option 
 to spin the wheel to win large amounts of cash for each letter they uncover. It's a simple enough 
 game, though it can prove surprisingly challenging, which is probably why the show is so popular 
 with so many home viewers. The computer-game adaptation follows the rules of the show nearly to 
 the letter, and it can occasionally be equally challenging, but in the long run, it's probably 
 not as intellectually stimulating as Jeopardy! 2003 (also from Infogrames) . Surprisingly, Wheel 
 of Fortune 2003 actually benefits from the fact that it's a computer game, rather than a TV show 
 in some ways, since the game displays all available letters openly on the screen, conveniently 
 omitting any letters that have already been revealed, so it's a lot easier to keep track of things. 
   

  Unfortunately, Wheel of Fortune 2003 also has a number of drawbacks that make playing it seem less 
 enjoyable and less involving than watching the show. Though the game has plenty of puzzles -- more 
 than enough to keep you busy for a while -- it seems lifeless, despite the presence of the fabulous 
 Vanna White. However, Vanna is all alone -- her co-host, Pat Sajak, is nowhere in sight, and Vanna 
 herself generally doesn't appear on the actual game show floor (but rather, on certain screens 
 and in menus) , so many of the camera angles that show the wheel and the game board often look empty, 
 despite all the colorful trappings. You're also a lot less likely to get excited about the game's 
 prize money, dream vacations, luxury cars, and other winnings, because they're all imaginary. Winning 
 a phony ski trip in a game you play sitting at your computer while listening to canned remarks 
 from your opponents and canned applause from a recorded audience just isn't the same as watching 
 some lucky fellow on TV finally win the dream prize he's always wanted.           It's a decent 
 reenactment of the show, but it lacks some of the excitement.    

  And unfortunately, despite its appropriately gaudy presentation, Wheel of Fortune 2003's production 
 values aren't too spectacular either. The game offers a few different sets, each more garish than 
 the last (which is appropriate, since the TV show is all about bright colors, glitter, and flashing 
 lights) , though they all consist of rather unimpressive-looking and static rendered sets. Even 
 Vanna herself just doesn't look as fabulous as she should, thanks to the game's low-quality full-motion 
 video, which is often cluttered with ugly compression marks and frequently suffers from embarrassing 
 pauses (during which Vanna is frozen helplessly onscreen) as the game loads the rest of the animations 
 from the CD. Thankfully, the game's sound is considerably better -- Vanna's voice samples are generally 
 excellent, and they rarely ever drop or clip together. The same can be said of TV announcer Charlie 
 O'Donnell's voice-over in the game, though the dialogue from your generic computer opponents (an 
 unnamed, invisible female player and an unnamed, invisible male player) can sometimes seem a bit 
 forced.   

  If you're a tremendous fan of the TV show, you may enjoy Wheel of Fortune 2003, since the game 
 does a decent job of reproducing most of the major elements of the TV show. But no matter how you 
 feel about  Wheel of Fortune , you'll probably agree that, despite your chatty opponents and the 
 ubiquitous (and again, fabulous) Vanna White, Wheel of Fortune 2003 seems to lack the excitement 
 and character of the TV show it's based on.

Review:  One of the best real time Tv games ever! This game has perfect graphics, value and revewi tilt. 
 Even though I got this game from a genreal mills cereal, I recomd this game to all my friends. 
 It easy to understand, and you don't have to fell so bad if you lose. If it's a ingle player it 
 is realy easy, because the computer keeps on losing on porpuse. It's an awesome game. 
  
  The gameplay was awesome, and I had fun playing this game for 15 hours. It felt like to best time 
 of my life, However, solo games were a bit harder.
  
  The graphics were the best, it looked all realy, and the cuts scenes looked like it was from real 
 life. However, due to these good graphics it sometimes froze up, it's mostly my computer fault 
 because of low gb.
  
  The music is great, and when you load this game, and it has the credits and the beginging game, 
 the music is awesome! I just love listing to it over and over again.
  
  The value was good because I got it free with my cereal, so the cost was free and good, thats why 
 it's 10, I think you should only rate games 10 for value is if it's free or it's very low.
  
  My reviews tilt about is was good. 
  
  I recomd this game to anyone, but I wish you could 
 save stuff.
