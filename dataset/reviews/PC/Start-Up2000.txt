It lacks the excitement and strategic challenge you might expect from a game about the cutthroat 
 high-tech market. 

 While the idea of a game that's purely a business simulation might sound unappealing, it doesn't 
 mean a game based on managing lots of money can't be fun. The appeal comes from the way that such 
 games let you live out an entrepreneurial fantasy in a risk-free game environment. Unfortunately, 
 French developer MonteCristo Multimedia's latest business simulation, Start-Up 2000, hardly makes 
 this fantasy enjoyable. Several factors in the game contribute to what's simply a confusing experience 
 that at times seems too much like real work than like play.   

  Start-Up 2000 lets you build a high-tech company from the ground up and offers you a chance to 
 become very rich at doing so. You begin the game by choosing the type of product you want to manufacture. 
 You have three options: a mobile video phone, a cyber television, and - interestingly enough - 
 a next-generation game system. After picking a company name, product name, and logo, you find yourself 
 in your new office with seed money in your bank account and a plethora of menus in front of you. 
 A news terminal keeps you updated with business trends and e-mails from your partners and staff. 
 At another computer terminal, you can change out components for your product to keep up with technological 
 advancements. Clicking a financial chart on the wall brings you to a management screen that lets 
 you borrow money, find venture capitalists who want to invest, and view your earnings and stock 
 prices on a series of graphs. On yet another management screen, you can plan a marketing strategy 
 and adjust your price to counter your competitors. At the end of the month, overhead is subtracted 
 from your total capital while profits are added.   

  You can leave your office anytime and enter staff management mode. From here, you can begin hiring 
 staff. The developers apparently went for a graphical style reminiscent of Maxis' popular strategy 
 game The Sims, as all the desks, coffee machines, and workers are portrayed with pastel colors 
 in an isometric perspective. But the graphics could have been much better; for instance, the workers 
 lack personality.   

  There are four distinct floors at your new company: finances, research and development, marketing, 
 and production. Throughout Start-Up 2000, you have to sift through rsums and fill positions 
 with qualified individuals. When you select your workers, a smiley face, which indicates their 
 morale, appears above their heads. You can improve this morale by adding more elements to their 
 break room or by raising their salary. Even so, it's never clear just how much more or less productive 
 your staff becomes. The only indication that you did something right comes at the end of the month 
 when you find out how much money was gained or lost.   

  Start-Up 2000 features several adjustable options, in addition to an exhaustive manual that explains 
 how everything relates to everything else. Even so, the fact that you're unsure of your progress 
 until the month's end makes the gameplay elements seem that much more ineffectual. As a result, 
 jumping from screen to screen tends to get tiresome and even confusing. If the game's interface 
 were easier to navigate, if the staff had more character, and if the countless adjustments you 
 had to make throughout the game had a more immediate effect on your progress, Start-Up 2000 would 
 have been that much better. But as it is, it lacks the excitement and strategic challenge you might 
 expect from a game about the cutthroat high-tech market. If you're looking to sharpen your management 
 skills in a high-tech arena, you're probably better off digging up an old copy of Tom Clancy's 
 Ruthless. com.

Review:  Start-up was a game I once played on a demo disc, I then went out to go buy it, and guess what? 
 , Start-up has got to be the most limited, boring game I've ever played since getting the full 
 version.
  
  The graphics seem to be pretty amazing for the time I had it, when every other game's graphics 
 pretty much sucked :P
  
  It's basically just a game where you try to run a business in a simulation of the 'Real World' 
 in a simulation of the 'Real Market', although the game is set in the future, so I see it pretty 
 difficult to work out how many people are going to buy a videophone... and now they exist, and 
 let me just say, videophones look nothing like the concept Start-up suggests!
  
  I do not recommend anyone to buy this game if they want a good, old-school sim - it sucks.
  
 
  So yeah, I liked the graphics, the rest of the game =
