:::Review:::
If you've ever dreamed about flying any of these bombers or jets, this is as close as you can get 
 outside of paying for a real-life flight. 

  Flight Simulator 2004 add-on creators have their work cut out for them. With thousands of incredible 
 and free mods available for download, commercial products have to be truly special to stand out 
 and justify their expense -- and Shockwave Productions has really delivered this with Wings of Power. 
 Wings of Power may just seem like a plane add-on for Flight Simulator 2004, but it's definitely 
 commercial-quality software: It lets you experience the closest thing to actually  flying  a colorful 
 collection of World War II-era aircraft.  

          Planes in Wings of Power are modeled in exacting detail.     

  Specifically, the program 
 lets WWII buffs take wing in several famous bombers, including the B-17 (F and G) Flying Fortress, 
 B-24 (D and J) Liberator, the B-29A Superfortress, the PB4Y-2 Privateer (a B-24 variant for the 
 Pacific theater) , the Lancaster BIII, and the jet-powered Ar-234B2 Blitz Bomber. A few German jet 
 fighters, the Heinkel HE-162 Salamander (great for sightseeing) , and Focke-Wulf Ta-183 Huckebein, 
 are thrown in for good measure. If you're used to flying any of these classics in games like Combat 
 Flight Simulator 3, prepare for an entirely new level of realism, courtesy of the Flight Simulator 
 2004 engine.  

  The development team claims that users can fly the planes in this simulation using the actual pilot's 
 manuals for the planes that are modeled here, promising close to 100 percent accuracy between the 
 published statistics and in-game performance. In fact, many pages in the 160-page manual are ripped 
 directly out of these original manuals, and the excellent documentation also includes historical 
 facts, cockpit diagrams, flight data, and other helpful information about each aircraft that is 
 modeled. There's even a section on how to use the archaic C-1 and Sperry autopilot systems found 
 in some of the planes.  

  Good as the manual is, we obtained a complete copy of the B-17 Flying Fortress pilot's manual to 
 take the developers up on their challenge -- and sure enough, for the most part, things work as advertised. 
 We were able to take off, fly, and land the bomber using the procedures outlined in the pilot's 
 manual, and all of the switches and gauges were exactly where they should be. The plane stalled 
 at all the right speeds, didn't take kindly to tight turns, and generally flew as the published 
 statistics told us it should fly. The few quirks that did exist were attributable to limitations 
 of the Flight Simulator 2004 engine. For example, turbochargers are not implemented properly, but 
 the Flight Simulator 2004 engine makes doing so impossible.  

  Suffice it to say that if you've ever dreamed about flying any of these bombers or jets, this is 
 as close as you can get outside of paying exorbitant amounts of cash for a real-life flight.  

 
  Sometimes we got so caught up looking around the gorgeous cockpits that we completely forgot to 
 pay attention to the fidelity of the flight modeling. The 2D cockpits are spectacular, and amazingly 
 enough the 3D cockpits are virtually indistinguishable from the 2D versions. Every button, switch, 
 lever, and other component is modeled in exacting detail, covered with textures that look great 
 even at the highest resolutions. Best of all, most of those cockpit accouterments are interactive, 
 so you can use your mouse to adjust nearly every aspect of your plane's performance.  

          Belly landings are fully implemented, much to the chagrin of this B-17's ball turret gunner. 
     

  The texture work all around is superb. When the developers claim they modeled every aircraft down 
 to the last rivet, they mean it -- you can literally count them. The textures also stand up to high-resolution 
 scrutiny inside and out. Using extreme zoom levels in a virtual cockpit usually results in seeing 
 a blurry mess of instruments, but the virtual cockpit instruments in Wings of Power maintain most 
 of their detail and clarity, even when they fill the entire screen. The planes sound about as good 
 as they look, with sonically balanced prop and jet noises that roar, sputter, or whine based on 
 the whims of the throttle.  

  The use of the Flight Simulator 2004 engine may allow for spectacular visuals and impeccable flight 
 modeling, but it comes at a price -- no combat. If you feel that most of the fun of flying simulated 
 warbirds is derived from guiding them through flak-infested skies swarming with fighters to create 
 spectacular explosions deep behind enemy lines, Wings of Power is going to be a complete letdown. 
 Sure, you can load up planes with a variety of historical loadouts -- but all it really does is add 
 weight and shift the center of gravity, dramatically changing the way the plane flies, but not 
 altering the basic "gameplay" one whit. Missions are also included, but they're ferry flights or 
 milk run re-creations of famous historical raids like the strike on the Ploesti refineries.  

 
  The bottom line is that those who crave combat will have to stick with mods like Firepower, while 
 players who enjoy flying for the sake of flying will find that the attention to detail in Wings 
 of Power is certainly worth the price of admission.
