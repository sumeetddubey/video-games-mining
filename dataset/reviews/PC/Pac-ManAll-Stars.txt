Pac-Man All-Stars simply isn't very fun. 

 Pac-Man All-Stars is the latest game in a classic series that peaked in the early 1980s. While the 
 popularity of the early Pac-Man games has yet to be surpassed, there have been several recent attempts 
 to modernize the classic pellet-chomping hero with varying levels of success. Unfortunately, Pac-Man 
 All-Stars falls in the less-successful end of the spectrum simply because it isn't very fun.   
         Pac-Man and his buddies have escaped the mazes, but are now squabbling over pellets.   

 To its credit, All-Stars tries to break new ground by using elements from the classic Pac-Man games 
 in a completely different style of game. The game includes a single-player mode and supports up 
 to four players in multiplayer mode over a LAN or on a single computer. Initially, you can take 
 control of one of several characters from the arcade games, including Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Pac-Man 
 Junior, and Professor Pac-Man, and other characters can be unlocked by successfully completing 
 the game's storyline.   

  But rather than guiding the character through a series of mazes, you enter a series of 3D arenas 
 to engage in a feeding frenzy that is vaguely reminiscent of the classic board game Hungry Hungry 
 Hippos. Each level begins with one character in each corner of the screen. A new batch of pellets 
 then appears, and the characters begin their frenzied munching to see who can accumulate a set 
 amount of points first or who can get the most points in a set amount of time. Once a group of 
 pellets has been gobbled, a few flowers appear in different parts of the arena, and when a character 
 eats a flower, another flight of pellets appears.   

  While this free-for-all pellet gobbling forms the backbone of the game, there are a few elements 
 tossed in to add some variety. In addition to a few pieces of fruit worth different numbers of 
 points, Pac-people can eat the occasional power-up that gives them special abilities for a limited 
 amount of time. Some power-ups, like the magnet or the super speed, make your pellet gobbling more 
 efficient, while others, like the stun bomb and the thieves' mask, help you by putting the other 
 players at a disadvantage temporarily.   

  No Pac-Man game would be complete without a gang of ghosts, so of course Pac-Man All Stars has 
 a group of spooks that players must avoid while they gobble pellets. Unlike the arcade ghost monsters, 
 which could inspire a dark fear due to their life-stealing capacity, these ghosts are only able 
 to take away a few points and stun you for a moment, so they instead inspire the kind of dread 
 you get when you realize the TV show you're watching is about to go to a commercial. The bigger 
 obstacle in the game is the wizard's hat, which can have a variety of consequences if it's triggered. 
 Some of the consequences, like the shrink ray, are merely amusing, while others, like hiccups or 
 "bouncy bouncy," can cause complete mayhem in the game, as players partially lose control of their 
 characters.   

  The game's graphics are adequate, although the levels tend to be fairly uninteresting, and it's 
 difficult in the beginning to determine which parts of the level are at a higher elevation than 
 others, which makes it hard to navigate efficiently. Pac-Man All-Stars does support several screen 
 resolutions, and the characters and environments are colorful but simple. The few scripted story 
 sequences included do little to tie the game together and could have been used more effectively. 
 The sound and music in the game are appropriate, considering the arcade theme, but they both could 
 have been more distinctive.           No need to fear the ghosts, they've been de-clawed.    

 
 In the end, Pac-Man All-Stars simply doesn't live up to its potential. The idea of taking Pac-Man 
 and his groupies on an adventure outside of their maze is immediately appealing, and it offers 
 all sorts of possibilities not explored in Pac-Man All-Stars. Rather than leading the Pac-people 
 on a journey through interesting open environments, you'll be forced to squabble over pellets with 
 the other Pac-people in a series of static arenas that offer little more than bland backgrounds 
 for pellet munching. Rather than providing appropriate opponents in the menacing ghost gang, Pac-Man 
 All-Stars makes the ghosts nearly harmless and casts the other Pac-people as the real enemies. 
 While this twist makes sense in the game's multiplayer mode, it makes less sense in the single-player 
 story mode, and it takes away from the classic Pac-Man-vs.-the-ghosts theme.   

  Overall, Pac-Man All-Stars lacks the kind of clarity in design that made the original Pac-Man games 
 a success, and it doesn't add enough modern elements to successfully stand on its own merits. The 
 game's mishmash combination of Pac-Man parts results in something that could be entertaining as 
 a novelty for short while, but stops short of becoming a game worth playing for any length of time.

Review:  While other games that were redone like BattleZone or Centipede, Pac-Man should have been left 
 alone or redesigned better. Pac-Man doesnt seem to look as original as a Ball with legs and arms. 
 I prefer to see Pac-Man in 2D. Now the puzzles or mazes are radical compared to the same old map 
 we are used to. For some reason the graphics looked like a second rate game compared to other puzzle 
 games. Mario Brothers improved over the years and his adventures are fun. Maps after maps in this 
 game seem pointless where some are just uninspired. If you were to look to buy this game, I recommend 
 you look for an Atari and buy the original Pac-Man.
