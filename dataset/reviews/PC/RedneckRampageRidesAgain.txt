:::Review:::
This isn't a cookie-cutter sequel at all. It's half shoot-em-up, half laugh riot - and that adds 
 up to a damn good deal to me. 

 In this age of ultra-fancy 3D graphics, it's hard to imagine a major publisher like Interplay releasing 
 a first-person shooter that doesn't feature any 3D support at all. But that's just what it did 
 for Redneck Rampage Rides Again - and I'll be danged if it ain't more fun than the original.  

 
 No matter how much you like games based on the Build engine, like Blood, Duke Nukem, or Shadow 
 Warrior, there's no denying it's getting long in the tooth. But it's impressive what Xatrix managed 
 to do with that "old" engine. I'll be the first to admit that Redneck Rampage Rides Again's graphics 
 don't compare to the purty stuff you see in games like Quake II, Hexen II, or Unreal. Still, it 
 don't take a nuclear physicist to decide whether a game looks good or not - and for a game without 
 3D support, Redneck Rampage Rides Again looks pretty durn good.  

 3D purists might whine there's a lot of "pseudo-3D" here, and they've probably got a point. But 
 even they'll have to fess up and admit that there's some impressive stuff here, especially when 
 the action takes you indoors: Beams, girders, staircases, and other objects look so good you feel 
 like you could run into 'em and stub your toe (well, at least until you get really close and start 
 getting a bad case of pixelitis, that is) .  

 But I'm gettin' ahead of myself. After all, some of you might not have a clue what Redneck Rampage 
 Rides Again is all about, so here's the skinny for those of you who've been running from the IRS 
 or living in a cave for the last year. Redneck Rampage Rides Again is the youngun of Redneck Rampage, 
 a game that slapped you into the brogans of Leonard, a hard-workin' fella who ain't got a problem 
 with loading up his shotgun and kickin' some ass to save his hometown of Hickston, Arkansas, from 
 illegal aliens - and we ain't talking about the kind that wade across the Rio Grande, either. These 
 are space critters, and they were making clones of all the locals to do their dirty work.   

 After Redneck Rampage and the Suckin' Grits on Route 66 add-on, Leonard and his good buddy Bubba 
 probably thought they'd seen the end of them ETs - you would too, after being in a full-blown game 
 and an add-on pack - but as they say in Hickston, they wuz wrong. Leonard and Bubba managed to 
 hijack one of them fancy flying disks, but just when they thought they had it made, it took a nosedive 
 into the desert in one of them states west of Texas. When the game opens, you (well, it's actually 
 Leonard) are trying your dangdest to get back to the garden spot that is Hickston.  

 Along the way you square off against vicious jackalopes (rabbits with antlers) , rabid pit bulls, 
 clone bikers who've watched Blue Velvet one too many times ("Don't look at me!") , cheerleaders 
 chucking dynamite batons, and a pack of other critters ranging from placid pigs to scary skeeters. 
   

 If you don't spend any time with it, Redneck Rampage Rides Again might seem skimpy for a sequel: 
 There's only a handful of new weapons and enemies, and it still uses the clumsy multiplayer mode 
 of the original (which means everyone's gotta start at the same time and, as of the publishing 
 of this review, there's no gaming network that supports it) . But the pleasure here's in the details, 
 friends - and the best are the new insult lines the enemies spout.  

 The Skinny Old Coot from the first game won a free trip to Vegas, and he must've paid as much attention 
 to the lingo of the locals as he did to the card count at the blackjack table. When you get close 
 to him he cackles "Groooveee, bay-bee, he he he...." just as he's whipping out a hog leg to end 
 your time on this here planet. Move up into the higher levels, and the Coot starts shouting stuff 
 like "Craps, you lose!" and "New shooter comin' out!" - and while it might sound pretty plain as 
 you read it in this review, it's about fall-down funny when you hear it in the middle of an intense 
 bloodbath.  

 But my fave has gotta be Daisy Mae, the clone cheerleader with the TNT batons. She's got so many 
 good lines there's not room to print 'em all here: "I'm gonna slap you bald-headed!"; "Do you like 
 that, boy?"; "Were you raised in a barn?"; "Now you've gone and done it!" (one of Leonard's multiplayer 
 taunts) ; and my hands-down winner for best line in a computer game: "Now I'm gonna have to open 
 up a can of whoop-ass on you!" - the same line Leonard used at the start of the original Redneck 
 Rampage.  

 Redneck Rampage won't win any awards for its stilted multiplayer mode, but with 14 single-player 
 levels - most of 'em really big - and some interesting diversions involving motorcycles mounted 
 with machine guns and hydro-boats equipped with mortars, there's so much great action here that 
 it doesn't really matter.   

 I've only got a couple of gripes with Redneck Rampage Rides Again, the first being that the lack 
 of 3D support means that the CPU's gotta handle everything - and if you ain't got at least 200MHz 
 of processing power, you can expect severe hiccups in the animation when there's a lot going on 
 at one time. And some of the levels get pretty dark - not dark as in atmosphere, but dark as in 
 it's kinda hard to enjoy the graphics. Sure, there's a gamma adjustment to lighten things up, but 
 if you jack it up so's you can see stuff good, everything looks too washed out.  

 But my biggest gripe is that this is a DOS-based game; even Xatrix admits it runs poorly under Windows 
 95. It wouldn't have been a big deal two or three years ago, and I'm not exactly in love with Windows 
 95, but even I've gotta confess it really does make things like sound-card configuration and multiplayer 
 support a lot simpler for rednecks like me. Hey, Xatrix: Other people have made great first-person 
 shooters using that monopolistic operating system called Windows 95, and you should take a lesson 
 from them.  

 Before I forget, I better let ya know there's some filthy language here, real lowbrow stuff that 
 a lot of people will consider utterly offensive. Then again, if that sort of thing offends you 
 then you probably wouldn't be in the market for a blood-drenched shooter that makes fun of poor 
 white trash in the first place.  

 It's a little hard to tell someone to shell out 40 or 50 bucks for a sequel that at first glance 
 seems pretty much like the original. But the key words here are "first glance," and once you get 
 into Redneck Rampage Rides Again you'll see that this isn't a cookie-cutter sequel at all. It's 
 half shoot-em-up, half laugh riot - and that adds up to a damn good deal to me.

Review:  Redneck Rampage Rides Again is one of those uncommon (with regard to early entries in the FPS genre, 
 that is) sequels that uses the exact same game engine as its predecessor. Titles like Blood and 
 Half-Life originated on a licensed assembler (the Build and Quake engine, respectively) , then evolved 
 their own homegrown production elements to serve as the flagship release for the lauded Lithtech 
 and Source development kit. Like Doom 2, RRRA is essentially a massive expansion pack for the original 
 title. Leonard and Bubbas hillbilly hunting trip is all gussied up with a few new critters and 
 some nice new toys. Additions in the latter category include weapons like the chicken crossbow 
 -- which adds a fowl-guided tracking system to Leonards dynamite launcher -- and the sling blade 
 -- which is gruesomely fun to use despite the fact that melee weapons arent always a wise selection 
 for a gunfight.
  
  Leonard also gains access to a chopper rigged with handlebar-mounted machine guns and a flat-bottomed 
 punt complete with a powerful mortar launcher. Neither vehicle functions very realistically, but 
 both are fun to use, especially the motorcycle. RRRA contains a fairly large racetrack and stunt 
 arena for hog riders, and even though the big air jumps employ some mighty sketchy physics, they 
 provide a welcome break from padding around on foot. The air boat is essential for saving a lot 
 of time that Leonard might otherwise spend slogging slowly through the swamp, but trying to gauge 
 an accurate shot with the cannon had me reaching for my bow or rifle instead more often than not.
 
  
  Redneck Rampage was an incredibly entertaining and endearing game, so simply expanding it further 
 under the guise of a sequel does not feel like overkill. The new material in Rides Again adds a 
 lot of mileage to the series cornpone formula, leading Leonards adventures in the great big world 
 (well, the Midwest, anyhow) with the same boozy, wild-eyed, blissfully ignorant sensibility that 
 made all the in-jokes and scatological grossness so identifiable and genuinely hilarious in the 
 first go-round.
