:::Review:::
Klingon Honor Guard is a decent action game utilizing the Star Trek franchise. 

 Klingon Honor Guard is essentially an average shooter using Star Trek as a backdrop. The premise 
 is that you're a trainee in the Klingon Honor Guard, when the High Council suddenly gets bombed. 
 Since you're the new guy, you can't be a part of the traitorous conspiracy, so you're sent out 
 to avenge the honor of the slain council members. The game is divided up into 28 levels divided 
 among 20 units.   

 At first, the gameplay seems goal based, like Jedi Knight, but it's in fact more of the key-hunting 
 monotony of past shooters. No matter what, you always end up hunting down some item, whether it's 
 a palm print or a retinal scan, to open some door, which gets you closer to the last room, which 
 signals the end of the level. In between the units are video briefings, which do a good job of 
 laying out your objective. But because of limitations of the Unreal engine, the videos always play 
 in a separate window, putting your computer on window-swapping mayhem whenever a briefing pops 
 up. Don't even bother with viewing the introduction, because it's Klingon History 101, using stiff 
 animations combined with stock footage of volcanoes, and it's a real yawner.   

 The level design in the early part of the game is lackluster but gets better as the game progresses. 
 I was about to dismiss the game by the second level, but luckily, as I played some more, I was 
 rewarded with some really interesting design later on. You get to tour locales such as the Rure 
 Penthe prison that was seen in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, a space station, and even 
 a Klingon Bird of Prey (both inside and out) . The later levels show off the Unreal engine's color 
 and aesthetics, and were laid out in a logical fashion and utilized some interesting triggers (such 
 as a prison riot) .   

 The enemy design doesn't progress as nicely though. The Klingons replace the Skaarj, which means 
 you basically fight the same Klingons over and over, except they change clothing and weapons depending 
 on where you fight them. They retain the dodging maneuvers of Unreal's Skaarj, and they also "play 
 dead" at times. The levels are also more populated here than in Unreal, so you face a lot of Klingons, 
 which got a bit tiresome for me. The other enemies include your standard security robot type, some 
 Andorians (who seem to be like Klingons but slower) , the Nausicaans (Klingons but uglier) , and 
 some annoying animals (dogs, scorpions, and pigs) . The only really interesting enemy is the Lethian, 
 because it has stealth capabilities.   

 The weapon design is average, with four token Star Trek weapons, some standard weapons found in 
 most other shooters, and one really nice ubergun. The two Star Trek guns are the disruptor pistol 
 and rifle, which have the saving grace of a nice disintegration effect, and the other two weapons 
 are a knife and the Bat'Leth (that curved Klingon battle sword) . Then we have the spinning disk 
 from Unreal, the rocket launcher (with an additional twist of heat-seeking rockets) , the grenade 
 launcher, and a rail gun (called "Sith Har" here) . The ubergun, the particle dispersal cannon, 
 is really nice because it either fires a massive energy wave or creates a miniature black hole. 
   

 And while MicroProse made a lot of tweaks to the engine, the multiplayer is still hampered by the 
 limitations that have plagued Unreal. MicroProse is promising to work with Epic on the infamous 
 multiplayer patch, but for now, consider Klingon Honor Guard to be a single-player game.  

 Klingon Honor Guard is a decent action game utilizing the Star Trek franchise. It's fun to wield 
 that famed Bat'Leth - the Klingon-style one-liners your character dishes out are amusing. If you're 
 a Star Trek fan, you'll probably appreciate the levels and enemies. But judged on its merits as 
 a shooter, Klingon Honor Guard suffers because of its average design.

Review:  This game is actually quite good... the story and videos make it quite worth playing through..... 
 I started playing it a while back and from the score it got I didn't think it would be good... 
 I picked it up again and I was quite suprized at how good it was once I got the 3D rendering working. 
 That was not an easy task but software mode is terrible looking. I actually had to go back and 
 install it on my old windows 98 computer to get it running. There isn't a lot of different types 
 of enemies during the game and the single player game is not very long. I finished the game and 
 there's not a lot of replayability in the game for me, but the single player story makes it worth 
 playing through once.

Review:  Can someone please tell me what the whole purpose of this game was? I couldn't figure it out. It 
 was a huge dissappointment to say the least. I spent hours running around the same limited map 
 trying to figure this game out.
  
  I have never played a FPS so frustrating as this one. Hands down if you want this game seek immediate 
 medical help. Or email me, I will be happy to sell you my copy for the right price.
  
  Overall this game, based on the unreal game engine of the time, was just simply bug filled, no 
 content, hack of a game.
  
  There was no plot to the game, or at least not one that I could find, and the action and game play 
 were just simply lacking.
  
  A horrible game.

Review:  I've had this game since like 1999 and its a fun shooter. The story mode is indepth and some of 
 the mission objectives are challenging. Some additional game play options consist of tournament 
 melee mode in which you can battle against or with A. I. Bots and other human players. Tournament 
 mode was why I played the game because it allows you to explore the levels in the game, set up 
 pitched battles and mindlessly blow the crap out of each other. Granted this can get tidious as 
 times, but this game is still entertaining if you ever feel like blowing people away with star 
 trek weapons.
