:::Review:::
These are classic games that belong on every computer gamer's shelf, no doubt about it. 

 X-Wing and TIE Fighter have such an elevated place in the hearts of so many gamers that they have 
 passed beyond mere computer games and into the realm of legend. Other games are compared with them, 
 usually unfavorably, and the gameplay is so strong that people still return to them despite their 
 aging graphics.  

 LucasArts knows when it has a good thing and has packaged and rebundled these games incessantly, 
 with add-on discs, deluxe editions, bundles, and so forth. In the latest repackaging, it has taken 
 the complete X-Wing and TIE Fighter, with all missions and campaigns, and a limited version of 
 X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter and bundled them in one package. Having them all together in one box helps 
 reduce shelf space and gives new computer users who may have missed these classics a chance to 
 try them, but the bundle feels curiously unfulfilling.   

 No special new missions or campaigns have been added for this release, and gameplay has only been 
 very lightly tweaked by a few bug fixes. The major new appeal is complete hardware-acceleration 
 support for X-Wing and TIE Fighter, which none of the previous bundles or upgrades offered. Support 
 via Direct3D is stable and fairly effective. Essentially, both games have been retrofitted with 
 the X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter engine. Smoothing and shading, some enhanced textures and modeling, 
 and a few lighting effects generally make things look better but not outstanding. These are still 
 old games, and even the X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter engine is looking a bit long in the tooth. No matter 
 what hardware tricks Lucas uses, you can't escape the fact that space-combat games of the last 
 six months (Wing Commander: Prophecy, Descent: Freespace, even X-COM: Interceptor) look much better. 
 The cockpits and wraparound material have been enhanced but still look a bit dated and even cheesy 
 at times.  

 The included version of X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter has 14 missions and nine spacecraft. You can play 
 online with up to eight people, but only against other people who have this specific version and 
 only via LAN or modem. Internet play is not supported. The game is also incompatible with the full 
 version of X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, and I found no disc-spawning option. The result is a glorified 
 demo.  

 These are classic games that belong on every computer gamer's shelf, no doubt about it. The packages 
 are completely Win95 native, easily installed, and easy on the hard drive. With about 250 total 
 missions, it's hard to really complain at $29.95. (No rebates are offered for registered owners 
 of any of the other games, and no download of the new hardware support is available.) If this bundle 
 feels like more of the same with only very modest additions for fans, that doesn't undermine the 
 essential value or the appeal of two-and-a-half landmark games.

Review:  X-Wing, and soon after TIE Fighter, are simply put two of the greatest PC games ever. They are 
 also considered by many (especially most 30+ years old) to be the definitive Star Wars games.
 
  
  These are immersive, balanced, long, exciting games. The missions come one after another in linear 
 fashion, but you have a great degree of freedom within each individual mission. Between the unfolding 
 action, the music, and the chatter of your teammates, you will likely feel that you are right there 
 with the Rebels, attacking the Death Star, protecting your capital ship, and so on. 
  
  You will end up using 20+ keys on your keyboard along with a joystick, but it starts to come pretty 
 intuitively. The graphics are not going to knock your socks off these days, but I vividly remember 
 the simple MIDI soundtrack having a stranglehold on my emotions (the music changes with current 
 events in the missions) and expect that it still would today.
  
  X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter is not the same masterpiece, as it is multiplayer-only. Considering that 
 the Collector's Ed. versions of X-Wing and TIE now feature the upgraded graphics of XvT, it is 
 not revolutionary in any way, and is best considered a "bonus" to be played with friends for a 
 few hours of fun.
  
  It is hard to believe that i first played X-Wing SEVENTEEN years ago. There is still nothing that 
 has matched it, apart from TIE Fighter. This game is as much a classic as Super Mario Bros., in 
 my opinion. If you can find it, grab it, and poke around the net for the minor tweaks you might 
 need to make in order to get it running on XP or Vista.
