It will prove that EA Sports can produce a racing sim that's as realistic and exciting as the best 
 racing games on the market. 

 These are wonderful times for racing-sim fans. Over the last two years, there have been top-notch 
 simulations in nearly every category, from superbikes to road rallying to GT sports-car racing. 
 EA Sports' new F1 2000 is another strong contender, and despite a few problems in the retail version, 
 the game will doubtless achieve at least one goal: It will prove that EA Sports can produce a racing 
 sim that's as realistic and exciting as the best racing games on the market.  

 But before you open up a new browser window and head to your favorite online store to buy a copy, 
 you should bear in mind that the game does have a few potential problems, such as its steep system 
 requirements. EA Sports recommendeds a 450MHz system with 128MB RAM, which is probably slightly 
 higher than what the average consumer is using - but the harsh fact is that such hardware is only 
 average according to F1 2000's internal rating system. What it all boils down to is that if you 
 want to see this game in high resolution in its full glory, you'll need at least a 600MHz machine 
 with a fast 3D accelerator. As such, you may find yourself gradually reducing the game's detail 
 setting and even turning off the mirrors to get the smooth animation needed to drive an F1 2000 
 car at 200 miles per hour.  

 The good news is that some judicious tweaking can eventually provide a frame rate you can live with 
 and also race with, provided you can avoid the maniac antics of the computer-controlled drivers 
 who've apparently decided they're participating in Death Race 2000 instead. It's to be expected 
 that most F1 crashes take place at the start of races, but at times F1 2000 feels too chaotic, 
 especially when you check replays and see drivers viciously slamming into you when there's plenty 
 of room for them to pass safely by. And earning the pole position is no guarantee of safety, because 
 for some mysterious reason, the opposing cars tend to blow by you at mind-boggling speeds off the 
 start line as you either spin out of control or are immediately hit by some crazed Frenchman.  
 

 Then again, no one said F1 was for wimps. And once you get adjusted to the bump-tap-crash tactics 
 of the computer opponents, you can get set to enjoy the most exhaustively authentic F1 game currently 
 available - at least as far as modern-day cars are concerned. Every track and driver from the 2000 
 season is available in F1 2000, though some tracks seem a bit narrower than they do on TV. F1 2000 
 lets you craft your own persona as you race for the championship, and its quick-race mode is a 
 joy to use. You get to bypass qualifying and warm-ups, but you also have the ability to choose 
 your start position, as well as head to the garage and fine-tune your car and even load a predefined 
 setup based on your experiences in the game's test-day mode.  

 All 17 F1 circuits are available in any mode you race in, which gives you every opportunity to learn 
 the distinct nuances of braking and shifting that separate winners from losers. The game's engine 
 sounds are a bit tinny, though they do accurately reflect the location of vehicles screaming alongside 
 you, and the game's garage setup options are about as extensive as you'll ever find in any racing 
 game you can buy. They're not just for show, either: If you fiddle with tire pressures, gear ratios, 
 differential lock, and dozens of other settings, you'll immediately feel the difference out on 
 the track.  

 The 17 circuits include a track for every taste - Hockenheim for the speed freaks, Suzuka for the 
 corner burners, Monza for the purists, and on and on. You can easily customize your controller 
 for use with F1 2000, though activating force feedback seems to have a major impact on the game's 
 frame rate. So aside from the overly aggressive computer opponents and the game's steep hardware 
 requirements, about the only knock against F1 2000 is its lack of an online multiplayer matchup 
 service, as the only way to hook up online is by exchanging IP addresses and hoping the lag isn't 
 too bad. But a quick glance at the F1 2000 web site reveals that soon you'll be able to test your 
 mettle on virtual courses against the times of real-life drivers at the most recent F1 events, 
 so a dedicated matchmaking service can't be far behind.  

 As a company that many racing-sim fans didn't believe to be a serious contender, EA Sports has now 
 proven it can run with the best on just about any circuit imaginable, thanks in large part to F1 
 2000. If your system can handle the game, then you'll find that it's one of the best F1 racing 
 sims to date.

Review:  Formula 1 fans aren't really well catered for by the games market these days, however this game 
 is one of the classics from back in the day.
  
  Featuring all the cars, drivers and circuits from the 2000 F1 season, this game allows you to truly 
 live the experience of a demanding F1 season (well, aside from the millionaire lifestyle and gorgeous 
 women) , with challenging, exciting races. 
  
  The graphics are of good quality, though at the time of release you really needed a top-end machine 
 to really get the most out of it. On modern machines though, it looks brilliant. The sound to is 
 realistic, with ITV-F1 presenter Jim Rosenthal giving voiceovers for the championship tables and 
 introducing each Grand Prix. A nameless voice also talks to you over the cars radio while you are 
 out on the track informing you of dangers on the circuit, when to pit etc. The sound effects are 
 realistic though the sounds during crashes are a bit weak. 
  
  The cars all handle realistically, though at times a little too realistically. Playing with a keyboard 
 means that you will have to use a few of the driver aides to have any success, as the throttle 
 is so powerful without them that your car will simply spin as you try and accelerate. 
  
  Crashes are spectacular, however the damage modelling isn't particularly realistic, and short of 
 losing wheels, wings and generally looking battered the cars don't sustain any truly severe damage. 
 When they are damaged they handle badly which adds realism to the experience, though it does not 
 mean they are impossible to drive. I have won GP's completing 40+ laps with no wings and two wheels 
 hanging off for example. This is probably due to the weakness of the computer drivers. They have 
 a tendency to be overly aggressive and to not be particularly fast. Even with the difficulty turned 
 up they aren't really a serious challenge over long race distances.
  
  You choose the race distance, as a percentage of the real-life race distance. I personally always 
 choose 100% and keep a 2 hour slot free for a truly realistic experience. Each circuit is unique 
 and very accurately modelled in the game and some at full race distance are incredibly challenging. 
 You can also use a quick race mode whereby you do not take part in practice or qualifying, but 
 simply choose your start position and go into the race. This makes for an interesting challenge 
 if you deliberately start last and try and work your way through the field as quickly as possible.
 
  
  On the whole this is a solid game, and caters well for its market. It could be improved though, 
 and I long for the day when a current day F1 driving sim game is released, as with today's technology 
 it could be spectacular. For now though I shall continue to be happy with F1 2000, and would recommend 
 it to fellow F1 fans.

Review:  F1 Championship Season 2000 introduces some new features. The most notable of these is the new 
 driving school mode, All 17 F1 circuits are available in any mode you race in, which gives you 
 every opportunity to learn the distinct nuances of braking and shifting that separate winners from 
 losers. The game's engine sounds are a bit tinny, though they do accurately reflect the location 
 of vehicles screaming alongside you, and the game's garage setup options are about as extensive 
 as you'll ever find in any racing game you can buy. They're not just for show, either: If you fiddle
