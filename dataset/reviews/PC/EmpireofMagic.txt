:::Review:::
Regardless of whether you're looking for a turn-based strategy game or a role-playing game, Empire 
 of Magic will probably disappoint you. 

  Empire of Magic appears to be yet another game in the long line of descendents of King's Bounty, 
 the classic New World Computing game that helped create the fantasy turn-based strategy genre. 
 It's a genre that has produced some great games, including the Heroes of Might and Magic series, 
 the Age of Wonders series, and the Disciples series. Unfortunately, while Empire of Magic resembles 
 these games on the surface, and it too features hero units who travel with support units, as well 
 as towns where you can hire more units, it is entirely different from those other games. It can 
 best be described as a turn-based role-playing game with a strange combat system, and at times 
 it plays more like a poorly designed board game, where the rules don't make much sense but instead 
 exist only to make you carefully scrutinize your every move.  

          NPCs will ask you to perform many tasks in broken English.     

  The game might have 
 been better had the designers actually made a decision between making a Heroes of Might and Magic 
 clone or making a role-playing game. Empire of Magic has elements of both, but they just interfere 
 with one another. The game is broken up into chapters, and in each chapter you'll need to make 
 your way to some location, performing various side quests along the way. The characters you meet 
 speak in a strange dialect, one that indicates that the game was developed outside the United States 
 and localized by nonlocals. These characters will give you tasks, forcing you to walk your units 
 across the map, one turn at a time. However, the game's designers don't seem to understand that 
 there's a reason most role-playing games switch to real time when you aren't fighting. Slowly moving 
 your units from one place to another makes up half the game, and it gets annoying quickly.  

  Each turn can take a fair amount of time. Often, you'll be engaged in battle alongside a large 
 force of friendly units that aren't directly under your control. They fight, move, and run around 
 while you watch, and when that friendly army is huge, the wait for your turn is accordingly lengthy. 
 But until you get used to the game's bizarre combat system, you'll end up reloading several of 
 your previously saved games and repeatedly sitting through many of these drawn-out battles.  

 
  Empire of Magic doesn't follow the traditional combat formula of most fantasy strategy games, 
 wherein battles are a distinct game within the game. Instead, your units expend action points by 
 moving around -- but they carry over these same action points into combat, so you need to conserve 
 these points at all times. The combat itself is simple -- you just choose to cast a spell or attack, 
 and your units get to it. Your options change depending on whether you are attacking or defending. 
 For instance, when defending, you can choose to have one character protect another, but you don't 
 have this option when attacking. The converse is true for fleeing -- you can escape combat voluntarily 
 only if you are the attacker. The attacker always moves first, so your units' speed does not play 
 a part in combat. However, if your units happen to have more action points than your opponent's, 
 you can keep fighting without retaliation once your opponent runs out. Likewise, if you attack 
 an enemy party that has used all its action points, you can pretty much wipe it out without sustaining 
 any damage, even if your enemies were much stronger.  

          The combat is almost entirely lacking in strategy.     

  The game's combat system is 
 certainly unique, but unfortunately, it also doesn't make any sense, and it never seems like anything 
 more than a set of arbitrary game rules that you must learn to exploit, using one group to go in 
 and whittle down your enemies' action points and then sending in another to finish them off. The 
 more obvious downside to this system is that your units can also be attacked, and easily killed, 
 when they have no action points. You'll automatically fail a mission if one of your heroes is killed, 
 which can be extremely frustrating in the early portion of the game, when one or two hits is enough 
 to kill a hero and send you back to the load game screen. This particular issue becomes less of 
 a problem as your heroes get stronger, but the combat system never gets more interesting.  

  It doesn't help that Empire of Magic looks as bad as it does. On the map, your units are primarily 
 colorful little blobs with no real personality. In combat, they take shape but don't show any character. 
 And the fog of war that blankets the screen is just a black mass, reminiscent of the fog used in 
 Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. The audio is likewise poor and has very little in the way of sound effects. 
 The game's occasional voice acting is generally terrible. The music -- an appropriately epic orchestral 
 score -- is the only saving grace of the game's otherwise barren audio.  

  Regardless of whether you're looking for a turn-based strategy game or a role-playing game, Empire 
 of Magic will probably disappoint you. The quest-based system is hindered by the game's turn-based 
 movement, which requires you to use several turns just to travel across the map and talk to someone. 
 And the game lacks any real strategic elements, other than making sure your units always have plenty 
 of action points available, or performing hit-and-run attacks to make sure your opponent's units 
 don't. The only real point in Empire of Magic's favor is that it's a relatively long game -- but 
 it's made even longer by the fact that you'll inevitably be forced to play the same turns over 
 and over again.

Review:  When I bought the game some years ago, I had a really good time with it, recently I played it again... 
 thats why I came here to see what people said about it, and to my surprise, The review here is 
 kind of an opposite of what I thought about Empire of Magic!
  
  the game-play is what you might expect from a turn-based fantasy game, taking care of your units 
 and trying to balance the strenght of your new characters! Which one of the new characters will 
 I take, which one of the old ones will I keep???... though decisions if you know what i mean...
 
  
  Good ambient, sounds and nice old-school atmosphere.
  
  The only two problems with the game, first, was the crashes at certain point, but that was solved 
 immediately with the patch.
  
  Another problem was the design of the battle screen, specially the awful line that marks your units 
 attack to the foe...
  
  But... in the end you get used to it, and more because of the really great time you have trying 
 to figure out the strategy to follow on every new step you take and on every new scenario you open... 
 and the GREAT feeling of watching your units grow up in effectiveness and eventually getting the 
 job done, well enough to advance to the next stage and becoming very powerful, strategically designed 
 (upgraded) units from your limited army... yes!, the one that will be with you 'till the end! ... if 
 some cool new unit appears later... that is...
  
  A very rewarding experience if you are into Turn-based games, a genre I specially like above others!
 
  
  The strenght of this game, as I said, is the bond you create with your creatures and heroes. Gameplay 
 is a second thought... you are there!
  those creatures are yours to command, Your job is to keep them safe, attack when you feel the time 
 is right and get through like a champion!
  
  My score is 8.5 because it's a deep strategic game, a great attempt when the masses are going into 
 pure action and no substance... This kind of games like Empire of Magic doesnt grow up in trees 
 this days! :)
  
  If you find it somewhere, Get it!, at this point it might be cheap... so, don't think twice... 
 have a good time!!!
