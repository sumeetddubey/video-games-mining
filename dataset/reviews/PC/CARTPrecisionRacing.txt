CART Precision Racing raises the bar for serious racing simulations. 

 Ever since the release of Indianapolis 500 almost seven years ago, Papyrus has remained the undisputed 
 king of hard-core racing simulations. While many established software houses have produced offerings 
 with improved graphics, sound, and other frills, none has managed to outperform Papyrus's top-notch 
 driving model.   

 Daring to tread where so many have failed, upstart Terminal Reality (previously known for the decidedly 
 arcade-like Hellbender and Monster Truck Madness) has produced a surprisingly realistic driving 
 model that not only matches that of Papyrus's excellent IndyCar II in complexity but may even surpass 
 it in some respects. For example, the vehicles in CART Precision actually turn with the front wheels, 
 not the center of gravity. While this may seem like a small matter on paper, it has a great impact 
 onscreen. Essentially, it makes each and every movement of the car seem absolutely credible in 
 both appearance and "feel." Factor in Z-axis motion, and the resulting driving model is dead on. 

 This excellent driving model is further complemented by a fully functional garage that sets a new 
 standard in racing simulations. Not only are the cars now fully customizable down to the smallest 
 detail, but novice drivers can actually have the computer do all the hard work for them. By answering 
 a series of simple, multiple-choice questions about the car's performance on the track, the computer 
 will actually tweak most of the car's major settings for you. More advanced users will be happy 
 to learn that CART Precision offers a plethora of gears and gadgets to play with, and, if you get 
 a bit confused, a handy voice-over describes the function of each and every rivet at the click 
 of a button.  

 As if the driving model and garage features were not enough, Microsoft has upped the ante again 
 by incorporating superlative multiplayer capabilities. While most simulations provide some form 
 of LAN and modem support, CART Precision goes one step further by offering unlimited free Internet 
 play for up to eight players via Microsoft's own Internet Gaming Zone.   

 Of course, all of this attention to detail means nothing without a strong graphics engine to convey 
 a sense of speed. Fortunately, CART precision once again takes the checkered flag. The cars, stadiums, 
 and tracks all appear almost identical to their real-life counterparts and (with a 3Dfx card) move 
 at a very convincing frame rate - even with all effects switched on. In fact, the only hint of 
 slowdown occurs when several cars appear onscreen at once, but this is a minor annoyance.  

 This is not to say that CART Precision is perfect. For example, Microsoft has insisted that every 
 game it produces maintain a Windows 95 look and feel - regardless of its practicality. What this 
 means for gamers is that every screen has a standard Windows 95 pull-down menu for quick and easy 
 access to most program options. Unfortunately, every time this menu bar is accessed, full-screen 
 3D accelerators switch off, causing the screen to go black for a few seconds. At 230mph, a few 
 seconds is all it takes to transform your new IndyCar into a greasy smear on the barrier wall. 
 While these menu bars are very helpful for spreadsheets and word processors, they have little practical 
 use within a computer game. Fortunately, the remaining quirks do not truly interfere with gameplay, 
 and can thus be easily dismissed. CART Precision Racing raises the bar for serious racing simulations. 
 While this rather sweeping pronouncement may anger many fans of Papyrus Software's NASCAR and IndyCar 
 sims, there can be little doubt that Microsoft has managed to at least match the complexity and 
 accuracy of the Papyrus offerings, while surpassing them in presentation. If you are a fan of hard-core 
 racing simulations, you must take this CART for a spin.

Review:  Microsoft releases CART Precision Racing, a game which knows how to impress and satisfy with its 
 overall picture. Unfortunately is it enough for everyone, but it is a game made only for the fans 
 of CART races.
  
  In CART Precision Racing, you will have to drive your CART to victory, through the American stages 
 of the CART league. The game offers authenticity, both with drivers and CART vehicles, while the 
 tracks you play in are also authentical.
  
  In the game, apart from the Career mode or the Solo race or training, you will experience the real 
 job of being a driver. This is helped by the very deep-origined garage. In the garage, you can 
 tune your car's performance as you like it to be, from the front tires to the hood of it. You can 
 also save the changes you have made or try them in a test drive.
  
  There is also a good multiplayer mode, which is otherwise difficult to use and non-user friendly, 
 preventing players from playing online. But it is still a good concept.
  
  The graphics are good, but they carry many bugs which are difficult to avoid or face successfully. 
 The visual options are not improving enough through more powerful systems and that's what makes 
 the game a bit shallow. But the commentating and sounbds on the track are really pleasing and realistic.
 
  
  CART Precision Racing is an innovative game, but that doesn't mean that it makes the difference. 
 Multiple bugs and some bad environments for the newbies are the cons of the game.
