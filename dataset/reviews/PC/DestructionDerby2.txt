:::Review:::
It's definitely a better looking and more playable game than the original PC Destruction Derby. 
 

 Let's face it: at a certain age, destroying your toys becomes more enjoyable than playing with them. 
 When you were a kid playing with matchbox cars, did you ever actually race them against each other? 
 I thought not. No, you slid the little die-cast speedsters as hard as you could at one another 
 until they smashed to pieces on the kitchen linoleum. Am I saying that this is the correct way 
 to play with matchbox cars, that one should be encouraged to enact scenes of demolition with his 
 playthings? Yes, because it's fun.  

 Fun, in case you were wondering, is what games are all about. Few auto racing games actually let 
 the player do more than nail down the accelerator and brake around turns. Last year's Destruction 
 Derby was a refreshing break from this monotonous trend, combining stimulating, competitive racing 
 with the meaningless vandalism that action gamers crave. It was the first racing title to come 
 along that encouraged you to and rewarded you for driving straight into oncoming traffic - now 
 THAT'S a racing game. Psygnosis have finally released the sequel, and gamers who appreciated the 
 irrational smash-'em-up mentality of the original PC version are sure to get a kick out of riding 
 on the hard driving path that is Destruction Derby 2.  

 The most notable enhancement in DD2 is your car's ability to leave the road - skyward. Courses now 
 include banks and jumps that send speeding cars flying into the stratosphere, colliding mid-air 
 with other cars, eventually landing on more cars, only to skid on the ground and bash into yet 
 more cars. Vehicles have to take jumps with caution or risk corkscrewing and landing completely 
 upside down, helpless as toppled turtles. Occasionally, car physics push the limits of reality. 
 Sometimes, when a car takes to the air, it careens overhead in slow motion as though someone had 
 turned on the anti-gravity machine. Surprisingly this detour from true car physics just adds to 
 dramatic quality of the action.   

 Crash scenes have also improved. Cars now spew more parts than an auto shop when blindsided. Vehicles 
 can also lose hoods and wheels, driving around with engines exposed, trailing sparks as their bare 
 axles scrape the ground. Damage is the word when it comes to racing in Destruction Derby 2, which 
 lends new meaning to the term "eliminate the competition."  

 Seven new race tracks, ranging from winding desert roads to nighttime streets, are introduced in 
 the game, and the races here seem to be much more difficult to win compared to the original. Additionally, 
 Psygnosis has heeded the cries of the gaming masses, introducing four new destruction derby tracks 
 (wherein the sole objective is to disable other cars) for our demolition pleasure. The last of 
 these, called the "Death Bowl," features an inescapable chasm that cars can be knocked into. Playing 
 in "Total Destruction" mode (where all vehicles, as if operating as a unit, abandon all other causes 
 and go straight after YOUR car) , you can lure a pack of vehicles to the edge of this pit and swiftly 
 move away, watching them tumble over to their smoky deaths.  

 The graphics and playability of Destruction Derby 2 aren't as silky as they were in the Playstation 
 version, but it's definitely a better looking and more playable game than the original PC Destruction 
 Derby. Combine the new improvements with a bold, sludge-metal soundtrack and you've got a great 
 sequel to Destruction Derby. The main complaint you could lodge against this game is that, compared 
 to the previous title, the other cars are nearly impossible to overtake during a race. Still, if 
 you're looking for more chassis-crushing fun in a game that ends up somehow being even more silly 
 than the original, Destruction Derby 2 is your ticket.

Review:  Great game i was even happy just owning the DEMO version with the one only good track in the entire 
 game haha.
  
  That one part just after the finish line where the road narrows and u park your car sideways across 
 causing every car to pile up is CLASSIC! ill never forget that part it made the game.
  
  The bowls/arenas in the game are OK, there very hard just like the tracks.
  
  Sound is decent 
 graphics are blurry even for its time.
  
  value: its FREE! you can download this game at almost any abandonware website.
  
  The worst 
 part about this game was the controls, steering your car was somtimes impossible with other cars 
 trying to bump you off the road.
  
  Good game fun factor is hilarious even
