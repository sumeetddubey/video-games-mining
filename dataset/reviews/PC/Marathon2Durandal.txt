Marathon 2 is a distance runner, and with all its perks and goodies should more than tide over the 
 3-D shooter fanatic until the totally customizable Marathon Infinity comes out for the PC. 

 
 Office productivity has a new enemy, and its name is Marathon 2: Durandal. Set 17 years after the 
 extraterrestrial unpleasantness aboard the starship Marathon, this flashier, nastier, first-person 
 corridor-crawler puts the player at the unenviable beck and call of Durandal, the rogue artificial 
 intelligence from the first game. Durandal, still a little disturbed (in the first raid-party mission 
 he gleefully tells you that he has been introducing the beleaguered alien defenders to "the magic 
 of orbital bombardment") , has brought the galactic war to the Pfhor stomping grounds. Just guess 
 who gets to be the point-man.   

 The original Marathon was no small achievement, but Marathon 2 absolutely shines: Somewhere along 
 the line, the aliens got a lot smarter, and they know how to use local conditions and features 
 to their advantage, bobbing into an aperture just long enough to take a few cheap shots at you 
 before ducking back (although a few well-placed grenades will bring that kind of crap to a thundering 
 fireball of a halt) . The stereo panning and ambient sounds (running water, chittering aliens and 
 thrumming machinery straight from the dripping corridors of the Nostromo) make headphones a must; 
 a larger viewing area shows off special effects like flickering light sources, underwater exploration 
 (and it's about time - the game is called Marathon, right?) , striking outdoor environments under 
 vast moon-cluttered alien skies, really gross-out monsters with gaping maws for chests (the first 
 time one of these things came at me around a blind corner, I damn near recoiled right out of my 
 chair) , and player-friendly humans (Born-on-Boards or "BOBs") who splatter yellow blood if they 
 were actually alien-assimilated Trojan-horse mutants, or red blood if - oops - it turns out they 
 weren't.  

 And what about BOB? Well, first of all, he's not like he was in the last game - in other words, 
 a useless, whining, panicked, unarmed civilian whom you'd just as soon shoot in the back (and in 
 fact often did) as look at. No, now BOB is an assertive, talky, and decidedly armed soldier who 
 occasionally beams in with two (or three, or seven) of his friends to help you clean out a room. 
 He's also had it up to his palette with getting shot at, particularly by trigger-pumping morons 
 like you who're supposed to be on his side, and if he takes a round because of your cruddy aim 
 he's likely to send of fair number of them right back.   

 The single-player story line of Marathon 2 - revealed bit by bit via telescreen, courtesy of an 
 artificial intelligence of questionable sanity - is fun and deep enough, but the game really starts 
 to get dangerous when up to eight players link up to fight - either in fairly standard Quake-style 
 free-for-alls, or in the specialty multiplayer games such as King of the Hill, which is pretty 
 self-explanatory, or "Kill the Guy with the Ball," which, come to think of it, is also pretty self-explanatory 
 (once it's made clear that the "ball" is actually some poor schmuck's skull) . Also, the level names 
 are priceless, but I won't ruin any of that for you. As with all great multiplayer action games, 
 Marathon 2 rates way up there on the  and the Cuss-O-Meter, and 
 any minor flaws (such as the inability to jump) are nicely sidestepped by crude fixes (such as 
 the ability to "help" someone get some air by detonating a grenade at his feet) . Marathon 2 is 
 a distance runner, and with all its perks and goodies should more than tide over the 3-D shooter 
 fanantic until the totally customizable Marathon Infinity comes out for the PC.

Review:  This is actually a review for the Aleph One version, so I don't know if it is the Mac or PC version.
 
  
  In 1994, Bungie released Marathon, an ambitious FPS for the Mac that was better than Doom in almost 
 every way. It had a compelling plot with many twists and turns, alien slavers, an AI with questionable 
 sanity, ingenious puzzles, and awesome weapons. You won't see a Flamethrower in Doom, but you do 
 in Marathon! In 1995, Bungie released the sequel: Marathon 2: Durandal. It is now 17 years after 
 you saved the Marathon and Durandal, the AI with questionable sanity, has just awakened you from 
 cryogenic sleep. It turns out that after you saved the Marathon, Durandal stole you away from the 
 ship and put you on his captured Pfhor ship.
  
  Marathon 2 improves on its predecessor in almost every way. The graphics are much better for a 
 start. The first one was all indoor, but this one has many outdoor levels. The lighting is better 
 too. The guns also look better. There are also new weapons, such as a shotgun. The aliens also 
 look better. The hunter is now starting to look a bit more like the hunters in Halo. Also, the 
 troopers don't look as stupid as they did. All the graphics just look sharper.
  
  The AI, of course, is very much improved. No longer are BOBs complete retards who will get in your 
 way. Now, they are armed and they help you. The aliens are smarter too. There are also new kinds 
 of aliens for you to fight.
  
  The sound, sadly, isn't improved too much. The sound effects are great, but there isn't much music. 
 However, the game overall is much improved and if you liked the first one or you like Halo, give 
 it a try (it was released for free by Bungie, find it at trilogyrelease. bungie. org) Note: Gets 
 repetitive after awhile. In fact, it gets so repetitive that you will never want to hear the game 
 mentioned again. Good while it lasts, though.
