:::Review:::
Rebel Assault II will be enough to satisfy those seeking a worthwhile multimedia "experience," but 
 the limited gameplay will send hard-core gamers running back to Tie Fighter. 

 It's true that Rebel Assault II is, at its core, an arcade-style shoot-'em-up, but the play experience 
 goes far beyond that description. It starts with the story -- an original Star Wars-based plot that 
 pits Rookie One (that's you) on the side of the Alliance against the dark forces (no pun intended) 
 of the Empire. Action sequences are integrated almost seamlessly into the storyline, and interwoven 
 with movie scenes that add both context and suspense to the game.  

 Interactive movie games are nothing new. But this product's full studio production values set it 
 apart from lesser interactive adventures that come out of the typical Hollywood-Silicon Valley 
 convergence.  

 Passwords and user-defined skill levels ensure that all players can enjoy Rebel Assault II at a 
 comfortable flying and combat level. Hard-core gamers who like the 3-D action of Dark Forces may 
 scoff at the game's limited options. Likewise, veteran joystick jockeys will laugh at the fake 
 flying, which follows a predetermined line and doesn't provide the kind of control you get in Origin's 
 Wing Commander series.  

 Rebel Assault II's fine musical score, well-written script, and decent acting will be enough to 
 satisfy those seeking a worthwhile multimedia "experience," but the limited gameplay will most 
 likely send hard-core gamers running back to Tie Fighter.

Review:  You know, I still really like this game. It was one of the earliest I got after switching from 
 Mac to PC and I still have it.
  
  For the day, the graphics were amazing and it felt like you were there flying and fighting. Sure, 
 compared to today's super games, it's dated and simplistic. But there's something familiar and 
 warm and fuzzy about going back to it after so long.
  
  Limited in scenarios, and actual fighting, it's still a whole lot of fun just to fly around.
 
  
  Sometimes, it's just nice to step back and remember that the force is with you!

Review:  The first Star Wars game I ever owned I think, and I was totally immersed in the game. But I found 
 it quite difficult and at times unfun. Fun seems to be a constant lacking in Star Wars games but 
 this one has a little bit, but technology was limited back in those days.
  
  The game has a few scenarios. Fly your X-Wing and shoot tie fighters is one, guide the Milenium 
 Falcon through obstacles and shoot strom troopers. It is quite restrictive and quite terrible by 
 today's standards but still I remember I had a ball with it. Hardly fun anymore, it would be considered 
 quite forgettable. The game is restrictive. You can't move around the space when your shooting 
 enemies, you have to duck and shoot and so on. However the music and the sound effects are quite 
 good and flying through obstacles is quite tricky. It's definately worth a look to those keen Star 
 Wars fans.
