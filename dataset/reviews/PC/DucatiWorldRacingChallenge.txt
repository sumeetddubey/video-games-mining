:::Review:::
While the game boasts about 40 different Ducati motorcycles, Ducati World Racing Challenge is severely 
 hampered by its flawed control, obsolete graphics, and bad sound. 

  Last year, Acclaim released F355 Challenge for the Sega Dreamcast. It was a superb racing game 
 that featured one of the most respected vehicle manufacturers in automotive racing: Ferrari. With 
 the release of Ducati World Racing Challenge, Acclaim was undoubtedly hoping to capture that same 
 essence using yet another revered name in Italian racing. Unfortunately, while the game boasts 
 about 40 different Ducati motorcycles that span the length of the company's storied existence since 
 World War II, Ducati World Racing Challenge is severely hampered by its poor control, obsolete 
 graphics, and bad sound.           The graphics lack detail    

 Ducati World Racing Challenge is split up into two distinct gameplay modes -- quick race and Ducati 
 life -- the latter of which makes up the majority of the game. Similar to the Gran Turismo games 
 for the PlayStation and the evolution mode in EA's Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed, this open-ended 
 mode lets you choose from a number of racing events throughout the history of Ducati's 50-year 
 product line. You start Ducati life with $10,000 with which to buy a bike, helmet, and leathers. 
 You'll only be able to afford a cheap bike initially, but you can gain more money by competing 
 in the many racing events available. Most of these events have some sort of prerequisite that you 
 need to meet before being allowed to compete -- such as possessing a certain class of license or 
 bike -- and by successfully completing the events, you'll be rewarded with new bikes, hidden tracks, 
 and prize money. You can use prize money to stock your garage full of Ducatis that range from classics 
 from the '50s and '60s to modern-day beasts like the 996SPS and 748. The game lets you squeeze 
 more performance from your bike by letting you upgrade various parts like the gearbox, exhaust, 
 brakes, wheels, tires, and clutch.   

  The quick-race mode is similar to Ducati life, but access to some of the more exotic Ducatis and 
 racetracks isn't as restricted, as there isn't any kind of resource model to keep the high-end 
 bikes out of your reach. But as in Ducati life, the various races in this mode include vintage 
 class, modern class, and special events, and you can compete against the clock in addition to the 
 computer-controlled opponents.   

  However, despite the breadth of racing options available in the game, Ducati World Racing Challenge 
 suffers from serious problems. The first of these that you'll notice is the game's outdated graphics. 
 The tracks are all very sparse -- course objects like bridges and grandstands are lacking in detail, 
 and 2D sprites are used liberally to represent peripheral objects like trees. The bike and rider 
 models are also disappointing. The textures are washed out and fuzzy, and the bikes themselves 
 are so rough-hewn that they practically look like they've been mangled in an accident. The game 
 lets you play from three different camera views -- one third-person view and two first-person angles -- but 
 the first-person views really limit your peripheral vision, making it impossible to see any bikers 
 who aren't directly in front of you.   

  The game's sound is unacceptable. While the fast-paced tune that plays through the various menus 
 in Ducati World Racing Challenge is rather catchy, the bikes' sound effects are poor. Ducatis are 
 known for their signature growling engines and throaty exhaust notes, but some of the bikes in 
 the game sound like blast furnaces instead. The effects of driving over different surfaces and 
 of crashing are generic, and the incessant squealing of the tires becomes annoying almost immediately. 
           The racing action falls flat    

 Yet the most glaring problem in the game is the control. The game has a number of driving tests -- designed 
 to familiarize you with maneuvering your bike, finding the best racing line, cornering, and so 
 on -- that you must pass within a set time limit, but you'll hardly put these skills to use while 
 racing on the tracks. In fact, with a little practice, you can lap certain courses over and over 
 without ever braking. It's a shame that the physics in the game are so simplistic, because Ducati 
 World Racing Challenge is one of the few PC bike games to actually feature separate inputs for 
 front and rear brakes. However, the only difference between the two is that the front brakes are 
 slightly more powerful than the rear brakes. There are no penalties for staying on the front brake 
 too long while entering a turn, nor will you encounter problems applying the rear brake while coming 
 out of a corner -- both of which would send you onto the asphalt in real life. Additionally, all 
 the tracks in the game are variations of five core designs, and all five designs are forgettable. 
 There's also no online multiplayer mode available, though there is a horizontal split-screen option 
 for two players on one computer.   

  The potential of Ducati World Racing Challenge is clearly evident, and it could have been the Porsche 
 Unleashed of motorcycle games. But while it does have some appeal for die-hard Ducati fans, Ducati 
 World Racing Challenge is ultimately hamstrung by its many problems. In the end, Ducati World Racing 
 Challenge proves that it takes more than a recognizable license to make a high-quality racing game.
