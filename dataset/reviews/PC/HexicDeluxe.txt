:::Review:::
If you're in the market for a Bejeweled knock-off, you could do a whole lot worse. 

  You can only arrange a field of polygonal shapes in so many different ways -- at least, that's the 
 philosophy behind Hexic Deluxe. A kissing cousin of Bejeweled, Hexic presents you with a square 
 field filled with interlocking hexagons. The goal is to arrange like-colored hexagons into groups 
 of three or more, which will clear them from your screen. You can't move the hexagons individually, 
 but you can rotate them at the corners where three hexagons meet; however, the game will only let 
 those rotations stick if it will clear pieces, further limiting the amount of monkeying around 
 you can do.  

  The game offers several variations on the same concept. There are the self-descriptive marathon 
 mode and timed mode, as well as a survival mode in which, instead of refilling the field every 
 time you clear pieces, you go until you have no more moves to make, at which point the old pieces 
 are locked into place and the field is refilled. Hexic strikes a near-perfect balance of challenge 
 and accessibility, and it's as easy to play for five minutes as it is for an entire afternoon.

Review:  Hexic Deluxe is best described as a fun little puzzler that is good for killing spare time between 
 other events and activities. In Hexic, your goal is to move sets of three hexagons so that each 
 hexagon in the set matches up with three or more hexagons of its corresponding color. When you 
 do this the matched hexagons disappear, the hexagons that were above them fall to fill the empty 
 space, and an appropriate number of new hexagons is generated and fall down on top of the pile. 
 Hexagons generated when making a match are random, which means they can be any color or hexagon 
 type, including power ups. Power ups give you extra points when you match them with hexagons of 
 the appropriate color, as well as allow for the possibility of making a lot more hexagons disappear 
 than just what you are matching when you make a match. It is also possible to wind up with a bomb. 
 Bombs are the games way of killing you off, and appear at random in place of one of the new hexagons 
 you generate when making a match. They drop down with a random color and number. Their number is 
 how many moves you have to match the bomb up with two or more hexagons of its color before it detonates, 
 killing you and bringing an end to the game. As you make matches and generate points, you will 
 advance in level. Each level requires a certain number of matches in order to complete it. Once 
 you reach that number of matches, you advance to the next stage, which requires an even greater 
 number of matches in order to advance beyond it. There really isnt anything more to Hexic than 
 this. You simply match hexagons for points and new gems, and its surprisingly fun.
  
  The game runs in a windowed mode, and performs very well with little to no slow down. The controls 
 are straightforward point and click via the mouse, and the graphics are very colorful. Unfortunately, 
 the same can not be said for the games music, which is really more an assortment of sounds than 
 anything, and feels pretty tacked on and last minute. As soon as you load up Hexic Deluxe you will 
 see its very much inspired by other big name puzzlers such as Bejeweled. Sadly, while the game 
 is quite fun and challenging, and supports a variety of different game modes and difficulty settings 
 for each one, its not nearly as fun or addicting as the puzzlers that inspired it. This is mostly 
 due to an overall lack of polish that leaves the game feeling rather dull and plastic despite how 
 well it presents itself. Also, for whatever reason, luck plays more into the equation of this game 
 than logic does. For instance, about half the time a bomb drops it drops in a color that is not 
 even remotely close to the hexagons of its same color. This is really frustrating because most 
 of the time it means you cant do anything with the bomb when it drops. So, you are left to make 
 other matches around the bomb in hope that the two or more of the appropriately colored hexagons 
 you need will be generated close enough together, so you can match them with the bomb to diffuse 
 it and keep playing. This really hurts the games lasting appeal, making it an unlikely candidate 
 for marathon play sessions. However, its not enough to hurt the fun of playing in a short time 
 span. This makes Hexic Deluxe an ideal title to keep you occupied while waiting for other more 
 important things to arrive, such as the end of your shift on a slow Friday afternoon.
