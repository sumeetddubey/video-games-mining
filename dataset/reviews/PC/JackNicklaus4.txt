:::Review:::
It's a fine piece of work with only a couple minor flaws. 

 The Golden Bear is back, and he's better than ever. Accolade's Jack Nicklaus series hasn't had a 
 new incarnation in almost five years, but in all that time its position as THE leading game for 
 course design has not been supplanted. Jack Nicklaus Signature Edition Courses are still made and 
 traded widely on the Internet, and a bevy of course designers are already using JN4 to crank out 
 more.  

 JN4 is the work of Accolade and Cinematronics, and it's a fine piece of work with only a couple 
 minor flaws. There are two parts: the gameplay itself and the course designer. The game easily 
 competes with anything out there, while the course designer is in a class of its own. The game 
 is a handsome, full-featured golf sim with all the bells and whistles you could want. The resolution 
 scales up to 1600x1200 in a full 16.7 million colors, with nice, wide vistas on the course. The 
 courses are sharp-looking and second only to Links LS in sheer beauty: quite an accomplishment 
 considering JN4's fast redraw times and need to accommodate a course designer. Water and sky textures 
 are quite good, but unlike the original Nicklaus game, there's no in-screen animation: the price 
 of hi-res.  

 While there's a viewing window with plenty of height options - from one meter to 30 - you can't 
 keep multiple views open at the same time. An optional ball camera automatically reverses angles 
 to show where the ball lands, but this causes one of JN4's minor hiccups: a three to five second 
 hitch in golf swing animation. With the landing camera turned off, the golfers are animated immediately 
 and smoothly, including Jack himself, whom you can play against but not as. Opponents are recorded 
 rather than AI, which means you get a few canned golfing partners rather than a series of constantly 
 changing opponents.   

 Play control is quite good, with a three-stage power bar that feels much better than that click-and-release 
 of Links. You aim shots with an aiming arrow, and then adjust trajectory and draw/fade effects 
 with the control and arrow keys. It's all very well implemented with a smooth power bar. Ball dynamics 
 seem pretty good overall, although uphill and downhill lies don't seem to have a lot of effect 
 on a stroke. There are plenty of play and scoring modes, including tournament, skins, match, stroke, 
 bingo bango boingo, and sudden death. Full and smoothly implemented Internet, LAN, and modem play 
 is supported, with up to four people on any connection.   

 Five courses come with JN4: Colleton River Plantation, Country Club of the South, Muirfield Village, 
 and Cabo del Sol. The most interesting may be Winding Springs, which was created by Nicklaus' own 
 design team expressly for JN4, using the course editor. Talk about your fantasy course! All courses 
 are excellent, and look great with the lush colors and good hazing effects of the game.   

 Things really come alive in the course editor, which is a fabulous, powerful piece of world-creation 
 software. Wizards help you with routing, distances, and pars if you like, and then you can edit 
 each hole however you want. Holes are edited individually, which means you can't create a large 
 canvass, say a mountain range or lake, and then route a course around it. You need to adjust the 
 water and terrain levels for each hole, and then fit them together. A potent set of tools lets 
 you raise and lower terrain to shape a hole. Terrain types range from sand and rough to fairway, 
 tee, green, and all manner of ground types in between. There are well over a hundred different 
 objects to place on a hole - trees, bushes, rocks, benches, and even sounds - all of them scaleable. 
 The horizon is handled with panoramic images that can be rotated, so they look right when placed 
 on the course. It all comes together spectacularly in a 3-D window that lets you watch as the course 
 takes shape.  

 There's always the desire for more. Some PCX or BMP importation utility would be nice. A custom 
 object builder like that found in previous JN games. A forest mode would make it possible to slather 
 a hillside with dozens of trees at a time rather than place them one at a time. Elevations are 
 handled rather too simply: You are only able to raise or lower them by increments instead of being 
 able to set a particular height or width. Plus, due to the complexity of these courses, a single 
 course can take up to ten megabytes of space, which will make downloading them tough.  

 All these criticisms are more in the form of a wish list for future versions than attacks on this 
 one. JN4 is a superb piece of work: powerful, full-featured, gorgeous, and fun. Since it has the 
 ability to bring forward all previous JNSE courses - and there are hundreds of these - it hits 
 the market with more playable course than any competitor. (Cruise some of our links to get an idea.) 
 It will undoubtedly rule its category for some time to come, just like Jack himself ruled the game 
 for thirty years.

Review:  This game was surely a hit in1997 but now its just a mediocre game!! The game is vera alike Links 
 if you ever played that one you probably enjoy this one. There are 10 courses tochoose from and 
 a lot of different modes to play but it gets pretty boring after a while because there is not any 
 really challeng like a tournument or something. Its a good simulator with real courses. You can 
 also make your own courses with the editor which is pretty fun.
  
  Graphics are good. The Courses are good and look much like the real ones. The details are a little 
 fuzzy but its an old game.
  
  Sound are bad but thats not so important in this game anyway but a little more voices could have 
 been good. 
  
  Gameplay is bad i think sometimes when you push its doesnt stop so you slice it out in the forest 
 and thats not so fun. The steering of the direction on the ball is slow and hard to move.
  
  Value of the games is marvelous. There is many courses and many modes i miss a world tour or 
 something though. You also have the editor were you can make your own courses. The game gets boring 
 pretty fast and you can just play for short times.
  
  Tilt. The game is not so funny. It gets repitive and boring to quickly. And the lack for competion 
 with many players makes the game even more boring. Its ok to take out and play one round once in 
 a while but just for 30 minutes then you have fullfilled the nedd for a week or so.
  
  + The many courses, many modes
  - The sound, The Gameplay, Repitive, Lack of tournoment mode

  Sound 4
