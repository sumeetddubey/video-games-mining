With play like this, who needs work? 

 Microsoft Flight Simulator isn't really a game. Over a dozen years it's had five major version upgrades, 
 ports to nearly every platform (and language) on the map, and cumulative sales that nudge the stratosphere 
 of desktop productivity perennials. This can't be a game, can it? Maybe it's not software at all, 
 but the first CD-ROM-based cult. Then the ever-popular cross-continent jaunts, where the most exciting 
 things to happen are takeoff, landing, and the seven-odd meditative hours of not crashing in between, 
 would make sense. Actually, before this latest release, a powerful mantra and finger cymbals were 
 necessary to make the thing fly under Windows 95.  

 For those not yet initiated, Microsoft Flight Simulator is as realistic an approximation of the 
 flying experience as has ever alighted on desktops, and is not for the faint of heart (or faint 
 of manual) . Want to take off? Wellmake sure you've completed the pre-flight check (equipment 
 failures can be set to occur randomly) , tune your transponder to the code provided by the tower, 
 set your COM and NAV radios to the local frequencies, check the wind direction and speed, request 
 permission to take off from air-traffic control, taxi to the appointed runway (avoiding other taxiing 
 aircraft, of course) , set your flaps, release the brakes, and apply the throttle. While this degree 
 of realism may seem overly fastidious to some, it is part of the flying experience, and duly rendered. 
 Novices may, of course, bypass much of the minutiae, and ample multimedia flight training is provided, 
 but in the end, this is where you're working to beand sometimes, it really does feel like 
 work.  

 Before you're in the air, though, you also have to decide where you want to go today - scenery and 
 hundreds of airports are mapped for every inhabited continent on the globe, making dramatic crashes 
 into each of the extant Seven Wonders of the World a possibility (nay, an obligation) . You can 
 take off from Marrakesh, refuel in Marseilles, and end the day in Malta. But first, immerse yourself 
 in the navigational arcana of VHF Omni Range and non-directional radio beacons, VOR radials, and 
 Instrument Landing Systems - you won't get to Paris by taking off from London and pointing your 
 plane east. Selected navigational maps are provided, but for flights further afield you'll need 
 to download a homebrewed chart or invest in a set of professional Jeppeson charts, and then carefully 
 map your course beacon to beacon. With play like this, who needs work?  

 This version of MSFS is Windows 95 native, and while the jury is still out on DirectX, the windowed 
 environment is handy - you can use the in-flight autopilot cruise time to catch up on e-mail, Microsoft 
 Office add-ins for flight planning, and navigational calculation can only be around the corner. 
 Other additions to this version are two new aircraft - a 737 jetliner and the Extra 300S aerobat 
 (which join the Cessna, Learjet, Sopwith Camel, and sailplane) - and a much-needed overhaul of 
 the antiquated and confusing interface - the ordained will find it familiar enough, while novices 
 will be able to get into the air faster, configuring weather, season, time-of-day, and realism 
 levels more intuitively. The scenery is as rich as ever, with subtle texture-mapped geography, 
 visual cues from accurately placed landmarks, and regional swaths of satellite-generated photorealism. 
 Other swank features from previous versions are retained, such as the "Land Me" option, video replay 
 of stunts and landings, multiple external views, and "slewing" (the ability to freeze action and 
 reposition or reorient the aircraft) . Likewise, the aerodynamic realism of Microsoft's flight model 
 is as good as ever - after seeing the punishment a 737 can take (yes, it can loop the loop) , real-life 
 in-flight turbulence isn't nearly as disconcerting as it once was. The only notable absence is 
 support for multiplayer flying, though Microsoft promises this in future releases via its DirectPlay 
 technology.  

 The bottom line? Whether you consider MSFS a game or not cuts to the quick of whether you'll be 
 converted. Games have rules, a context, and a motivationa way to win. The rules in MSFS? 
 The laws of physics. The context? You're a pilot in a plane. The motivation? Wellyou're a 
 pilot in a plane, subject to the laws of physics. If you can suspend your disbelief and enter the 
 reality of the simulation, then MSFS is the ultimate tool for exploring that fantasy of flight, 
 with its moments sublime and mundane. Indeed, it's not the gameplay but the gamework - the checking 
 of instruments, the charting of courses, the credibility of the simulation - that makes the fantasy 
 available. That said, if you can't convince yourself that getting from A to B really matters, Microsoft's 
 feeble "adventures" - such as "see if you can fly through the Arc de Triomphe" - will sustain your 
 interest for all of five minutes. The great shame of this product is that it feels unfinished in 
 this regard; if you can't buy into the realism trip, there's not much to go on. Microsoft is just 
 a mission-disk away from transforming this product from the cult that it is into the major religion 
 it should be.

Review:  'As real as it get's!' is what it says on the box. At the time this game probably was as realistic 
 as Microsoft could make it I suppose. Maybe my 4/10 score isnt really fair but this game is just 
 so unrealistic and since other flight sims like Flight Unlimited were so much better I think it 
 deserves the mark.
  
  OK im not really into Flight Simulators much anyway but since I am a big PC gamer I thought I should 
 do a flight sim review as they are only really available on PC's. There is a decent amount of planes 
 to fly here and they all fly differently but the controls are just clumsy and if you tap the control 
 keys the plane swerves and usually you end up crashing. Ah, crashing. When you crash on this game 
 you see a clip from the outside of the plane and it doesnt explode, it just hits the ground and 
 does a strange flip while staying in the same position. Nothing even falls off the plane when it 
 crashes. What is up with that? And if you crash into a skyscraper the plane gets jammes in the 
 side of the wall rather than hitting the building and exploding or hitting the building and falling 
 to the ground.
  
  One reason why this game is so unrealistic is... get ready... you can land on the sea and take off 
 again. Yep, with any plane (there isnt even one of those planes that can land on water) , even a 
 huge jumbo jet you can still do it. If you crash into the sea, the plane doesnt sink, it just does 
 exactly what it does on land and says 'Splash!'. Also, I flew over San Fransico and tries to crash 
 into the Golden Gate bridge and Alcatraz and nothing happens! You just go straight through and 
 carry on! The land is all 2D with a few odd 3D skyscrapers and hills.
  
  The only good points about the game are varied amount of planes, the huge land to fly over and 
 the sound effects. If your looking for a Flight Simulator game then GET ONE OF THE NEW ONES! Do 
 not bother with this old one because it sucks!
  
  Pros:
  + Good amount of planes
  + Good sound
  
  Cons:
  - Extremely unrealistic in every way
  - Clumsy handling of planes
 
  - Rubbish graphics
  - You can land on the sea!

Review:  When i got this, i thought it was going to be fun with a lot of realism, the as real as it gets 
 don't fit into this sim. If it had more planes, better graphics on the AI planes, and more AI planes 
 than just the ones in Chicago Meigs field, this would have been much better. its also too easy 
 physics as well. When i crashed the plane in the ground, only 2 out of the planes were able to 
 shatter its parts on the ground, the Extra and the cessna, Could that also apply for the others? 
 So if you ever see this game in stores still, don't buy it. Get somthing better like the Flight 
 Simulator X. Thats much better than this.
