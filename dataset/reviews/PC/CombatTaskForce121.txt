:::Review:::
Combat: Task Force 121 is a game that is just as hackneyed as its title makes it sound. 

  Combat: Task Force 121 is a game that's just as hackneyed as its title makes it sound. Available 
 for the usually telling price of $19.99, Task Force 121 is a thoroughly rudimentary military-themed 
 first-person shooter that puts the bulk of its focus on online play. Up to 16 people can play online, 
 and there are several different modes of play. While this might sound like a pretty good deal, 
 the unbalanced shooting mechanics and mostly lousy maps pretty much do away with that notion right 
 away. And the thoroughly terrible single-player campaign further reinforces this fact. Had the 
 developer perhaps just skipped the single-player portion altogether to spend some more time hammering 
 out the problems with its multiplayer, the game might have turned into a decent little shooter 
 for online-shooter fans. In this form, however, Task Force 121 simply can't compete with the myriad 
 other shooters available for the PC.  

          When Combat Task Force 122 is unavailable, the government calls in Combat Task Force 121. 
     

  Task Force 121 includes LAN and online multiplayer modes, which support up to 16 players. Multiplayer 
 games include general and team variations of capture the flag, deathmatch, king of the hill, and 
 last man standing, as well as a game called VIP escort, where one player acts as a VIP who must 
 be escorted to a safe zone while the other team tries to kill him. On paper, all this sounds great. 
 There are a nice variety of modes, the interface is simple and easy to use, and in every game different 
 players can play as different class types, such as basic soldiers, close-quarters combatants (who 
 prefer weaponry like shotguns) , demolitionists, heavy-weaponry combatants, and snipers. Unfortunately, 
 once you get into the action, it all becomes painfully clear that no amount of game modes can make 
 Task Force 121 enjoyable to play.  

  The main problems with the multiplayer gameplay have to do with the weapons. There are six guns 
 in the game, including a pistol, a shotgun, and a few different types of machine guns. While each 
 weapon feels initially like it packs a good punch, some of the balancing between weapons feels 
 kind of strange. Shotguns, for instance, are almost always one-hit killers, so long as you're near 
 an enemy. Conversely, some of the larger assault rifles seem like they take way too many hits to 
 actually bring down an opponent. Apart from this, the action just has a tired, bland feel to it. 
 The maps are a big part of this problem, because they don't have much variety to offer. The corridors 
 are often too cramped to be much fun, and even the open spaces seem to lack much in the way of 
 space. Plus, certain soldier classes, like snipers, feel altogether useless in a lot of maps, because 
 there are rarely any good vantage points to properly play them. The multiplayer as a whole feels 
 severely antiquated. The PC version's multiplayer does feel a little quicker, which is a plus, 
 but it still isn't all that great. If you're a forgiving person and don't mind the weird balancing 
 and mediocre maps -- and are in desperate need of some run-and-gun action -- then Task Force 121 is 
 serviceable. But there are loads of shooters available for the PC that do FPS multiplayer better 
 than this game.  

  If you're not interested in the online multiplayer, Task Force 121's stock drops even farther, 
 especially when you factor in that the game has absolutely nothing to offer in the way of a single-player 
 experience. Well, OK, it does have a single-player campaign, but it's so unabashedly lame that 
 you won't want to bother with it. Essentially consisting of a scattershot collection of brief missions 
 with seemingly unintentionally hilarious names like "Operation Crazed Liberty" and "Operation Outraged 
 Tension," the mode is just no fun. Basically, all the missions are a bunch of fetch quests where 
 you have to find keys, safe combinations, and other assorted bric-a-brac before getting to the 
 end. That's it. You must get from point A to point B and find a key or something in between.  

 
  In between all that, you'll shoot a bad guy here and there. Though the developer did go to the 
 trouble of making the enemy artificial intelligence at least decently smart, it apparently couldn't 
 be bothered to add things like health packs. This teams with the game's checkpoint system -- which 
 starts you out with depleted health after you die -- to cause you a great deal of frustration. All 
 in all, the single-player campaign will probably take you only a few frustrating hours to blast 
 through. And at no point is it ever fun. Thus, those without multiplayer on the brain will have 
 a terrible time with Combat: Task Force 121.  

          Multiplayer for 16 players is lovely and all, but it would be a lot more appealing if the 
 maps didn't suck and the weapons were properly balanced.     

  Task Force 121's graphics are mediocre. There are only a few character skins to choose from, none 
 of which look all that great, and the models animate in a pretty herky-jerky fashion. All the maps 
 have a decidedly muddy look to them, with a lot of nasty-looking textures, ugly set pieces, and 
 occasional sections of the environment that don't look quite finished; and even with the unremarkable 
 visuals, the game still has slowdown issues that pop up in certain areas. The PC version predictably 
 is about a half step above the Xbox version graphically, but there aren't any notable differences 
 beyond a slightly cleaner overall look. The audio is perhaps the one saving grace of Task Force 
 121. When you're in combat, the echoes of gunshots can be quite fierce, and they sound wholly realistic. 
 Similarly, though the enemy dialogue is a little on the repetitive side, it's well recorded and 
 delivered and isn't so prevalent that you'll be hearing it constantly. Unfortunately, there's not 
 much in the way of music in the game, and what is there isn't very impressive.  

  Combat: Task Force 121 is a game that seems content to stick closely to the quality of those budget 
 shooters that have come before it. While the online play is merely average at best, its single-player 
 play and its overall production values are seriously subpar. You could certainly say these problems 
 aren't that big of a deal, especially since the game is only $20, but on a platform as rife with 
 multiplayer shooters as the PC, this excuse doesn't really hold much water. In the end, you should 
 take a pass on Combat: Task Force 121.

Review:  In this game you will be taking the part of a lone soldier fighting for a para-military task force 
 used to thoughrt terrorists fromj thier evil goals. you will travel to many enviroments. Theres 
 not much to task force 121. its an extremly average if not sub-par shooter tha has no tactical 
 aspects. I first played the game on Xbox and found it a short-lived barly entertaining shooter. 
 the campaign very short and very plain and the multi-player is basic. but i dont think its a bad 
 game just a low budget shooter with a lot of quarqs. The best thing in the game is the sound. the 
 weapons sound real and the modeling is ok. the graphics are very dated and see old in every aspect. 
 the game is not for any die-hard shooters looking for a thrill. its almost a updated arcade game. 
 so try it if you want but its not going to wow you any.

Review:  Dont even buy this, Its total crap and has no need to exist on this planet. I made a huge mistake 
 in buying it so I hope you dont repeat what I have done, OK? so dont buy it! it sucks.
  
  This thing has to be 100 words, So I have to say 100 words about crap huh?
  Only problem is there 
 is not much else to say.
  
  The gameplay is slow and the enemy AI is very poorly done.
  The graphics are ugly and the enemies look retarted.
  The sound effects are almost non-existant 
 except for gunfire, nothing special.
  What more do I have to say?
  DONT BUY IT.

Review:  It's a value game from Groove, a basic, very basic FPS, fast action, easy to play and beat.
  I of course play more complicated and better elaborate games but sincerely, i think that CT 121 
 doesn't deserve to be treated like some others that produce bad, cheap value titles you might know 
 to whom i refer. Anyway here is my review and have in mind that such a small game like this making 
 use of a basic and light Unreal engine, simple controls sure can be way more better than other 
 Value companies out there. Did i mention they can recreate the best jungle environments, yes, take 
 a look for example on the jungles of Marine Sharp Shooter.
