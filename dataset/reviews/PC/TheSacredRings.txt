:::Review:::
Extremely difficult puzzles and a vague plot sink this ambitious Myst clone. 

  More of a rehashing of Aura: Fate of the Ages than a sequel, The Sacred Rings is yet another Myst 
 knockoff aimed solely at adventure gamers with a high tolerance for frustration. This Streko-Graphics 
 game is deeply difficult and overflowing with excruciatingly obtuse puzzles based on the same sort 
 of surreal contraptions that were introduced by Atreus back in 1995. However, like its predecessor, 
 and unlike much of the Myst series, The Sacred Rings lacks a well-developed plot and interesting 
 characters, which makes it tough to summon up much enthusiasm for trudging through this airless 
 collection of brainteasers.  

          Strange alien landscapes and way-out mechanical puzzles -- sound familiar to anybody?    

  For what it's worth, the plot picks up right where Aura ended. Apprentice Umang of the Clan of 
 Keepers awakens in a strange, apparently movable house in possession of the sacred rings that solving 
 a lot of weird mechanical puzzles led him to in the last game. However, his quest remains unfinished, 
 as a group of rebellious Keepers headed up by the evil Durad have started a revolt to try and grab 
 the rings and the two pieces of the Tetrahedron artifact, which can be used together to grant great 
 powers to their bearers. Soon you're off on another scavenger hunt through new surreal dimensions 
 with a lot of locked doors and bizarre gadgets.  

  It's hard to tell up from down in The Sacred Rings, as Streko-Graphics has again given characterization 
 and story little attention. Much of the plot is developed in grainy cutscenes, complete with stereotypical 
 characters and a villain who actually "Muhahahahaha!"s about your plight at one point. You spend 
 all of your time exploring a handful of locales trying to figure out what you're supposed to be 
 doing, so you have no time for idle chit-chat. The game's visuals are good in a 1999 sort of way, 
 and they establish an intriguing setting by being imaginative, although they are also both claustrophobic 
 and seriously dated by a reliance on Myst's one-step-at-a-time movement. And while the impressive 
 voice acting makes characters come to life (especially Umang) , there is little of it because your 
 interactions with human beings are few and far between.  

  So it's really all about the puzzles. And make no mistake, The Sacred Rings boasts an impressive 
 collection of out-there challenges geared to test your reasoning and your sanity. There is a fairly 
 wide variety as well, although each usually comes down to scrounging for clues and then pushing 
 buttons, turning gears, or activating something similarly mechanical. Most deal with glyphs, colors, 
 or some other geometric patterns and shapes that have to be dialed up or plugged into a machine 
 (although you do get tossed the odd curveball, like in one instance where you have to examine the 
 patterns presented by partially burned candles) , so it feels like you're breaking one code after 
 another. All are extremely hard, which leads to some satisfying "Aha!" moments where everything 
 finally clicks and a solution comes to your mind.  

  Still, just as with Aura, Streko-Graphics doesn't provide enough context for your puzzle solving. 
 Not only is the game missing the backdrop of a satisfying story, but it's also missing even the 
 barest of motivations. You're typically plopped down in some whacked-out garden or a metal building 
 with more sealed hatchways than a submarine and abandoned with nary a clue of what to do or how 
 to go about doing it. Right at the very start of the game, you wake up in a strange house with 
 a weirdo who tells you only to find a way to open a stuck metal door, before he goes off and takes 
 a nap. You aren't even informed which of the house's many doors he's referring to before he goes 
 beddy-bye. Clues are provided through notes and letters, although they're typically so mysterious 
 and/or wordy that they could be considered puzzles all on their lonesome.  

          Clear as mud!     

  Exploration is very tedious, both due to the step-by-step movement 
 and a need to scroll your cursor around to carefully examine every object on the screen. The latter 
 is particularly annoying, because it feels clunky and because areas are loaded with fine details 
 that make it impossible to tell what's useful and what's not. You come across a desk loaded with 
 books and odd-looking paraphernalia, yet only one item is accessible. A shelf features three locked 
 cabinets, yet only one of them can be opened. And so on. It's nice from a visual perspective that 
 the developers took the time to dress up the game's varied environments, but there are way too 
 many red herrings here, which makes it very easy to overlook vital objects and clues.  

  You need to be a hardcore puzzle-solving adventurer to get any entertainment out of The Sacred 
 Rings. While the game features some truly devilish mysteries that provide no small sense of accomplishment 
 when solved, don't expect to get through this one without checking out an online walk-through... or 
 tearing your hair out.

Review:  I thought this game was really good. Yes it is hard that is for sure. But I expected it to be before 
 I even bought it. Thats part of the reason that I did. I like a challenge. I thought the graphics 
 where good. The sound not so much but not so bad not to play it. It had a great story. Enough to 
 keep me interested and the puzzles were over all pretty easy minus maybe 2 of them I would call 
 hard. If you like Myst type games at all give this game a try. It's pretty good.

Review:  Hi.
  
  This is my first review. I just wanted to say that you can give this game a low score if:
  -&gt; 
 You don't think the graphics are actual
  -&gt; The plot is nothing new
  -&gt; You compare it to Myst
  -&gt; You don't like adventures
  
  Just don't say it is very 
 hard and puzzles without enough context! There is plenty of hints throughout the game and you are 
 always focused.
  Myst is WAY harder and get's you clueless for a long time (I really loved Myst) , while Aura2 its 
 much more of a family game.
  
  I give it 7.3 just for the 2 first reasons above...
  
  Thanks
