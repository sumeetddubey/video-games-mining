 The acting isn't Oscar-quality, and it's got a few rough spots around the edges, but if nothing 
 else, The Dame Was Loaded proves that a game can be built around full-motion video and still be 
 fully interactive.  

 And that's because the game's design is rooted firmly in the graphic-adventure tradition. As the 
 smart cursor moves around the screen (a static digitized photo) , it changes to various icons that 
 let you Look, Take, and Use objects, as well as Talk to the tough thugs, sultry sirens, and other 
 stereotypical characters you'd expect in a 1940's detective story. Thankfully, it's a long way 
 from the visit a witness, record a video gameplay of ICOM's Sherlock Holmes games, 
 or the mind-numbing videotape work in Voyeur.  

 You play as a second-rate private dick named Scott Anger, who's just come off a month-long bender 
 sparked by the drive-by shooting death of his fiancee. Your first assignment back at the office 
 seems simple enough: a missing-persons case notable mostly for how much you're attracted to your 
 client, the curvy Carol Klein. But after a couple of days of sleuthing (and perhaps even petty 
 larceny and breaking and entering) , you learn that a whole series of major crimes -- bank robbery, 
 arson, and murder -- are somehow linked to your case. And when some unsavory characters suspect you 
 know the location of some stolen diamonds, your life -- and the life of your girlfriend -- hangs in 
 the balance.  

 Because the puzzles can be complex and the clues sometimes vague, you'll want to save often, which 
 brings us to the game's biggest weakness: There are only five save-game slots, a pitifully small 
 number for a game this long and complex. To make matters worse, there's no way to call up the Save/Load 
 menu -- you've got to journey back to Anger's office every time. It sounds trivial, but after you've 
 done it several times you'll realize just how much this slows down the action (even if you hit 
 ESC to bypass the video clip of Anger tossing his hat on the coat rack) .  

 Even so, murder mystery fans will find enough here to enjoy that they'll probably be able to look 
 past the flaws, and veteran gamers won't feel cheated by blowing through the game in a few hours. 
 If you're looking for a truly interactive video-based adventure, this could well be the ticket.
