Microsoft has proven itself fighting fit with a thorough retooling of the classic. 

 Competition is good. Microsoft Flight Simulator has long been the undisputed champion of the civil 
 aviation sim scene, and the last four years' worth of halfhearted upgrades led some to think that 
 the flyboys in Redmond had given up even trying. Now, with two highly anticipated contenders on 
 the way - Sierra's Pro Pilot and Looking Glass's Flight Unlimited 2 - Microsoft has proven itself 
 fighting fit with a thorough retooling of the classic.  

 While flight scenery under standard hardware has been tuned, with a graphics accelerator card - 
 the game supports Direct3D compatible cards - the graphics have become breathtaking, and it's no 
 surprise that the illusion of flight is all the more convincing. Gone are the shimmer of distant 
 scenery and the flicker of ground lights at night. Clouds are wispy and transparent, and the aliased 
 patchwork terrain of earlier versions is now smoothly blended and vastly more realistic. Devotees 
 will also notice more subtle graphic embellishments: Runways have skid-marks, and dawn really does 
 now rise in the East. With the release of Windows 98, this version of Microsoft Flight Simulator 
 will even support multiple monitors, making homemade wraparound cockpits a real (and, for spouses, 
 terrifying) possibility.  

 Not only does the view out the window look better, there's more to see. Thirty North American cities 
 are now rendered in detail, along with 15 others in Europe and Asia. Perhaps the most stunning 
 is Hong Kong, which is faithfully represented right down to the checkerboard approach (which requires 
 of pilots a last-minute sharp turn before landing) . The Las Vegas, Hawaii, Japan, and Caribbean 
 scenery expansion packs have been subsumed in this release, and the detail of the New York and 
 Paris graphics exceed those of the retail enhancement add-ons. Microsoft has also made available 
 a conversion utility for shareware scenery from earlier versions.  

 More than 3,000 airports are available for takeoffs and landings, but planning the flights in between 
 is impossible without resorting to third-party tools; the "database" of navigational aids is merely 
 a text listing of transmitters and beacons, and detailed area maps are provided only for the 45 
 major metropolitan airports. While this is an improvement upon the previous version - which offered 
 no maps - it's still a notable shortcoming.  

 The stable of available aircraft has evolved to include fixed- and retractable-gear versions of 
 the single-engined Cessna 182, the new Learjet 45, plus enhanced versions of the 737-400, Sopwith 
 Camel, Schweitzer sailplane, and Extra 300S for aerobatics. For the first time, a helicopter is 
 included: the Bell 206, which fixed-wing pilots will find an unfamiliar (and initially frustrating) 
 flight experience. Instrument panels and controls are rendered in greater detail, right down to 
 the realistic throttle knob on the Cessna, and the fully user-configurable keyboard layouts and 
 joystick button assignments are a welcome addition.  

 The flight models of the aircraft are as realistic as ever, and Microsoft's association with FlightSafety 
 International - a major training organization - will presumably speed acceptance of MSFS as a flight 
 instruction tool. Included in the manual is even a coupon for a cut-rate first flying lesson from 
 Cessna.  

 Other technical innovations include support for Force Feedback joysticks, bringing a new sensation 
 to the PC flight sim. The experience is disconcertingly realistic - runways really are bumpy - 
 and the rattle of the stick in a stall will send a shiver down your spine. Multiplayer support 
 also returns, via LAN or the Internet (hosted free to players at Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone) . 

 Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 is an impressive feat. With a few exceptions, gone are the glaring 
 flaws of the previous version; coupled with its technological innovations, the sum of the parts 
 is a unique flight experience of unprecedented realism. Although the flight sim skies will soon 
 be crowded, Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 will prove an able contender with the best of what the 
 competition offers.

Review:  Now, by todays standards, this game is not so hot. When I was younger and wanted to just fly planes, 
 it didn't matter what the graphics looked like, or the sounds were. *Though they were pretty darn 
 good for the time, I might add*
  
  Gameplay - (8/10) ~ Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't think there were many worthwhile Flight 
 Simulators out when this game was released. This was something which had given the industry the 
 boost it needed, and with the great fun you got flying an airplane, to the amazing scenery *FOR 
 THE TIME* this made this game wicked cool!
  
  Graphics - (7/10) ~ The graphics for the time were great! Now a days it takes gigabite upon gigabite 
 to keep the graphics files for Flight Sim X Deluxe, back then it took up a fraction of this and 
 still made things as great as they could be!
  
  Audio - (7/10) ~ Once again, for the time it was really good, and I have to commend them for doing 
 such a great job here aswell!
  
  Overall, you can't really find this game anywhere, but if you do, you should buy it and own a piece 
 of amazing gaming history!

Review:  This game is pretty good for its time but i only have it because my dad is pilot so I ended up 
 with this crap but when i was younger it was pretty good but stick with the new ones like flight 
 sim x it has a lot of better grapics. I have about 1 hour on little planes and im only 10 and if 
 you do not have at least more than 35 hours on any of the flight sims and/or in real life you should 
 not have this or other sim games.
  
  I have 1 hour on a plane because my dad has a job and he lets me fly, ones in a while but i'll keep 
 adding hours every time i fly.

Review:  I realise this is probably an old-school game, considering it's 8 years old... man that makes me 
 feel so old! And I'm only 15! How I'd kill to go back to the 90s :P Anyway, back to the review. 
 As far as I remember, this game I found interesting, fun and slightly educational. Except for the 
 fact that because I played this game at the age of 8 or so, I got the impression you use . to release 
 the brakes on anything... but I guess that stopped me from starting the car...
  
  The game itself possibly isn't as aesthetic as you'd like. To my knowledge, I remember it being 
 rather pizellated, and badly drawn out, but the science and physics behind the game amazed me. 
 Overall I can still say that this game is/was way ahead of it's time, in the sense that seemed 
 to be able to do more than any other game was able to at that time. Either that, or I just didn't 
 have much of a gaming life at all back then... either way.
  
  I'm going to rate the graphics low, but everything else high, because the game itself was *uber-realistic* 
 :D

Review:  I think Microsoft did a nice job on this game.
  
  
  GAMPLAY: I didn't really play this game very much, but when I did I had a good time. You can play 
 at an airport in NY and fly by the Twin Towers... that's cool.
  
  GRAPHICS: For '04 the graphics kind of sucked, but they were still okay.
  
  SOUND: The planes 
 really sounded like... planes. (Would you believe that?)
  
  VALUE: Selling this game now would not be a wise choice.
  
  TILT: I really liked this game, 
 but againI really didn't play it a whole bunch. I didn't really like installing it in MS-DOS mode 
 either.
