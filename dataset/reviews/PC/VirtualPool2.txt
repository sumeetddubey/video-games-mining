Virtual Pool 2 succeeds as being both an entertaining game and an instructional tool. 

 VRSports has worked magic with its release of Virtual Pool 2. VR Sports has taken many strides in 
 improving upon its earlier Virtual Pool, and thanks to its unmistakable attention to detail, Virtual 
 Pool 2 succeeds as being both an entertaining game and an instructional tool.   

 Players of Virtual Pool 2 are given many gameplay options: barroom or tournament setting; amateur, 
 pro, or expert difficulty (this affects pocket size and cut, rail, and table speed) ; and practice 
 or competition mode. You can compete against other players at home or over the Internet or choose 
 one of over 100 computer foes of varying skill levels. Virtual Pool 2 offers 12 very different 
 types of pool games as well, from 9-ball to Snooker. There are four versions of 8-Ball, Straight 
 Pool is a wonderful practice game, or you can invent trick shots and situations. VRSports had an 
 eye on the rulebook, so be sure to call those shots, and every game is accurate to its regulations. 
 To assist those unfamiliar with billiard protocol, rules are included in either the manual or in 
 a keyword searchable help index.  

 Virtual Pool 2 takes some getting used to, as the table view and shot alignments are controlled 
 by the mouse. You can zoom right into the action by viewing your shot from atop the cue ball or 
 retreat to an almost voyeuristic perspective from the ceiling, and every angle between the two 
 is obtainable. Gameplay physics are precise in Virtual Pool 2. The strength of stroke, cue-ball 
 English, and impact angles are all critical factors in bagging your shot; the only thing missing 
 is chalking your stick - that much is automatic. Practice mode also allows the use of shot tracking 
 lines that guide preciseness, an invaluable support for long cuts or bank shots. Further aid is 
 gleaned by viewing the included video clips, and there are over 75 here, hosted by World Champion 
 players and illustrating everything from game basics to trick shots.  

 Virtual Pool 2 is a simulation that plays almost identical to the real thing. Like the original, 
 it comes with a money-back guarantee promising to improve your actual game - and with the amount 
 of accuracy here, it's a good bet VR Sports won't have to cut too many checks.
