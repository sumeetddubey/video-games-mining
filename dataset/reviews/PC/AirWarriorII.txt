:::Review:::
A worthwhile investment if you're a fan of WWI or WWII flight and fight sims. 

 For over a decade, Kesmai Corporation's Air Warrior has been the most popular online multiplayer 
 flight sim, available on commercial online services such as Delphi and GEnie. It comes as no surprise, 
 then, that we should see a boxed version - and see one with enough new missions and features to 
 make any aerial combat enthusiast salivate.   

 Published by Interactive Magic, Air Warrior II is more than front-end software to facilitate online 
 dogfights. Pilots can climb into over 35 aircraft and tackle over 300 single-player missions against 
 some pretty sober AI, or battle one-on-one via modem play. To ensure high replayability, other 
 additions have been included - such as an editor to create your own missions and the ability to 
 record and replay your flights.   

 Air Warrior II's interface is a snap to use, with many customizable options. First time players 
 may want to select an "Instant Action" game to get started: No take-off, landing, or missions - 
 you're simply dropped in the middle of a battle. Air Warrior II is easy to learn, and the designers 
 have balanced aerodynamic authenticity without sacrificing the fun factor. With the help of a well 
 put-together 140-page booklet and a handy reference card, command over your weapons, in-flight 
 aircraft controls, and multiplayer navigation takes little time to master. Don't misunderstand 
 - the controls may be easy to learn, but the missions get increasingly difficult (the long range, 
 unescorted strikes into Germany are one of the tougher sets of missions) .  

 The major problem with the game lies in its visuals. Although you can pump up the screen resolution 
 up to 800 x 600 or 1024 x 768 (if you're running more than 16MB RAM) , the scenery in AWII seems 
 terribly bland and outdated, and little or no effort has been made to add texture to the original 
 Air Warrior terrain. The landscape looks like a green tarp, and if you get close enough, you'll 
 be treated to a few isolated trees, gray square buildings, or a mountaintop. While graphics aren't 
 the "be-all end-all" of air combat sims, it's the serious lack of detail that takes away from some 
 of the realism.   

 Despite its minor shortcomings, Air Warrior II is a worthwhile investment if you're a fan of WWI 
 or WWII flight and fight sims. Although the terrain is dull to look at, the frame rate is very 
 good (even on a 486/100) , so there's definitely a trade-off factor here. The realistic cockpit 
 views coupled with the extensive single-player and custom missions make AWII a must for heated 
 aerial gameplay, and it will probably remain a resident on your hard drive for some time. For a 
 real thrill, launch an Internet game from the Web (Kesmai/Aries Games) , and discover why the original 
 Air Warrior has ruled the online skies for the past ten years.
