:::Review:::
While the Battleground series has always featured solid gameplay, this new title adds a grace of 
 play and significant style to the table as well. 

 Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon in front of them Volley'd &amp; thunder'd; 
 Storm'd at with shot &amp; shell, Boldly they rode &amp; well, Into the jaws of Death  

 Alfred, Lord Tennyson, attempted to capture the glory, the spirit, and the savagery of military 
 conflict in this quote from The Charge of the Light Brigade. Battleground: Waterloo, 
 the third entry in Talonsoft's Battleground series, provides an even more intriguing perspective 
 on Napoleonic warfare. Some historical games offer accuracy at the expense of looks; others have 
 style but no substance. Battleground: Waterloo offers the best of both worlds, and throws in some 
 great new features along the way.  

 The installation of this Windows-based game is painless ... unless you are low on hard drive space. 
 Installation requirements range from 26 to 303 megabytes. The game recommends running Windows in 
 256-color mode; anything more slows it to a crawl. Once you've successfully loaded the game, prepare 
 to be impressed.  

 The graphics in Battleground: Waterloo are first-rate. In addition to the traditional 2-D perspectives, 
 the 3-D views of the battlefield appear to have significantly improved over the previous Talonsoft 
 games. The Zoom-In modes reveal incredibly detailed units, buildings, and terrain. Sounds effects 
 are average, but the music truly helps draw you into the action.  

 Battleground: Waterloo's interface is similar to that of its predecessor, Battleground: Gettysburg, 
 with a few extras tacked on. One outstanding addition is the Advantage slider, which lets you make 
 the game as easy or difficult as you like. Instead of forcing you to choose a single difficulty 
 level, the programmers now allow you to alter the balance of the scenarios to suit your tastes. 
 Since Battleground: Waterloo lacks any tutorial, the Advantage slider allows you to learn without 
 becoming too frustrated. Several other features have been tweaked to allow more unit control. The 
 combat AI is also very good, but plays conservatively and doesn't spring too many surprises.  

 
 In the end, while the Battleground series has always featured solid gameplay, this new title adds 
 a grace of play and significant style to the table as well. The game has very few weak points, 
 and a host of strong elements. Battleground: Waterloo will show you more than a simple look at 
 a battleit will show you how a wargame can do almost everything right.

Review:  It states on the backside of the game box, Easy to play, difficult to master. And that is the one 
 and only backside of any game box i have ever read to be true. So, very, very true. The game is 
 about Waterloo, the last battle of France's great general and emperor Napoleon. You can play the 
 battle from both sides. The french side and from the, well, em lets say allied side. The french 
 are superior in cannons, and in men against the Army of Wellington, but when the Prussian army 
 under the command of Blucher arrives, you can only hope to hold them at bay. You have several small 
 scale scenarios, amongst the main battle itself. Many of them are What if?, but there are some 
 historical too. Lets say you start the battle, actually the scenario that is the battle and is 
 named la Grande Battaile de Waterloo. You basically see 2 different armies (the prussian army comes 
 as reinforcements later on ) . Units on map are battalion size, and because several battalions 
 are needed for one brigade, and several brigades are needed for one division, it may look like 
 a mess to some people. You move units by clicking, and you fire on enemies, if they are in range 
 too. But this is a very strategical game, and great planning is required to win the game. The french 
 have to manage more than 150,000 enemies, during the course of the battle, while having only 100,000 
 soldiers. But their soldiers are somewhat superior to most of the prussian ones, and superior to 
 the dutch and nassau troops. The graphics of the game are low-standard these days but, they still 
 look good to me, but they certainly are the weak part of the game. The sound is, well, everytime 
 you fire with your unit, or the enemy fires with theirs a movie appears and you can see actual 
 soldiers firing. Thats as much effects you get in the game. On the other hand. This game has the 
 best music, the music that fits in the best and simply perfect music. I have never, ever enjoyed 
 music in a game so much. The value of the game is also great, since you can choose multiple paths 
 to complete the battle, and have additional scenarios too. I dont know anything about the multiplayer 
 though, since 4 years ago, when i got this game, i couldnt find a person to play it with (nor did 
 i have internet for that matter so, my attempts were rather futile in all directions) and it certainly 
 isnt any different today (when i have internet, and can search for players online) . Its a hard 
 game, and certainly isnt a walkthrough. Expect to see the deaths of thousands. Its very rewarding 
 in the end though, because you can say, i did what Napoleon couldnt do, or i beated him in record 
 time. If you see this game, it should be so cheap that i strongly reccomend you buy it.
