:::Review:::
If you're new to the SimCity franchise, this package is a solid introduction. 

  The SimCity Box is a good value, so if for some reason you haven't tested your mayoral prowess 
 in a SimCity title before, now's your chance. Ostensibly, this package includes five games, though 
 that isn't quite the case, since two of them are expansions. Yet at $39.95, it packs in dozens 
 of hours of quality gameplay, thanks in particular to the inclusion of SimCity 4 and its Rush Hour 
 add-on. This isn't quite the dream team of SimCity games -- no one wants or needs the lame SnapCity, 
 and the inclusion of 1998's SimCity 3000 would seem a no-brainer -- but if you can overlook the filler, 
 you'll still find that the cream rises to the top.  

           These otherworldly visitors in SimCity Societies do not come in peace.      

  The 
 most recent title in The SimCity Box is  Destinations , an expansion to 2007's  SimCity Societies 
 . Societies on its own was a decent but unremarkable take on the city-building formula, in which 
 you juggle social energies and economic needs while making your sims happy in your ever-expanding 
 burb. With the recent release of Destinations, however, SimCity Societies leapt a great hurdle -- so 
 be sure to install both the original game and its expansion when prompted. The duo won't provide 
 the challenge or depth you might be used to from a SimCity title, but the presentation is charming, 
 and the simple gameplay is surprisingly engaging. When you consider that the expansion goes for 
 $29.95 on its own, it's also an obviously valuable part of the package. You may have rightfully 
 dismissed Societies as too easy to hold your interest, but the expansion is good enough to bring 
 it in step with the big boys.  

   

  Of course, the meat of this package is  SimCity 4 . As with its predecessors, it was a rewarding 
 challenge that could keep you glued to your computer monitor for hours at a time. Five years after 
 its initial release, the game is still up to that task. The early hours are admittedly slow: You 
 create residential, commercial, and industrial zones while balancing the intricate economic burdens 
 of a growing metropolis. But as your town grows, these needs require a tight balancing act that 
 involves a lot of thought and care. This installment allows for more micromanagement than do prior 
 games; you can set taxes based on social class and zone type, for example, so expect to fiddle 
 around with these options often as you search for that financial sweet spot. In turn, these elements 
 make for an involving game, and seeing impressive new buildings sprout up is an excellent reward 
 for your keen eye and thoughtful calculations.  

  SimCity 4's expansion,  Rush Hour , streamlined the gameplay in ways that made the initial release 
 seem obsolete, so again, be sure to install the expansion before jumping into the original. As 
 you can guess, Rush Hour is all about transportation, and it gives you all the tools to manage 
 your travel networks: parking garages, intercity ferries, and other enhancements that allow you 
 to better see how your roads are affecting traffic congestion. But the most interesting aspect 
 of the expansion is the added ability to get behind the wheel of a vehicle (or in the cockpit of 
 an airplane) and zoom about your bustling burg. It's all good fun, though you shouldn't expect 
 much from the driving mode: It's clunky and a bit unintuitive, though it was pretty awesome back 
 in 2003.  

           In Rush Hour, rail stations are only one solution to your traffic woes.      

  Together, 
 these four games make The SimCity Box a worthwhile value, if only because there's so much gameplay 
 for a good price. SimCity 4, the oldest game of the bunch, still looks good and sounds great, so 
 there's no reason to shy away if you're worried about the dated visuals. The pair of Societies 
 titles looks better by today's standards, though the frame rate can get a little rough in a city 
 packed with structures and decorations. All four of them benefit from a good deal of charm, from 
 the oft-hilarious news tickers to the dramatic-looking disasters that can lay your city to waste. 
 As for the fifth included game,  Sims Carnival: SnapCity , it's best to ignore it completely and 
 hope it goes away. It's a weird and boring mixture of Tetris and SimCity, and as interesting as 
 that sounds, you shouldn't play it.  

  It's too bad that The SimCity Box isn't more historically relevant: A package including SimCity 
 2000, SimCity 3000, and SimCity 4 (and their add-ons) would have made for a fantastic, entertaining 
 look at an important game universe. Thankfully, four of the five titles included provide enough 
 value and entertainment to be worth the price, so if you're looking for a broad introduction to 
 the SimCity series, this is a good way to start.

  The SimCity Box is a good value for those who are interested in city building, yet haven't experienced 
 the SimCity series of games.
  
  The SimCity Box's "premiere" title is Destinations, an expansion to Simcity Societies. Destinations 
 helps elevate the gameplay above the mediocre levels presented in the original game, but it still 
 doesn't measure up to the depth of the other Sim City titles. Its a fun game to play around with, 
 but won't really challenge you with balancing budgets or worrying about pollution.
  
  The shining jewel of this collection is SimCity 4. Even after five years, it continues to exist 
 as one of the premiere city-building games. The game offers the highest degree of micro-management 
 and is quite challenging, but this makes creating a successful city all the more satisfying. The 
 game has aged well and still looks great.
  
  SimCity 4: Rush Hour is an undisputed improvement over the original. If focuses on transportation, 
 allowing you to fix up your road networks, add garages and ferries, etc. The coolest feature is 
 one that lets you take nearly any vehicle for a spin.
  
  The last game, Sims Carnival: SnapCity, is hardly up to the other games' caliber. It's a strange 
 addition to this collection, and can only be described as a fusion of SimCity and Tetris. Hardly 
 a compelling game.
  
  If you want to try out the SimCity series for the first time, then go ahead and pick up this collection. 
 It's just disappointing that it doesn't include the more relevant games from the franchise: SimCity, 
 SimCity 2000, and SimCity 3000. These would have been great to try out, and would have easily been 
 a better choice than Sims Carnival: SnapCity.
