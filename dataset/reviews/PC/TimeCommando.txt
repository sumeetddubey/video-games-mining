:::Review:::
Enough whiz-bang graphics to keep gamers awake into the wee hours of the morning. 

 It's 2 a. m. and I'm still playing Time Commando, the latest game from the French development group, 
 Adeline. By some stroke of luck, and probably a large sum of money, Activision has managed to publish 
 a ground-breaking title that has enough whiz-bang graphics, environmental, enemy, and weapon variety, 
 and clever twists to keep me and many other gamers awake into the wee hours of the morning playing 
 our hearts out.  

 The game is a cross between Alone in the Dark, Fade to Black, and (back me up here, old-timers) 
 that old Apple II classic side-scrolling fighting game, Karateka. The basic premise here is that 
 you work in a virtual reality combat training facility where soldiers are schooled in all forms 
 of battle, from primitive to futuristic. As the thin plot thickens, a virus is uploaded to the 
 main computer. Because the future is apparently devoid of anti-virus software, you get sent into 
 the computer to fight the virus and the many, many unique foes it puts in your way. You start in 
 a prehistoric setting throwing rocks and swinging clubs at cave-dwellers, and progress through 
 the game by beating on various human and animal life with every conceivable weapon appropriate 
 for the time period.   

 Despite the fact that the story has loopholes so large that I could throw my 17-inch monitor through 
 them, the game's graphics are outstanding. In a bold move, by developer Adeline, the action is 
 displayed via a kinetic, cinematic camera that swoops around the environment and your main character 
 to continually give you the most interesting angle on the action. We're not talking Doom here, 
 where the backgrounds are rendered on-the-fly. These are pre-rendered backgrounds with pre-determined 
 camera movements similar to those in the Alone in the Dark series where the camera is stationary 
 while you're in an area, but as you move to the boundaries of that area, the camera either follows 
 you with a zoom, dolly, or pan, or the view switches to another stationary camera in the next area. 
 To complete the individualized feel of the game experience, your character and enemies are polygons 
 rendered completely on-the-fly. This combination of visual effects allows the game to pursue a 
 linear path with static backgrounds, while using fluidly animated characters within those environments. 

 Techie talk aside, Time Commando also delivers some great thrills. What sets this game apart from 
 the pack is its depth: the number and variety of its enemies, weapons, and levels are unmatched. 
 What other game gives you a chance to whack a Friar with a broadsword, hurl fireballs at an evil 
 demon, have swashbuckling bouts on the deck of a Conquistador's ship, and perform aerial jumping 
 kicks at an electric bear and fish that live inside a computer processor? As you travel through 
 the game you pick up lots of cool new weapons, but finishing each time period leaves you with only 
 your fists and feet to ward off bad guys. There are numerous hidden rooms and power-ups to be uncovered, 
 but you'll find that many of them remain hidden while you succumb to the urge to follow the beaten 
 path. Part of this is due to the pressure of a time limit. The virus, represented by a meter at 
 the top of the screen, is basically a timer. You must find floating computer chips along the way 
 to keep the virus from overtaking the computer. The other factor that hinders your search for secrets 
 is that you lack the ability to go backwards in a level. Once the area scrolls off the screen it's 
 inaccessible. While this is annoying, it does create a fast tempo that forces you to continually 
 forge ahead.  

 A number of clever twists have been added to keep the action lively even in the later stages of 
 the game. A good example is the Wild West section of the game, where you come upon a barn but you 
 can't open the door. Dynamite sticks are being lobbed in your direction from a window at the top 
 of the barn, but shooting at the window doesn't change anything. The secret here is to catch one 
 of the sticks of dynamite and throw it back into the barn, presumably igniting the stash of TNT 
 inside, which makes the barn blow up reeeeeaaal good.  

 One of the most amazing points in the game can be found in the Modern Wars era where you acquire 
 an Uzi and a rocket launcher. Realistic sound effects and very cool explosions highlight this section. 
 You can't call yourself a gamer until you've fired off a few rat-a-tat rounds from an Uzi in Time 
 Commando - it's an invigorating experience.  

 One of Time Commando's small flaws is its enemy intelligence or, perhaps, its lack thereof. In the 
 easier skill levels, the game is a cake walk and even in the harder ones, the enemies still walk 
 right into your line of fire, without regard for what type of weapon you have in your arsenal. 
 Bad as this sounds, the game might consist of an eternity of hide-and-seek playing if the enemies 
 had more intelligence. Another minor irritation is that it's often hard to position your character 
 when trying to dig out a hidden item. The game should have offered a larger hot-spot area for these 
 operations. And the final criticism of Time Commando is that the background graphics and the characters 
 aren't always a seamless combination, causing certain graphic anomalies to occur that can break 
 the suspension of disbelief.  

 Adeline has shown with Time Commando that it still has the wherewithal to produce a masterpiece 
 on par with Relentless, its incomparable action adventure.

Review:  I still remember the first time I played Time Commando. My father bought me the game for my birthday. 
 I installed the game in my flashy Pentium 100 and then I started to play one of the greatest games 
 ever. 
  I remember that I was totally stunned by the wonderful graphics, I can remember the way I fought 
 against cavemans, ninjas, aztecs, modern soldiers or even strange future women armed with yo-yo. 
 
  It's been ten years and I still remember how good I felt the first time I beat the game.
  I wish there were more games as good as this Time Commando...

Review:  Well, Its been a while since I've played this game.. it was 1996 when i started playing this classic 
 and it was dream come true.. first of all it has a great story.. you are trying to save earth from 
 the virus and you have to travel to do this hard misson.. you get to see caveman, romans, near future 
 and future..
  
  its 2006 now and I've just downloaded this game again.. can't believe how hard it is for me now 
 :p ... these old-classics are way better than ps2 or xbox 360.. I have got both of them but i still 
 play Time Commando.
  
  If you like try try this game I would say go for it because it will keep you up for some time.

Review:  Time Commando may not even run for all I know on an XP machine whithout a lot of tweaking. But 
 it deserves mention as one of the more fun action games when it came out 9 years ago. Fairly simple 
 3d graphics but with a great variety of enemies and locations. The levels are partially scripted 
 here and there and this helps to give this fairly straightforward action combat game some "depth." 
 The is some minor clipping problems on a few levels but they really are minor. My favorite level 
 was a space marines section with zombified astronauts. 
  
  Worth remembering with a review. They REALLY should make more games like this today.
