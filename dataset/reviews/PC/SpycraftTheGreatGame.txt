:::Review:::
This is not a game whose video segments are mere story-props that leave theplayer behind, but one 
 designed to keep the player actively involved. 

 If the concept of a resolutely straight-faced game developed with actual input from former CIA/KGB 
 members seems just a little scary to you, you'll be all the more prepared for Spycraft, which is 
 more than a little frightening. As a CIA operative from The Farm, the player must utilize 
 intelligence records and techniques -- including satellite photo enhancement, multi-level data analysis, 
 field combat training, image alteration and even interrogation/torture -- to root out a group of 
 renegade secret agents who have killed a Russian presidential hopeful and are now after America's 
 Chief Exec. My head's had just about all the bad-acting-intensive, video-based yawners it can handle 
 without actually imploding, so Spycraft came as something of a relief. The acting is reasonably 
 good, and the game elements are presented in a nonlinear fashion which, while simplified (and still 
 slightly bewildering) , presents the realistic, on-your-own flavor of an intelligence operation. 
 This is not a game whose video segments are mere story-props that leave the player behind, but 
 one designed to keep the player actively involved (sometimes emotionally involved, and that's all 
 this reviewer is gonna give away about that) .   

 Spycraft is a classy piece of work; it's entertaining but at the same time manages never to insult 
 the player's intelligence, unless it's on purpose (Absolute crap! is one of the charming 
 evaluations your handiwork may receive over the course of your training.) A caveat: Realism, acting 
 and game quality aside, Spycraft is essentially a mystery, and hence has as much replay value as 
 finding your car in a mall parking lot.

Review:  I played this masterpiece and stuck then left it on the shelf like a fool for a few months. Thankful 
 to some help from a online walkthough I got unstuck and was just amazed at how much variety and 
 fun this game was.
  
  The highlights for me was leading a rainbow six like assault on a building it was like a poor man 
 rts with just red dots and stuff to represent your team.
  You give a order to breach and then listen to the great audio and some visual feedback as your 
 team attempts to assault the room.
  There are some shooter like parts but most of this is like a mystery you are the slueth bringing 
 the puzzle together.
  CIA weapons and tech is all over and really makes you believe you were an agent for short time 
 and adds alot of cool factor (untraceable ice bullets anyone?)
  
  The visuals are movie like most the time and really brings you into the story.
  There a few games 
 that attempt this same feel/feat Foxhunt comes to mind but I feel it wasn't as rewarding when the 
 credits started rolling.
