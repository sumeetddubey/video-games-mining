Elementary, my dear Watson? Not even close. 

 Elementary, my dear Watson? Not even close. If you have a few dozen hours to kill, check out Electronic 
 Arts' Case of the Rose Tattoo from the Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes series. While figuring out 
 the mystery actually is elementary, solving the case isn't so easy. Sherlock Holmes' brother is 
 injured in a strange explosion during a social function at the Diogenes Club. Was it faulty gas 
 pipes or foul play? That's the question.   

 Despite the hours the game takes to solve, you're not likely to get bored too easily. The game makes 
 great, subtle use of video and graphics, and gives you plenty of characters to interact with and 
 interrogate. The down side to all of this is that the game is strictly linear. In order to move 
 along in your investigation, you have to get the right questions answered, and uncover the right 
 clues, in the right order. Unfortunately, that means clicking on things until your finger goes 
 numb. For a large part of the game, the only deductive reasoning you need is figuring out what 
 object you haven't clicked on yet, which doesn't take skill or brains, only patience. Luckily, 
 when you get stuck, an included hint book is around to give you enlightenment.   

 Depending on how you look at it, the linear nature of the game is a bit of a mixed blessing. There 
 are so many places to go, and so many people to question, it would probably be too overwhelming 
 were you given the power to go anywhere you wanted. There's a handful of puzzles along the way, 
 including a chemistry set you use to analyze clues, as well as a game of darts. While the game 
 doesn't really require a whole lot of brilliant detective work, it's still entertaining to watch 
 the story unfold as you click along. If you're looking for unpredictable twists and turns, this 
 game probably won't deliver. But if you're in the mood to use a little brain power and watch a 
 fascinating mystery from the eyes of a master detective, this is the game for you.

Review:  Having recently finished Sherlock Holmes: Case of the Serrated Scalpel (Serrated Scalpel) and Sherlock 
 Holmes: Case of the Rose Tattoo (Rose Tattoo) , I thought both were review-worthy. I had heard about 
 these games, but never got the chance to check them out. At the time Rose Tattoo appeared on the 
 shelves, my system did not have the CD-ROM drive that was required to run Rose Tattoo. I'm reviewing 
 both games at the same time, because both were made my Electronic Arts and while different in their 
 own ways, they had a couple design elements in common. I will not elaborate on the basic premise 
 of each, because other reviews have already done so.
  
  Visually, Rose Tattoo stands out from Serrated Scalpel. Instead of 256-color artistic backgrounds, 
 you have backgrounds that were given a more realistic look to them, with FMV actors manually performing 
 each action. I counted just over 90 people in the end credits. While many of these are small parts 
 - NPCs in a certain location - it is still a lot. The game is also voiced, too, which is why it 
 makes use of CD-ROM technology. Those that desire can choose No Speech, which provides the ability 
 to click-through dialogue at your own pace (I read faster than the actors speak) , which is great 
 until you get to the actual cutscenes, where you are unable to do this. These do not happen often, 
 though, and most of the time you can click through at your own pace.
  
  I thought this game had a storyline that was even more complex and several more locations to visit. 
 I counted up 25 when I was near the end and even then another couple of places became available. 
 As before, you can always go back to a place you visited previously, and while you do need to do 
 everything at some point, it does not have to be done in a specific order. There is much to keep 
 track of and if you try to keep track of it all, you might get lost. Luckily, Watson again notates 
 all conversations, so you can always refer back to something. Again, you can not die or purposely 
 get stuck.
  
  Different from Serrated Scalpel, however, is that your available action verbs have been whittled 
 down to what appears when you right-click the mouse. The default for objects is usually Look and 
 the default for characters is usually Talk if you just click the left mouse button. However, this 
 is usually not enough and you need to check out the available verbs when you right-click. They 
 aren't always available the first time, though, and you need to sometimes come back to an object 
 after looking at other things and/or talking with other characters - including Watson. Once I got 
 the hang of it, it was OK, but it did throw me off at first. It simplifies the game in that aspect, 
 but there's more pixel hunting in this game, to up the challenge, so to speak. It does follow in 
 the exploration model of Serrated Scalpel and any good detective should completely survey the scene, 
 anyway. I mentioned that the story is more complex, which means there is more conversing this time 
 around, too. Talk to everybody about everything, and then click on him or her again to see if there 
 are new dialogue choices.
  
  Sometimes, older games are shorter and can be finished more quickly, but not Rose Tattoo. I spent 
 a good 12 hours (the minimum standard for today's adventure games) exploring, conversing, and generally 
 keeping busy. Despite all that, I know I missed a couple of optional things. The game is reminiscent 
 of Laura Bow: The Colonel's Bequest, in that you get out of it what you put into it, in terms of 
 what you all do and how thorough you are. In the end, I appreciated the opportunity to fully explore 
 my environments and question all suspects about every possible thing. Too many games look great, 
 but have little substance. I thought Rose Tattoo had more substance. The new look took some getting 
 used to and because of the new verb system, I didn't think it was as good as Serrated Scalpel, 
 but it came very close. Playing Serrated Scalpel is not required to play Rose Tattoo, but if you've 
 played one of these two games, I encourage you to play through the other one.

Review:  Not going to belabor the point here. Most people know what they're getting in a Sherlock Holmes 
 game, and this is fairly typical of the mini-genre. Search for clues, talk to people, slowly unravel 
 a mystery. Good basic adventure gameplay that wasn't too tough.
  
  But what struck me about this game is the dialogue. Extremely erudite, observant, faithful to the 
 period, and frequently funny in it's precise wording. You just can't find writing this good in 
 most games (not since the best of the old Infocom and Legend adventures) .
  
  So it's almost 10 years old now and probably almost impossible to find, and may not even run on 
 modern systems. But if you're an adventure fan with a literary bent, do yourself a favor, track 
 down a copy, and take a chance.
