FX Fighter represents the future of PC fighting games: the fullythree-dimensional fighter. 

 
 FX Fighter represents the future of PC fighting games: the fully three-dimensional fighter. Just 
 as Battle Arena Toshinden has done on the consoles, FX Fighter illustrates just how visually impressive 
 a full 3-D environment can be. Even so, as with all ground-breaking technology, certain wrinkles 
 need to be ironed out before FX Fighter can live up to its claim as the ultimate PC fighting 
 game.  

 This is an extremely atmospheric and versatile title, allowing variation in environment, challenge, 
 number of players, and graphic detail. The characters are diverse, both in appearance and ability, 
 and the worlds where the battles take place are dark and surrealistic. While the characters are 
 advertised to have forty different attacks, you rarely utilize (or need to utilize) more than about 
 ten. In fact, if you get too ambitious, you risk sending your character spinning out of the ring 
 and into the Great Beyond.   

 In order to develop the 3-D graphics and keep game speed at a respectable level, the designers kept 
 the number of polygons as small as possible. The result is that the characters have a slightly 
 wobbly, disjointed, almost drunken appearance. This actually helps the atmosphere, though, and 
 makes sudden attack moves all the more exciting.  

 FX Fighter's final drawback is in the lack of challenge of the one-player mode. Only eight opponents 
 are available, and, with minimal practice, you'll find a move that enables you to finish all of 
 them with relative ease. Variable difficulty levels help, but you really need a friend to beat 
 up on to extend the play value.  

 In general, FX Fighter's amazing graphics and personality see to it that this title is far and away 
 the most inventive and interesting fighting game available for the PC today. With a bit of fine-tuning 
 in response time and graphics, the result should be a game for the ages: FX Fighter 2.

Review:  This game has so much to offer, good graphics, gameplay and interesting characters who are just 
 so much fun to fight with!
  
  The story mode is very good, you start off with one of the many interesting and unique characters 
 and you take over planets by defeating your opponents and one by one you take them out, clearing 
 the game. this game is fully 3D and uses the ring out fearure well for once.
  
  This was the first fighter i ever played and my god was i amazed, i dont blame myself, this game 
 looks awesome and the music in this game is the best ive heard in a long time. This in fact probably 
 has the best music ive heard in a game.
  
  This game for sure has changed the way fighters were made, this game is truly unique and surprisingly 
 good for its time. this game should be played at least once, just to see what started some of the 
 good fightes off.
