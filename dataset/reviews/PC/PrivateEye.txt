:::Review:::
Private Eye falls into the trappings of almost every interactive movie , unsteadily treading a thin 
 line between a linear narrative structure and an experience controlled by the player. 

 Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe has seen several cinematic incarnations, from Humphrey Bogart's 
 seminal portrayal in The Big Sleep (1946) , to Elliot Gould's minimalist Marlowe in Robert Altman's 
 bizarre interpretation of The Long Goodbye (1973) . Private Eye from Byron Preiss Multimedia is 
 the first attempt to bring the cynical PI to an interactive environment, and it succeeds in re-creating 
 the hard-boiled atmosphere of the novel it is based on, Chandler's The Little Sister. Unfortunately, 
 Private Eye leaves a great deal to be desired as a game.   

 Private Eye falls into the trappings of almost every interactive movie , unsteadily treading a thin 
 line between a linear narrative structure and an experience controlled by the player. If the designers 
 had stuck to the first option, creating a sort of living storybook for grown-ups, then they would 
 have had something really great on their hands. The minimal animation - which looks like a cross 
 between Dick Tracy comics and The Dig from LucasArts - is excellent, as is the original jazz score. 
 And - surprise, surprise - the voice acting is top-notch, especially the voice of our hero, which 
 never resorts to the Bogie impression one might expect. The game is made more enjoyable by the 
 continual barrage of Marlowe-isms - such as during an interview with an aspiring actress caught 
 up in the seediness of '30s-era Hollywood, when he sums up her character with a deadpan, "She looked 
 about as hard to get as a haircut."   

 The technical achievements are undermined, however, by the almost total lack of any so-called "game." 
 Long stretches of animation are interrupted by the opportunity to make minor decisions, not unlike 
 the film sections of the last two Wing Commander games. The scene stops, and Marlowe confronts 
 you with an opportunity: "I could ask him about this-and-that, or I could ask him about such-and-such." 
 And of course, you constantly wish you could do the sensible thing, which would be both. But such 
 are the limitations of Private Eye, and so you press on, never sure if you're making any headway 
 because you're never asked to make any deductive decisions. It's always "should I take this incredibly 
 valuable clue, or should I leave it?" or "Where should I go next?" when there's really only one 
 sensible option. And in the end, the interactive elements became a tedious obstruction in the otherwise 
 enjoyable experience, and I found myself wishing I could just set the thing on autopilot and have 
 it tell me the story.   

 What made Chandler's Marlowe stand apart from similar hard-boiled creations was that his cynicism 
 was always the result of an inherent optimism. Despite his tough-guy demeanor, he was always giving 
 people the benefit of the doubt, and time and time again the world let him down. I sympathized 
 with Marlowe while playing Private Eye - wanting desperately to enjoy it, but left feeling ultimately 
 empty and disappointed.
