:::Review:::
Summer Athletics captures none of the passion and excitement of summer athletics. 

  Imagine, if you will, an international goodwill competition consisting of eight athletes coming 
 together in some city or other to test their abilities in a series of dull takes on traditional 
 sporting events while the eyes of the world look elsewhere. Summer Athletics: The Ultimate Challenge 
 brings this vision to life, and it's every bit as underwhelming as you'd expect.  

           It may be hard to believe, but rotating both thumbsticks rhythmically for a minute or 
 two isn't much fun.      

  Summer Athletics is a collection of seven simple minigames based on seven categories of events: 
 running, jumping, swimming, throwing, cycling, archery, and high diving. Although there are a number 
 of events within each category -- the jumping category contains pole vault, long jump, triple jump, 
 and high jump events, for instance -- the differences in how the events in a category play out are 
 relatively minor. You can jump right into any individual event or play through a prearranged or 
 custom competition made up of any combination of events, with up to four players participating. 
 The game also includes a career mode in which you create your own superathlete and take him or 
 her through a series of competitions. There are a surprising number of options for customizing 
 your athlete's appearance, but none of them have a significant effect. No matter how much you tinker 
 with these options, your athlete will still end up looking like a plastic doll made from the same 
 mold as all the other athletes in the game. Summer Athletics pretends at depth by making you spend 
 points after each event to improve your athlete's attributes in career mode, but this just feels 
 like busywork, because it's never clear what effect these attributes have on your performance. 

  There are more competition options here than you can shake a javelin at, but they can only be as 
 good as the minigames they're composed of, and the minigames in Summer Athletics range from mediocre 
 to awful. The diving events are just simple rhythm games. Your dive takes place in slow motion, 
 and you have to respond to a series of visual cues with precise timing to execute the best possible 
 dive. It's nothing remotely exciting, but at least it's clear what you have to do to succeed.  
 

  The same can be said of events like short-distance running, which just involves jiggling the right 
 stick back and forth as fast as you can on the 360 and moving the Wii Remote and Nunchuk up and 
 down rapidly on the Wii. There's no depth to it, but there's still a certain straightforward appeal 
 to these kinds of brief endurance events that's reminiscent of classic sports games like Track 
 &amp; Field. The throwing events and jumping events are pretty similar to each other, and all involve 
 building up momentum with rapid controller inputs and then timing your jump or throw for the best 
 possible result. Like the short-distance running events, these feel a lot like sports games of 
 old that put an emphasis on rapid button mashing. That gameplay mechanic still works in short bursts, 
 but it is decades old, and this game does nothing to improve upon it.  

  Archery is a bit better on the 360 than on the Wii. All you do here is line up a shot, taking wind 
 into account, and fire. Using the thumbsticks to line up your shot seems more precise than using 
 the remote. The swimming events, on the other hand, are considerably worse on the 360, though they're 
 terrible on the Wii as well. On the Wii, they involve moving the remote and nunchuk in motions 
 that vaguely resemble the swimming style being used in the event, and getting into a good rhythm 
 is pretty easy, though waving your arms in the same motion for a minute or two is anything but 
 fun. On the 360, you must rotate both thumbsticks constantly in an overly precise rhythm that's 
 tricky to establish and extremely difficult to maintain.  

  The worst of the bunch are the cycling and medium-distance running events, which require you to 
 pace yourself to maintain a balance between speed and conservation of stamina. If you don't push 
 yourself hard enough, you'll fall behind the pack with no chance to salvage the race, and if you 
 push yourself too hard, you'll run out of stamina well before the race is over. Staying in the 
 pack is essential, since the only way to conserve your stamina is to stay in the slipstream of 
 an opponent. Finding the right balance in the medium-distance running events is tricky, and in 
 the cycling events, it's downright mystifying. The confusing onscreen gauges provide no guidance, 
 so time and time again you will find yourself being passed by your opponents with no idea how to 
 improve your performance.  

           One nice thing about the sprint events is that they're over quickly.      

  As you'd 
 expect, the Xbox 360 version is sharper and more vibrant than its Wii counterpart, but neither 
 version looks good. All of the athletes seem to come from the same very small gene pool. The animation 
 for the athletes is smooth during competitions, but the same few canned animations are repeated 
 for celebration and disappointment after events. The event arenas feel eerily empty, and the only 
 constant presence is a creepy grinning monkey dancing in the background. The sound in the game 
 is disappointingly minimal. The noise of the crowd cheering has about as much character as what 
 you'd hear in a sports game on the Atari 2600. The athletes seem to have taken a vow of silence; 
 they don't utter so much as a grunt or a shout, and the announcer has only a few bits of verbiage 
 you'll hear over and over again.  

  A handful of the events in Summer Athletics can make for simple fun in small doses, especially 
 if you have a friend or two handy to compete against, but the majority of what you'll find here 
 is lousy. Even at a budget price, seven minigames isn't much for your money, and considering that 
 most of them aren't worth playing, even diehard sports fans are better off steering clear of this 
 game.
