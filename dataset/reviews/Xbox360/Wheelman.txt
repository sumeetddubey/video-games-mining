:::Review:::
Wheelman offers plenty of movie-style thrills, although it's hamstrung by terrible on-foot gameplay. 
 

  Ever since it was announced as both a movie and video game, Hollywood's influence on Wheelman has 
 been clear. The game certainly panders to action game fans, finally answering the question, "What 
 would it be like to spin a motorcycle onto its front wheel and shoot a truck in slow motion?" While 
 the driving is fun and exciting, the on-foot sections are terrible, mired by poor control and weak 
 enemy AI. These weaknesses prevent Wheelman from reaching its potential, and the uneven 6-8 hour 
 campaign leaves you wanting more good content once the game wraps up.  

           When you're behind the wheel, Wheelman really succeeds in making you feel like a Hollywood 
 action hero.      

  You play Vin Diesel as Milo Burik, an American driver who arrives in Barcelona to go undercover 
 and infiltrate the city's three biggest gangs. The game works hard to make you feel like you're 
 an amazing driver, empowering you with a number of special abilities that not only help you survive, 
 but look cool as well. You can perform "vehicle melees" using the right analogue stick, swerving 
 into enemies or ramming them from behind. You can also steal civilian cars by "air-jacking" them, 
 jumping from car to car like some sort of urban Tarzan. Then there are the aimed shot and cyclone 
 moves, where you can shoot at enemies in slow-motion from an over-the-shoulder perspective.  

 
  These special moves are the most enjoyable part of Wheelman, as they really capture the essence 
 of the Hollywood movies that inspired the game. While they can become repetitive over time, the 
 focus meter ensures that you have to be driving well in order to pull them off, and the steady 
 supply of enemies and police means that you're always under pressure. The control system makes 
 it easy to slide around corners and perform donuts, and the game definitely succeeds in making 
 you feel like a Hollywood action hero.  

  You can either play Wheelman as a free-roaming game in which you find missions yourself, or you 
 can use the map to jump to the relevant locations. The missions often revolve around escorting, 
 capturing or stealing cars, but there are some particularly memorable assignments, such as driving 
 through a newspaper editors office, and smashing up rival advertising billboards. Things get repetitive 
 as you progress, and the game can be beaten in around six hours, but there are optional side missions 
 that extend the longevity and give you an opportunity to increase your focus meter, vehicle health, 
 attack power, and performance. Fugitive missions are particularly good; planting you deep in enemy 
 territory and then challenging you to make it to a safe point alive.  

  There are only a few missions involving on-foot gameplay, which is a good thing, given how badly 
 the game plays in this area. There's no cover system, so you have to protect yourself by ducking 
 behind objects, and it's a real pain to target enemies and free-aim. Even more implausible is the 
 lack of a jump button, meaning you have to walk around obstacles. The enemy AI is also painfully 
 stupid, positioning itself next to explosive barrels, which are inexplicably scattered in locations 
 that include a church graveyard.  

  The storyline for Wheelman is cinematically styled, but it's predictable and stuffed with risible 
 dialogue. The gangs are staffed with the sort of thugs you've seen a million times before, and 
 while they often speak in Spanish or Russian, they lack any sort of believable motives or intriguing 
 relationships. Diesel's character is pretty arrogant, although that could be described as his style, 
 and when the whole thing wraps with the tease of an inevitable sequel, you're not really sure who's 
 working for who or why.  

  Wheelman captures the style of Barcelona for its setting, but it's devoid of the same sense of 
 life. Take La Rambla for example -- a vibrant mix of market vendors, tourists and street performers 
 in real life, but an abandoned collection of park benches, coffee tables and generic shacks in 
 the game. That said, Wheelman keeps the pace moving by making nearly everything destructible, even 
 if you're on a bike. On the downside, Vin Diesel's 'good guy' status means that he can't kill any 
 of the civilians in the game, as they jump to avoid getting runover and are completely invulnerable 
 to bullets.  

           The story is confusing, but there are plenty of movielike cutscenes.      

  Thankfully, 
 the music fits perfectly, with a Spanish-influenced soundtrack for the game's many loading screens, 
 and an orchestral score that adds to the urgency of the chases. The music is locked when you're 
 on a mission, but you can flick between seven radio stations if you're just cruising around. They're 
 split into genres like classical, urban, and American, and though they lack licensed tracks, the 
 music quality is serviceable. The sound effects are also good. You can hear fan belts screeching 
 from clapped-out vehicles, and the voice acting is much better than the script deserves. On the 
 other hand, the graphics vary from unremarkable to just plain bad, particularly when it comes to 
 the characters. It's hard to believe that Vin Diesel was happy to be represented like this; he 
 has dead eyes, strange lip movements, and rough shadows across his face during many cutscenes. 

  Wheelman introduces some neat ideas to the open-world driving genre, and when you're moving at 
 high speed, it's a lot of fun. The slow-motion gunplay and air-jacking work particularly well, 
 and really make you feel as though you're blessed with superhuman driving abilities. Nevertheless, 
 there are also some big problems, particularly the on-foot combat and complete lack of multiplayer. 
 If you're a fan of Vin Diesel or movie-based car chases then you'll get some enjoyment out of Wheelman, 
 but only if you can vehicle melee your way around some significant flaws and omissions.

Review:  Games in the open world action genre carry the burden of being compared to crime centric games 
 like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row. This game has a few interesting ideas but most of them don't 
 turn out as well as you'd hope. Wheelman is an open-world action game that has Vin Diesel at the 
 helm. The main character's name is Milo Burik but his appearance and voice is that of Vin Diesel's. 
 
  
  The game takes place in Barcelona, Spain. Milo is a highly skilled driver that has come to Barcelona 
 for reasons that are never told. The opening cutscene has Milo picking up a woman who vaguely implies 
 that she's some kind of gangster who needs your help. There are three main gangs in Barcelona and 
 so it's Milo's job to be sort of a "go-to" guy for whatever gang is in need of his driving skills. 
 
  
  To put it bluntly, the story in Wheelman is horrific and it has more holes than a hundred pounds' 
 worth of Swiss cheese. The game never tells you why Milo has come to Barcelona, who he works for, 
 how he knows the woman [in the first cutscene] , or why she needed to be picked up. It doesn't make 
 sense that Milo does jobs for every gang because if any of the gangs had so much as half a brain 
 they would kill Milo for being a traitor. If you knew that your right hand man was sleeping with 
 the enemy, would you keep giving him work when you already know that he is a traitor? It also doesn't 
 make sense that Milo never receives anything in return for being an errand boy to the three gangs. 
 Nobody pays him even a single Euro. 
  
  The vehicular combat is clearly where most of the developers' effort was put into. You can do these 
 little swipes with your car either to one of two sides or in front of you. These are known as vehicle 
 melee attacks. Using the vehicle melee attacks successfully can send other cars crashing into a 
 wall or cause them to wear down (they'll eventually explode if you damage them enough) . Another 
 thing at your disposal is shooting while driving but it's handled very poorly. You have no control 
 over where you want Milo to shoot when you are driving normally; more often then not, he'll be 
 shooting at a car's tires when you really want him to take out another driver. All you can do is 
 hold down the Left Bumper on the Xbox 360 controller and hope for the best. 
  
  While in a car you are encouraged to drift, slam into other cars with the melee attack, drive at 
 a high speed, and destroy pieces of the environment (street lamps, benches and phone booths) . Performing 
 any of these stunts will earn you what I like to call 'special juice'. Once you gain a lot of special 
 juice you will get the ability to give your car a temporary speed boost or to use one of Milo's 
 special abilities. You can use the 'aimed shot' by pressing up on the D pad and this will slow 
 the action down to something that resembles a James Bond or Matrix film. A reticle will appear 
 on screen and it's your job to align it with a circle that appears on an enemy's car that is in 
 front of you. Several successful hits will make your enemy's car explode, and it's easier to make 
 them explode using this method rather than manually smashing into them until they explode.
  
  The other special ability is called 'cyclone'. It's basically the same as aimed shot but in 
 reverse. When you have a lot of special juice, simply press down on the D pad to perform it. Your 
 car will spin 180 degrees and the same looking reticle will appear on screen. Align your reticle 
 with a circle that appears on an enemy's car and keep shooting them. Repeat this process to relieve 
 them of their lives. Basically, cyclone is good for taking out enemy cars behind you, while aimed 
 shot is good for taking out enemy cars in front of you. 
  
  There's also a move called the air jack; an action that sounds much dirtier than it actually is. 
 When you are driving behind the car that you want to steal, you hold the 'B' button until a green 
 arrow appears. Once you see the green arrow, let go of the 'B' button for the awesomeness to ensue. 
 Milo will climb onto his car's roof, leap onto the car in front of him, kick the driver out of 
 the window and then take control of the vehicle. All of that happens while both cars are in motion. 
 
  
  The on-foot shooting seems like it was an after-thought for the developers. The enemy AI is terrible; 
 they almost never stay behind cover -- they prefer to stand out in the open or to hang out near 
 explosive barrels. They never show aggressive behavior in the fire fights and most of them wouldn't 
 be able to hit the broad side of a mosque. None of the places you'll be fighting in are memorable -- 
 they're just generic looking train stations and churches. Even if the problems were to be fixed 
 it wouldn't solve how bland the shooting gameplay is. With a cover system and some special abilities 
 it could've been OK, but as it is, you'll dread the shooting portions of Wheelman. 
  
  The story missions wear out their welcome before the game ends -- that's a sign that Wheelman is 
 a one-trick pony. When you're finished with the story you can dive into over 80 side missions. 
 There's a good variety to what they have you do; you'll be hijacking specific cars and bringing 
 them back to a base, destroying as much of the environment as possible in a given time limit, doing 
 street races, escaping from a mob of enemies that are all out to kill you, and more. I had more 
 fun with the side missions than with the story missions. 
  
  Some of the story missions suffer from poor design. Most of the missions that are frustrating involve 
 shooting from your car. That's not a coincidence. The mission that has you chasing after a train 
 on a motorcycle will try your patience as you battle the game's flaws. I mentioned earlier that 
 shooting from your car is a chore, but it's even more of a chore when the game throws an unfair 
 amount of enemies at you. Enemy cars will literally pop out of thin air. If you were capable of 
 shooting directly at an enemy driver it wouldn't be much of a problem, but because of the fact 
 that Milo almost always aims at their tires [regardless of the situation] it's rather annoying. 
 
  
  Wheelman's graphics are unimpressive across the board. The car models are ok looking; they have 
 some nice looking reflections but the vehicle damage looks totally weak, and the vehicle explosions 
 are laughably bad by today's standards. An ugly, pixilated flame engulfs the car; then the car 
 turns black while the car parts fall off in an unconvincing manner. The explosions make the vehicle 
 combat significantly less satisfying than it ought to be. Milo Burik's character model is decent 
 looking, with the exception of his eyes. In the cutscenes his eyes look very bright and shiny which 
 makes it seem as though he's just seen the Holy Spirit. 
  
  The developers of Wheelman have somehow managed to make the city of Barcelona look boring. Most 
 of the streets look the same, and it's no fun to explore the city. In the game-world you'll come 
 across Arc de triomf and Port Vell which is pretty neat (they are real places in the real Barcelona) . 
 
  
  There isn't much to rave about when it comes to the sound of Wheelman. The guns sound like cap 
 guns and the music fits with the setting but it isn't memorable or recognizable. Vin Diesel generally 
 sounds good delivering Milo's lines; he's got a deep and seductive voice that works well with Milo's 
 character. Most of the other characters have stereotypical voices that don't add anything to the 
 game. There are also some inconsistencies with the subtitles during cutscenes. Characters will 
 occasionally speak in Spanish but the subtitles don't always match the language. In some Spanish-speaking 
 cutscenes there will translations of what they said but other times the words will be in Spanish. 
 Eso est loco! 
  
  There are no multiplayer, co-op or leaderboard functionalities of any kind in Wheelman, so most 
 of the stuff to sink your teeth into is the side-missions. Wheelman is an unimpressive and sometimes 
 frustrating game that is certainly not worth paying $60 for. Maybe in a few years it'll be worth 
 a look when the price has gone down, but until then you already have some better options to get 
 your open world action game fix from. Thanks for reading.

Review:  I have played alot of of low budget games but this is just Bad
  Let me just start by saying that the graphics look like they could run on a ps2 i dont usually 
 care about the graphics but they are almost as bad as 
  The Outfit.
  The game has a really bad story it's boring and confusing.
  
  The story is that you are an 
 undercover CIA agent in Barcelona named Milo. Your job is to take down the 3 main gangs in the 
 city. Basically you work for a gang, who will hire you to take down another gang, then the gang 
 you JUST took down will hire you to take down the gang you originaly worked for. It's confusing 
 i dont know why the gangs just don't kill you.
  
  The game has cheesy one liners, annoying characters, Short story mode,
  and no multiplayer. I 
 have no idea how Vin Diesel could let them release this game like this.
  
  You are probably fed up with me bashing the game but i'm just telling you my opinion so lets move 
 onto the few good parts.
  
  The game has a feature called ' airjack ' which can be rather fun what it lets you do is hijack 
 a moving/parked car while driving at high speeds.
  Another feature is the aimed shot and the cyclone which lets you slow down time to take shots at 
 the enemies and a thing called vehicle melee where you can smash into the other cars using the 
 right stick.
  The last good thing i can think of is the activities such as rampage, taxi driving and lots of 
 other cool things if the activities were not here i would have given this game a 3.
  
  if you are thinking of getting this game play the demo or rent it first.

Review:  I don't know why everyone bagging on this game for its "lack of story." I guess people are under 
 the assumption that, because it has film star Vin Diesel, it should have some elaborate Hollywood 
 style story as its foundation. I don't recall most of the Need For Speed games having what I would 
 call a "riveting story," but they were still really fun racing games (especially NFS Underground 
 1 & 2) . If you're thinking about playing this game because you're looking for an amazing story, 
 you're in for a letdown. If, however, you're going to play the game because you like racing style 
 games that include heated gun battles and fast-paced action, you'll probably enjoy this game.
 
  
  The graphics look really good (especially in HD) . If you're playing the game to get achievements, 
 you're in for some frustrating times throughout the course of the game. One achievement (worth 
 100 gamerscore points) requires you to complete all the side missions in the game with an S Ranking 
 (highest rank possible) in each one. On some missions, it's fairly easy to get an S Rank on your 
 first attempt. On other missions, it may take you 30 times of replaying the mission just to get 
 everything right and get the S Rank.
  
  I've been playing the game for probably around 10 hours and I've spent about 95% of my time playing 
 the side missions. Truthfully, I don't really care about the story or how it plays out (if you 
 want a brief rundown, basically you're trying to infiltrate multiple gangs in Spain and take them 
 down) . The side missions are where the real fun is. They give you the opportunity to perfect your 
 driving skills (which will make the actual storyline missions a lot more manageable when you decide 
 to play them) and on top of that, getting either an A or an S Rank in the side missions will give 
 you some sort of "power up" that makes the game a lot easier. Some types of side missions give 
 your vehicles more health (which comes in handy when you've got 10 gang cars slamming into you 
 with people hanging out the passenger side windows shooting at you) . Other side missions make your 
 vehicle do more damage to other cars when you ram into them (handy for taking out gang cars) . Overall 
 I think there are 7 or 8 different types of missions that all include an upgrade or something of 
 benefit if you get a good rank when you complete each one.
  
  Summary: Don't rent this game if you're looking for some "Fast & Furious" style storyline. Rent 
 this game if you're into fast paced driving games and don't really care too much about the story. 
 Overall, if you're playing the game for achievements, you'll log a lot of hours in the side missions 
 and you'll see more of a value in the game than someone who is playing primarily for the storyline 
 and doesn't care about the achievements. If you stick to the Storyline Missions, the game won't 
 take that long to complete at all.

Review:  Since the release of The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay on the original Xbox in 
 2004, Tigon Studios and their founder, Hollywood star - Vin Diesel, have set the standard for videogame 
 movie tie-ins. Their latest project, Wheelman, stars Diesel once again, but takes a very different 
 direction and also produces vastly different results.
  
  You play as Milo Burik (Vin Diesel in voice and appearance) , an undercover CIA agent and "wheelman," 
 essentially a high-end getaway driver. Your role is to infiltrate various gangs and criminal factions 
 in the real-world city of Barcelona in Spain. The developers clearly put a lot of effort into making 
 sure the architecture in their virtual city matches the real city's iconic landmarks. As you drive 
 through Catalunya's capital you'll notice famous landmarks such as Sagrada Famlia and Casa Mil. 
 However, while the buildings are true to life some liberties have been taken with the street layout, 
 most notably in the roads being much wider than in real life, in order to make chases through traffic 
 a little easier. That said, they need not have bothered widening the streets because there is very 
 little traffic and pedestrians compared to other open-world games, like GTA IV, so virtual Barca 
 ends up feeling a little empty by comparison.
  
  The seemingly thinly populated city may have come as a result of using Unreal Engine 3 to render 
 the game's open-world. Unreal 3 is normally saved for high detail, smaller, closed environments 
 - and it shows in Wheelman. Environmental textures are often functional enough, but sometimes stray 
 into the downright ugly, while the relatively low resolution character models are most definitely 
 sub-par. There are some strange proportional issues as well. Vin's over-designed chest pecks look 
 distinctly "man-boob" like from some angles! On the other hand, the vehicles look pretty good, 
 but obviously more effort has spent on modelling the 1 or 2 licensed cars, rather than on the much 
 more common unlicensed vehicles.
  
  In gameplay terms Wheelman is structured very similarly to other car-chase games, such as Driver 
 and True Crime, though it certainly has its own gimmicks to set it apart. Most prominent of these 
 is "vehicle melee" which has you using the right stick to slam your car into your enemies, effectively 
 using it as a weapon. 
  You also have a couple of special moves which will immediately have you thinking of the highway 
 chase in The Matrix Reloaded. "Aim Shot" allows you to shoot forwards through your own windscreen 
 in first person, helping you to pinpoint enemy fuel tanks for quick kills. "Cyclone" performs the 
 same function, but spins you 180 degrees to aim at enemy's car bonnets, or even the driver himself. 
 They most definitely achieve their goal of changing the way you think about car chases in games, 
 but after you've seen them a few times they can start to feel repetitive. Finally there's "Air 
 Jack" which allows you to jump from car-to-car at high speed, Just Cause style, to change out of 
 a damaged vehicle without stopping.
  
  The core handling model is very arcadey, encouraging epic drifts and handbrake turns as well as 
 ludicrous slow-mo jumps and explosions, but it's nothing you haven't seen before and its stiffness 
 makes navigating through traffic on a motorbike unnecessarily difficult. However, as soon as you 
 step out of a car you quickly realise that the driving is definitely Wheelman's strength. 
  
  On-foot control is exceptionally bad considering this game runs on the same engine that powers 
 Gears of War. The cover system requires back-to-basics use of the crouch button and the animation 
 is really lacking in polish. Shooting is solid enough and the aiming is reminiscent of GTA IV, 
 but the enemies you'll be shooting at aren't exactly the smartest. When you're out of the car the 
 game feels distinctly "last-gen."
  
  On top of the story driven missions you get a whole raft of side missions, which are often more 
 entertaining than the story. These include taxi fares, races, fugitive chases (point to point chases) , 
 rampages (destroying a certain amount of road side objects) and contracts (take out a specific 
 enemy vehicle) . Completing these objectives will upgrade some of your abilities, such as your car's 
 durability, but you can very easily finish the game without ever doing them.
  
  Wrapped around the gameplay is a story that you've probably seen before in countless action films 
 and you'll be hard pressed to feel emotionally connected to any of the characters. There are a 
 couple of events later in the game that are clearly supposed to pull at your heart strings, but 
 frankly the storytelling was so disjointed that I was still struggling to figure out who everyone 
 was. On top of all this, the voice acting is really poor, even Vin Diesel himself sounds robotic.
 
  
  In the last act of the story the game tries to present the player with a sense of choice by offering 
 3 missions, only 1 of which you can play, but the story makes no sense so you're unlikely to feel 
 the impact of your decision. Besides, whichever choice you make ultimately results in you undertaking 
 a structurally identical mission anyway, just in a different part of the city and with a different 
 character dying at the end of it.
  
  My other major gripe with the game is that it can be very buggy. Very occasionally you'll see traffic 
 spawn out of thin air and during my review playthrough I experienced one glitch that broke the 
 game entirely. I failed a mission by being pulled from my car by a police officer, but upon reloading 
 a checkpoint the animation of the cop pulling me from the vehicle just kept on repeating over and 
 over again. The only solution was to restart the mission (which I was already 10-15 minutes into) 
 from the beginning.
  
  It can't be denied that Wheelman is fantastically entertaining at times, but it's all buried under 
 a steaming pile of glitches and action movie clichs that make it difficult to ever get truly immersed 
 in. Factor in its short length and lack of multiplayer and you've got a title that's good for a 
 rainy weekend's gaming, but not much more.

Review:  Vin Diesel is back in game with Wheelman, a new game from Ubisoft, Midway, and Tigon. 
  
  Wheelman is a driving game based on mission. It have many factors that can make it good game. Vin 
 Diesel, Amazing stunt actions, and Unreal Engine. But it lacks of good story, facial animation, 
 and challenge to the gamers.
  
  The story, Vin staring as Milo, a wheelman (a. k. a crazy-ass-driver) , coming from US to Spain (no 
 background story of him or what so ever) jump into the heart of gangster activities on Barcelona. 
 Take jobs from one gangster to another. The story is weak, the cutscenes are bad, plus bad facial 
 animation (i know Vin have a cold-looking face but he doesn't have any facial expression on it! 
 he just moving his lips, it's so plain)
  
  The gameplay, Wheelman have interesting gameplay, with so many amazing stunts! I really love the 
 air jack system! It's a mechanism to jack moving vehicle by jumping from your current vehicle, 
 really great, it's very useful cause your enemy can damage your car pretty badly. Another good 
 idea is aimed shoot system where you can automatically aimed your shoot to your enemy's vehicle 
 wheel, engine, or the driver. You can use cyclone (this is the best part of the game) where Vin 
 spins his car 180 degrees then shoot his enemy's vehicle behind him. It even more amazing when 
 he's driving a bike! Vin can use melee attack with his car too, this is a great idea, by simply 
 tap the right analog button to the left or to the right, the car will smash other vehicle around 
 it, great! While on foot, Vin can't punch people, he can only shoot them with infinite ammo handgun 
 and limited shotgun, assault rifle, or smg, Shooting mechanism is simple, it use auto aim, just 
 like GTA. No cover mechanism but you can crouch. The gameplay is great, the problem is, Vin is 
 so great, he's a type of die hard man with fool enemy. Sometimes it can be intense with the numbers 
 of enemies chasing and shooting at you but with those two shooting mechanism and melee attack, 
 Vin can escape easily, there are no challenge to the gamers.
  
  The graphics is amazing, a free-roaming game with unreal engine, it just great. The environment 
 is very destructible, there are some low frame-rate but it won't disturbed you. Too bad the game 
 doesn't have good physics, you can see the car blow almost 10 meters up in the air with extreme 
 explosion effects.
  
  The sound, average but it have cool scores, Vin Diesel's voice is awesome.
  
  So, this game 
 is for you who likes crazy stunts and the excitement of blowing your enemies ass.

Review:  Im Really enjoying this game and even though its has some bad points what game doesn't well first 
 ill start with the gameplay the first few missions are very fun but you will notice that they start 
 to become the same which kind of takes the fun away but if that don't bother you then its really 
 fun the graphics it isn't the best graphics but isn't the worst I would say there ok there isn't 
 that much detail in the environments so the city seems abit dead and dole most of the streets all 
 look the same as well so its like your driving in the same place all the time the cars look good 
 the sound is abit dole and the voice acting isn't all that good as well but its ok 
  
  Overall
  I am enjoying this game but some stuff should have been made better I suppose it seems 
 rushed but it is a fun game

Review:  i am a great gta fan and so love all games that look and feel like it. wheelman was one that i was 
 waiting for. it has some real vin diesel attitude and great vehicle combat, with great looking cut 
 scenes and some nice muscular vehicle melee attacks. but as soon as the game progresses your eyes 
 will start getting tired of seeing pontiac, smart, opel astra and some ducatti look alike.. i was 
 surprised to see just a handful of vehicles in the whole of barcelona and so the wheel factor of 
 the name suddenly just hit me back. new additions of using vehicle for combat, slow motion shooting, airjacks, and 
 police chasing is all ok but is the only thing.. missions very much will remind you of a lot of 
 games you have played before, and although the map is huge all buildings look the same so makes 
 you feel like driving around in the same place. graphics is good, cool videos, gameplay is at first 
 soothing but then boring, few vehicles, bad in foot combat, no character customization, an ok story, in 
 short just average.
