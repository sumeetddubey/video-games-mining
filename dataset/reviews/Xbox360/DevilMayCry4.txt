:::Review:::
The newest entry in the revered series features plenty of awesome action, a great new character... and 
 a bit of repetition. 

  You'll probably remember Devil May Cry 3 for the PlayStation 2 as being an unfairly difficult game, 
 yet one that rewarded your patience with a slew of high-quality action. If playing it gave you 
 tears of frustration, you'll be happy to learn that although this sequel is a challenge, it's by 
 no means an extreme one. In fact, you're given an excellent number of gameplay choices that help 
 you tailor the challenge to your preferences. You can initially choose one of two difficulties 
 (and if you want to cry like a little girl, you can unlock several more) , and you can even choose 
 whether you want the game to perform some combos for you automatically. No, you aren't apt to find 
 Devil May Cry 4 to be excessively tough on your first play-through, though it is no walk in the 
 park either. However, it is  generally  excessive -- not that that's a bad thing. Stylish action, 
 terrific boss fights, and beautiful, melodramatic cutscenes will inspire you to push forward, and 
 they serve as an appropriate reward for a well-played sequence of demon slaying.  

           You wanna piece of me?      

  It isn't surprising that a game featuring the charmingly 
 insane Dante would be so over the top, though the series' famed antihero is not the real star this 
 time around. Don't worry; you'll still get to play as Dante, and he brings with him a good selection 
 of weapons and fighting styles, just as Devil May Cry fans would expect. But you'll spend the majority 
 of the game as newcomer Nero, who has a selection of impressive and elegant moves of his own. Nero 
 is an excellent character, capable of delivering a few wisecracks, a brooding glance, and a heartfelt 
 plea of love to his beloved Kyrie in a few moments' time. He's clearly cut from the same cloth 
 as Dante, though it's a bit disappointing that the game doesn't explore this connection in more 
 detail. Nevertheless, you'll want to follow Nero's exploits as he struggles to learn the truth 
 about his own religious organization, The Order of the Sword, and Dante's apparent murder of its 
 leader.  

  The story doesn't offer up a whole lot of surprises, but it embraces a certain attitude of self-indulgence. 
 Cutscenes are overwrought, visually stunning affairs, and are among the best you are likely to 
 have seen in any game in recent years. The theatrical dialogue, impossibly athletic animations, 
 and swooping camera work make for quite the spectacle, but somehow, it's a spectacle that manages 
 to stay on just the right side of cheesy. Devil May Cry 4 takes itself seriously, but not  too 
  seriously, so for every shocking, bloody cutaway, there's an equally funny quip that helps keep 
 the narrative in check. There are a couple of cringeworthy exceptions, such as one scene where 
 Dante decides he's a tango dancer (don't quit your day job!) , but overall, you're apt to find the 
 scenes to be gorgeous, thought-provoking, and emotionally stirring.  

  Nero's claim to fame is his demonic arm, better known as the devil bringer. With it, you can grab 
 onto distant enemies and pull them in, pick them up, and slam them around for some excellent combos, 
 plus deliver a few other surprises. These mechanics are easy to pull off, and they represent a 
 general shift from the defensive gameplay of Devil May Cry 3 to a more aggressive approach. As 
 you play, you can pull off some incredibly satisfying moves, both in the air and on the ground -- the 
 most violent of which are accompanied by slick, bloody animations and appropriately gory-sounding 
 thwacks and slashes. Timing these various moves can be tricky, but like in the previous games, 
 eventually the subtleties of your combos click, and in time you'll be pulling enemies toward you, 
 slashing them into bite-size pieces, and smashing them into one another with glee.  

  The devil-bringer moves go a long way, which is probably a good thing, since Nero has neither as 
 varied an arsenal as Dante nor access to multiple fighting styles. However, he does have his standard 
 sword, red queen, and a revolver known as blue rose, and later on he earns another weapon that 
 franchise fans will enjoy seeing in action. As you progress, you will earn proud souls based on 
 your performance in any given mission, and with them, you can purchase new combos and upgrade existing 
 ones. And you'll need them, too, since you'll need to handle droves of demons that get progressively 
 tougher -- and they're awesome to look at, to boot. You can choose these new moves individually, 
 or you can let the game auto-select them for you based on how varied you want your array of attacks 
 to be. It's worth noting that you can't really make a mistake here; if you don't like the move, 
 or if there is a more powerful upgrade available to you, you can unlearn what you have purchased 
 for a full refund and use the souls for something else.  

           The action is stylish, beautifuland bloody.      

  You'll also encounter a 
 number of secret missions scattered about, and you'll no doubt find them the most challenging aspect 
 of the game. In some cases, you have to execute a certain move a set number of times in a row, 
 or dispatch every demon within the allotted time. While those missions are challenging, others 
 require you to have purchased a particular move before you can manage it. If at first it seems 
 that some of these missions are simply unbeatable, have faith and return to it later. There's a 
 good chance you were simply just missing a piece of the puzzle. You aren't required to do these 
 missions, but the orb fragment you earn is a perfectly fine reward, and accomplishing these difficult 
 tasks is incredibly gratifying.  

  About halfway through the game, you'll take control of Dante, and you'll likely go through a period 
 of adjustment while you get used to the change in gameplay techniques. Frankly, the devil bringer 
 is a great mechanic, and losing it is a bit of a disappointment, since it's likely to be the center 
 of your fighting style. Instead, you'll have a new set of actions and combos to get used to, new 
 weapons, and four (eventually five) fighting styles. Yet once your arsenal of melee weapons and 
 guns expands (Pandora's Box is a favorite) , you'll enjoy the cheerful boldness of them. There's 
 just a lot more variety here than with Nero, and it's a lot of fun to switch styles and weapons 
 on the fly, just to find more interesting and flashy ways of crushing demons to a pulp.     
 

  In addition to the dazzling action, you'll work your way through some light puzzles and platforming 
 sequences. The puzzles aren't tough, but they do require you to roam about a bit from time to time, 
 bashing on some switches, using a special device to slow down time, and accomplishing some other 
 odds and ends. They help break up the pace, but all too often these breaks result in lulls that 
 last a bit too long, making you long for another crazy demon attack. Some of the platform sequences 
 are fine, requiring you to use the devil bringer as a grappling hook to fling yourself around, 
 while some of the more standard sequences suffer from bad camera angles and an annoying tendency 
 for the camera to change positions midjump.  

           The boss fights are rather fun. Good thing, too, since you'll see most of these guys three 
 times.      

  Don't let the variety of weaponry and special moves lull you into believing that the rest of Devil 
 May Cry 4's design is similarly diverse. In fact, the many different ways of killing enemies is 
 quite a stark contrast to the repetition at the heart of the experience. While backtracking and 
 repeated environments have been a problem in past games in the series, the newest entry takes these 
 issues to an even higher level of monotony. Many successive levels take place in the same castle 
 hallways and forest meadows, and when you switch to Dante, you visit them all over again. Granted, 
 most of these areas are easy on the eyes, packed with gorgeous architecture and grand outdoor vistas. 
 Yet when you see them over and over again, and when some of the light puzzles have you traipsing 
 back and forth, you will wish for more to see. It has the effect of making a seemingly grand adventure 
 feel oddly limited.  

  That repetition even makes its way into the admittedly spectacular boss fights. These battles are 
 easily the shining star of Devil May Cry 4, and each boss is wildly different from the last, requiring 
 some split-second timing and good control over your reflexes. From a giant toad to a hulking stone 
 behemoth, these bosses are cleverly designed and a good deal of fun. Yet in the second half of 
 the game, you'll face all of the same bosses as Dante that you fought as Nero. While the game could 
 have benefitted from some new blood during these missions, the differences in styles between the 
 two at least lend some diversity to the repeated bosses and test the newest additions to your arsenal. 
 Yet amazingly (and irritatingly) , Capcom brings most of them out for a third time in the game's 
 padded and plodding penultimate mission. Yes, these fights are fun, but forcing most of them on 
 the player three times is overkill.  

  Regardless of which platform you play Devil May Cry 4 on, this game is a looker. Both Nero and 
 Dante are fluid in motion, showcasing a good deal of flair and subtlety in their movements. The 
 more damage a move does, the more astonishing it looks onscreen, and few games can approach the 
 pure razzle-dazzle of Nero jumping into the air, his cape flying and the glowing devil bringer 
 tossing lumbering demons around with matchless grace. From a design standpoint, the visuals can 
 be gorgeous to behold, and moments like your first glimpse of Gran Album bridge are bound to take 
 your breath away. What's more, all of this visual prowess is smoothly rendered on both platforms, 
 and broken up only by the occasional loading time. This can be noticeably reduced if you are playing 
 on the PlayStation 3, since some files will be installed to the hard drive, though the loading 
 times aren't excessive by any stretch. The downside for PS3 owners is that the installation takes 
 around 20 minutes to finish.  

           You may get rewarded for finishing a mission quickly, but you'll still want to gawk at 
 the scenery.      

  The sound design, like the storytelling, is merrily over the top. The vibrant brutality of your 
 most impressive moves is accompanied by equally squeamish and powerful sound effects. Fortunately, 
 the talented voice cast never hams it up, even when delivering the most melodramatic lines. As 
 Nero, Johnny Yong Bosch can be both remarkably sincere and sneeringly sarcastic, and his superb 
 acting makes for one of the most appealing new game characters to be introduced in some time. But 
 you may not find the music as universally appealing. This is the one area where Devil May Cry 4 
 feels too clichd, relying on the standard heavy metal grinds that accompany most demon-inspired 
 games and films, and replaying the same couple of tunes during combat ad nauseum. Luckily, it never 
 gets in the way, so while it may not stand out, it doesn't  stick  out, either.  

  Online leaderboards, challenging achievements on both platforms, and a host of unlockables (including 
 an action-only survival mode) will keep stalwart fans coming back for more, in spite of all the 
 repetition. Recycled content and some pacing inconsistencies aside, Devil May Cry 4 is a great 
 game, and it delivers a lot of quality action that will please fans without alienating those new 
 to the series. If you liked previous entries, you'll find what you're looking for here; and if 
 you were turned off by Devil May Cry 3's insane challenge, you'll feel a lot more comfortable this 
 time around.

Review:  Devil Mary Cry 4 is the last game in the DMC series (or so that's what's been said) . I was hoping 
 for Devil Mary Cry 4 to be a great experience that capped off the series-and that's exactly what 
 it did. First and foremost, there is a new character, Nero, and he has an awesome demonic arm. 
 This arm adds to the decent combat in the game. Old-time DMC fans won't be dissapointed though, 
 as Dante is also a playable character in the game. I don't believe the game is 100% perfect though, 
 as there could be improvements. When Nero's arm is used, the phrases he uses can get to be repetitive 
 and tedious. Also, although Dante is a playable character, I feel like there's something missing 
 to his repitoire. There isn't much to the story, but that I can get over since it's no big deal. 
 The addition of leaderboards is pretty cool, but I don't really care for them. Overall, I think 
 that Devil May Cry 4 is a good buy and is a must-have for any fan of the series, and even some 
 of those people out there who aren't fans

Review:  After hearing much hype about how great DMC 4 was on a whim I went to Wal-Mart to buy it. To my 
 shock it was only $34. Well it sat in my xbox rack for two days until i picked it up to play it. 
 Once i put it in I couldn't stop playing it until I beat it. I was able to accomplish this feat 
 within about 8 hours. The game was very solid and fun and the story line was very immersive. The 
 game deinately had somthing going for it that I very much liked. It felt more like playing an extension 
 of Ninja Gaiden than anything else. Don't get me wrong it doesn't feel like a rip off of Ninja 
 Gaiden but it definately gives the feel that Ryu Hyabusa is going to show up at any moment. Especially 
 with the price being as low as it was it was very much worth the buy and suggest doing the same. 
 It very much is worth having in your collection and not just renting because in time you definately 
 will be wanting to pick it up to play it again. Just dont play it for 8 hours straight like I did 
 cause it kinda burns you out ha ha!

Review:  Capcom just keeps making awsome games like STF4 DMC and many more my review: the best part of dmc4 
 is u play with nero as well as dante first half with the young kid then rest with dante who's matured 
 and is more powerful than ever.
  as the previous dmc there is no horde of demons behind u ,you fight specially designed demon lizards 
 , demon scarecrow, and royal demons , the boss fight are amazing. Berial one of the very first 
 boss u face fights like bull and ur in a arena trying to evade him ... thats cool on hard mode.
 
  
  the graphics are amazing the jungle and the city looks awesome, there is somthing for all the dmc 
 fans in this one, while playing with dante u can switch between styles with jst a click of the 
 controller which means u knw more combos. The fight between dante and nero is epic ,they fight 
 twice in the game and its tough , game is a killer and for those who already purchased it keep 
 making chains of combos coz there an arcade mini game also where u confront every demons one by 
 one and in hordes .
  dont loose ur patience on playing on dante must die mode coz
  DEVIL'S NEVER CRY

Review:  Very good game with very good story and good new edition with Nero the new protagioniest. You will 
 get your moneies worth out of it if you can get through the tough difficulty settings and get all 
 go through the bloody palace. I would choose this game over Ninja Gaiden 2 and other games like 
 that (god of war, etc.) Maybe could have used a little better work the backtracking parts but other 
 then that its a well made game and now with its price you should defently go and get it. Its like 
 20 bucks used i belive. Go out and get this well worth it!!!

Review:  I am a huge fan of Devil May Cry and It is one of my favourites games. Devil may Cry 1 and 3 were 
 amazing. The music of Devil May Cry 1 was very special and the story was perfect! Devil may cry 
 3 was also very good and funny but DMC 4 was a huge disappointing for me. It is a good game BUT 
 NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR A BIG FAN. The Same environments, the same enemies, nothing changes and the 
 puzzles are not fun.

  Gameplay: 8/10
  Graphics : 9/10
  Sound : 8/10
  Story : 8/10
  Dependence : 7/10

Review:  Graphics:9/10
  The graphics in DMC4 are breathtaking. There beautiful crisp anime graphics, there are very few 
 games like this on the Xbox 360. The detail in the characters and environment are amazing you can 
 see every thing.
  Sound:8/10 
  The voice acting in this game is top-notch. The music i did not like but i dont like that screamo/ 
 Heavy metal stuff (I'll stick to The Who) .
  Gameplay:7/10
  the game play is good but it gets repetitive after awhile witch will take up time on wanting to 
 replay it through again.
  Length:6.5/10
  This game is fairly short about 15-25 hours of gameplay not very long
  Story:10/10
  The story 
 is amazing in this game! This is the main reason i bought the game because i love the story! and 
 you can rewatch any cut scene in the game to make it look like a movie. There's this priest like 
 guy who wants a better world and turns his army into demons to take over the world.
  Lasting appeal:7.5/10
  Replay value is quite poor because theres not really anything to look 
 forward to besides achievements and pure entertainment but thats just my opinion.
  Over all:8/10
  DMC4 is a great game but thats my opinion not oyur you may disagree you may agree 
 so im just telling you thats all but i do suggest rent it at least. Viva Katamari out

Review:  The DMC series has never cease to amaze me. It always brings something new too the table that offers 
 a challenge + some new rocking tunes to listen too, that keeps me entertain while I do combos and 
 kill stuff. This game though has went through countless changes based upon players saying the mechanics 
 are off, or the game play is just down right terrible, which in noob terms most times means Very 
 hard to get used too :D! 
  These problems has finally been sum up and fixed with a new, or shall i say balance new Hero name 
 Nero, that basically everyone can get used to and use efficiently. He the shall i say the mixer 
 of Dante and his decease (whats known so far) brother Vergil; who offers hands down a unique and 
 great new fighting style with the help of his Devil arm in DMC4!
  
  The game play in DMC4 is easy compare to DMC3, which after DMC1 was consider the best DMC too date, 
 which in my opinion still is. The bosses are a little bit easier compare to the others, which again 
 is based off of new mechanics (Devil Arm) and in the middle of the game where you play as Dante, 
 which shows nothing new but backtracking and fighting the same bosses you shown who's boss already. 
 Dante ( the main hero in all DMC excluding DMC4) also has been revamp up a little bit as well, 
 but it isn't really that great once you play him for while though, which I guess is expected sense 
 this isn't the game he suppose to shine in anyways. The music (OST) , which plays a significant part 
 isn't long enough either, just replays of the same music, which makes this DMC the first to ever 
 do that, Is it the lack of funds or just being practical on the budget, your call. 
  
  Overall DMC4 is a great Action/Adventure game, which everyone should give it try, cause I can assure 
 you (if that means anything) that you will be glue to this game all night long. You'll also feel 
 right at home also you're a Castlevania Fan, so check it out!

Review:  All inclusive, the answer would be YES. A definite YES. Any owner of an Xbox 360 console (of age 
 of course, as this is a 16+ game) should definitely pick this game up for several reasons. It's 
 amazing to look at, the sound quality and content is fitting, the storyline is intriguing and accessible, 
 and most importantly the action is definitely the coup de grace, considering this is an action 
 game. There is SO MUCH to appreciate in this game partly because it does exactly what it says on 
 the tin; it lets you have fun. So for that reason and more to come, Devil May Cry 4 is a game that 
 you NEED to get. 
  
  Fans of DMC en masse; rejoice to know that in addition to the incredible new character Nero, comes 
 the return of series favourites such as the infamous anti-hero Dante, Trish, Lady, and even a certain 
 blue-clad demon you're sure to recognize and be excited to see. Like DMC3, DMC4 is straight to 
 the action and quite concise about it. Whereas DMC3 had a demon about to smite you in the first 
 seconds of the first level, DMC4 has you as the character of Nero facing off against Dante. "What?!" 
 I thought. "Fighting the second main character in the first level already? This is going to be 
 great!!" And great it was, as fighting other demons throughout the game is. Demons such as Bianco 
 Angelos and Alto Angelos (Demonic Knights) you would want to run into again just to lay down the 
 hurt, and demons such as Blitzyou'll hope you never see again. The boss fights in DMC4 are particularly 
 epic in comparison to past games, partly because they are MASSIVE. The first one being a fiery 
 centaur towering above tall buildings, and the last a floating colossal statue, larger than life. 
 Thanks to Nero's Devil Bringer Arm mechanic, grabbing these bosses produces fantastic results. 
 In fact, the final boss only takes 4 Buster moves to defeat. It's a sight you'll have to behold 
 for yourself to fully understand the magnitude of the power behind it. 
  
  Action aside, you can easily take some time to consider the calmer points of the game; the atmosphere. 
 Ah yes, the sea/ hill-side town of Fortuna, a modern, beautiful, DEMON INFESTED setting in the 
 high afternoon. Certainly, DMC4's environments look great, with plenty of demonic apparitions adding 
 to the scenery in an out-of-place yet appropriate way. From the bright and subtle town of Fortuna, 
 to the dark snowy mountain housing Gothic-style Fortuna Castle, to a rich, green Forest, and at 
 some point, the high skies above. So unlike past DMC games where it seemed to be all action and 
 demons, DMC4 manages to create a gorgeous looking setting that is both dazzling and easy on the 
 eyes. To stand alone in these places, using the character of Nero fighting for Love, or the character 
 of Dante fighting for Justice (yes, that's right fans, you can use Dante too!) you feel a heightened 
 sense of adventure. An endeavor, like any other DMC game, that is met by heavy resistance. Make 
 no mistake, DMC4 is challenging, trying, but no where near as frustratingly difficult as past games. 
 So for those of you who were afraid to enter the world of DMC, turned off by the insane difficulty 
 level; welcome to the world of demon hunters! For this game is sure to be more suitable for you.
 
  
  In DMC4, despite the large number of cutscenes you're bound to see, there's also a great deal of 
 loneliness, so to speak. Unless on their trepidation they meet a character that they interact with, 
 Dante and Nero are mostly fighting demons on their own, true to the core behind the DMC series. 
 And it's not all just fighting, because there's a plethora of puzzles to undertake, areas to explore, 
 higher places to get up to, and just general exploration. Compared to the likes of the first DMC 
 where the environments were large and explorable yet some areas were just for show, DMC4 allows 
 you to basically go anywhere that is visible and grab an item, jump to a ledge, or smash a switch. 
 Anywhere except that beyond graphical capability, or places you don't need to go (such as down 
 the depths of a mountain) . The graphics power of the Xbox 360 (and PS3 of course) allow for some 
 amazing visuals, many solid and fluid, one of the greatest being the Great Album Bridge, a sight 
 which is stunning and solemn, a sight which you must experience for your own, because words can 
 barely describe it.
  
  Other than the main storyline; the true meat of the game consisting of 20 levels, other modes are 
 available to play or interact with. There's a Library to view items, characters, weapons and such 
 like (like previous DMC games) , a gallery to view unlocked pictures from the storyline, Leaderboards 
 to compare your level score and total game score with other players across the world, and similar 
 to DMC3: Special Edition, Bloody Palace mode. Now, Bloody Palace this time around is much more 
 processed and certainly more challenging. Bloody Palace has you going from stage to stage, defeating 
 demon after countless demon, as usualwith a timer. A countdown timer begins each stage starting 
 from about 2:00 mins and goes down without resetting and can only be increased by defeating demons. 
 There is a higher sense of urgency this time around, with you having to use the variant skills 
 of either Dante or Nero to quickly defeat enemies, AND bosses, and move on, and look stylish doing 
 so. For those that found 
  Bloody Palace from DMC3 too dull and long, DMC4 gives you the challenge you need.
  
  Looking 
 at the characters of Dante and Nero, you can see big differences as well as similarities. Nero, 
 as such, is a physical representation of a younger Dante and resembles Dante's twin brother Vergil 
 as well (a point which is key to the main plot) . Dante is the older of the two, and has a light-hearted 
 yet serious outlook on the situation, whereas Nero is young, angry, and fighting for his beliefs. 
 The main story content is quite a serious affair itself, comprising of an ideal, a conspiracy, 
 and the characters that influence all this. Surely, a much more deeply and darkly involved concept 
 this time around, one that will appeal to those looking for more depth in the series. And of course, 
 using Dante and Nero has its own appeal, as Nero's moves revolve around his sword, his gun, and 
 his Devil Bringer arm, and Dante's moves involve several weapons and several fighting styles. Getting 
 to use (and getting used to!) Dante takes a while as he only becomes available some halfway between 
 the story, but it provides you with a chance to vary your skills for taking out demons. I personally 
 loved how Dante can change styles mid battle compared to DMC3 where you could only use one at a 
 time, as it gives way for some fun, and at times, ludicrous combo moves. I could go on, but that 
 would ruin the surprise of the world of features you'll discover in DMC4.
  
  Altogether; what more reason could you want for getting DMC4? It's a tome and a classic addition 
 for DMC fans, and it's a welcome entry addition to those new to the series. Power, Energy, Emotion, 
 as well as the occasional Comedy, all take centre stage in this enjoyable adventure that you're 
 sure to remember, and revisit again and again. Devil May Cry 4 is a game that deserves its place 
 in your games collection.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is a great game with a great mix of action and platforming / puzzle solving. DMC4 
 suffers from a poor story that does little to advance the series further, it starts with a organization 
 known as the "Order of the Sword" is having a ceremony and Dante comes in and disrupts the order. 
 The main character nero fights with dante to thinking that he is the enemy, but as the story goes 
 on Nero will find out who his friends and foes are, and his girlfriend Kiriea gets cought in the 
 mix. the story is only to send Nero from one place to another, then later in the game, send Dante 
 through the same areas over again. While DMC4's story may be laking, it more than makes up for 
 it in its combat. Nero has a new "Devil Bringer" that adds a completely new layer to the combat, 
 and finding which combos work well and experimenting is a huge part of the thrill of playing DMC4. 
 The part of the combat that lacks is the second half the game were you play as Dante. Its just 
 not as fun to play as Dante as it is Nero, Dante's combat arsenal is not fleshed out as it was 
 in DMC3 due to the fact that you only play as him roughly half the game. dante has the ability 
 to switch "styles" on the fly in DMC4, this is ment to give the player multiple ways to approach 
 each enemy, but in the end it limits dante to a few moves he can do per style compared to the almost 
 countless moves that could be done with his styles in DMC3. If dante had a seperate story this 
 aspect could have been avoided and his styles could have been more fleshed out and more weapons 
 could have been aquired but as it stands dante is a alright playable character in DMC4 and at times 
 enjoyable. Once you beat the main game you unlock more dificulties and the "Bloody Palace" mode 
 which in essence is a survival mode that takes you from 1 to 100 floors, each 10 giving you a new 
 boss. this mode is good and is better than the Bloody Palace from DMC3. speaking of the bosses, 
 they are incredible, each one is fun and chalanging in its own way. the only problem with to bosses 
 is that you fight most of them 3 times each, this is very excessive. overall DMC4 may not have 
 been as good as DMC3, but in all it is a great game that all people into action games should pick 
 up.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is the first installment in the series by Capcom for the newest generation of consoles. 
 It features all of the action, adventure, monsters and zombies that fans of the series are accustomed 
 to seeing and fighting. The game is unique, however, because it includes a new playable character, 
 Nero, that players will use for the majority of the game. For those of you who are fans of Dante, 
 don't fret, because Nero brings just as many (and in my own personal opinion, better) fighting 
 abilities, weapons, and moves to this game. Moreover, players will get to use Dante throughout 
 much of the last half of the game. Both character have their own fighting styles, but Nero has 
 a weapon called the "Devil Bringer" that makes him my preferred character to fight with.
  
  Gameplay wise, DMC 4 has all of the traditional action and fighting that veterans of the series 
 will recognize instantly. It also features a great deal of adventure and even some puzzles that 
 may throw some players for a loop during the course of the game. The action is fast-paced, the 
 fighting is challenging but fair, and the differences in fighting styles between the two characters 
 will help to keep players interested. Otherwise, the game proveides all of the run-n-gunnin, sword-swinging 
 action that any player could ask for. 
  
  Overall, I give this game a 9.0. The controls are excellent, the graphics are superb and the gameplay 
 is first-rate. The only reasons I cannot give it a "10" is because of a puzzle in the last half 
 of the game that players could spend hours on (without the advice of a guide) and the fact that 
 the replay value is not as high as with other action games I've played. Aside from that, DMC 4 
 is an outstanding game that provides plenty of action, some great boss fights (especially an absolutely 
 HUGE statue near the end of the game) , adventure, and the ability to upgrade your character as 
 you see fit. I highly recommend it.

Review:  I first was looking to buy a action game like this and was deciding between Ninja Gaiden and DMC4. 
 I have never played a Ninja Gaiden or DMC game before so I was uncertain on which game to buy. 
 I guess the deciding factor for me was to play the demos of each game and I liked how the sword 
 attacks are only the y button on DMC4 and it was two buttons on Ninja Gaiden (I cant remember which 
 two) . I also liked the setting of DMC more, with the demons and such.
  Gameplay 9/10
  I thought the gameplay was excellent because when you would get to a group of enemies the battles 
 would get ridiculous (in a good way) and you would be all over the screen attacking all of your 
 foes. 
  Story 8/10
  I wasnt expecting to get into the story to much when I first started to play but it grew on me 
 and now I am considering on picking up DMC3.
  Music 9.5/10
  I really liked the music in this game, mostly because I like metal and techno music and I havent 
 really heard to much of that mixed which was interesting. My favorite song has to be the one when 
 you first boot up your game and let it sit and it plays a little mini movie. The only problem with 
 the music is that they could have made more tracks.
  Graphics 9/10
  The graphics i thought were very well done expecally during the cut-scenes. After i beat a game 
 I usually do not watch the cut-scenes again but i find myself watching these ones over and over 
 because they a interesting and look outstanding. 
  9/10
  The replay value of this game depends on the user because after you beat the game on normal (dont 
 remember what they call it in the game, its the second one that is open when you first get the 
 game) a harder difficulty and the Bloody Palace is unlocked. The Bloody Palace is just a open fighting 
 arena and you try to beat all 100 levels of it in one sitting, it can get extremely hard. After 
 beating the game on the difficulty you just unlocked the hardest difficulty is unlocked. And whenever 
 you beat a difficulty for the first time some bonus art and such is unlocked, so there is quite 
 of bit of work to be done.
  
  In conclusion this is a great game for any "hack and slash" type of gamer and anyone with an interest 
 in these types of games.

Review:  This game is a sequel to its predecessor video game wise, but chronologically speaking, it takes 
 place after Devil May Cry, and before Devil May Cry 2. Devil May Cry 4 seems to be a rather average 
 installment in the series. While it isn't a bad game at all, its overall rating is higher than 
 that of Devil May Cry 2, but lower than Devil May Cry 3.
  
  With that said, the game is fairly unique. Firstly, the main protagonist this time isn't Dante, 
 it's a man named Nero. He is a member of the Order of the Sword, a clan of warriors who worship 
 Sparda. At first glance, this "Nero" character resembles Dante and his twin brother Vergil due 
 to his white hair. After further examination it can be said that in the face, they look nothing 
 alike. Dante is playable in the game; he's playable in the second half of the game, after Nero's 
 quest is completed.
  
  The game's wrapped around a central love story, and an undeveloped one at that. There seems to 
 be no character development, all you know from the beginning, is that you know a woman named Kyrie. 
 So throughout the game, (not actually aware of why or how you met this woman) , your main goal will 
 be to save her. You will then find out how inferior Nero is to Dante personality wise as well.
 
  
  There will be random encounters and skirmishes between you and Dante throughout the game, at first 
 Dante can be seen as an antagonist, but later in the game it's revealed that he's not really that, 
 he's just a person on the side who doesn't really play a major role in the story. He's just, Dante, 
 still messing around with his shop, Trish, and Lady. 
  
  With Dante, you will replay all of the stages and bosses that Nero played. So there's more backtracking 
 than desired. The thing about Nero is, his distinctive power called "Devil Bringer" which is a 
 wraith type entity that is engraved within his right arm. His right arm plays a large role in attacking 
 because it can grasp enemies, and can also perform many mind blowing attacks. More importantly, 
 it's required to navigate in stages and to progress in the storyline. He also contains a temporary 
 power up called "Agro", which can be charged within his sword to perform a more devastatingly damage 
 giving slash. He has one gun and does not gain any other guns. 
  
  I mean, the controls are mapped well; I didn't get any hand cramps from playing on the XBOX 360 
 controller. It's basically the same as Devil May Cry 3. 
  
  As far as customization and leveling up goes, not much has changed. Although, this time around, 
 you don't use Red Orbs to gain new attacks, you have a separate currency that is gained from how 
 well you fight and complete stages. Considering that this new currency is more difficult to obtain, 
 gaining new moves takes longer than it does to buy new items. There are still the same items, and 
 the secret missions make a return, giving you a blue orb fragment after each successful attempt. 
 
  
  All of the secret missions require both Dante and Nero, because the missions are sometimes mapped 
 for only one character. Once completed, you cannot complete it again for another orb, once you've 
 gained the orb that's it. Other than that, Dante has new weapons, I won't spoil you there. He retains 
 all of his well renowned attacks from previous installments. It must be noted that Dante is much 
 faster than Nero too.
  
  When I said that there's much backtracking, that also means that you will have to fight the same 
 bosses twice. The boss battles are engaging and invigorating at first encounter, but once you fight 
 them the second time, their attacks can be easily predicted, and no joy would be retained from 
 defeating them. However, fighting them the second time around also throws off your strategy because 
 Dante plays differently from Nero of course.
  
  Dante's new weapons are gained from defeating the bosses that Nero already fought. I can't find 
 much more to say about the game. Once you get the hang of the gameplay it becomes enjoyable but 
 a tad bit too easy. Fortunately there is a "Hard" mode that can be unlocked upon completing the 
 game on Normal. The only XBOX LIVE or PSN involvement the game has is just uploading your score 
 on the leaderboards.
  
  The puzzles aren't very arduous this time around. Yes, there is still that old dark and ambient 
 music that plays in the background throughout dungeons. The cut scenes use the in-game graphics. 
 I don't think that I saw one FMV. The graphics aren't really impressive, but simultaneously they 
 aren't bad either. They're sufficient at best, but the shadowing effect in the sunlight looks really 
 terrible, I should say. 
  
  The game seems incomplete due to how much backtracking is done. It feels that there should have 
 been ten other different dungeons to fill in how many Dante plays through. Nero earlier in the 
 game unlocks doors and whatnot that Dante easily skips through later down the road. With that mentioned, 
 Dante's playthough is much easier than Nero's. It's because as Nero, you do everything, and that 
 leaves little for Dante to do, outside of his combat. 
  
  Well, I guess about wraps up this review. I didn't really have much to say about this one, it's 
 a Devil May Cry game, and its formula is beginning to grow a bit old. Back then, it was highly 
 acclaimed for defining the Hack and Slash genre, but here in 2008- Present, more and more games 
 are beginning to cross the threshold. They are also surpassing Devil May Cry games action wise. 
 Currently, this game can be found cheap. So, don't be afraid to give this one a go. A very fun 
 game, but doesn't leave much replayability.

Review:  As all Devil may Cry fans would remeber the last game in this series was good, but annoyingly difficult. 
 Well fear no more, Devil may Cry 4 is no where near as difficult. Don't get me wrong it's not exacly 
 easy, but you won't just be able to sprint through it.
  
  If your not familiar with the Devil may Cry games don't worry this game was made more for you than 
 original Devil May Cry gamers (Don't worry orginal players it's still a bit for you) . Because in 
 this next installment of the Devil May Cry series you will play as a new character, Nero. Nero 
 is a great character that everyone will love and he has his own bunch of moves and weapons. Including 
 a new weapon, his demon arm (I can't remeber what it's called lol) and you will have a lot of fun 
 bringing demons to your face then smashing them into the ground.
  
  For the middle of the game you play as the orginally demon slayer Dante, and though it's good to 
 have all your old weapons back you will miss the neros arm. Which makes combat much easier.
  
  Devil May cry doesn't have a great story line and just brings up alot of questions but that 
 is good telling us there is going to be a sequel. This is a must have for all the devil may cry 
 collecters and all enw gamers should give it a try if you love action games.
  
  THE GOOD
  - Looks beautiful - Swift and flowing gameplay - Fun new character - But Still has that great DMC 
 feel -
  
  THE BAD
  - Not much detail in the story line - Repetive levels -

Review:  This is a run-of-the-mill hank n' slash video game. I had never played the Devil May Cry (DMC) 
 series until this game. In some respects, I am glad I hadn't since beating this game was enough 
 of a pain.
  
  I guess I can start out with the positives: the game has good graphics and a decent soundtrack, 
 but that is about it.
  
  Now for the bad:
  
  This game reminds me of the 2-D hack n' slash arcade games of the 90's that I played as a kid, 
 except this one is in 3-D. The game play consists of stringing together combos to achieve stylish 
 points. You get graded at the end of each mission by how stylish your combat was (i. e., how many 
 combos you string together on enemies) , how quickly you finished the mission and how many red orbs 
 you found. 
  
  There are 20 missions in all and each is pretty short. For the first half, you play as Nero (and 
 you also play as Nero for a little bit at the end) , a character that has a "devil bringer" arm 
 that has the the cool feature of being able to grab enemies from far away and smash them around. 
 For the other half, you play as Dante, who has a wide assortment of guns and fighting styles. 
 
  
  The problem with this is that you have to play the levels that you beat with Nero again with Dante. 
 This includes the bosses! Man this got annoying quick (Not to mention you will end up fighting 
 the same bosses 3 to 4 times throughout the course of the game) . The fighting also gets annoying 
 quick since button mashing is not my idea of fun combat. 
  
  The camera can get annoying since the camera will cut away and show a "red web" on the exits whenever 
 enemies pop up. The camera also is annoying since you sometimes can not control it and it makes 
 you view your combat from an akward angle. 
  
  The story is weak and those who are new to the DMC series will find it a bit confusing at first. 
 Overall, I never really could get into the story and often just skipped the many cutscenes that 
 pop up during the missions (and there are plenty of cutscenes) . 
  
  Overall, I was generous to even give this game a 5. After I finished the game, I sent it back to 
 gamefly (glad this was a rental and not a purchase!) .
  
  The people who will like this game are people who enjoy hack n' slash video games or DMC fanboys. 
 That is it.

Review:  I've always been a hardcore fan of DMC. The combos, guns, just everything is great about this game. 
 
  
  You play as Nero with the devil bringer which brings more awesomeness to the series. And then you 
 use Dante with the in-game equipment changing. Nero's arm allows you to snatch an enemy from far 
 away and bring them closer to you. It's pretty sweet. I will miss it if they don't have it in the 
 next game. Dante can now change his style and weapons inside the game. This makes for more stylish 
 and complex combos. 
  
  The graphics are perfect. In the cutscenes you can zoom in using the right trigger, so you can 
 take an even closer look at the solid graphics. The action directing inside the cutscenes are well 
 done. I was mesmerized when I first saw it. 
  
  The story on the other hand is just as bad as the second one. It has no real point. This is just 
 Dante filling out a job. In the first game we get know Dante and in the third one we find out a 
 lot about Dante and his family. But for this one, I guess were just getting to know Nero's character. 
 We never find out about Nero's arm and we never really figure anything out about him at all. Just 
 that he likes Kyrie and he's got a weird arm. I wish they would've talked about where it was from 
 or something. We're also left wondering how did he get to the places he got to... I mean really... 
 come on now... everything was just a coincidence... 
  
  The story is probably my only problem. If the story would've been more complete rather than have 
 a bunch of holes and questions, it would've got a ten.
  
  -Main thoughts-
  -The combos, guns, just everything is great about this game. 
  -more stylish and complex combos.
 
  -The graphics are perfect.
  -I was mesmerized
  -If the story would've been more complete rather than have a bunch of holes and questions, it would've 
 got a ten.
  -We never find out about Nero's arm and we never really figure anything out about him at all.

Review:  I can give credit where its due and this one sure does have a lot of good things going for it. 
 The combat is fun, the graphics are nice looking with good-looking environments. The story is one 
 of the best of the series. The enemies look creepy and bring some real appeal to the look the game 
 seems to be going for. But it does have its flaws. For one, the puzzles seem to be on the easier 
 side and anybody should be able to breeze through them with little effort. But that is not the 
 worst of it. The real problem is the main character Nero. I find him to be so annoying that I have 
 to mute the tv when he talks. He can taunt during action too. I can't tell you if that is an effective 
 feature since I just don't want to hear him say anything. Whatever happened to the silent types. 
 The music is pretty bland as well. Its no God of War, but it certainly is a entertaining ride, 
 for as long as it lasts anyways. All things considered, it is still a very good action game.

Review:  It all started with dmc on ps2 , the very first stylish action game made where u play as a devil 
 hunter (dante) the son of sparda the demon who turned against his kind to save humanity.. YEAH 
 LOOKS EPIC.. ,, the gameplay and the camera angle was amazing.. jst holding on a button u could 
 fire ur duel pistols (ebony &ivory) almost like a submachine gun.. what made the game more stylish 
 was u jump in the air and come down slowly firing ur guns.
  
  dante uses his alistor sword which almost like a huge one like cloud carries in final fantasy .. 
 and uses it like a katana .. fast and hard. the game became a phenomena and lots of game creators 
 tried to copy the style of gamplay.. but nothing comes close to dmc.
  
  time passed dmc2 came out was good like the first one but had controller layout problems.. but 
 still was a rocker. then came the ultimate dmc3 the game that no one can forget those hard combos 
 ,fighting all the booses in one stage and dante facing his fate in the finale with his brother 
 vergil.. ,the game was one of the toughest game on ps2..
  
  now its the return of dmc4 from the creators of dmc.. same kinda of gameplay but new characters 
 are intoduced.. NERO a young boy who has the power of demon in the form of a demon hand that can 
 almost do anything.. can slam huge monsters in one go.. well if u play on easy ..
  
  the best part of dmc4 is u play with nero as well as dante first half with the young kid then rest 
 with dante who's matured and is more powerful than ever.
  as the previous dmc there is no horde of demons behind u ,you fight specially designed demon lizards 
 , demon scarecrow, and royal demons , the boss fight are amazing. Berial one of the very first 
 boss u face fights like bull and ur in a arena trying to evade him ... thats cool on hard mode.
 
  
  the graphics are amazing the jungle and the city looks awesome, there is somthing for all the dmc 
 fans in this one, while playing with dante u can switch between styles with jst a click of the 
 controller which means u knw more combos. The fight between dante and nero is epic ,they fight 
 twice in the game and its tough , game is a killer and for those who already purchased it keep 
 making chains of combos coz there an arcade mini game also where u confront every demons one by 
 one and in hordes .
  dont loose ur patience on playing on dante must die mode coz
  DEVIL'S NEVER CRY

Review:  This is just one of those games that gamers like me love. It has a great single player campaign 
 and cool extras where the bloody palace gets a huge improvement over the one in Devil May Cry 3. 
 
  The single player campaign is twenty missions long. I think that this is the perfect length that 
 a game of this style should be. One awesome aspect is that the tutorial boss is Dante! For long 
 time DMC players, this is a totally epic fight because we have all played as Dante and he is just 
 God himself. It was relieving to find out that we got to play at least seven missions as Dante 
 and revisit all of the bosses that got away and finish them off for good. I'm talking about the 
 bosses like Bariel, and Echidna.
  The new difficulty in the fourth game of the series is called hell and hell mode. Not to be confused 
 with its predecessor heaven or hell where everyone, even bosses, crumble at the might of your pistols. 
 But, hell and hell is different, you still perish and the slightest nick of an enemy's attack. 
 The catch is that the enemies still have their regular HP!
  I know my review was probably lacking something but this is my first one so don't be hate'n.

Review:  If i were to give you a top 10 list of game series that I'd suggest you must play before you die 
 Devil may cry will be up there with the likes of halo, fable and some other stuff that i cant be 
 bothered to mention at the moment.
  
  I was introduced to the DMC series with DMC3 on the ps2. All thanks to my mate who bought it as 
 a birthday present for me i was hooked from the very start. I then soon played DMC1 but have not 
 yet to this day touched DMC 2 but thats neither here or there at the moment. I was hooked to the 
 hack and slash combo fighting and the awesome story line it is everything a series needs to have 
 in my opinion.
  
  So what does the 4th installment bring to the table? First off you have got to admire the graphics. 
 This was one of my first 360 games and i was blown away with the use of colour and character models. 
 The opening cut scene gave me chills due to the fact that Dante came crashing down and shat and 
 old guy in the face. It was truly one of those moments that makes you jump out of your seat and 
 go WOOO!
  
  So when the game started i was fighting Dante with the new guy with the devil bringer (his daemon 
 arm) Nero. Was good way to get the tutorial out of the way and soon enough Dante was beaten. While 
 going through the game with Nero His game mechanics were good sword fighting was up to scratch, 
 his gun style was pretty much one gun Dante which i liked. But his devil bringer arm i thought 
 was a bit broken. you could pretty much go through his part of the game just by using it and to 
 be honest that was a bit boring, that and he shouted a lot of things like slam dunk while using 
 it that got as little on my nerves. But the levels were good and the bosses were nice and challenging.
 
  
  Now when it came to playing as Dante i couldn't help smiling he's back with a vengeance his combos 
 are cool and style changes while on the fly was an awesome idea. But (yes there is a but) Dante 
 needs more weapons. DMMC3 he was swimming in them DMC1 he had a good selection too. DMC4 they are 
 lacking in my opinion. Another thing about Dante is his levels were basically 90% of the levels 
 i had already played with Nero. Same bosses and stuff which felt a little repetitive but i saw 
 past that and enjoyed the game.
  
  Now i mensioned plot holes. DMC fans gather round people new to DMC go off an enjoy the game for 
 what it is. There are a lot of un-answered questions when you reach the end of the story and for 
 me it is both good and bad. Good because its means there is a DMC5 possibly. Bad because, well 
 they didn't answer the questions. Not going to give to much away here but you have been warned.
 
  
  All in all dmc4 is a good game that stays loyal to the series with a few minor hiccups. New comers 
 will like it as will some veterans to the series. Just don't expect a masterpiece like DMC3 is

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 (DMC 4) is everything that you expect it to be, and nothing that would surprise 
 anyone even slightly familiar with the series. However, if you have enjoyed past games in the series 
 (especially DMC 1 and DMC 3) , then you will certainly have a blast with this one. The refinement 
 of the series' stylish and lightning-fast gameplay, along with a new character to start the game 
 out with, lead to an experience that any fan of fast and frantic action should not miss out on.
 
  
  HIGH POINTS: Most notably, the fast-paced action. This game makes you feel like you can tear apart 
 an army in moments, and once you really get acquainted with the controls, you can string together 
 some flashy moves and really get a charge. I mean, after all, that's why you play DMC, right? To 
 feel like a bad ass? Well, you will definitely get that sensation with this latest installment, 
 no matter which character you use. Second, the graphics and music are really well done. The graphics 
 are awesome and certainly on par with games being released today. The music is also standard DMC 
 fare (metal guitars, growling vocals) but it fits the game well, and has been a staple of the series 
 as well (notice a trend here?) . Finally, the lasting appeal of this game is the best of the series 
 as well. With tough achievements requiring MAJOR feats of gaming skill (or extreme endurance) , 
 its a good beat that you will not be getting the 1000 gamerscore on this game easily. In addition, 
 the 3 different difficulty modes and the unlockable tower endurance mode will give gamers something 
 to come back to after completing the game. 
  
  LOW POINTS: This is nothing new. If you are not a fan of the earlier DMC's, chances are this game 
 is not going to change your mind. This game is fan service through and through. Next, the story, 
 though by far the best in the series, is pretty weak. It requires a knowledge of the past games 
 in the series in order to get much at all out of, but if the story is what you are going for, you 
 are playing this game for the wrong reason. After all, you don't watch porno for the novel script, 
 right? You know why you are getting this game, and its not for a story that is anything more than 
 popcorn affair. Don't worry, its nothing stupid or ridiculous, its just not something that will 
 shake you to the core either. Finally, the new character addition to the series is almost BETTER 
 than Dante (yeah, I said it!) . This argument is augmented by the fact that Dante only receives 
 one or two new moves since DMC 3, and this is very disappointing. Dante is one of the top protagonists 
 in video games, and to fail to add to his feature set (even with the introduction of a new character) 
 was a mistake.
  
  THE SCOOP: If you like DMC, you will like this. If not, you will probably not be converted by this 
 game. It's that simple. Now, you know the drill. Played the earlier games? Get this game! You will 
 like it. Never played DMC before? Rent it first.

Review:  Devil May Cry is a hugely popular game. This fame comes from all the other Devil May Cry games in 
 the series. This game, even many months after it's release at the beginning of 2008, is still played 
 by gamers who aren't necessarily fans of the series. That means that the game has to be pretty good 
 to appeal to so many.
  All of my friends recommended me this game, and told me it's a must play. I followed the advice and 
 got the game, for both the PS3 and Xbox360 (rented) .
  The game is set in the DMC universe. It still feels like a DMC game. Having played DMC3 before, I 
 can't stop but compare the two. Devil May Cry 3 on the PS2 was great. Even though I didn't like the 
 theme or the story of the game, the gameplay was the one keeping me going. DMC3 had a very addictive 
 gameplay. I wanted to get the same thing from this game as well. I did get it, partially. Everything 
 about DMC3 was new, but DMC4 has nothing new or surprising. I wanted more from it. Of course visually 
 the game looks very good and the animations and sound effects are well done. I can't see any visual 
 problems in this game. The game looks great, the camera is good and all the other aspects of the 
 game just fit together into this great package. The game is good, no doubt about it, but for those 
 who played other DMC games before, it's just a little old, they won't see anything new besides the 
 pretty graphics. The gameplay is solid but nothing new. The boss battles are great and are a little 
 better than before. But that's all there is to it.
  As a whole, Devil May Cry 4 is a good game for the fans of the series. They will certainly like this 
 game a lot. I know I did, but it's very unlikely to become a fan of the series if this is your first 
 game in the series.
  The game is good and is worthy of it's name, but the lack of new things over it's predecessors or 
 rivals stop it from achieving greatness.
  
  Good: -good visuals 
  -follows the DMC tradition
  -good cinematics
  Bad: -nothing new
  -not multiplayer 
  My 
 Score: 8.1

Review:  we all played devil may cry 1,2,3 and 4, the fourth devil may cry is amazing so perfect. lets start 
 from the story: im sure if any one did not play this game he will engoy the game so go go destroy 
 your enemies lets Dante rock... and let nero save cryl, you will find the story is dramatic , romantic 
 sometimes and the important is fantasy action i liked the story very much
  The Graphic is terrific, the light, the shadows, the sound is good , but the music is not goog enough
 
  The control: is excellent, The moves, artifical intelligence is great 
  but the failings i think are :
  1. the extra hard level is not good because there is no chances, you 
 must buy evry thing even the chances
  2. if you killed you must start from the begining of the round
  3. the other characters is not 
 available"i mean the girls in the game i forgot their names" even when you complet the game with 
 normal or hard level
  4. there is no cheats those make you can play with super nero or super dante act
  i hope these 
 failings are repairing in devil may cry 5
  any way the all stuff are terrific and matching together are creat givet called DEVIL MAY CRY 4

Review:  Devil May Cry fans know what they expect from the action series: they look for fast paced action 
 sequences that require solid timing instead of button mashing. They expect large scale battles 
 with insane bosses and hordes of monsters that barely give the player a second to breath. They 
 also expect characters to take the dangerous settings lightly, with a large dose of sarcasm and 
 a snarky outlook towards the supernatural surroundings they find themselves in. Well, DMC fans, 
 take heart: Devil May Cry 4, the latest chapter in the series and the first true sequel in the 
 Devil May Cry chronology maintains all of these trademarks while showcasing the power of the 360 
 fairly well.
  
  That is, for the most part.
  
  See, Dante fans may find themselves a bit disappointed in their favorite character's new role within 
 the series: instead of taking over the spotlight as he has in the previous three games, the anti-hero 
 takes on a secondary position to franchise newcomer Nero. DMC4 is really more of his story and 
 his coming of age within the Sparda-influenced universe than a tale that picks up after the events 
 of DMC1. Is this a bad turn of events? No, not really, although some of the hardcore might wonder 
 if the game could've had a different title with a Dante cameo instead of a Devil May Cry chapter.
 
  
  
  The story of Devil May Cry 4 is set in and around the coastal town of Fortuna, which has an interesting 
 tale by itself: it's governed by a militant theocracy known as The Order of the Sword, and protected 
 by a group of Holy Knights. The people of the town worship the demon knight Sparda as a god and 
 savior. During a ceremony in honor of their deity, Nero, a young knight, sees Dante crash through 
 a window and slaughter the leader of the Order, as well as many of his friends. While he doesn't 
 know who Dante is or why he's attacking them, Nero wants revenge for Dante's actions. What follows 
 over the course of 20 missions is a quest of revenge and betrayal, as well as salvation and sacrifice, 
 as Nero hunts Dante down across the land.
  
  Apathetic and dismissive of authority, Nero is a younger, more angst-filled character than Dante's 
 older, wiser and more sarcastic outlook on the world. However, he's just as skilled as the Son 
 of Sparda, with a wide range of abilities to support him in combat. The first, and perhaps most 
 obvious element, is the Devil Bringer, his demonically-enhanced right arm that allows him to project 
 an energy arm ahead of him. This allows Nero to grasp distant objects, which he'll use to reach 
 new areas or scale heights, as well as grab, throw and punch opponents. While this can be used 
 to start or extend obvious combos, perhaps one of the most intriguing elements is that the arm 
 responds differently when used against each opponent in the game. For example, players will grip 
 and throw some creatures by their tails, while others may be pulled apart or even used as weapons 
 against their allies. This can be factored into players' plans when using Nero's primary attacks 
 in battle.
  
  Showdown at the Fortuna Corral.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is, simply put, a great game. It takes all the things that were great about the 
 old game, tosses in some incredible new additions, and delivers beautiful environements and cutscenes 
 that you will love to play.
  
  From the start of the game, you will see a pleasantly over the top fight scene that is more brutal 
 than flashy, as oppose to previous scenes in previous games. The best part is most things witnessed 
 in cutscenes are possible in game.
  
  Thus, it is time to review gameplay. Getting used to Nero may take a while for old fans and new 
 players alike, but the more you play with him, the more you start finding new and better strategies 
 for everything. Though he has niether the diversity nor speed of Dante, his agressive gameplay 
 is deliciously brutal. As Dante, you may start to feel significantly weaker, because though he 
 is faster, it is harder to attack enemies. Let me explain... with Nero, you can pull enemies to 
 you. While Dante, you have to get to enemies. Unfortunately, just running up to enemies leaves 
 you open, and closing the distance with a stinger makes them go flying, making it a challenge just 
 to begin a combo on an enemy. Also, having three swords and guns on both sides of the spectrum 
 may sound good in theory, but it creates too much for the player to concentrate on, and you may 
 find yourself confused as to which weapon your on. Also, the ability to change styles on the go 
 is a welcome addition, and the changes made are great and balance out the styles better than ever. 
 However, the dulling down of Trickster makes it almost pointless, and you will frequently find 
 yourself relying on two or three styles and ignoring the rest. Despite this rant, it is still just 
 as fun as it should be to play as Dante.
  
  Graphically, the game is gorgeous. Character models are incredible, and environements are beautiful. 
 Though many environements do repeat, the concentration on action and gameplay may very well make 
 you forget you had been there before, or you may just ignore.
  
  Sound wise, the game does a great job of not making vocalizations and sounfe ffects during battle 
 obnoxious. Also, the voice acting, particularly that of Nero, is incredible. Nero's voice acting 
 is incredible, and if you are afraid of him being a dislikeable character, have no fear, because 
 his character has something for everyone. The music is nowhere near the spectacle it was in DMC 
 3, but it is still enough to satisfy the average player.
  
  These combined alements make for a delightful game which has the great possibility of effecting 
 you emotionally, whether it be through the insane action, the incredible voice acting, or the stunning 
 visuals.
  
  If you are a hardcore action fan, you will no doubt enjoy this game. It is a guarantee. (Just don't 
 sue me)

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 starts out awkwardly to say the least. You are confronted with a young man named 
 Nero. He looks just like Dante, has an ego just like Dante, and he seems to have a little girlfriend 
 too. Nero is Dante in more than one way, he is part demon, he has gray hair, he is super strong, 
 and he comes off as a complete jerk. However, I like Nero, his moves are more aerial than anything 
 we've seen so far in this series, even more than Dante. His storyline is very solid and engaging, 
 just as his new moves are. 
  
  However just as we are feeling comfortable with Nero, we lose him. He is inserted into some sort 
 of god-like machine that haunts the city, causing ultimate destruction in its path. We then turn 
 to Dante who must again save the world. Although all we do is back-track what we've done with Nero. 
 We face the same bosses, the same environments, the same buildings, the same enemies, nothing changes.
 
  
  Devil May Cry 4 is solid. It's a very fun play through, however it never really takes off into 
 the "greatness" territory like the first two games in the series did. At least it's an improvement 
 over Devil May Cry 3. Hopefully, we will see a much improved Devil May Cry 5, all the potential 
 is certainly there.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is awesome, it looks amazing and it plays the same way like all the DMC series 
 so if you ever played DMC 1-3 you will love DMC4 the cutscenes look awesome the voice acting is 
 pretty good and the Gameplay is fun of course at some point you feel like omg i've been doing this 
 move for hours and hours but after you earn some cash and buy some new attack moves it will feel 
 like your god throwing up the enemy and hack them into pieces before they land on the ground i 
 have to give this game a (8.5) because there are a couple things i didn't like and one of them 
 where the Enemy's either at some point's they where retarded or way to smart to kill but either 
 way it was a pain in the ass. Graphicly the game looks awesome and the sound effect's where SWEET! 
 the biggest let down for me was that the Character Virgil (Dantes twin brother) wasn't in DMC4 
 i know he died way before DMC4, but i was kinda hoping for a come back idk or maybe Dantes, Virgils 
 father but either way Devil May Cry 4 is one of those games you have to have if you love Hack and 
 Slash games.

Review:  Well like i always do when i review games I start off by telling you guys what I think was well 
 done.
  
  To start off, the graphics are decent for a capcom game. Many times they don't focus on this flashy 
 feature that really entertains many people. The animation are well done and it is far as I know 
 is a glitch free game. The story line is not to intensive and kinda feels like they just made it 
 up as they went along, but honestly... who plays Devil May Cry for the story right? While playing 
 the game the only real problem that i came across is the same problem that i have found with all 
 the other games in the series.... Its very very repetitive. Its the same darn thing you have to 
 do over and over... grated its fun, but its looses its grip on you when you beat it... One of those 
 games that you will play once through and return it to your local game store.
  
  It is worth getting, but I would look for it used somewhere or pick it up off EBay. Even better, 
 if you subscribe to a place like game fly, just rent it... play it... beat it.. send it back.

Review:  Well, being my first Devil May Cry 4 game, I have played, this gives me a lasting impreshion to 
 play them all. I love this game. Everything about it is awesome, the graphics are awesome, bringing 
 Dante back was an awesome choice, and Nero is an awesome new addition! The game system is awesome, 
 but could give new comers hand cramps very easily. The charatcers are awesome, some minor flaws, 
 like for me some things were a tiny bit difficult, having for me to gt a game guide for it, butr 
 other then that, its an awesome addition to the Devil may Cry family, and I hope CAPCOM dishes 
 out a new one, cause I want to see alot of stuff that CAPCOm didn't include, like how did Nero 
 get his demonic arm, and why they were after him. I want some story issues cleared up, and more 
 action with Dante. I mean, he has had his own games, but I want him actually working together with 
 Nero. Not litterly fighting against him half of the time. Awesome game though, and new-comers and 
 regulers should pick this game up.

Review:  Its personally a great game, but I really think that the difficulty if hard and the puzzles take 
 away from the fun... The game is a good game, and the combat is excellent.... but I personally 
 think the game itself is a game that has good boss battles, a decent combat system, and horrible 
 puzzles, the game is in itself a button masher... and the save system is ok... I just wish it had 
 online play or a co-op or something other than the same old same old story.... Capcom has done 
 a wonderful thing with the graphics and personally its a great rent or if you are into this series 
 its a great buy,,, , , ,, Also the game has a good feel to it and if you like this style of game 
 or button mashers then it is good for you and fun so if you are also into anime stuff then look 
 at this game and its fun for all of you all

Review:  Good: 
  dmc came in the 3rd gen consoles wonderfully. graphics are done nicely, plus it looks promising 
 with their so-called newcomer, nero. nero is actually pretty fun to play. it's demon arm is what 
 makes him so special and powerfull as well. what i like the most is the boss fights, they're really 
 fun to play especially when nero get a hold of the demons and perform a badass finishing move.
 
  
  Bad: 
  the game is kinda short, can be done definitely less than 10 hours , and as you know nero cover 
 about 2/3 of the whole game, so dante's part isnt much fun cos u just backtracking the areas that 
 nero had passed
  
  Overall: 
  i dont get it when people keep bragging bout nero. they dont want nero to be the spotlight, they 
 want more dante instead. true, dante doesnt make enough appearance in the game, but he still a 
 one hell of a demon which is really cool. all and all overall i think dmc 4 is a success, but like 
 i said it could be better.

Review:  The story was mainly focused on Nero and Kyrie but it also took the living of adding some sides 
 of Dante's past stories and adventures. One thing that the Devil May Cry games are missing is the 
 side of Sparda. Sure they add little details in each game which folds into this big story but most 
 DMC fans don't really know who Sparda really was. Hopefully, the next DMC game will add some more 
 details onto his side of the story than Dante's.
  
  The sound and voice acting is much much much much better than the previous DMC games. In the other 
 DMC games, sound has mostly always has been a problem when it comes to the action. It usually comes 
 out in a blurry shank of irony. Now in DMC4, the sound has improved much better than the last DMC 
 games. 
  
  This game deserves some sort of award for it's graphics cause these are the best; you'll ever lay 
 eyes on. Most games out for the Xbox 360 that have good graphics have dark environments meaning 
 everything is all dark and there's absolutely no color into it (example: Gears of War, Too Human, 
 and COD4) . DMC4 has some outstanding color and rhyme into it's intellectual design. Not to mention 
 the shadowing and detail it goes into. Characters are all well detailed and Dante simply looks 
 great.

Review:  this game is great, even though it has some huge flaws.
  the game is about a guy named nero, and all he does is destroy people with his devilbringer. Thats 
 the best part of the game right there. you will have to pray on the powers of that for the first 
 11 chapters. It is very fun for the first time you play it with nero, the levels, until you get 
 to play with dante. You love him, but you also hate him at the same time for taking your devilbringer 
 away from you. You feel naked without it, though Dante is still good and he destroys too.
  The major flaw in this game is the repetitiveness.
  Why do they make you play through the same 
 bosses and the exact same enviroments. But the storyline is good and the moves and weapons is cool. 
 And all the girls have huge boobies that want to give you boners. And dante and neros weapons and 
 special moves combos are the coolest.

Review:  DMC4, is it good? Well, if you liked any of the previous games, you'll probably fall in love all 
 over again with this installment. It has all the classic DMC elements, tons of combos to master, 
 awesome cut-scenes and of course huge bosses. That's all good and well, but there's a new kid in 
 town called Nero. And he's the one you'll control through the majority of the game. You start the 
 game as Nero and finish the game as Nero. He's okay, but he's nowhere near as cool as Dante. And 
 it's him we want to play as right? But Nero has one thing that comes in "handy" (yeah, it's not 
 funny) , a demon hand that's very useful. With it you can perfom deadly punches, throws and grabs. 
 You can also use it to drag enemies closer to you, or vice versa.
  
  The best thing about DMC4 are the bosses who are awesome and memorable. There are not as many as 
 in DMC3for example. And you have to fight them 3 times before you cmplete the game. Yes, you have 
 to face all of them in a row before the last boss. But hey, it wouldn't be a Capcom game without 
 stuff like that.
  
  One of the main complaints of DMC3, was that it was way to difficult. A criticism I don't get, 
 I think most gamers can beat the game at the easiest mode without much sweat. Anyway, if you are 
 one of those who didn't like DMC3 for it's difficulty, then I can assure you that DMC4 is easier. 
 But no pushover.
  
  Two things keep this game from being on the same level as the fantastic DMC3. There's way too much 
 backtracking near the end. The second is that Dante isn't the main character. Again, Nero isn't 
 so bad, but Dante is way more cooler than him. Also, the dialogue is pretty bad. It's not good 
 and not quite cheesy enough to be awesome.
  
  If you liked the previous games in the DMC series, you'll like this one as well. Personally, I 
 think DMC3 still is the undisputed king in the series.

Review:  Gameplay 10/10 : you play as a guy called nero in the first half of the game , this guy has a super 
 arm which is very very fun to use specially on boss fights , and he is easier to control than dante 
 , and the most cool thing about this arm that you can grab the enemies from far to your sword with 
 it , sound cool huh? , well if you are an old DMC veteran you will notice a lot of stuff is here 
 such as the style modes with Dante as you can change on the fly in this game , and the powerups 
 is here too but are bit diffeirent to get , you need to gather proud souls to buy abilites and 
 such and you red orbs to buy items , proud souls can be gathered by bieng "Stylish" in a level 
 and doing varied combos instead of just button mashing , the game has some surprises too that i 
 wont spoil it here.
  
  Graphics 9/10: great graphics and i think they are they are almost flawless , you can not see any 
 jaggies and the framerate is so smooth and some times the game looks so real for its own good.
 
  
  Sound 8/10: its some goth metal there and there , but it really works well with the game theme 
 , some times makes feel excited and it never bores you.
  
  Value 9/10: not lots of stuff to do but its always fun to back to the levels and get an S ranking 
 , and the so very hard devilsh modes sure to keep intrested , and with the achievements on xbox360 
 , sure this one will hook on your console for a long time.
  
  Overall 9.5/10 : if you are a DMC fan then go out and buy this game right now , if you are not 
 then i suggest that you rent it first because you may not like how hard the game is or how it plays.

Review:  well, I thought this game was really fun. to star off, the visuals and design were pretty good. 
 and the voice acting was pretty cool. Dante and Nero are serious badasses! and the levels are great, 
 too. an great environment to jump around in. and with that, the character acrobatics are pretty 
 awesome! you can jump off walls and do some pretty crazy thing. now the great thing, COMBOS! there's 
 way too many to list. you have the guns, swords, and the arm (can't remember the name) that Nero 
 has to bring utter chaos and destruction to your enemies! although I didn't play very much of it. 
 the story was pretty good. now for the serious flaw in the game! the cut scenes! I fought enemies 
 for one minute and then there's a FIVE minute cut scene! WTF?!?! this really turned me off of the 
 game. I borrowed it from a friend. I'm not even gonna finish playing it now. the cut scenes make 
 me feel like the game itself isn't very long. ALSO, they have ENTIRE fights IN a cut scene! why 
 not let US fight in it?!?! but either way, the game was pretty. I only recommend it to those who 
 have a lot of patience.

  Sound - Great, Great voice acting, Perfect

  Graphics - Great, Nice timing, Perfect

  Gameplay - Great, Lots of combos/techniques

  Story - Good story, Makes sense... but its not Dantes story...

  Great game idd recommend it to everyone who likes good stories in games, good thrill/action and 
 a satisfying ending.
  
  
  ~~~~~BAD~~~~~
  
  Its a good game... a great game... even though you get to play Dante in it, its Dantes game... 
 and I was stuck with Nero more then a 3rd the game, when it should have been the other way around. 
 Capcom, why didnt you start a new dmc series and bind them together if you love Nero so much? Why 
 did you taint DMC's glorious name with a total fake like Nero... yeah hes cool... but a total fake 
 we dont even know anything about him. Except hes a decedent of Sparta, probably threw Virgil's 
 Sword.
  
  Dante is the devils son, in the history text in the game it even states: some think he has even 
 surpassed his father. So tell me again how the hell I beat Dante with Nero on devil hunter with 
 100% health? First time, and 95%+ health the second... Oh right... cause he was going easy on me... 
 literally... so how did I just take down a boss in 3 hits that Dante couldn't take down?
  
  As far as Nero goes, hes a ghost... we know nothing about him, so hes a loser character as far 
 as im concerned. A mix between Dante and Virgil's personality, how convenient... cough..
  
  Its a good game, worth buying, worth beating, worth playing - to an extent... but Dantes the **** 
 and anyone whos anyone knows Nero isnt worth settling over
  
  PS. We want Dante back!

Review:  The story of DMC4 is a bit more darker in tone yet more unpredictable than previous DMC games. 
 The game begins when a newcomer to the DMC named Nero, who seems to be part of a religious order 
 known as the Order of the Sword. Rumor has it that the order is a society dedicated to Sparda, 
 who a thousands years ago, served as the Fuedual Lord to Sparda. Nero and his order are being praised 
 as Gods of the city, and become the legends of truth. It is not before long when terror inflicts 
 them, as they have been targeting the Devil Arms, like the ones Dante seems to have. This begins 
 to posses evil on Dante, as he assisantes His Holiness, but Nero questions why Dante, who is the 
 son of the Legendary Dark Knight would kill him. It's up to Nero to find Dante, and discover what 
 is going on with the Devil Arms. The story in Devil May Cry 4 has more a deeper depth in the truth 
 of Dante's life than any other in the series. The story in this game contains scenarios you won't 
 see coming, and we explore Dante and Nero on a deeper and more emotional level than we ever see 
 them before. The story in DMC 4 is fresh, dark and consistently engaging to slash and bash through.
 
  
  The visuals are amazing you won't complain. There's still the different weapons to choose from 
 aside from Nero's devilbringer which becomes a hands down favorite, and a major part of his combos. 
 But let's not forget about Dante he has all four styles from DMC3 and Pandora and Lucifer which 
 are really fun to use.
  
  The only thing is that at times the puzzles that you get are annoying and will leave you a bit 
 pissed off but then when you get the chance to beat down some demons you'll forget all about that 
 lol.
  
  Overall Devil May Cry 4 will leave you happy, a good addition to the series with a fresh new face 
 and how it ends will leaving wanting for Devil May Cry 5 to come out already.

Review:  The Good
  you have a new playable character Nero, you can use Nero's powerful devil arm any time you want, 
 mad combos you can perform
  The Bad
  in order to perform such mad combos you need to have a rly quick finger, not the best DMC though 
 it's not a crap game
  
  Storyline
  In DMC4 you play as Nero who is hunting Dante for he has killed the Order of The Swords leader 
 (a cult that worships Sparda as a god) . In the process of hunting Dante you are confronted by many 
 demons you must defeat and close off their demon gates (don't ask me who opened them) . 
  After you defeat all the 3 demons and shut off their demon gates you must confront many members 
 of the order the 1st who is the mad scientist who tells you that the order is planning on opening 
 a vast demon gate the very same Sparda closed off. After you confront and defeat him you confront 
 many other members of the order and witness the kidnap of Neros love Kyrie so you must save her. 
 in Neros attempt to save Kyrie he fails and was put into the heart of the Orders "Saviour" (a giant 
 magical living statue) . After Neros failure to save her he too was put into the Saviours heart 
 so thats the last level except for the very last level you use Nero.
  Now you're playing as Dante where you have to save Nero and in the process you have too close off 
 the same gates Nero closed again.
  After all that you confront the mad scientist and defeat him again who flees again in the cutscene.
 
  You witness a cutscene in which the mad scientist has the Yamato blade and uses it to open the 
 demon gate and the Saviour is unleashed too kill all demons which spawned from the gate and the 
 2nd to last boss fight starts where you have to kill the Saviour which takes forever.
  After you defeat the Saviour Nero is released from the Saviours heart where you start playing him 
 again and is inside the Saviour trying to find Kyrie. After you find her you find the Orders leader 
 guarding her and another boss fight occurs after you defeat him you hve 1 more quick level to complete 
 you have to simply defeat the Saviour rly quick with just 3 or 2 devil arm hits.
  
  Gameplay
  in DMC4 you can play as Nero who has no "combat styles" like Dante has but a powerful 
 demon arm too use whenever you like and just as lethal, similar sword combos as Dante has from 
 DMC3 and DMC4's Dante levels, Nero also has a gun that you can use whenever you like.
  Nero is almost just the same as Dante but can only use 1 weapon and can use a devil trigger that 
 will increase your attack power and all goes the same for Dante.

Review:  DMC is my favourite franchise... EVER. So to say that my expectations for this game were high would 
 be a huge understatement. This game did not dissapoint. The new character Nero turned out to be 
 all right (Gameplay wise i actually PREFER Nero) , and putting it on the X360 actually paid off.
 
  
  Graphics: The graphics in this game are absolutely amazing. It's just mindblowing. I can say without 
 a doubt that this is one of the best looking games to grace consoles ever. Like when i say HQ from 
 the cliff in the forest, i actually stopped and looked at it for 6 whole minutes, because it looked 
 that good. It kinda loses out because it's not as gothic as the other games though.
  
  Gameplay: Gameplay is just as good as ever. With the same formula that DMC fans all know and love, 
 and should be welcoming to newcomers of the series. The action is tight and has that easy to pick 
 up hard to master feel about it. Capcom has tweaked the fighting as well with Nero and his Devil 
 Bringer, new weapons and the ability to switch styles on the fly. So yeah, big thumbs up here.
 
  
  Soundtrack: The sound is, to me, a bit underwhelming. Compared to the music of the other games 
 it's not that great. It's got a bit more laid back feel, not as much rock and that's a bit of a 
 dissapointment.
  
  My only con with this is that sometimes it gets a bit repetitive.

Review:  Let's get this out of the way first: comparing Devil May Cry to Ninja Gaiden is like comparing 
 Burnout with Gran Turismo. They're two different styles, with Gaiden being 'kill stuff and survive,' 
 while DMC is more 'kill stuff and make it flashy.'
  
  The bad: the usual melodrama. It's like a trademark though, so fans of the series shouldn't have 
 too much to complain on that spot. You don't play as Dante much. Christ, he's basically the mascot! 
 Not to mention so much more versatile with the style changes, so why do we only play as him for 
 less than half the mission sum? One level where you're in a forest and the frame-rate goes down 
 to hell when you go too high up (like a few feet higher than a full jump, high) . Stylish points.
 
  
  Now the good!
  Stylish points. Yes, I know I put this up with the bad, but there's a reason! That being the fact 
 that it gives players a reason (almost an obligation) to come up with combo ideas to force those 
 with inferiority complexes to try to get a better after-mission grade. Nero. A fresh (ish) face 
 for the game, with a fighting style all his own, thanks to the Devil Bringer. Which brings us to 
 the next good point.
  
  The Devil Bringer opens up new possibilities, allowing players to execute new combos. Example: 
 a basic four-hit combo, which throws the enemy back; you pull him closer with the DB and launch 
 the enemy into the air, with you following. Perform two aerial hits, then slam the enemy into the 
 ground with the DB. But wait, there's more!
  
  With the ability to style change on the fly, Dante is now more versatile than ever (but with fewer 
 style moves than before. Boo-hoo! T. T) . A favorite of mine is to perform the multi-stab combo, 
 but launch both you and the enemy into the air before the final hit (because that knocks the enemy 
 back) , hit one stroke short of a complete Aerial Rave with Swordmaster, jump again with Rebellion's 
 double-jump ability, instantly change to Gunslinger and use Rain storm, switch to Gilgamesh and 
 Swordmaster again to use that one ground pound move that I don't know the name of. Awesome.
  
  I can go on with this, and, though I didn't name very many flaws, they do exist, like a few 
 secret missions that casual players will likely never complete, but it is a game to play in the 
 long run. With an excellent combat system, this is an action-fan's dream.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4... I've heard the rumours that DMC3 was very hard, but I can tell you that this 
 game is a lot more comfortable. It's also one of those games I really can't find the correct words 
 to describe. It's an awesome game, but it still has its flaws. That's the short review, here comes 
 the longer one. 
  
  So, please bear in mind that this is the first DMC game I have fully played, so I don't know of 
 any improvements from older games. Anyways, after many beautiful cinematics you start of as Nero, 
 fighting someone with a lot of resembelence to Dante. You who are used to playing Dante from the 
 older DMC games might notice that this boyo has a different aresnal of weapons then him, but he 
 has a sword called Red Queen which he can 'accelerate', giving it the possibility to charge up 
 and do some devastating attacks. He also has this double-barrel revolver called Blue Rose which 
 is "capable to fire two bullets almost simultaneously". Now all of this can be can be compared 
 to the Rebellion and Ebony and Ivory, but then along comes Nero's Devil Bringer. His right arm 
 is a large demonic arm, which can be used to beat enemies into oblivion, or can be upgraded to 
 eject, and grab a demon which it brings back to you. It can also be used to make powerful Buster 
 moves, which sometimes can be quite simple against normal foes, but practically devastating towards 
 bosses.
  
  The gameplay, the gameplay.. It's still that quick, cinematic battles which we have fallen in love 
 with in Devil May Cry, and I really can't see anything bad with it. The only personal annoyance 
 I can find with the game is it's unability to block enemy attacks (The only way out is to dodge 
 them) , so if you're used to blocking attacks and being able to stand still with just pressing one 
 button, be ready to change your way of gaming. Now, one thing that might be a bit saddening about 
 this game is that it can be slightly linear. When you reach about halfway of the game, I felt it 
 as if the game almost started over, only this time you were playing it backwards. Yeah, you play 
 through every level in the game again, only backwards. Now, I saw this as a bit saddening, as even 
 the bosses were the same. But, the fighting and the game itself is very, very enjoying, so the 
 majority of the game could've been just a gray room and Dante slicing demons and I would've found 
 it enjoying.
  
  There is not too much to say about the graphics. They're beautiful, the whole game runs very smooth 
 and the cinematics are just spectacular. The only thing I've noticed is that it looks a bit weird 
 when someone gets their chest penetrated by a sword, and there's not even a mark on the clothing. 
 Okay, they might be demons and there is no visisble wound, but correct me if I'm wrong, is there 
 clothing that could withstand a blade being thrust at 70 mp/h straight into it and it would hold? 
 Not even Gore-tex.
  
  Now the items in the game are something that you will most probably recognize from earlier games. 
 You have your currency, the red orbs, which is collected from enemies and bosses in the game. You 
 also have the green orbs, which replenish your health. You have the blue orbs, and the blue orb 
 fragments, which permanently increases your maximum health. You also have the purple orbs which 
 increase your total magic, the silver orbs which replenish your magic and the gold orbs which will 
 ressurect you if you die. Items can also be bought from the shop with your red orbs, and in there 
 you can finds different coloured "stars" which will either replenish your health or your magic, 
 depending on the colour. Now, the biggest change with items from the previous games is that you 
 no longer buy your character skills from the shop with red orbs. You buy them with Proud Souls, 
 which you gain after every misson depending on how well you have finished the mission.
  
  Yeah, as before, you get a rating from completing every mission, influenced by how long you took 
 to complete the mission, how many stylish points you recieved and how many orbs you found. The 
 worst rank is D. After that it can raise up to C, B, A and finally S-ranking. The same with the 
 in-game combos, only there you can raise the rank above S. Deadly, Carnage, Brutal, Atomic, Smokin', 
 Smokin' Style and Smokin' Sick Style.
  
  Now to add in with all this, you have quite challenging achievements (But it also gives inspiration 
 for several replays of the game) , a possibility to upload your scores on each level online so that 
 you can compare your awesomeness with other players and unlockable game modes (Such as survival) . 
 All in all, Devil May Cry 4 is an awesome game, and if it weren't as repetetive, it could have 
 easily gotten a higher score. But, either if you're a fan of the DMC franchise, or just a newbie 
 to the series and just want some insane hack and slash, you will find what you seek in Devil May 
 Cry 4.

Review:  This Game has amazing graphics and the bosses and cutscenes look amazing but i felt like i was 
 fighting the same things over again and the gameplay got repetitve after a while. I like how they 
 Gave us nero to play though cause his demonic arm adds a whole new experience to the game and sets 
 it apart from all the others. The story line was also very well done but i found the game kinda 
 short... The game was original and it lived up to its hype in my eyes and i'd recomend it to anyone 
 who loves quickpace action filled games and devil may cry fans will not be disapointed. The Game 
 did have some problems though such as the very bad camera angles which made it hard to play sometimes 
 and i also didn't like how when you shoot your gone while in the air your guy freezes thier and 
 goes down slower but everything else moves at regular pace. The achievments are also very hard 
 to get and the mini games were very tedious as well.

Review:  Throughout the Devil May Cry series, I can tell you that they've been the most action-y, stylish, 
 goriest, and graphic games to ever hit the stores. DMC4 was the first DMC game I ever played. Mainly, 
 I started out with the fourth DMC because frankly, most people I heard reviewing this game have 
 given it a very good review and most of my friends recommended it, so I rented it one day and gave 
 it a shot. Through my amazement, I never seen anything quiet like DMC... Most "great" games out 
 there are FPS, RPGs, or Racing games. DMC fits in a different category off to the left of the "great" 
 games as a stylish, action-y game. That's mainly what makes DMC stand out as a popular game. In 
 DMC4, it introduced a whole new set of characters. Our new main hero is Nero (hehehe, that rimes, 
 Nero... Hero...) . I'm not that good a story telling but Nero is with this religious group called 
 the "Order of the Sword" I believe. But Nero is mostly assigned to the Order's "dirty" work but 
 he's still respected by his fellow "Holy Knights" (the Order's protective knights) . Two, new, other 
 main characters would be Kyrie and her older brother Credo. Now I'm not gonna get too detailed 
 into the story because I don't wanna give out spoilers. If you've played the previous DMC games 
 well then you already know our "real" main hero, Dante and his sexy two girls, Trish and Lady. 
 If you don't them well, I'd stick to the instruction booklet or an online guideline before starting 
 your game. Now... onward to the reviewing!
  
  Weapons/Items 8.5/10
  
  When you start your first mission on "Human" (easy) mode, you face off against a boss. Oh yeah, 
 did I forget to say that you first play off as Nero? Sweet XD. Most of the battle between you and 
 the boss is just a tutorial. You're battling Dante (the "real" main hero from previous DMC games) 
 and he's no pushover at first. Once you get the controls down and the tutorial is over, now it's 
 time to kick some a**. Nero has something that Dante doesn't, a "Devil Bringer." Mainly what it 
 is it's a demonic arm that Nero uses to "bring" enemies either closer to you, or away from you 
 by flinging them around like they're toys. So, when you first use it on Dante, he's all like, "Oh 
 s*** he just slammed me onto the ground with that demonic arm... I'm so f***ed." Along with the 
 Bringer, you also get one revved up sword (Red Queen) in which you can charge it up so that it 
 can perform stronger and faster attacks. Don't forget your double... barrel... pistol? (Blue Rose) . 
 Blue Rose is the one and only pistol that Nero uses throughout the game. You can upgrade both sword 
 and pistol to cause more damage or perform different combos. Dante has a whole new list of new 
 swords and armor-piercing guns. I'm not gonna list all of them but I can list his default weapons. 
 Sword: Rebellion, A powerful blade that is the physical manifestation of Dante's power. This babe 
 was passed down to Dante from his father, Sparda. Guns: Ebony & Ivory, Personally designed by Dante, 
 these pistols are the weapon of choice for rapid-fire situations. Coyote-A, a hunting shotgun that 
 spreads buckshot over a large area. Tremendously powerful at point-blank range. Weapons in this 
 game are well-designed and have many cool features about them in which you can upgrade and buy 
 different combos for them. Dante's default guns aren't really effective on most bigger enemies. 
 Sure, you can blast them away after launching them in the air but when you're trying to take care 
 of an enemy from a long distance, Dante's guns don't feel very effective. Like I said, you can 
 upgrade them but still, they aren't as effective as they were in the previous DMC games. Nero has 
 only one gun and it is very effective at a far range but it's really only useful for a charged 
 shot, not for blasting enemies in the air. Besides the downfalls of the guns, they are pretty useful 
 when pulling off combos. Dante's Rebellion is of barely any use when it comes to defence. Sure, 
 you can acquire new skills but I've barely seen any moves where Dante uses his sword as a shield 
 or use a superior counterattack. Although you have Royal Guard, that doesn't really cut it when 
 it comes to new DMC fans testing it out than more experienced DMC Royal Guard fans in which they 
 can perform highly defensive moves with it. Red Queen just doesn't have any really strong moves 
 except when you charge it up using exceed. Still, both swords have great moves and power-ups that 
 can really slaughter your opponent (s) . Ok, lets talk about the items. Most items aren't new nor 
 are they improved which is one of the downfalls of them. Proud Souls and the Holy Waters are probably 
 the only newer items in the game but they work effectively. All "older" items from previous games 
 have been upgraded slightly more than how they were in the previous DMC games. For instance, the 
 Gold Orb can revive you but you don't restart the level in the process. Purple and Blue Orbs cost 
 a little less than how they were in the previous DMC games. One problem when it comes to buying 
 items, each time you buy an item, the price gets bigger and bigger. This goes the same with upgrading 
 or learning new skills by using Proud Souls. You no longer use red orbs to buy new skills, you 
 use "Proud Souls" in which you earn after completing a mission based on you style points and rank. 
 Red orbs are now harder to find because most objects that consist of red orbs don't carry many 
 orbs leading you to search out every single breakable object throughout each mission. Luckily, 
 there are some "Red Orb Crystals" in some missions in which you can keep slashing at it for a bath 
 of red orbs paradise until it breaks. Holy Waters are the mother of all items in which damage every 
 single enemy around you critically just in case you get overwhelmed. Well that's it for the Weapons/Items. 
 Now, lets talk about the action!
  
  Gameplay/Action 9.5/10
  
  The action is awesome!!! Oh my god... you'll never play a game with this much gameplay to it. First 
 off, you start out slashing and bashing with your biga** sword around slicing at demons. Most sword 
 combos are easy to do and are effective. Not to mention adding some charged shots from your gun (s) 
 throughout the combo. Most combos consist of you pressing the "Y" button on your controller multiple 
 times and pointing the left stick in a certain direction. Some combos can be mixed up meaning, 
 while doing a certain combo, one part of the combo launches the enemy into the air. Instead of 
 following up with the rest of the combo, you can jump up into the air and bash away with a whole 
 another combo that will add even more damage. Nero can add even more damage to his combos because 
 of his Devil Bringer. There's even a setting where you can pull off plenty of combos just by pressing 
 a button! This feature is called "Automatic" and can be decided if you don't want to go through 
 all the button-mashing or control scheme. You can activate this when choosing your character. Although 
 you're bound to be doing the same old combos over and over, It's also neat to try and mix a few 
 different combos together. When it comes to certain enemies, things can get a little out of hand 
 but too serious. Enemies tend to get too aggressive and will launch attack after attack after attack 
 on you. Luckily, this only happens on the more tougher difficulties. When Nero uses his Devil Bringer 
 on enemies, like I said before, he smashes them around like they're just little toys. Nero uses 
 different combos with the Devil Bringer on certain enemies depending on the enemy. For instance, 
 on smaller enemies, Nero just slams them onto the ground. For bigger enemies, Nero might swing 
 them around a little more than how he does to the smaller enemies. When it come to bosses and Nero, 
 well lets just say Nero goes kamikaze on them and punches and smashes at them like crazy. One problem 
 with Nero's Devil Bringer is that he's vulnerable most of the time he's bashing away so if you 
 use Devil Bringer on an enemy and an enemy behind you slashes at you, then you're pretty much history 
 pal. With all this added, Dante is still the same ol' Devil Hunter except the fact that you don't 
 have to keep revisiting the Divinity Statue to change your style. Instead, you can just change 
 it with the D-pad. Dante's styles have been increased tremendously so that they perform ever more 
 powerful mover than before. Dante has 4 times the more combos than what Nero has since Dante can 
 change his style plus he can add even more combos by using different weapons for each one and mixing 
 them together. With all of this, you get a "Devil Trigger" which make your attacks ten times stronger. 
 One great advantage that you have throughout the game is that you're now faster than your enemies. 
 What I mean is enemies are now slower than before making the game a bit more easier than Devil 
 May Cry 3. But because of slower enemies means deadlier attacks. On harder difficulties, enemy 
 attacks are much stronger as you progress. But still, you're still faster than most enemies. Some 
 enemies are a bit too strong unleashing deadly attacks over and over again. But not all enemies 
 are too strong, just a few frustrating ones. Puzzles are now too easy and I wished that they would 
 have worked on more puzzles than the stupid dice game puzzle (Mission 6 and 19) and Lost Forest. 
 Added to that they are very ofter repeated. But most puzzles only take about a few minutes to complete 
 so nothing to worry about. In the end, the action and gameplay is tight in which anyone will have 
 fun. If I missed something, I'll surely add it to this review.
  
  Graphics/Backgrounds/Cutsceens 9.5/10
  
  This game deserves some sort of award for it's graphics 
 cause these are the best dang **** you'll ever lay eyes on. Most games out for the Xbox 360 that 
 have good graphics have dark environments meaning everything is all dark and there's absolutely 
 no color into it (example: Gears of War, Too Human, and COD4) . DMC4 has some outstanding color 
 and rhyme into it's intellectual design. Not to mention the shadowing and detail it goes into. 
 Characters are all well detailed and Dante simply looks great. Besides the fact that when someone 
 gets stabbed, sliced, or even punched, there's absolutely no mark on them that shows that they 
 got hit. Still, the game just looks fantastic. The environments that you go through are unique 
 in which they are very detailed but some areas that look like you could walk into, don't allow 
 you through. What I mean is, example: whats the point in having two giant towers sitting right 
 next to Fortuna Castle if you can't go inside them? Although these are there for atmosphere, still, 
 what's the point? The game has a lot of repitition in it meaning you go to the same place more 
 than once throughout the game (once with Nero then you turn around and go all the way back the 
 way you just came as Nero as Dante) . Almost every single spot that you went through as Nero, you 
 go back through as Dante *sigh. I don't have much to say about the cutsceens except that they are 
 fantastic and are flawless. There's plenty of action in each one and that they're nice and long 
 so you get more pleasure of enjoying them. Not to mention that you can skip anyone of them if they 
 take too long. Some cutsceens are pointless but most are worth the wait. Well, you can't have a 
 cutsceen without sound...
  
  Sound/Voice Acting/Music 9.8/10
  
  The sound and voice acting is much much much much better than the previous DMC games. In the other 
 DMC games, sound has mostly always has been a problem when it comes to the action. It usually comes 
 out in a blurry shank of irony. Now in DMC4, the sound has improved much better than the last DMC 
 games. When you swing your sword, you actually sound like you're swinging your beautifully crafted 
 sword than how you would hear the blurry nonsense from the previous games. Voice acting fits perfect. 
 Nero's voice actor was a perfect match. Dante's actor sounded a bit too young than how he looked 
 in the game. Trish's voice was Trish's voice and Lady had her thang. One voice actor I didn't like 
 was Credo's. He kinda sounded jacked up meaning he sounded like he had a sore throat or something. 
 Kyrie's was o. k. but she almost sounded just as lame as Elise's voice actor in Sonic the Hedgehog. 
 Berial's was personally my favorite since it wasn't too deep nor was it too high and it fit for 
 a king of the Fire Hell like himself. Dagon's voice was all a glump of deep slushes and mouth-fulls 
 of gloob that he barely had any voice at all. Echina's voice fit her well. Agnus's was good but 
 not great. And, last but not least, Sanctus's voice also fit him well but I thought he look older 
 than what he sounded like. Lesser demons had really great voice acting and each of them were absolutely 
 flawless. The music was made up of Metal/Tech music in which I wasn't sure I liked. But the song 
 at the end of the game made it seem even better. The soft piano made heartwarming moments even 
 better than what you'd think. All bosses have their own metal/tech song while you battle them. 
 All in all, the sound is great and I couldn't make seen any better.
  
  Story 9.7/10
  
  The story was mainly focused on Nero and Kyrie but it also took the living of adding some sides 
 of Dante's past stories and adventures. One thing that the Devil May Cry games are missing is the 
 side of Sparda. Sure they add little details in each game which folds into this big story but most 
 DMC fans don't really know who Sparda really was. Hopefully, the next DMC game will add some more 
 details onto his side of the story than Dante's.
  
  Overall: 9.3
  
  Now I didn't really do the math here but I can surely tell you the Devil May Cry 4 is one of the 
 best action games out there that I'm sure anyone, fan or not, will love. I wasn't a fan myself 
 and now I'm a huge fan after playing Devil May Cry 4. So if you're looking for a stylish, action-y, 
 gory, graphic, detailed, immerse, and fun game, buy Devil May Cry 4 it's worth the money and the 
 wait.

Review:  Lets run through Devil May Cry 1-2-3 briefly.
  
  1) new and awesome. nothing quite like it at the time and was engaging
  
  2) a little bit too 
 much of the same thing but still it was somewhat entertaining and playing as the other character 
 was something new.
  
  3) i have no idea what they were thinking when they believe people could play this and keep their 
 sanity. way too hard and frustrating.
  
  now we're at 4
  
  Its hard to judge sequels because we expect a lot. especially having 3 games before it you would 
 think the developers would have found out exactly what was wrong with the first 3 and fix them. 
 in a sense, they have fixed a lot. not only have they fixed a lot they added a couple new things 
 into the mix. although it was fun, its too short of a thrill. i found myself just running through 
 the game because nothing really grabbed my attention about the game play. 
  
  the new abilities you gain throughout the game come way too late. i didnt get to really explore 
 each weapon thoroughly. the puzzles were kind of easy, and the story wasn't too impressive. the 
 fact that you reach your destination and you have to run through the levels backwards is just lame.
 
  
  no part of the made me feel really proud. nothing was engaging. just the same old hack and slash 
 you see from the other 3 games.
  
  don't get me wrong, i didn't hate the game. many parts of it were cool and the cut scenes were 
 probably the best I've seen this year. 
  
  honestly i don't know how they could've made it better, but i don't think that's our job. that 
 is the job the developers to think of something new and innovative and have us entertained. 
  
  let me remind you we are #4 now. thats 3 chances they could've made a awesome game after the 
 original but still, the game feels unfinished, rushed, and too much like the others.

Review:  this game is definitly one of my favorites for the time being.
  
  The idea of bring Nero into the series was truly clever and still keeping dante in aswell, they 
 can really get away with saying all of their coky remarks, however corny they are. but anyway i 
 thinl that the gameplay is great. i thought that there could have been a few more combos but the 
 amount of moves and abilities makes up for it. dante ould have had a few more combinations for 
 the pandoras box, unless there is some kinda secretive ones that i dont know about or something. 
 
  
  really really good graphics especialy on cutscenes there is very good detail put into almost every 
 item. the only thing i could ask for is "could they put more enemies in to the next game and make 
 them a bit weaker so that it is realistic when you kill them and so that they can put more CPUs 
 into one room" thats not to much is it??
  
  graphics 8/10
  gameplay 9/10
  freedom 6/10 : ( 
  story 10/10!!!

Review:  Devil may Cry 4 doesn't bring anything that new to the table. The core gameplay and options you 
 had from DMC 3 make a comeback and those who have played previous iterations are sure to feel at 
 home with the setup. However DMC 4 does revamp the difficulty so for those of us who don't have 
 real devil hunter powers can actaully go through this one instead of suffering through each level 
 like we did in 3.
  
  You start out playing as Nero. Nero looks like a young version of Dante as the present Dante is 
 more solid now and bulky than his former slim self. The control scheme for both is very similar, 
 but Nero feels more nimble and Dante is more like a tank. Nero has a motor in is sword which adds 
 to his attack power. He also has a demon arm that can do special moves to enemies and grab them 
 closer to you. The arm is essential to progressing anywhere with Nero so learn to use it a lot. 
 Dante still has his guns (as the left trigger switches them) and his styles which replace the motor 
 and hand respectively. Other than the differences of play styles between characters this game feels 
 like a DMC game.
  
  The game itself is graphical eye candy as almost everything in the game seems polished and detailed. 
 The camera will often pan out to just give you that "awe" inspiring feel as you just gaze at your 
 surroundings. Characters models all look well done and animate just as well. The game also shows 
 great contrast, as you'll be dragged into what seems like the dark pit of hell one moment, to some 
 bright colored place the next, but its all appealing every step of the way. The monsters you battle 
 in the game are polished as well, but they seem to recycle the core model over and over, to change 
 only slightly enough to make you see a difference, the method seems a little generic, but its not 
 enough to turn you off.
  
  DMC 4 is filled with a lot of action, therefore there is a constant clatter of sword just chopping 
 people to pieces and guns peppering some ugly demons. The sound is just really in your face and 
 gets you in the action mood. The problem is that the music that occurs when you enter certain phases 
 of gameplay feel repetitive. The same song plays everytime you fight, which would be ok for a slow 
 paced rpg, but for someone who needs action, the narrow listed soundtrack, gets boring quick. The 
 boss fights for the most part have their own theme, but it just feels wrong to have the same music 
 for the other parts of the game.
  
  DMC 4 is exactly what fans of the series want. More action and more demons to kill. With even a 
 few comedic sequences keeps a fresh feel to it as it keeps you immersed with it's over the top 
 storyline. Now go kill some demons already.

Review:  
  Devil May Cry 4 is my first foray into the well loved Japanese franchise and it definatly leaves 
 an impression. First of all the cut scenes are fantastic, the introduction is especially impressive 
 with the new lead protagonist Nero being introduced via the series' trademark gun-fu style. If 
 may be flamboyant and over the top you would be hard pressed to find any action fan who wouldn't 
 enjoy them.
  
  The story progresses at a fast pace with Nero trying to figure exactly what is going, threatened 
 by strange fabric clad monsters and destruction of his city. As this is my first DMC game I cannot 
 tell you what Capcom has added to the long running series, but as this is the first on a Microsoft 
 console, many 360 owners will be in the same boat. For anyone that has played games such as God 
 of War, Tomb Raider, and Ninja Gaiden the Devil May Cry formula is something different and dare 
 I say it special. The fluidity and achievement felt when performing different combos and special 
 moves of either player characters Dante or Nero is commendable, crucially its fun. Its a formula 
 which many games of the action adventure genre try to aim for but the rare few actually deliver. 
 This is accomplished by providing the player with 3 different weapon stances achieved by pumping 
 the left trigger before or during the battle to offer more power to your combos, combine this with 
 the devil arm and the ability to shower your enemy with bullets. The gamer has an impressive amount 
 of choice to decimate his or her enemy's with, and that is without doubt one of Devil May Cry 4s 
 best strengths. Within an hour or so of combat on the easiest level, impressive combos were not 
 only being enjoyed by myself by passers by as well, who were asking what that "cool" looking game 
 was, which brings me to another strength of DMC4, the graphics.
  
  The character models of DMC4 are beautiful, and a step up from what Capcom's previously achieved 
 on the 360 with both Dead Rising and Lost Planet. The action is fluid with no signs of frame rate 
 slow down and the environments can provide, at times, an impressive back drop to action which bombards 
 the screen with red and blue light with corresponding combos and moves, most noteworthy is the 
 Church which is expertly modelled and textured. My only complaint is that some areas are markedly 
 more impressive than others, which travelling from the initial church set up is disappointing. 
 Some gamers will also be disgusted with the repeated frequency at the which environments repeatedly 
 appear, partly due to the dual player character story, but also due to what some players may call 
 lazy level design.
  
  Repetition is DMC4s largest pitfall and inevitably its most disappointing element. It has been 
 a criticism of the series before but here the prospective buyer is effectively getting a story 
 which repeats itself half way through the game, albeit it in reverse order. This isn't a reference 
 to the varying difficulty levels but the way the story forces the player to revisit previous environments 
 with a second protagonist, effectively playing the game with what constitutes as an unlockable 
 player mid-way through the game, a time most players will get to within six hours. This makes the 
 game a very difficult recommendation for those who aren't interested in multiple play through's 
 or mastering the combat system. 
  
  The campaign will only take the player a maximum of twelve hours once dealing with a suitable amount 
 of puzzles and highly enjoyable boss battles, but if you want to complete the 4 different difficulty 
 levels which unlock as you complete the prior level then DMC4 will take considerably longer. If 
 you are willing to commit to this game, and its four difficulty level than it will feel like 40 
 pounds well spent, but if you are only interested in the story than you are effectively getting 
 a quarter of a game. However what is present within the game is polished, with interesting bosses, 
 puzzles and plot lines and will keep you entertained. You can also purchase new moves as you play 
 from which as you play through them unlock new skill sets and moves which gradually rank up as 
 you play, bought from your local save point using the games red coloured economy orbs, Enhancements 
 do change tactics, and at times make you feel like a sword wielding maniac who has the ability 
 to shatter the world with the appropriate button press, especially when you are offered an S by 
 the games combat system. This competitive element, which has long been a hallmark of the DMC series, 
 is expanded here with the benefit of an big friend list and an xbox live connection. As each time 
 you connect to Live you will be alerted of your friends progress within the game via a menu pop 
 up, for example what levels they have finished, what difficulty and at what score and rank. Also 
 included are detailed leader boards, ranking players down to the aforementioned attributes at each 
 level. It is a little touch, but one which goes a long way to encouraging the gamer to beat their 
 friends best score, maybe climbing up that leaderboard. This addition will only interest a few 
 gamers, but it is a online addition which Capcom should be praised for, when you are presented 
 with that pop up it really hits home the point that this is a competitive game amongst friends 
 and increases the chances of DMC4 staying in your hard drive for much longer than the story lasts.
 
  
  DMC4 showcases its Japanese origins with depth that awards committed gamers and genuinely provides 
 a sense of considerable achievement once you beat it on the hardcore difficulty levels. In a sense, 
 this is a sense of what makes DMC4 a traditionally but paradoxically refreshing experience, it 
 is one you would be much more familiar with in the 1990's not 2008. As an addition to the series 
 DMC4 is more accessible than it ever has been offering tutorials and the easiest of difficulty 
 levels, and it will remind some older gamers of other classic games such as Castlevania and Ninja 
 Gaiden in its attempts to lengthen its experience. How you think of those games now will undoubtedly 
 effect your thoughts on DMC4. Personally I found this title not only beautiful but deep, ironically 
 funny, but more than anything else fun. Capcom has made a game that isn't without its issues but 
 if you can put the incredibly short story and limited game modes behind you, DMC4 is a worthwhile 
 purchase.

Review:  This game is the BEST of all the Devil May Cry games I have ever played. Its not because of its 
 new and improved graphics, it because this time, you take on a new role instead of Dante. You are 
 now Nero. A BAD ass character that has the same white hair as Dante and Vergil. But he isn't a 
 demon like Vergil and Dante. He has a demonic arm. And that is a big mystery. How does he get it? 
 Well I really cant tell you so lets continue. This game plays traditionally well like the other 
 Devil May Cry games. Controls are pretty much the same, and the fighting looks as crazy as ever. 
 With the exception that you get to use Nero's demonic arm in combat as well! Heres a little spoiler 
 to the fans of Dante. You do fight him in the game, and yes, you do get to play as him. So all 
 of you Devil May cry fans can play as Dante and Nero! To sum it all up, this game is just amazing. 
 Its hard on a certain difficulty, and the learning curve isn't to steep. And the storyline is great. 
 There is an online scoreboard where your completion of a mission is put up. So for all of you DMc 
 fans, pick this one up quick!

Review:  After beating Devil May Cry 4 on basic Devil Hunter mode, I felt like I was ready to give Devil 
 May Cry 4 a full bodied review. Oh my, what a game it is. Devil May Cry 4 is everything we loved 
 about Devil May Cry in the earlier installments, enhanced with a simply flawless visual presentation 
 and with an incredibly rewarding combat system that makes DMC 4 arguably the purest hack and slash 
 adventure to be released.
  
  The story of Devil May Cry 4 is more darker in tone yet more unpredictable than previous DMC games. 
 The game begins when a newcomer to the series named Nero, who seems to be part of a religious order 
 known as the Order of the Sword. Rumor has it that the order is a society dedicated to Sparda, 
 who a thousands years ago, served as the Fuedual Lord to Sparda. Nero and his order are being praised 
 as Gods of the city, and become the legends of truth. It is not before long when terror inflicts 
 them, as they have been targeting the Devil Arms, like the ones Dante seems to have. This begins 
 to posses evil on Dante, as he assisantes His Holiness, but Nero questions why Dante, who is the 
 son of the Legendary Dark Knight would kill him. It's up to Nero to find Dante, and discover what 
 is going on with the Devil Arms. The story in Devil May Cry 4 is a more deeper and darker affair 
 this time around. The story in this game contains scenarios you won't see coming, and we explore 
 Dante and Nero on a deeper and more emotional level than we ever see them before. The story in 
 DMC 4 is fresh, dark and consistently engaging to slash through.
  
  Visually, Devil May Cry 4 is truly a living and breathing masterpeice. From the visually creepy 
 bosses such as Berial, to the textures of the level designs such as the church, brimm with huge 
 detail, and a dark and moody atmosphere giving us a warm memory of the dark and moody enviornments 
 from DMC One of yore.
  
  Blades, firearms and the standard weaponary from DMC are here, as well as nifty contraption such 
 as Dante's lucifer appear here to. The combat with the weapons here is incredibly satisfying, and 
 action is consistent on screen.
  
  The only flaws I did have with this helluva fun experience was those darn Gyro Blades with Nero. 
 These sections and puzzle segments do sometimes brake up the flow of DMC, but they are not consistently 
 a bother, so, it is only a minor quibble.
  
  Overall Devil May Cry 4 is one of the best hack and slash games ever made, period. Racking alongside 
 Ninja Gaiden and God of War, Devil May Cry 4 is an addictive romp you will love.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 pushes the franchise to the limits with its great dramatic story, cutting-edge 
 graphics, fun game-play and one hell of a soundtrack! But the puzzles are repetitive, stupid and 
 break down the games pace and most of the time frustrating. Capcom did couple of new things 
 including the new character Nero and the new Devil Arm mechanic makes the game-play so fun and 
 killing demons have never been better!
  
  The game starts with Nero who works for The Order of The Sword and has a demonic arm that he tries 
 to hide it from the group. His twisted journey begins when Dante kills the leader of that order 
 and after that Nero is ordered to track him down and take him out. But the order isnt like 
 what it is seem to be and Nero will go through lots of unexpected events. Id love to tell 
 you more but in that case Ill spoil all the fun. The game is serious but it has quite funny 
 moments and a bit romance which involves Nero girlfriend Kyrie which happens to be the sister of 
 one of the Order of The Sword commanders, Credo. The games characters are pretty good and 
 each has their own unique personality. Thanks to the games dramatic cutscenes, the story really 
 sucks you in to the plot.
  
  As you will play with Nero for most of that part, you will be introduced to several new mechanics. 
 The most notable is the Devil Bringer mechanic which allows Nero to grab his enemies and beat the 
 hell out of them. As in the previous games of the series, you will have a gun and a sword. X is 
 used for shooting with gun and Y is for hitting with your sword. Nero has only one sword and one 
 gun but it can to pretty insane combos and attacks and these combos are really cool to pull off 
 against various enemies and demons and they are not hard to do it. To add a little spice to the 
 combat, Neros sword has a fuel gauge which can be used to charge your sword and perform 
 more cool blazing attacks. To these, all you have to is press and hold L trigger couple of times 
 and stop until the sword is blazing. Nero can jump and dodge as well. Holding the RB will lock 
 on a target and while locking; pressing A with moving the stick around will make Nero dodge around.
 
  
  You wont be to play as Dante until chapter 11. That is when the real fun begins. Dante doesnt 
 have a demon arm instead the B button is for Style actions. This time, you dont have to 
 wait until the next save spot to change your style instead you can change it anytime by press the 
 D-Pad. Each direction is for a style. There are four styles for Dante and throughout the game, 
 you will be given one last style. The styles are Gunslinger, Swordmaster, Trickster and Royal Guard. 
 Each of them adds a bit strategy to the game and spices up the action. Unlike Nero, Dante has couple 
 of weapons including the return of our favorite double barrel shotgun, Coyote-A.
  
  And of course what will Devil May Cry do without the Devil Trigger? Both Dante and Nero can shape 
 to Demon form. Being a demon gives you several advantages: you will be stronger, some of your attacks 
 deal extra damage and for Nero, you can do pretty insane attacks by pressing couple of buttons 
 together.
  
  If play good or like $%^&ing prodigy, the game will show that in your Style Meter. The Style Meter 
 appears on the top of the left corner of the screen. If you play good and your character doesnt 
 take damage, the Style Meter will raise to higher grades. These will affect your Mission Ranking 
 and achievements. The grades range from D to SSS. S, SS, SSS are the best and if you get to these 
 you will unlock couple of achievements and raise your Mission Ranking. Repeating the same combo 
 over and over wont raise your Style Meter so you got to be a bit creative about how you 
 kill the demons. Mission Rankings also ranges from D to S. To be good at missions you have to play 
 good and complete that mission fast. Dying and using healing items will reduce your rank on each 
 mission.
  
  The games shop system has evolved. Now there is a new currency which is the Proud Soul obtained 
 by completing missions good. These souls can be used to purchase skills and character upgrade. 
 The Red Orbs still featured in the game and it can only be used to purchase items. When you kill 
 enemies, you will either get a Red Orb (currency) , Green Orb (health) and White Orbs (Demon Energy) . 
 There are several items in the game which can be used: The Blue Orb (Health Extender) and The Blue 
 Orb Fragment (Collecting four will turn in a blue orb) . There are items which can be used for healing, 
 demon energy recharge and deal damage on enemies and these can be purchased or found throughout 
 the game.
  
  The story will take into a series of stages including castles, cities and forests. You will fight 
 numerous demons and enemies and each offer a different challenge from each other. One of the most 
 disappointing elements is the puzzles. They are boring, pointless and some times frustrating and 
 repetitive. They break down the games pace and totally unrelated. The Boss fights are quite 
 interesting and very fun to do. Each will require a different strategy and cranking up the difficulty 
 will make them more badass. You will fight them three times!
  
  Talking of these great gameplay elements but what about the graphics? The game looks great and 
 designed well. Character models are highly detailed and well shaded including the flawless facial 
 animation which makes the characters emotion believable. The stages are highly detailed and realistic 
 and lighting is really dynamic which make the shadows move around according to the light source. 
 Textures are big and in high resolution but if zoom a little you find it a bit weird. The animations 
 are perfect and make the attacks and combos look cool too. All these great visuals run in a smooth 
 framerate so you wont notice in drops or slowdowns.
  
  The voice acting is pretty good and the main characters are voiced well. The game is all about 
 badass characters which involves Dante and Nero. The cutscenes rock and even better you can move 
 the camera around and zoom. Cutscenes consist of action, humor and a little romance between Kyrie 
 and Nero. The games music is also pretty good. It ranges from rock, techno and some epic ones which 
 add an ambience to the game. I forgot to say that the games theme song is performed by Larc~En~Ciel, 
 a Japanese rock band. It is actually pretty good and completely rocks your socks off!
  
  Devil May Cry 4 is one of the best action games around. Leaderboards and achievements will add 
 a value to this game including the Deadly Palace survival mode. Completing the game in all the 
 difficulties will keep you busy for a long time so you have nothing to fear about this game.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is the fourth installment in the Devil May Cry series. You really don't need to 
 play the other 3 to get Devil May Cry 4.
  
  You Play as Nero a Devil Hunter who works for The Order a group of people who are like the police. 
 Though theres only 2 game difficulties Easy and Demon mode. To get the full expierence of the game 
 I suggest Demon mode cause Human mode is just way to easy.
  
  The plot is basically His Hollieness gets killed by Dante, demons are summoned and you Nero are 
 sent to find Dante and find out whats going on  _  very simple if you ask me =/
  
  The boss battles are intense and had me outa my seat most of the time.
  
  During the middle 
 of the game you swtich from Nero to Dante. Though the controls changed it wasnt that hard to get 
 back and and memorize all the combos. Sadly to say the switch from Nero to Dante wasnt as exciting 
 as playing as Nero. The game kinda got easier playing as Dante/
  
  The graphics are fine and the shadows were awesome!
  
  
  
  Now to the issues of the game. 
 Okay comon game developers beating the bosses the first time was fun but beating them three times 
 is just annoying, and playing through the same level twice gets old; To me it just tells me the 
 game developers just got lazy and did'nt want to work. Also a little bit more checkpoints in the 
 game would be nice :? because walking through the whole level cause you accidently turned off your 
 console isnt much fun  _ .
  From what I heard Devil May Cry 3 was extremely hard. So I asked myself if Devil May Cry 3 was 
 hard why isnt Devil May cry 4 hard? Honestly the last boss wasnt much of a challenge.
  
  
  Overall this game gets an 8.5

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is a slickly animated action game, pitting you against a horde of demons as you 
 make your way through the highly detailed and visually stunning environments. There is huge depth 
 to the combat systems in place, but the same depth and steep learning curve may be daunting for 
 some.
  
  As I have not played previous versions of this game, initially the story was a bit lost on me. 
 The story is a mixed bag; in some of the cutscenes, Nero is mourning for Kyrie, his female interest 
 who becomes involved in the story, and the voice acting here as he wails for her is superb. At 
 other times, particularly with Dante but also with Nero, they display wanton bravado and their 
 behaviour is playful and whimsical. On their own these cutscenes work well, but their tones do 
 seem at odds with each other at times. Regardless of their tone, any time there is action in these 
 cutscenes, you are ensured an entertaining show to rival any action sequence that Hollywood can 
 produce. Without giving any twists away, the story serves well enough to keep you moving along 
 and provides the back drop to slay plenty of demons.
  
  You begin the game as Nero, and an intro fight with Dante (who you will play as later in the game) 
 teaches you the basics of combat to get you started. At the outset Nero has his sword, his firearm 
 and Devil Bringer, his supernaturally powered arm, as weapons. A handful of combos for his sword 
 are available, with plenty more moves to unlock for his weapons.
  
  There are two types of currency in the game, the first of which are blood orbs. These are collected 
 from slain enemies, and from items you can break in the environments. These can be used to buy 
 items, such as healing items or holy water (to deal damage to enemies) , or permanent increases 
 to your magic and health. The other currency is proud orbs, which are awarded at the end of each 
 mission. The amount earned depends on your grade for that mission, which comprises of how long 
 it took and your style among other things. Which brings us to the style meter.
  
  Once a combat sequence begins and you land an attack, a style meter will appear in the corner of 
 the screen, which begins at Deadly (a D rank) and works it way up to a potential SSS rank, but 
 begins to drop as time goes on, and drops faster the higher the current rank. The key to raising 
 your style meter is to use different attacks. The sooner you reuse the same attack, the less it 
 will impact on your style meter, or not at all while it continues to decrease. On the one hand 
 this forces variety to get better style and encourages unlocking more moves, but some enemies may 
 only be prone to certain attacks or will viciously counterattack if you use certain moves. Overall 
 though, the system works well, and can give you incentive to replay a mission to get a better rank.
 
  
  Nero has plenty of moves, both offensive and evasive that he can learn by using the proud points 
 he earns at the end of each mission. Some of these are almost essential to learn, and certain areas 
 may be excruciatingly difficult or frustrating without them. You can go back and play previous 
 missions again if you want to earn more proud points if you do find yourself short of an essential 
 skill. Most of the variety in your attacks will come from Red Queen, your sword. Most of the combos 
 require some variation of locking on to an enemy, directional pushes with the analog stick, and 
 sometimes precise timing of the melee button during certain animations, including a number of mid-air 
 combos that can help juggle your foes. While the large selection and sometimes complex moves may 
 take some time to get used to, once you do the controls feel responsive and you will rarely pull 
 off a move you weren't trying to. Snatch is a great ability that let's you use your Devil Bringer 
 to drag enemies towards you, or in the case of heavier enemies pull you towards them, even while 
 you are in mid-air. This really makes the combat intense and helps fuel your style meter as you 
 are nearly always in combat instead of having to close the distance between enemies.
  
  Devil Bringer is also used similarly to drag you around pseudo-platforming elements, among other 
 environmental puzzles that are scattered through the first half of the game. These are not bad 
 on their own, but are usually a little too long, too frequent or require you to do the whole section 
 again if you fail. In the latter half of the game when you control Dante, these sections become 
 nearly nonexistent; better pacing in this regard would have been appreciated. There is also a fair 
 amount of back tracking in the game, to the point of confusion. At times I was unsure whether I 
 was heading in the right direction, and at one point did a full circle of an area before finding 
 the right exit, because it had been several hours since I was last there.
  
  After a period of time playing as Nero, I began to settle into certain attack routines. Make no 
 mistake, the combat was definitely fun, but I reached a limit for how many moves I wanted to memorise. 
 While I had points I could spend, my brain was already overloaded and forgetting to employ some 
 of the moves that I had learned. Then the game switched to Dante, which was an alienating experience. 
 Dante is even more complex to play than Nero. Dante has four styles, which can be switched on the 
 fly by using the directional pad, which changes the functionality of the B button and enables combos 
 for that particular style. On top of that, Dante acquires new weapons and firearms, which can also 
 be switched on the fly. Mastery of Dante and switching between his styles and weapons is sure to 
 earn you high style points, but it will take plenty of practice to get there.
  
  The enemies you fight and the combat are really the highlight of the game. Whenever you encounter 
 a new enemy, it is preceded by well produced cut scenes that gives you an impression of their menace. 
 All of the in-game animation and visual effects are superb, making the action slick, fast, and 
 intense, with no slowdown anywhere in the game. The game keeps things fresh by changing the mix 
 and numbers of enemies in any given area, which often means employing different tactics each time 
 to avoid getting the snot beaten out of you. The bosses are impressive sights to behold it's a 
 shame however that a few of them will be faced 3 times in the game with no significant changes.
 
  
  What may mitigate your enjoyment factor of the game is how fast your reflexes are, your dexterity 
 to string together combos, and how difficult you like your games. Combat with regular enemies can 
 be challenging but not terribly frustrating once you have learned their behaviours, though some 
 combinations of enemies will certainly provide a higher challenge. The bosses on the other hand, 
 can initially be downright frustrating. I did not find it readily apparent how to avoid certain 
 attacks, or how to get my own hits in before being pummelled into submission. In light of this 
 frustration, I turned to FAQ's and video walk throughs after my first few attempts. Even once you 
 have learned some basic tactics, it will still take some diligence, fast reflexes and practice 
 to take them down, so don't feel cheap if you need to turn to these resources. Most stages do have 
 a couple of automatic checkpoints throughout, and there is always one before a boss fight. Restarting 
 a saved game however will begin at the beginning of a mission.
  
  There is an automatic mode where the game initiates combos from button mashing. While I did not 
 like the lack of control this gave (such as performing automatic combos when I was actively trying 
 to initiate another) , it will allow players not so interested in learning the nuances of combat 
 a chance at a decent style score. When it comes to items, the game also employs an increasing price 
 each time you buy an item. This is fine for certain items, such as permanent increases in health, 
 of which you can only buy a limited number. For reusable items, like recovering lost health, this 
 is ludicrous. For example, cheap healing stars start off at 500 red orbs, and scale by 500 (based 
 on my experience) each time you buy another. This means if you buy 5, if it will cost you 7500; 
 another 5 will cost you an additional 20000. Perhaps there is a cap, but this system is a slap 
 in the face to less skilled gamers. I lost a boss fight after using a few items, and turned off 
 my console rather than continue so that I could preserve those lower prices on my last save. This 
 is obviously not a desirable outcome.
  
  Despite all that bashing, for the most part the game skirts the line between frustrating and the 
 satisfaction you get when you make it a little further through the level or boss fight than the 
 last time. My playthrough was on Devil Hunter Mode, though an easier mode does exist. Completion 
 of the game unlocks some Bonus Art, Devil May Cry History (which would have been more useful before 
 starting the game) and Bloody Palace, which is a timed arena mode, with more time awarded for better 
 style as you face progressively harder enemies. The Son of Sparda difficulty mode is also unlocked, 
 and there are an additional 3 to unlock on top of that for the perversely masochistic or savant 
 among you.
  
  Devil May Cry 4 has plenty of things going for it with great control, excellent presentation throughout 
 all aspects of the game, and a deep combat system to sink your teeth into. It offers a great action 
 experience, but may overwhelm and frustrate some players with its challenges.

Review:  Alright so, the first Devil May Cry was phenomenal. Then there was the second, which sucked ass, 
 and then the great and mighty 3rd. Now there's the fourth. The main character was always Dante, 
 a pimp character with a kick ass hair-do. but now there's this poser Nero he looks much like Dante 
 but i think he better represents todays regular emo kid. Most of the game in which he takes part 
 in his crying and bawling over his girlfriend Kyrie. But also he fought like a badass when she 
 was involved. It kind of reminded me of Orlando Bloom in Pirates of the Carribean. It almost made 
 me want to grow a beard put on a pirate suit and fight Nero myself just to intensify the situation 
 real quick. 
  
  either way. Much of this game is spent killing random demons with a bigass sword that only a half 
 demon could wield. You fight through 20 missions just to kill a big statue (with a beard) . and 
 save the girl. Controls are simple to remember if u play it as much as me. 
  
  So considering my respect for the Devil May Cry series this game earns, from me, an 9.5 out of 
 10. this is Phil, self-proclaimed video game reviewer. add me as a friend for more of my reviews 
 and my blogs.

Review:  I always followed the DMC (Devil may cry) series from Dante meeting Trish to the battle over power 
 with Virgil. now I though it would suck because it had Nero for half the game and no Virgil but 
 Nero's part in the story blew me away. I was completely satisfied with Nero's control scem and 
 more satisfied with Dante's because it was pretty much the same as the PS2 DMC 3 control. One other 
 thing that made me happy is that it's the same wild and crazy Dante who every time he leaves his 
 shop he breaks his door down. This game has to be 2nd best in the series. this game would be hard 
 core and ruff for new players but they have easyer difficulties so it should be pretty easy to 
 grab a hold of this game.
  
  THIS GAME ROCKS.
  I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT.
  
  p. s. my big brother tried to talk me out of buying this game and now he wants it.

Review:  first of all just seeing the game is pure entertainment.. the graphics is top notch, nothing that 
 can be compared to any other fantasy action 3rd person, it is in every way the highest.. the environment 
 details and the visuals are totally mind-blowing. then comes the action in the game, adding to the 
 characters, both NERO and DANTE are perfectly made and playing the game as both is pure fun and 
 thrilling. well balanced moves for each character goes well with the story line. plently of boss 
 battles, nero the character and his moves, storyline, music, levels and visuals are all great along 
 with awesome cut videos which add up with some cool dialogues and actions make it all spectacular 
 to watch and play along.. i played this one on the pc recently and for those of you who are playing 
 on the pc please dont hate the game coz of the controls or the keyboard, its time for you to buy 
 the xbox 360 controller for that will alone will change this game .. or its time to move on to the 
 xbox 360.. HATS OFF..!!

Review:  You should know by now what Devil May Cry is all about but if you don't, it's all about a pair 
 of demi-demon twins, Dante and Vergil, who are the sons of the Legendary Dark Knight Sparda. Sparda 
 was the one time minion of the Lord of the underworld who turned against his master to defend humanity. 
 He closed the portal to Hell which has been reopened a few times since Dante took up the mantel 
 (in his own way) . The games followed Dante as he tries to stop the armies of hell and clashes with 
 his twin brother on a few occasions.
  
  The gameplay has always been about fast paced and intense (not brutal like God of War) action revolving 
 around your ability to mix all sorts of melee combat using all manner of demonic weapons and a 
 variety of guns. You hack, slash, shoot, and dodge your way through the armies of hell to save 
 the world. Pure over the top, stylish action.
  
  Now that we've got that out of the way, what has changed in this installment? Well in case you 
 haven't heard, a new character has been introduced named Nero who seems to have been afflicted 
 with this demonic arm that has given him a few pretty neat powers at the expense of looking completely 
 human, which is ok because he looks cool instead. Unlike Dante, he only has one main weapon, the 
 Red Queen, which is an exceptionally large sword with a gas chamber that can pump onto the blade 
 itself to ignite. For those who love taking this game through hell, or at least Dante Must Die, 
 this is exceptionally interesting because you'll be able to charge your attacks by doing this and 
 you can charge it completely (eventually) by pulling the trigger just after you swing your sword, 
 giving you the ability to string together massively devastating combos. He also packs only one 
 gun, the Blue Rose, which has been customized to shoot two revolver rounds. It fires a little bit 
 slower than Dante's famed Ebony and Ivory but when fully charged they can pack quite a punch by 
 lodging in the enemy and then exploding soon afterwards dealing massive damage to itself as well 
 as splash damage to any nearby enemies.
  
  While all this is pretty interesting, it's not the BIG difference between Dante and Nero. Obviously 
 his arm, the Devil Bringer, is a pretty big deal. Instead of Dante's cool but static and slightly 
 undemonic "styles" Nero has the Devil Bringer. You can use the Devil Bringer to do a variety of 
 things depending on the context in which it's used. For instance, if you use it on a nearby enemy, 
 Nero will grab the enemy with a ghastly blue hand and do something along the lines of wind up and 
 throw and enemy or grab it's lance and shove it through your enemy. Every creature, including bosses, 
 will be affected in it's own way and in some cases will be affected differently based on where 
 or when the Devil Bringer is used and every Devil Bringer attack is vastly intensified if Nero 
 is in Devil Trigger.
  
  It has a couple of other neat features like the ability to grab certain enemies and hold them in 
 front of you to use as a shield. The more interesting ability is to grab distant things and either 
 pull them to you or you to them. This includes enemies. You'll get used to using this for your 
 combos and you'll probably become slightly saddened when you switch to Dante and lose this ability. 
 It'll help you navigate a few puzzles and in some cases get you out of harms way. 
  
  Dante is still around though he only finds two new devil arms to put with his Rebellion and only 
 gains one "gun" which is actually Pandora's box which can change forms to do different things. 
 Don't worry, he finally brought a shotgun with him this time along with his twin handguns. His 
 four styles return and seem to be largely unchanged.
  
  While the game actually looks far more detailed and looks like it should fit into what I call the 
 "bulky" category, it really isn't. It also, for the most part, doesn't give up graphical fluidity 
 to keep it's fast past movements and quick dodging/attacking. DMC4 has not gone back the route 
 of DMC2 which picked up graphics and style and lost it's speed and, as a result, gameplay. With 
 that said, it still looks fantastic with beautiful outdoor atmosphere and amazing creatures to 
 do battle with. The character models look great and for the fans of the trench coats, they alone 
 look awesome. And for those of you out there, likely not to talk about it, the women are very much 
 carrying what all fans will recognize as a very anime style look. I'm sure you all understand what 
 I mean.
  
  In case you were worried, the game sounds pretty much exactly as it should. The music has different 
 songs but still carries the same feel including the metal goth music coupled with the semi-classical 
 gothic music. The voice acting is pretty much on par with it's great one liners and, before you 
 moan - hear me out, they've kept Dante's voice actor since DMC3. For those of you that have moaned, 
 I imagine it's because Dante of DMC3 was in the area of 18 years old while in DMC4 he's much closer 
 to 48. You probably wouldn't know that it was the same guy, his voice has changed slightly to reflect 
 Dante's age, though in some cases he does come out sounding slightly goofy. For the most part though, 
 fret not, the voice acting is good stuff.
  
  The story isn't up to the par of DMC3 but it is actually pretty good all in all. Unfortunately 
 you have lost the rivalry of Dante and Vergil which created for some great cut scenes and some 
 dramatic story but they've replaced it with what seems like the video game embodiment of a rock 
 and roll love song. When you play the game, you never at any point get the feeling that Nero is 
 a wimp or a softy or a sap or anything of that nature. It's got far more of a "through hell" kind 
 of feel and it creates a distinctly different feel than past DMCs. It feels slightly less bad to 
 the bone but I dare say it's just as good and still distinctly DMC.
  
  The story is slightly different, Nero plays slightly different, and the game looks slightly different 
 (really just in quality) but any DMC fan needs to play this game. In fact, this game will appeal 
 to just about anybody who likes fast paced action or has had a really bad day. This game is at 
 least a rental and more than likely worth owning.

Review:  OK, so I am a big fan of the DMC series and it is a great series, number 4 is no exception. Amazing 
 graphics along with a good storyline and voice acting make it phenomenal. Nero, the new hero of 
 the story was a perfect character to add but I was disappointed that I had to beat his story before 
 I could get to the real hero, Dante. I found boss fights to be challenging and took just the right 
 amount of time to beat which is good. Nero's basic fighting techniques are more than enough to 
 keep someone entertained and then you get more! The Demon Arm is also a nice addition to the story 
 and it's loads of fun. Now for the bad. Once you beat Nero's part of the story you begin the next 
 set as Dante, the devil hunter we all know and love. The only real problem I saw was that you have 
 to beat all of the same levels and bosses all over again. There was no variety and it's disappointing. 
 Dante's weapons however provide hours of fun with combos. Now I won't lie, I played all of the 
 difficulties and I enjoyed it so it wasn't all bad but sometimes people like variety in their games. 
 Overall if I had to decide if this game is worth buying I would have to say YES!! go and buy it 
 because you don't know what you're missing.

Review:  With a strong fan base, the Devil May Cry franchise went through several iterations over the years. 
 However, due to often sloppily programmed PC ports of earlier DMC games, the series wasn't favored 
 much by PC gamers. That was also the case with the previous installment, Devil May Cry 3, which 
 was available for PS2 and PC platforms.
  Devil May Cry 4 marks Capcom's first attempt to bring the series to Xbox 360 and PS3 platforms. 
 The PS3 edition wasn't received too well by a number of eager console gamers who have complained 
 about the infuriating 22-minute (albeit one-time) installation. Fortunately for X360 users, this 
 is an issue they won't have to worry about. However, the long installation thing on the PS3 turned 
 out to have its benefits. Crucial game files are transferred to the console's HDD, reducing load 
 times between cut-scenes and levels. Although from our experience with the 360 version, these load 
 times are insignificant and can hardly be construed as a drawback.
  The thing about Devil May Cry 4 (360) is that it captures your attention straight away with its 
 excellent artwork and first-rate overall design. The impeccable character design, highly detailed 
 environments, as well as the beautiful architecture shown on structures and buildings throughout 
 the game, is enough to captivate any gamer. Each character and enemy model has been carefully animated, 
 which makes each combat scene a pleasure to watch. The cinematic feel is perpetuated throughout 
 the entire game, thanks to a huge number of cool-looking cut-scenes, skillfully brought to life 
 by Capcom's animation team and directors Hideaki Itsuno and Yuji Shimomura.
  The stylish art direction and top-notch non-interactive movie sequences help maintain the steady 
 flow of a decent, though at times unclear, storyline. New-comers to DMC will surely feel slightly 
 puzzled at the beginning. Things improve later on as the plot unfolds and you are given a clearer 
 picture about some of the key characters such as Nero, Credo, Kyrie, Sanctus and so on.
  Okay, try to stay with me. You play as Nero, a youthful Holy Knight in the Order of the Sword - 
 a society dedicated to fighting demons. The story begins with Nero arriving to a meeting of the 
 Order. Bored by the ongoing ceremony Nero decides to leave, but before he does, his demonic arm 
 flashes and warns him of imminent danger. At that moment, Dante (the main character of the previous 
 game) crashes through the window and kills the head of the Order, Sanctus. Nero and Dante begin 
 a duel, after which Dante escapes. As instructed by Credo (bother of Nero's love interest, Kyrie) , 
 Nero heads out in pursuit of Dante.
  Like I said, the storyline may bewilder you at times, but all in all, Devil May Cry 4 does a pretty 
 good job of presenting the crucial characters, unlike some DMC titles before it, which had rather 
 weak characterization and dialogue (not to mention, pretty lousy voice-overs) . Voice acting in 
 DMC 4 is superb and goes remarkably well with everything that transpires during the game's frequent 
 cut-scenes. In short, while demanding gamers may not find the story too interesting or original, 
 its presentation greatly contributes to the well-thought out single-player campaign.
  Gameplay is where all the fun's at in DMC 4. The pace of the game is dictated by the constant spawning 
 of bizarre monsters and demonic entities, most of which Nero has to slice and blast into oblivion. 
 The gameplay mechanics revolve around using Nero's abilities and weapons to gain additional, more 
 complex, combos; both for melee and ranged combat. It takes a bit of practice to memorize all the 
 moves. Whenever you're stumped, you may access the skills list, where a description is offered 
 on how to pull off each move or combo. Also, at the beginning of the game, you can set the difficulty 
 to "Human," ideal for newcomers to the series, or "Devil Hunter," perfect for hardcore DMC players. 
 Both provide a satisfying single-player experience.
  While most of the game puts players into the role of Nero, there's a portion where you may also 
 play as Dante (a welcomed tribute to the old games and a nice moment for DMC fans) . When playing 
 as Dante, you'll notice that there's a variety of new moves that are definitely an improvement 
 over earlier games. Newcomer Nero, on the other hand, remains the central character in this installment 
 and you're bound to get a kick out of his fighting styles, which involve the use of his demonic 
 arm (the Devil Bringer) , a powerful Red Queen sword (that can be charged up to deliver more damage) 
 and a revolver referred to as the Blue Rose, along with other abilities. There are literally dozens 
 and dozens of combinations with which to create havoc as you chop your way through enemy ranks.
 
  The best aspect of Devil May Cry 4 is that it just keeps going, with new moves unlocked constantly, 
 different areas to explore, rewarding boss fights, challenging secret missions, etc. With such 
 a dynamic environment, chances are you'll rarely get bored. Every part of the combat was neatly 
 fused with the excellently directed cut-scenes, generally keeping a dynamic pace. The only time 
 when things may slow down a bit is when players get to fight as Dante, at which time you revisit 
 levels and surroundings you've already traversed with Nero. It is somewhat of a letdown, since 
 the game's generally superb art and visuals make you yearn for more new and cool, undiscovered 
 environments.
  As fun and challenging as DMC 4 may be, it does have some downsides. The camera still hasn't been 
 tweaked to allow for trouble-free character movement. I'll admit this much; it is better than in 
 any of the previous titles in the series and it has less frustrating moments that before. Regardless, 
 in certain parts of the game, you may have trouble finding the right angle to check out the action 
 on screen or to view various points of interest in the nearby area. Devil May Cry 4 also features 
 a few puzzles every now and then, which hardly require brainstorming, but they sometimes make a 
 nice change from the almost constant action.
  The important thing to remember about this game is that it does require a certain amount of patience, 
 particularly when it comes to performing specific moves in order to defeat your foes. Executing 
 complex moves increases your chance of delivering deadlier blows and that will, in turn, open the 
 road to additional rewards - magical items that restore your health or improve your powers and 
 similar things. It doesn't have a steep learning curve, just a brief adjustment period. In any 
 case, don't get discouraged if you don't carry out a move successfully at first. It takes a bit 
 to get the hang of it and once you do, things should work smoothly throughout the rest of the game.
 
  Despite the game's occasionally annoying camera and some level backtracking, Devil May Cry 4 still 
 has a lot to keep you engaged for a while. If you haven't played any of the previous Devil May 
 Cry games, ironically, this is the best place to start, since it offers the best performance and 
 a truly rewarding single-player experience. There are plenty of unique skills and different fighting 
 abilities, on top of a huge number of extras to grab along the way. It's a thrilling action adventure, 
 well worth the $60 price tag.

Review:  Starting note: I only rented this game so I have not done a huge amount. I got up to Mission 13.
 
  Now, back to the review. This game is excellent. It is the first Devil May Cry game I have played 
 but I am now considering playing the others. Firstly, I will start on the story.
  There is not a lot to the story, it's a good one but the start doesn't give you much information 
 about your setting, now that might be me as this is the first DMC game I've played. As you get 
 in the story gets better when characters are not the way you thought, it's entertaining.
  The visuals in this game are superb, especially the cutscenes, the characters are very detailed 
 in looks and in movements. Capcom did a very good job in this vicinity.
  This game is quite a button masher, but I don't mean Super Smash Bros. type button mashing. Timing 
 your button mashing correctly will result in some pretty sweet combos. For example, once this certain 
 combo is purchased, you can do the following; press Y, and just before he completely withdrawls 
 from the attack tap Y over and over again. At the last minute your character will spin around and 
 execute some rapid attacks, dealing some serious damage to any opponent in the way.
  Nero is a cool character, but if you are looking for sume kick-ass moves and attacks you (as I 
 did) will find Dante more enjoyable. Nero is armed with a pretty cool sword, I think it was called 
 Red Queen, a pistol but I can't remember its name, and of course, the Devil Bringer.
  All the weapons have what you can call upgrades, but technically for the sword it is just new combos 
 that can be purchased with Proud Souls. The sword has a lot of combos on offer whereas the gun 
 and Devil Bringer have only one that is continually upgraded, the gun has charge shots that are 
 upgraded and the Devil Bringer has extendable reach for grabbing.
  Dante has an awesome sword (which I can't remember the name of!) , two pistols named Ebony and Ivory 
 and a pretty cool shot-gun type thing whos name is on the tip of my tongue. Dante's moves are spectacular 
 to look at, and very effective. To further increase his fighting ability, he has four fighting 
 styles that include Sword Master and Trickster, it's a nice addition.
  The boss fights... all I can say is; WOW. They are really fun, and require more than just button 
 mashing. You can be technical and dodge and all that or you can be like me and pre-boss fight, 
 spend all of my red thingys on healing medicine thingys, and just flaunt it against the boss whilst 
 boosting my health when it goes low. But with that 'tactic', I was in luck, because I didn't realise 
 I could buy healing stuff with red thingys and when I came to fighting Agnus I realised I could, 
 and because I hadn't spent them I had heaps!
  Devil May Cry 4 is an utterly enjoyable gaming experience and if I had money, I would so buy it. 
 So go on, hire it, buy it, become friends with someone who has it and enjoy the adrenaline and 
 awesome fighting that is Devil May Cry 4.

Review:  As many of you might already know, DMC is the action series that made its appearance on the PS2 
 in 2001 and was received by critics and audience as one of the best action franchises of all time, 
 thanks in large part to its main character, Dante, a half-demon Devil Hunter with a kinky sense 
 of humor and a backpack full of great lines. In the fourth game, we get to meet a new character, 
 Nero and witness the power of his mysterious right arm. 
  First of all, DMC4 is NOT a button masher. It is possible to play the game in a more, lets say, 
 "careless" fashion but the real joy and rewards lie in getting to know the abilities of the characters 
 you get to control and successfully applying them into combat. Since the beginning of the series 
 (with the exception of the -according to the writer - non-existent second installment) DMC has 
 always been all about tactical, masterful and stylish action-packed fights against hordes of demonic 
 creatures bound to opening the way for their masters to enter our human world. The gameplay is fragmented 
 in combat sequences that require of the player to crash all opposition to proceed to the next area. 
 
  It's the battle system involved in crashing said opposition that puts this series apart from most 
 other action game IPs. In similar series (like Ninja Gaiden or God of War) a fair ammount of skill 
 is required in order to survive the situations thrown at you, but in my first example (and after 
 spendig tens of hours on both NG Black and NGII) you are constantly faced with the realization 
 that the game practices cheap methods and imbalanced mechanics in order to extrerminate the player, 
 while in the second example combat is not as fast and precise. Truth be said (and while I am a great 
 fan of both said series) , DMC4's combat system is chess-like. With the exception of the involvement 
 of two kinds of enemies every single encounter in the game is perfectly balanced and (even in the 
 highest difficulty settings) NEVER feels cheap. Even if the user gets her/his head handled to him/her, 
 one will never feel like the game is using stupid tactics in order to bring the player down. It's 
 all about said player's skill and once you reach a certain level of understanding concerning the 
 game's mechanics no feat will be out of reach. To make this simple and plain, there is a specific 
 difficulty setting involving instant death for the player while the enemies are tuned on "Hard" 
 (Son of Sparda for those who've played a previous DMC) and is still very much beatable if you know 
 what you are doing. 
  It becomes apparent that the game's winning points lie in this perfectly constructed battle mechanic 
 and it is this mechanic that will make you want to play the game again and again. Combined with 
 two playable characters, a ton of moves and abilities to master and use along with some of the 
 coolest (and most bizzare) weapons ever seen, replay possibilities become near-endless. 
  Aside from the combat sequeses the game offers some over-simple pazzles (often involving the press 
 of a switch) along with some platforming sections that, in most cases, are the main reason of frustration. The 
 thing is, like in previous titles in the series the enviroments are semi-two dimensional (remember 
 RE: CODE Veronica?) which means that while the camera makes good work of following the character 
 around and introducing some breath-taking views, it tends to switch it's position out-of-the-blue 
 causing you to fall into a pit or lose track of the enemy. While this problem remains throughout 
 the experience its is more often than not subtle and totally unable of undermining the game as 
 a whole. 
  All things said about the gameplay, lets move to the technical part. In terms of graphical presentation 
 there are few games that can stand up to DMC4 and not fall short. It is a blend of high resolution 
 textures, great animation, believable expressions, stunning characters and vistas along with a 
 cohesive artistic direction that really puts you in the protagonists' shoes. The game runs on a 
 solid 60 frames per second (with the exceptio of one forested space) even when chaos ensues in 
 front of your eyes. The engine's two (and only) weak points are the shadows which are not thoroughly 
 detailed and the lack of quality anti-alising (in some cases) . Overall, its a superb looking game 
 sporting some of the most beautiful character/enemy models you could ever ask for. In case of the 
 later, you will really be stunned by the quantity of pure imagination that was put into creating 
 them. They are absolutely gorgeous (no metallic, laughing worms in the sub way here if you know 
 what I mean...) . 
  The sound is also quite fantastic, the musical scores being a mix of death metal and industrial 
 tunes accompanied by crystal clear sound effects and - in most cases - 100% professional voice-acting. In 
 simple terms, the sound as a whole does great work of pumping adrenaline or drama into the action 
 wherever they are needed. 
  Surely, one of the worst thing in DMC4 is the ammount of repetition and backtracking that you will 
 have to endure, a thing that proves that the game was initially designed with Nero in mind and 
 that the same levels are used with "that other character" again as a result of the developement 
 team not having enough time in their hands to make new ones for him. Onother problem is that you 
 will have to battle specific bosses up to three times, but friends of the action genre should have 
 grown accostumed to this generic fact by now. 
  Closing comments: Some people might think that DMC4 is not as fast or challenging as they would 
 like it to be, but this would possibly be due to the small ammount of time that they would have 
 invested in it. On the higher difficulty settings it will prove tough enough for even the most demanding 
 of players and its speed is perfectly measured so that you will be able to understand where every 
 attck comes from without making you curse simply because "cough" exploding shuriken "cough" will 
 be coming to you from every direction. With a list of hard-to-earn achievements and a lot of unlockables 
 (art, backstory info, special chars, difficulty modes and more) this game is surely a value purchase. As 
 stated above, entertainment comes from knowing the game and once you get to know it you will hardly 
 ever put it behind you.

Review:  Last generation was somewhat of a rebirth for developer Capcom. While the PS1 generation saw the 
 company introduce its popular Resident Evil series, the PS2 generation saw them perfect the formula. 
 Maybe as important was the creation of a new franchise by Resident Evil creator, Shinji Mikami. 
 Devil May Cry defined a generation of action games and paved the way for such beloved games as 
 Ninja Gaiden and God of War. Now a new generation is upon us, and though Mikami has moved on, Capcom 
 isn't throwing in the bucket on either Devil May Cry or Resident Evil. While we'll have to wait 
 until next year to experience the latter, players can right now play through the latest in the 
 DMC series, Devil May Cry 4. 
  
  The biggest and most obvious change to the classic demon hunting formula is the hunter. The majority 
 of DMC4 sees the player assuming the role of Nero, a fiery young warrior working for The Order 
 of the Sword, which worships past DMC hero Dante's father, Sparda. As the game opens Nero loudly 
 walks in on a ceremony praising Sparda. Leading the chanting is Nero's beautiful girlfriend, Kyrie. 
 Doing double duty as the sister of the order's top knight, Credo, Kyrie becomes the most important 
 aspect of the twisting, though entirely obvious story. Dante decides to crash the party, killing 
 the order's high priest, Sanctus, and partially destroying the chapel where the order prays. Credo 
 is unable to defeat Dante and so Nero takes up his sword and duels the half-demon. Neither fighter 
 turns out victorious in the end, and Dante escapes. Nero is then sent by Credo to bring Dante back 
 for trial. 
  
  So Nero sets out to bring Dante to justice. Along the way he learns the truth about the Order, 
 the reason for Dante's seeming betrayal, and several other important pieces of DMC lore. Of course 
 no mere mortal could hope to defeat Dante and the army of demons that have somehow materialized 
 in and around the Order's city. That's why Nero has a devil arm. Unlike a normal arm, a devil arm 
 can extend its reach to grab enemies from across the screen, and can smash them to the ground. 
 It can also be used in the air for advanced aerial maneuvers. 
  
  So with his arm and a special sword known as the red queen, Nero can kick some serious ass. The 
 game plays out similarly to previous games in the series. One button is used for sword swinging 
 and can be hit in different rhythms to achieve varying combos. Though Nero doesn't have ebony and 
 ivory, he does have a single handgun, though it is largely useless. Using a mixture of sword swinging 
 and arm grabbing, intermixed with the occasional bullet, Nero racks up massive combos against his 
 mindless foes.
  
  To assure worrying fans, Nero is every bit as capable as Dante in combat, and is in fact at times 
 more powerful. Though Dante remains the superior character, Nero gets some cool lines and isn't 
 the lame excuse for a series revival most thought he would be. Instead, Nero serves as a great 
 change of pace from Dante, and, while not as cool as the series' signature hero, has plenty of 
 interesting aspects that keep things interesting. 
  
  There happens to be a negative aspect of Nero's incredible power. Devil May Cry 4 is a cakewalk 
 compared to the third game in the series. I played the previous game on easy and still had trouble 
 getting through many parts. DMC4 on normal is about five times easier than three on easy. Maybe 
 it was too much to expect the series to achieve a strong difficulty balance after failing on the 
 past three attempts, but it is nonetheless disappointing. 
  
  Fortunately, the combat in DMC4 feels better than any previous installments. Even though you wont 
 have much difficulty getting through most sections, the combat is still enjoyable and worth playing 
 the game for. Nero has only his starting weapons to use throughout the game, but speaking how useless 
 secondary weapons have been throughout the series it is perhaps better that the game focuses on 
 making Nero's single weapon the best possible. Nero also doesn't make use of the different stances 
 seen in the third game. Generally, combat with Nero is more focused, and much better off for it. 
 To add some depth, Nero can rev his sword up before striking to do additional damage. This feature 
 isn't needed on the easier difficulties, but mastering it is necessary on the harder levels. Of 
 course halfway through the game control switches back to Dante, and here we get all of the different 
 weapons and stances seen in the previous game. Still, with only half a game to evolve them they 
 seem weaker than in previous games. In fact, and I never thought I'd say this, I actually prefer 
 playing as Nero. He is more powerful, and using his arm can combo longer making it easier to achieve 
 the all important S ranking at the end of a level. I still prefer Dante when it comes to personality, 
 but I wouldn't mind seeing Nero return in DMC5. 
  
  Like in previous games, weapons can be upgraded using orbs, although this time the orbs used for 
 upgrades are proud soul orbs, which are earned at the end of a level based on your ranking. Also 
 new to this game is the ability to remove orbs spent on one upgrade and move them to another upgrade, 
 should you find that your first choice proved less useful than you originally thought. Red orbs 
 are still used for recovery and stat boosting items, and without the need to spend the orbs on 
 upgrades there is a tendency to buy more health regeneration items making a lot of the bosses much 
 easier. The game is also kind enough to put a shop right before every boss so that you can upgrade 
 your weapons or buy new items if the boss is too hard. 
  
  Enemies in DMC4 are great in number but few in variety. Though you'll often face double the amount 
 of enemies as in the first game, there are only about a half dozen different foes in the game. 
 While they are all well designed and have their own attack patterns and weaknesses, it would have 
 been nice to see more enemies, especially in the second half of the game when you retread over 
 previously beaten ground as Dante. Additionally, most enemies look very similar. You will fight 
 numerous green and blue foes, most of which are versions of macabre puppets similar to those found 
 in the first game. The enemies animate well, but they are largely mindless targets and offer little 
 challenge during combat.
  
  Speaking of retreads, you will once more fight a small smattering of bosses multiple times in DMC4. 
 It seems like the issue of repeating enemies and bosses would have been cleared up by the fourth 
 entry in the series this is not the case. Actually, by the end of the game you will surely get 
 the feeling that Capcom is merely padding the length of this game with repeating sequences that 
 could have been resolved the first time around. Not that the game ever becomes unenjoyable, in 
 fact it has to be the most fun game in the series. It just feels like the game could have left 
 out the Dante portion and been all the stronger for it. 
  
  The levels that you travel across look great, at least the first time through. The art isn't as 
 impressive as what was on display in DMC3 but the high quality textures and ambient lighting go 
 a long way towards hiding this. What isn't excusable is how slow this game runs. I'm not talking 
 about framerate drops, which are almost non-existent, but more how slow the game runs at normal 
 speeds. I realize that NG2 has some major framerate issues, but I would rather a blisteringly fast 
 game that has some bouts of slowdown than an average speed game that holds things solid. This is 
 especially true after the special edition DMC3 which had a turbo mode that brought things almost 
 on par with the original NG. 
  
  The audio in DMC4 though is by far the best in the series. The opening opera sequence is great, 
 and the VO, while still corny, doesn't sound as laughable as in the first three games. Nero especially 
 gives a great, if rather overblown, performance, and does a much better job than Dante ever did 
 in the previous games. The music is once more a mix of techno and rock, though, again, the opening 
 opera sequence is really mesmerizing. Fans of the original game will also get a great blast from 
 the past in the form of a character theme they may not be expecting. 
  
  Overal DMC4 is a great action game that elevates the series to new levels of playability with a 
 finally solid camera and an excellent new devil arm mechanic. The game stumbles for a bit with 
 the inclusion of some less than stellar Dante levels, but ends with a bang. Here's to hoping that 
 Capcom chooses to bring Nero back for the inevitable next game in the series, and that they finally 
 choose to end the backtracking and boss regurgitating

Review:  The Devil May Cry 4 is an action game. But it have style of stylish action. Which is not just 1-2-3 
 hit, evade, jump or like that. DMC4 is slightly different with other action games.
  
  Gameplay - The gameplay is action. So it is just keep moving and fight devils. But you will fight 
 in many variety ways with Nero and Dante's skills and weapons. Also there is rank of stylish, time 
 of mission, collection of red orbs and these will affect to rank of mission. So you can't just 
 do the same moves to enemies because this won't increase rank of stylish.
  
  At first it's only beginning and it's 1-2-3 hit. But later you can get many skills with proud souls 
 that you can collect after clearing mission. There are 2 characters to play and they are New character 
 Nero and the famous kicking devil's ass Dante. To say simply Nero is for the newcomer of DMC and 
 Dante is for pro of DMC. The differences of those two are huge because Nero have a devil arm that 
 can be used to pull enemy to you and used for an attack with massive damage. Also Nero's gun is 
 able to be charged to level 3 if you purchased it. The charged gun level 3 is very powerful and 
 can be used for many times. Also Nero's devil bringer can be used to almost all devils and even 
 bosses for animation of Nero's killing action and Nero's counter attack.
  
  Dante is same as previous series that he have 4 styles and 1 style that will be acquired later. 
 The styles are Swordmaster, Gunslinger, Royal Guard, Trickster, and DarkSlayer.
  Those style will affect with Dante's weapons and evading movement. For example when Dante is equipped 
 with rebellion with Swordmaster he can perform powerful moves as sword massacre or real impact 
 and more. Also the Trickster can make your enemies pisses off because Trickster is evading and 
 if you get mastered to it then you won't get any damage and make enemies pisses off that they can't 
 hit you :p
  
  When you proceed and you will get Devil trigger for Nero and Dante which will avaiable when you 
 play him. D. T. is as power up for short time. 
  
  But the fighting can get repative because well... you do same skills to enemies and kill them and 
 again and again.
  
  Graphic - Graphic is great. The design, art, and details are great and the effect of weapons, destructions, 
 etc are great too. Also the frame rate is fine even there is a huge boss that almost covers the 
 T. V. screen. Also the cut scenes are fantastic.
  
  Sound - The sound of music, effect, and the voice of characters are just great. By the way... Nero 
 says Fuxx! in game sometimes and the voice is very interesting :)
  
  
  In DMC4 there are so many modes to be played as Human mode, Devil hunter mode, son of sparta mode, 
 dante must die mode and more. By beating DMD you can get super Nero and Super Dante as bonus. Also 
 there is Bloody Palace that you will fight to 101 places and this will keep you long time of playing. 
 
  
  But when you are done everything then there is nothing to do and you don't feeling to play DMC4 
 anymore. Still, there are many modes to check it out.
  
  So for DMC fans and people who's looking for any great action games I recommand this. Now time 
 to kick devil's ass.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 for the Xbox 360 is a beautiful and very addictive action game. The game follows 
 a new character to the series, Nero, who is a ballsy and very well voice-acted character. From 
 the beginning of the game the story and characters suck you in. That combined with blitzkrieg combat 
 and eye-popping visual will have you playing for hours on end. Though there is some repetition 
 at the end (because you're playing the same levels through with a different character) , the last 
 part of the game plays so fast that I was more focused on the destination. The game is quite substantial 
 in that it has multiple unlockable difficulties for replay value. I would recommend renting this 
 one though if you just want to see the story. If that's the case put it to human mode and set the 
 combos to automatic and you'll be through the main story in no time.

Review:  Well what can I say its an awesome game! This is my second DMC game I have played so I dont know 
 too much about it but. From what I remember only Dante was in the game. But now theres a new character 
 named Nero who has this B. A. arm that can almost anything in a few hits. I still like being Dante 
 more since hes really cool. The only questions I have are why did the demons give Nero that awesome 
 arm? Why are they very old sine there hair is white? And is Dante and Nero brothers they seem like 
 it O well still a great game!
  
  Besides that the story is great. But I will admit it is very repetitive since you go through the 
 bosses a little too much. The graphics are awesome better from what I remember but it is on the 
 360 V. S. the PS2 so that explains a lot. The controls are wierd at first but you get used to them 
 over time you will know what to do. I do like how you can use a variety of weapons to PWN these 
 demons thats very cool. The guns are also very cool better then some pistol. Ok quick question 
 what would you rather have a pistol or a Huge suitcase looking gun that can shoot bullets and missles? 
 I WANT THE SUITCASE! Any ways other than that its a great game and if you beat it you get to see 
 a great final scene in the game and look at some extras like fan art and how they created this 
 master piece of a game! Well for anyone who is reading my review thanx because I know im not the 
 best at writing reviews so plz dont take this as un-helpful. So plz get this game if you like action/adventure 
 type games and really like DMC because this one wants me to play 2 and 3 since I never have im 
 excited till 5.

Review:  Im one of devil may cry"s fan, I like this kind of games alot...
  but this one was not totaly gret to me as it has its own problims:
  there are alot of falws in 
 the graphic like when you push some of the demons to the wall they kinda enter the wall or they 
 disapear and it is so obvius and happens alot...
  
  about the story I found it a great one for this game but when all the game is complete nero wont 
 get the kiss, I really expected the kiss but the demons came and rouned the time for nero.
  
  the controlling is very good, so is the guns and the sowrds, there is some fabeluse fighting 
 styles like in neros hand and dantes guns. but the bosses are repeated like who had made the game 
 didnt know what to do if they are dead from the first time adn he made them get away when you play 
 with nero and dante have to kill them all even when they are dead nero have to kill them again 
 that makes it kinda boring for some players...
  
  there are alot of sound efects that makes the game intresting and it wont let you down.
  
  
 there the map thing and its so small that when nero if captured you have to get dante back to the 
 place when you started.
  but I still like it...

Review:  Back when DMC4 was first announced and appeared on the cover of my monthly Game Informer as a "World 
 Exclusive" with a new main protagonist "Nero" I was more than perturbed. However, now that it is 
 finally released and questions have been vanquished regarding the ever so badass Dante being playable, 
 and the results are in.
  
  Gameplay:
  Fast and furious are two best words to describe the intensifyed action this game ignites you into. 
 You start the fight as newcomer Nero, who I must admit does have some kick ass moves and combos 
 as well as the demon arm which can prove more than useful in certain situations. The combat of 
 sword/gunplay is brilliantly executed and throws you into the fray feeling revamped and enhanced 
 from previous installments. About halfway through the game on mission 12 you pick up the story 
 as the infamous Dante, and well boys and girls lets just say the game soars above and beyond after 
 that moment. With allowing Dante to switch styles on the fly with the flick of a button now as 
 well as perform various new sweeeet combos really make the gameplay stand out amongst its predecessors 
 in terms of genuine action and fast paced movements. Difficulty has been softened and anyone who 
 isn't shy of DMC3's insane learning curve and difficulty level will praise buddha that this has 
 been implemented. Boss battles range from moderately entertaining to epic as you progress in the 
 game. Although as you play as Dante you just backtrack through Nero's missions and levels, it feels 
 kind of re-used like a dirty cum filled condom after the night of your bachelor party, but overall 
 it's nice to see what good ol' Dante can do that Nero couldn't in the prior stages.
  
  Graphics:
  Capcom continues to bring the THUNDA in terms of graphical achievements in this current 
 generation of high definition graphics. The character animations and textures are such a delight 
 to gaze upon. Slick and smooth overlay on the environments really make the fantasy world of DMC4 
 come to life with exotic locales that make one wonder if it could get any better, and yes it does. 
 The shine on Dante's Rebellion is all too perfect as well as the way they decided to bring back 
 Trish and Lady and make them look as beautiful and sexy and dynamic as ever.
  
  Sound:
  As always in DMC games we have a mix of an orchestrated score mixed in tune with alternative rock 
 which is catchy and similar to that of DMC3. Voice acting is up to par and the voice of Nero is 
 superbly and surprisingly done. Dante sounds just as badass and looks as amazing as he did in DMC1. 
 This ain't your grandaddy's prequel Timmy, and Dante has his wisecracks as well as that deepened 
 base in his voice as well. Truly remarkable voice acting resonates within this title.
  
  Control:
  The control is surprisingly great even being on the 360 and using the controller to 
 perform combos and accurate firing on weapons. Pulling off sword combos never felt more at home 
 even with the 360 controller. Moving Nero or Dante is a breeze, and jumping and platforming is 
 just as good as it was in prior games. 
  
  Overall:
  With all being said even if some are skeptical about this newcomer Nero, it can generally be overlooked 
 by intense sequences of action, above average voice acting, and newly implemented devlish techniques 
 including this demonic arm which seems to have interesting talents such as pulling an enemy closer 
 to you, or send a foe vaulting into the air. Dante is just as badass as ever with his traditional 
 red trenchcoat, rebellion, and ebony and ivory. If you're a fan of the series it shouldn't be missed 
 and even if you're a newbie it's still one hell of a ride.

Review:  You'll probably remember devil may cry 3 for the playstation 2 as being an unfairly difficult game, 
 yet one that rewarded your patience with a slew of high-quality action. if playing it gave you 
 tears of frustration, you'll be happy to learn that although this sequel is a challenge, it's by 
 no means an extreme one. in fact, you're given an excellent number of gameplay choices that help 
 you tailor the challenge to your preferences. you can initially choose one of two difficulties 
 (and if you want to cry like a little b____, you can unlock several more) , and you can even choose 
 whether you want the game to perform some combos for you automatically. no, you aren't apt to find 
 devil may cry 4 to be excessively tough on your first play-through, though it is no walk in the 
 park either.
  
  however, it is generally excessive -- not that that's a bad thing. stylish action, terrific boss 
 fights, and beautiful, melodramatic cutscenes will inspire you to push forward, and they serve 
 as an appropriate reward for a well-played sequence of demon slaying. frankly, the devil bringer 
 is a great mechanic, and losing it is a bit of a disappointment, since it's likely to be the center 
 of your fighting style. now, wouldn't that suck ?
  
  the games story is quite entertaining. long story short, dante comes in to take out a diabolical 
 order before they can end the world, and nero aids him once he finds out the true plans of the 
 order, but in this whole mess, nero's girlfriend gets captured, and then a rescue mission is in 
 place. now some people say that this story is a bit plain, but its all a matter of opinion. And 
 for the dialogue, i had no problem with it. dante and nero are both always slick at the mouth, 
 but like i said, its a matter of opinion of how the player his/herself views the dialogue. (i personally 
 liked it.) 
  
  now, on a final note, i think this game is an instant classic, in-depth fighting system, beautiful 
 cutscenes, entertaining story, and awesome characters, this game is definately worth the $60, the 
 wait and a high score of a 9.5 from me.

Review:  POINT OF GAME: Control Nero, the awesome new DMC protagonist, as you attempt to uncover the truth 
 about Dante and about the mysterious outbreak of Demons in the city. Use new weapons and abilities 
 to eliminate demons in the most stylish way possible.
  
  GRAPHICS (10/10) : To put it bluntly, the graphics are just spectacular. Every single effect, every 
 single environment, and every single character model are fun to just stare at. The game's environments 
 really captivate the player with it's Gothic and natural look. The game's framerate is impressive 
 and a lot can be said with the particle effects of weapons. The game is the most realistic looking 
 DMC yet.
  
  SOUND QUALITY (8.5/10) : The music in the game is just to die for. It ranges from vocal music you'd 
 usually hear in churches, while the rest of the music is a mixture of Gothic music and metal or 
 hard rock. The sound effects are sharp and sound really great. The dialogue... well... it's kind 
 of lackluster. Much of it is pretty cheesy and a little too short, plus Nero whining over Kyrie 
 will just make you laugh, but will also leave you thinking that he's acting like a whiny little 
 child (most of the time he isn't though, he's really cool) . Fortunately, Dante sounds as cool as 
 ever. But still, the dialogue could 've been a lot better.
  
  CONTROLLING AND PLAYABILITY (8/10) : The controls for DMC 4 on the 360 are pretty much okay, although 
 some controls for the attacks are a bit hard to grasp and sometimes happen if you just button-mash. 
 Repeatedly pressing random buttons is sometimes just as effective as pressing them correctly to 
 get the right attack. The lack of camera rotation in certain situations of the game, like in a 
 fixed camera position, can be pretty offsetting.
  
  ENTERTAINMENT (8.25/10) : The story is decent, though some spots could use a little more work. The 
 action will certainly keep you enthralled, however. So many ways to kill enemies and always striving 
 to get that S ranking in a mission will keep you challenging this game for quite some time. Nero's 
 moves are pretty good, though his gun is so weak, even with upgrades, that he may as well just 
 be throwing the bullets at the demons. Dante's moves are pretty good, although he has fewer weapons 
 in this game and they're kind of weak compared to weapons he received in the past three games. 
 Plus, you only use Dante in seven missions. The enemies are better than ever, however, quite a 
 few boss battles are too easy.
  
  REPLAY SCORE: 3 out of 5
  Good for quite some time, but the fun won't last for very long.
  
  THE GOOD: Graphics are spectacular 
 and the action is still very addicting. The entertainment, although a little flawed, is still just 
 as great as ever. The music is fun to listen to and sound effects are awesome. The enemies will 
 certainly provide a good enough challenge as well.
  
  THE BAD: There is always something amiss with the dialogue and the control scheme is a little rough 
 around the edges. Also, some of the boss battles are so easy, it's not even funny.
  
  THE BOTTOM-LINE: Capcom certainly knows how to keep a series alive. Even with its few major flaws, 
 the game is still worth your time. The action is fast-paced and heavy with excitement. The story 
 isn't great, but not terrible either. The sound quality is okay, save for the mediocre dialogue. 
 Overall, this is a game that is a definite keeper.
  
  SUBSCORE*: 8.68 out of 10
  
  FINAL SCORE: 8.5/10
  
  *Not rounded to nearest quarter point.

Review:  DMC 4 is a 4th installment of the DMC series created by Capcom. This game has an enchanted graphics, 
 cutscenes, and gameplay than the previous DMC series.
  
  DMC 4 got all the mechanisme of the previous series with an extra improvements such as weapons, 
 items, cutscenes, mission, moves, enemies and bosses. 
  
  The bosses and the enemies battle are great too because this game use the Devil Arm method. Such 
 as God of War or Kingdom Heearts 2 gameplay, sometimes a great cutscenes will trigger if you use 
 the Devil arm to attack your oppenents. 
  
  The story also didn't linked with the previous series but if you played the previous series you 
 might know the characters momento in the game for a time or two. 
  
  If you are a true fans of DMC, i'll suggest you to buy this game. If not, just rent it, but i still 
 suggest you to buy it, because it worth playing for a several times.

Review:  In this fourth installment of Devil May Cry Capcom tries to mix things up a bit much like a wedding 
 there's something old and something new something borrowed and something blue. I must admit when 
 o first heard the premise I though MGS2 all over again, but it works in this game not that it didn't 
 in MGS2, but this time it hammers its point home with old character and new sharing a game. 
  
  Lets cover the story. I for one think games like this have to have a good reason for you caring 
 about playing them and that reason is the story. Once again Sparda is the main driving force in 
 this one. A religious sect has been worshiping him as a savior of sorts. One of the sect Nero isn't 
 all that devoted and seems to almost not want to be in the group. Young, Care Free, and brash the 
 only thing Nero seems to care about is Kayrie his seemingly girlfriend who is also sister of the 
 captain of the guard. Things heat up real quick when a stranger burst in a murder's the leader 
 of the cult. From there things get rolling and don't stop anytime soon. You will fight a wide array 
 of characters and good bosses which seem larger than life in most stages. Things don't get boring 
 but not too often do they wow you either. I will say this at times its better to play with Nero 
 than Dante and ill tell you why later.
  
  Game play  For those of you who are familiar with DMC you won't need much info on Dante, but things 
 don't differ too much for Nero other than the devil bringer which spices things up just right. 
 You can grab enemies from afar and pummel them until they can't take it anymore. You can also use 
 it to get around or snatch out of reach things. Over all Nero's devil bringer brings the pain!! 
 In a boss fight you the devil bringer also spices things up as Nero can do various moves as with 
 a plant lady boss where Nero Wails away on her and trust me I wouldn't want to take the beating 
 he gives her. The controls are easy to get use to and for the most part are on point. You play 
 through like 18 stages and it takes a long time if you spread it out but you can beat it in two 
 days if you're dedicated to it. Half as Nero and half as Dante, needless to say Dante blows minds 
 and defies gravity as he uses all of his styles from part 3 to the upmost and on the fly. There 
 is also a verity of games after you beat the game such a s Dante must die mode. So there is no 
 lack of reply value in this one.
  
  Graphics are sharp, but won't win any current gen awards in my opinion. I have seen plenty of better 
 looking games on the systems. It seems like a really sharp PS2/ Xbox game if you ask me. The game 
 itself is well animated although the cinemas could use some work. Facial expressions don't quite 
 go over as they should. There are some good in game motions that are cool to observe most with 
 the devil bringer. The graphics don't miss a beat while fighting though and do very well. 
  
  The sound is on point in this game as every clank, bang, monster growl, and other sound effect 
 come through. The voice acting is great and does a god job of delivering where and when it counts. 
 Well written considering what type of game it is. The rock music that plays comes up sounds good 
 and lets you know when a battle is about to kick off. Dante sounds as good as he did in past games 
 too.
  
  Overall this is a great game, but could have been better in certain areas, but you can't have everything 
 can you. The story can get a little besides its self at times, but otherwise delivers. It doesn't 
 fall in line with the other games, but does manage to mention or cover past characters and or subjects. 
 Things stick when they need to and bosses are fun and challenging. If you don't buy this one definitely 
 rent it PEACE and get on it.

Review:  Devil may cry 4 isn't the greatest sword slinging fighter out there but it's good, real good. Well 
 presented and designed the game feels right. The combat is fluid and if you take the time to master 
 it, devastating. However, some of the games good features are balanced by some of it's less pristine 
 factors.
  
  The game isn't short per-say but it has almost no replayability, and a lot of the game tries to 
 mix it up and accidentally denies you regular combat. Looking back on the game I realize you are 
 usually sped through a level by monsters that come from the ground when you idle, poison gas that 
 ekes away at your health or time limits. Anything thats not sped up is slowed down by frustrating 
 jumping puzzles or a tremendously terrible dice-based minigame. the game would be adequate with 
 simple spaces connected to one another with enemies to fight inside, but the variety they tried 
 to put into it can stunt your enjoyment of it.
  
  It's not a bad game but it isn't much good past the first playthrough.

Review:  DMC 4 definitely sets the bar for DMC games in general. DMC has never been a huge favorite of mine 
 but I've always wanted to give it a try. Well, I did and it truly is great. DMC 4's awesome, action-packed 
 story and cutscenes make it worth while. The only complaint I have (which is the same for everyone) 
 is the back tracking. You play the first 11 levels as the new main character, Nero. Then, eventually 
 he gets absorbed by this monstrous statue and then things shift to Dante, who you'll be playing 
 as for most of the remainder of the game. Basically, most of the levels you did as Nero, you'll 
 be backtracking as Dante except the levels will be harder than Nero's. The games cutscenes are 
 definitely sweet looking and just something that great to look at. If your a huge fan of series, 
 definitely check this out and if you've been wondering for a while whether its worth it or not, 
 it is, oh it is.

Review:  PROS: Great Graphics, Action Cut Scenes look awesome, Gameplay is amazing, Nero's Hand changes 
 combat for the better, Bosses are huge and colorful, Storyline is actually pretty good. Also... 
 One Liners are cheesy, but damn i like em anyways
  
  Cons: A lot of backtracking, repeated boss fights, very few environments (there is like 3 in the 
 whole game pretty much) , Characters like Lady, and Trish have very minor roles. Some weird puzzle 
 like missions are not fun.
  
  Devil May Cry has had a really interesting history. It began as actually a sequel to Capcom's Resident 
 Evil series! However it later got switched to its own project, and changed dramatically from there. 
 Devil May Cry is born. The series that is known for crazy action scenes, cool main character in 
 Dante, and lots of cheesy one liners. But The game was awesome. Then they made a sequel. BAD it 
 was one of the most disappointing sequels ever. Then DMC 3 brought the game back to its glory days. 
 All three were for the PS2, and times are changing. With the next gen systems coming out, The next 
 DMC was announced, and it would be on not only PS3, but Microsoft's Xbox 360. How does the game 
 fair?
  
  You begin the story in what seems to be a religious group of people who worship Sparda, Dante's 
 Father. You are introduced to a new character, who looks a lot like Dante. but instead he is more 
 childish, and he's got a messed up hand. (more about that later) So after you are late to ceremony, 
 Dante comes through the glass, shoots the leader. And then goes after everyone else. After that, 
 your goal as Nero is to hunt and track down Dante. However as the story goes on, it starts from 
 there, but ends up fighting a giant rock like idol, and finding out some very shocking secrets.
 
  
  Instead of having Dante as the lead character, most of the game you play as a new character named 
 Nero. Nero is similar to Dante in that he has a huge sword, white hair, guns, and is bad ass. But 
 just not as much, and seems a bit more whats the word... Immature? He is a lot less calm and relax 
 then Dante always is. But having said that the main difference between the two, is the Hand. Nero 
 has a possess hand, that has really neat powers. Nero can pick up people in the air, he can choke 
 them and throw them on the ground. Also he can get to unreachable places. The hand really changes 
 up the gameplay.
  
  The gameplay with Nero is a lot different then other games in the series because of that. Its no 
 longer just about swords and guns. With Nero swords and guns are in play, but hand is vital for 
 long range, and getting people into your combos. However its not like they forgot about Dante. 
 When you get about oh half way through the game, you play the majority of the next half playing 
 as Dante.
  
  Dante comes with 2 different kinds of guns, and a sword. However as you play later on, you find 
 a whole bunch of new guns and swords, that are freaking crazy. Some of the coolest weapons in a 
 game. Dante is the more traditional DMC gameplay. And its nice that you get to play as both, because 
 both styles of the characters are different.
  
  Most of the game takes place in only 2 places. This castle, which is located in a icy region. and 
 a forest behind the castle. Its really disappointing that they did not add other settings, and 
 you have to play through the same levels twice. Yeah thats right. One time with Nero, and another 
 With Dante. Of course its going to be different slightly. But repeated bosses (you have to beat 
 each boss 3 times!) Its the main downfall of this game. 
  
  Along with that there is parts of the game where you need to smack these giant pillars into there 
 correct spots. This is not fun in any way. There is no need for it, and its just tedious as all 
 hell. As well as not the best platforming gameplay in the world. The game is about action, and 
 there are times where you need to jump to different places, and the controls for that part are 
 not that great. 
  
  Gameplay like a said has changed, but it still is high paced and fun as it ever was. The main reason 
 you play this game is for the high action in the game, You have kick ass combos, cool villains, 
 and its never been better. The graphics help out with making the action even better then the old 
 games as well
  
  Overall DMC 4 is a great addition to the series. You get a whole new set of characters, and villains. 
 You also get a better looking DMC game that is always nice. Its worth picking up, and if you have 
 been a fan of DMC, you are fool not to pick up this game. The backtracking is annoying, but the 
 action is too good, and the cut scenes are just plain kicking!
  
  Breakdown
  Gameplay: Its high action is a huge positive, but repeated boss fights, and backtracking is a negative. 
 
  Graphics: one of the better looking games for the systems. a Big step up from the older games in 
 the series
  Sound: I like the battle music, but if you don't you will find it annoying fast. But great voice 
 work not the best script, and good overall music
  Value: Different difficulty levels, and secret missions are worth replaying.. but the core game 
 is short
  Overall: Nice game to the great series, puts the game to next generation!

Review:  + Nice cutscenes and graphics
  + Fast, action, and fighting
  - like I said going backwards...
  - Dumb, useless, and boring board game.
  - Fighting the same 
 boss like 3 times... wow
  
  DMC4 soon to be 5, then 6, then 7, anyway back on track is a hero you know Nero, o wait nevermind 
 use to Dante. Anyway a newcomer Nero is just like Dante a cocky, badass, same sword and hair. But 
 Nero has a neat demonic arm which he can lift up enemies and slam them down. Only real new thing 
 about this game... I don't want to spoil anything about the story but it's ok i guess. The bosses 
 are neat looking (to bad you have to fight them 2/3 times) the fighting is good and the difficulties 
 are crazy. The board game is just utterly useless. You have to attack a dice block with your sword 
 and it gets more boring on from there. The game is more of a rental because if you bought it, you 
 wasted a lot of money. O yea, Vergil is not in this game.

Review:  To Start Devil May Cry 4 Is Best Game In The Genre And In My Opinion The Best Game On The 360. 
 
  
  Storyline.
  9.0
  Not As Good As DMC 1 or 3 But Still An Amazing Intense Storyline. However It Does Start To Lack 
 In The Middle Of The Game.
  
  Gameplay.
  10
  Perfect It Has Everything You Could Possibly Want. All The Combo's Are Fun To Perform And The Devil 
 Bringer Makes The Game Alot More Fun.
  But The One Aspect That Gave The Gameplay A 10 Was Dante's Weapons And Combat They Tripled The 
 Fun Of The Game.
  
  Length.
  10
  Quite A Long Game But Can Be Finished In Under 10 Hours. However The Replay Value Means That You 
 WIll Play The Game Over And Over Again.
  
  Replay Value.
  10
  I Play This Game Everyday Even Though I Have Completed The Game On Every Difficulty And Got All 
 The Achievements Apart From The 1Million Proud Souls Achievement. The Replay Value On This Game 
 Is Amazing.
  
  Graphics.
  9.5
  Stunning And It Makes All The Other DMC Games Look Like Gameboy Games.
  
  Difficuly.
  8.0
 
  I Only Found Some Minor Problems When Trying To Get Past Dante's Guns On Hell Or Hell. So For 
 Me This Game Is Lacking The Fun Difficulties Of DMC 1 and 3.
  
  Overall.
  10
  Best Game In The Genre, Series And The Best On The 360.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 Reminds Me of Dan Haren last year (pitcher for arizona) he had an amazing first 
 half and even started the all star game then in the second half he just flared out. dont get me 
 wrong i loved this game however capcom lacked full execution. Nero is an awesome new hero that 
 can rival dante in all his glory and some of the new tricks he brings refreshes the devil may cry 
 formula and maybe even set a new standard then after 11 missions u control dante again but his 
 abilities feel dated compared to nero but still very fun but what makes the second half a letdown 
 is all he does is works his way back from were nero started and fights all his old boss fights. 
 the dialouge is cheesy however the story is solid. the old metal is back and the visuals are even 
 better than ever (TRISH OMFG!!!!) overall DMC 4 lives up to its predecessors and brings somethin 
 new and fun to the table and i recommend it to anyone who is a fan of stylish action games.
  
  1st half - 10/10
  2nd half - 7.5/10
  OVERALL : 8.5/10

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 has gone back to its roots of being one of the best fast paced games of all time. 
 Devil May Cry the original was a surprise to being a unique almost perfect game. Devil May Cry 
 2 lost it and threw Dante's cool character in the abyss. Devil May Cry 3 was the hardest game i 
 have ever played, but Devil May Cry 4 comes back to being one of the highlight games of the year. 
 
  DMC 4's character Nero is most definite the highlight of the game. When I first heard that I'll 
 be playing as Nero instead of Dante I was a little scared of how the game would turn out. At the 
 end Nero stands out as good or maybe even better then Dante's character. In games, Dante is still 
 one of the coolest characters when it comes to personalities. 
  The action is just great. Nero's arm adds a whole lot of fun just watching him plummer down his 
 enemies to the floor. The only bad thing about Nero is that he never obtains different weapons. 
 This makes Dante cool because he not only has a huge sword but a full set of boxing gloves a boots 
 that are metal and on fire, (which Ninja Gaiden 2 totally copied off of them) small incendiary 
 knives, and Pandora's box which is a suitcase that can transform into many different weapons. 
 
  The setting for DMC4 is the most impressive because it does not take place in just a castle. The 
 graphics stun you as you are in a forest, the snowy mountains, flouting up in the sky, and in a 
 city infested with creatures. Put all these things I have told you plus the games not almost impossible, 
 and you get one of the most satisfying games of the year.

Review:  Yes, i know my friends, DMC 4 has not followed up on that cliff hanger at the end of DMC 2. Instead, 
 we see an older Dante, a bit younger than DMC 2 Dante but older than DMC 1 Dante.
  Look alike Nero is just as Brash as Dante, maybe not as deadly, and a little bit more cocky. He 
 brings a lot of humor to the game, as does Dante. Using the Devil Bringer is a bit more fun than 
 using Dantes sword, but ah well, it is what it is.
  The story is fantastic, the visuals are beautiful, the acting is superb.... I just want to finally 
 see a sequel to DMC 2!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  Heck, maybe you could even bring Vergil back, I kind of miss his quite, sarcastic, ninja, ass kickin 
 self. Having that nice dynamic from Dante was fun and interesting... maybe Nero being Dantes little 
 protoge wasnt as great as Dante vs. Vergil. Honestly though, seeing Yamamoto in the game was a 
 bit of a mean teaser.

Review:  at first i was angry at gamespot for giving this game an 8 but now after beating the game 3 times 
 i finaly understand why, the graphics are great sound is also good, the gameplay isent as good 
 as DMC3 but still good,
  the only problem with this game is that its toooo easy and way too short, playing this game on 
 DMD is like playing DMC3 on easy mode,
  i strongly recemend renting this game first cus if you dont then youll buy the game and finish 
 it in the same day you bought it then youll have to ask your mom if u can have another game then 
 she will probibly slap or beat the crap out of you (at least thats what my mom will do ) SO RENT 
 IT FIRST

Review:  Devil may cry 4 was a pretty awsome game AT FIRST. it can also be very funny while later very dramatic. 
 Soaring around as nero hitting huge combos never gets boring and unleashing the demon hand is completly 
 original and fun. The boss fights are also very fun. its a pretty even fight and you can kill the 
 bosses without having to do some crazy puzzles. although after you get about halfway through the 
 game you are forced to change characters which to me sucked because dante is very boring to play 
 as, at first. while playing dante you have to play back and redo everything you have already done 
 which obviously is a disaster. but as you proceed backwards through the story you recieve very 
 amusing new weapons that make the character alot more bearable and eventually you start to stop 
 missing the demon hand. The replay value is kinda good as you can unlock the skills you didnt unlock 
 the first play around and you can unlock special modes the story isnt long though which to me was 
 a disapointment because I really didnt want it to end. Overall I'd say its way better than ninja 
 gaiden 2 and would advise anyone to at least try it.

Review:  The first Devil May Cry game I played was 2, and I loved it back then.
  When I first heard DMC3 was comign out I was hyped!
  Overall it was too hard for my tastes, then 
 I heard Special Edition was coming out, which has anb easier difficulty.
  DMC3: SE was overall one of my favourite games of all time.
  When I heard DMC4 was coming out 
 I was so hyped i couldn't sleep for months. After years of waiting, I found out it was coming to 
 360, which revitalized my hype, and the idea of a collectors edition was nice as well.
  When I got this game I played for hours, and finished it in 2 days, which may sound short, but 
 this game has good replayability.
  This game did not dissapoint me, and I was hyping it for 2 years.
  
  Gameplay: 9.5/10
  This 
 game has ungodly good gameplay, the controls are better than I imagined. Although some buttons 
 don't do anything, and their should have been more Devil Arm abilities.
  
  Story: 9.5/10
  This game's story is about as good as DMC3's story, good characters, AWESOME cutscenes, good twists 
 and surprises. This game had a better story than I expected.
  Although, they do not say where Nero got the Devil Arm from (I believe that is is Vergil somehow 
 best dmc game ever

Review:  Devil May Cry has been one of the premiere action games out there. Right up there with Ninja Gaiden 
 and God of War. While God of War had the story, and Ninja Gaiden had the speed and depth in combat, 
 DMC was always about sty-le. Devil May Cry 4 continues that trend of stylish gameplay and over 
 the top characters and story. 
  
  The story starts off with Dante shooting the head priest of a church in a town that pretys to his 
 father as this good. There we meet new hero Nero. From then on Nero goes on a mission to stop Dante. 
 A few predictable twists later we find out Nero has a new target. The story is essentially broken 
 up into a few things. The love story of Nero and Kyrrie, Dante's mission, Nero's mission, and the 
 Demons themselves. The story this time is more about Nero, with Dante being a side character. In 
 short it is good, but quite frankly Devil May Cry 1 and 3 felt more polished, as this story was 
 just good. That said the game has a ton of cheasy over the top one linears that are cheasy enough 
 to be funny. Dante is as excellent of a character as ever. 
  
  So lets get to the main point. The game design. For starters the combat is fast and fluid and stylish 
 as ever. There is alot of dpeht there for those who go for it. That said where Ninja Gaiden is 
 offense and defense. Devil May Cry 4 is all about the offense. In the case of Nero the devil Bringer 
 is a huge offensive weapon. Bring launched enemies back to him to continue the slaughter. As soon 
 as you get the hang of Nero you get to switch to Dante. Now Dante has all his tricks from 3, but 
 gets new ones along the way. THis adds another layer to his combat and dpeht. Its a nice change 
 of pace for the game which really helps. On top of that there is the great boss fights. They are 
 huge in size, epic, and an all around blast.
  
  So what flaw does it have? Well while Nero's new Devil bringer is fun, it does make the game too 
 easy and takes away from the challange. In fact Devil May Cry 4 in general is too easy compared 
 to previous DMC games. The biggest flaw is the repitition in this game. For one you go through 
 hordes of enemies, just slashing and fighting. With no change of pace puzzle or bigger enemires, 
 etc. Next the recycling. You fight the same bosses on 3 occasions, and go through the same levels 
 once normal, the other in reverse order. To top it all off, they kept the fixed camera, instead 
 of giving you more control of that camera. 
  
  So in its design DMC had alot of recycling and that ultimately cost the game. However with the 
 same fun characters, great combat, and multiple difficulties for those that challange themselves 
 DMC 4 is a great game worthy of a purchase. This is still one of the best action game franchises 
 out there.

Review:  All i can say about DmC4 is that its A-W-S-O-M-E good all around game for the 360 wether your new 
 to the DmC game play or a noobie its got some thing for you wether its the fighting the boss battles 
 or the little puzzle like missions in the game it is very well rounded alothogh there is alot of 
 beating up the same monsters it makes up for that with incredible fight sences and boss battles 
 even the cut secnes look like game play wich makes you feel more like your playing the story out 
 and there is even a little of a MMO style feel to the game trying to get more money so that you 
 can upgrade and get better moves to beat a boss it requires a little strategy and some thinking 
 witch makes the game play more challenging and keeping up with its name as being said to be one 
 of the hardest games out there it is surtenly challenging at some points but you feel inspired 
 by the carechters personality to keep going on espesioly witht he newest charecter Nero a "hoodlem" 
 with a who gives a F*** attitude makes you more bad ass then the demons and devils you fight not 
 to mention you get to be half demon but i wont spoil it for the rest of you. you will have to play 
 and see and alotho i got the Red ring of death playing this im gunna give it a very good rating 
 of 9.5 outta 10

Review:  I'm not a fan of Devil May Cry series, but I did play fourth game and it was pretty good game. 
 Do I feel that it's better than Ninja Gaiden II? I don't know for the fact that I haven't play 
 it yet. When I do get my hands on it, I'll compare both of them. Here's my pros and cons of Devil 
 May Cry 4.
  
  Pros:
  gameplay is awesome, main bosses are the star of the game, Nero (Red Queen and Devil Bringer) is 
 a great character to use until Dante comes later in the game, controls are good and fight choreography 
 is off the charts. Memo to Hollywood industry: if you want an good action movie with interesting 
 fight scenes, go look at Devil May Cry 4. One last thing, voice acting was great.
  
  Neutral: graphics can be an hit or miss sometimes. I love cut scenes, but just too much
  
  
 Cons: Storyline is perplexing, trashy one-liners, music is flat-out garbage, puzzles/platforming 
 are unfairly frustrated to a fault and camera angle are a pain.
  
  I'll wait for the game to drop the prices. It was an good game, but it can be improve.

Review:  Ok, I love DMC, I have not played alot, but have loved the it all the same, I also loved the Anime... 
 But that aside, DMC4 is one of my favs, more then anything, for the fact that I'm still playing 
 it... I have to say that not alot of games give me a hard time, and even if not in it's predecessors 
 league for Difficulty, it still presents a challenge, but I got nothing but time...
  
  Anyway, DMC4 Follows a kid named Nero more then Dante, Yeah yeah, we all know this, and if you 
 didn't you do now.... The game has about a good 50+ hours of gameplay, depending on if you dare 
 take on the Harder modes, like yours Truely (I Owened) and if you dare try it, an immpossible feat 
 for anyone aside from the best of the best, and Cheaters, to get a perfect 1000 gamerscore on the 
 360, which I am aiming for...
  
  Yeah getting off topic here, anyway, the gameplay is really very deep, considering this falls into 
 a hack and slay category, with a wide asortment of moves, and a need for spit second timeing (and 
 you will need to be fast) , and two different Characters to master, who do fight very differently, 
 and not to mention, BLOODY PALACE... Not for the faint of heart... Anyway, before I ramble again, 
 DMC4 is a great game that will hold it's self for the most part even if you have never seen another 
 DMC game, but don't take my word for it, give it a try!

Review:  DMC4 is a good game. you will enjoy this game if you like action gaming. its pretty much the "perfect" 
 action game cept for the gameplay. and the gameplay, is really what matters the most. what i mean 
 by the perfect action game is that the story is cool, enemies are fun to kill, the enviroments 
 fit well and the camera doesnt suck. everything sorta fts well, making it perfect in everything 
 but the gameplay.
  
  whats wrong w/ the gameplay is that there just isnt enough variety. u get a gun, a sword, and a 
 cool devil bringer arm you use to grab on to things. u will unlock new and different combos but 
 it ultimately gets a little old bc most of the time ull just be switching between the weapons adn 
 each one is just a different face button. its a blast for a while but it just gets old.
  
  overall this is a good game, its a dec buy but id rent it first

Review:  I was a huge fan of DMC and this game gave me hope that it was coming back with a fierce uppercut. 
 The story is simply amazing as well as the movie sequences, the music! Oh the music is spectacular! 
 But this was far most the easiest Devil May Cry out there! I remember getting SSS in an hour! The 
 main game... to short! This game is way better then DMC 2 but the controls are quite easy and fighting 
 is effortless. I killed every boss while sitting back, relaxed and kinda bored. When I beat the 
 game I as disappointed on how easy the different modes were. And I kinda expected some cool extras 
 like in most Capcom games. The moves are pretty neat and original to this game. And Nero opens 
 up to be a sweet new character (Unlike Raiden - MGS2) . This and Resident Evil 4 (creative control 
 problems) are the games that make me think that Shinji Mikami, Atsushi Inaba, and Hideki Kamiya 
 leaving Capcom was Capcom's biggest error in judgment. I just hope they focus more on the principles 
 of games instead of visual.

Review:  Demons, magic, transforming, insane moves with weapons, insane weapons and a new character. Devil 
 May Cry 4 is not as good as the first or third installment but better by the second by a long shot. 
 You play as Nero, a kick ass demon hunter working for a group trying to stop the attack of demons. 
 But that goes right out the window when the bad ass, Dante, smashes through the ceiling and shoots 
 His Holiness. You then take on missions trying to capture Dante and close the hell gates. But here 
 comes the cheap part of the game... devil bringer. On human mode you can easily destroy the enemy 
 with one or two slams to the ground. On devil hunter mode, maybe four slams. Other than that, Nero 
 is a great part of the DMC4. Bosses are challenging, most of them, and you can play as Dante himself. 
 Now Dante goes through all the same levels as Nero does except backwards and a little challenging 
 without the devil bringer. But Dante is still a super cool man we knew and love from the third 
 installment. The storyline makes no sense in my opinion. Its too confusing but I understand why 
 Nero, Dante and Trish is in the game. Devil May Cry 4 isn't bad but just disappointing for a big 
 fan. Nero still has the same moves like Dante but just changed at little bit. Example when Nero 
 goes forwards and moves the Red Queen across the stomach's of his enemies, that is Dante's stinger. 
 WAY TO LAZY IN HIS MOVES!!!! DMC4 is still a good game but Capcom needs to step up in order to 
 get another game. DMC5 must be better than this game! But for Devil fans you will be disappointed.

Review:  THIS gam e is really fun but i think they cudve made this game a lot better
  i mean they cudve thought of some god of war stuff. and buying combos for the weapons didnt really 
 make a difference to me. they cudve but more attacks for devil bringer. i didnt really like the 
 story but the action was really fun. ir eally liked the boss battles. they were very fun. but for 
 some reason from mission ten to mission 18 the boss battles got surprisingly easy. and also last 
 boss was very easy. wasnt much of a challenge. it wudve been better if mission 18 boss was the 
 last boss. what i really enjoyed about this game was graphics and gameplay. the gameplay is amazing 
 and is challenging. although their mayb few types of monsters some of the monsters r very challenging. 
 the boss battles hav a strategy towards them. some boss battles i found that being offensive is 
 better than rollling around waiting for the right time to attack. this made repetitive a factor 
 not to be in devil amy cry.
  
  get this game if u r in to action/adventure. its no god of war but its the next best thing to it.

Review:  Devil May Cry games are loads of fun, this one is awsome but didnt make it as fun as the third 
 one. The only upside of this game compared to Devil May Cry 3 would be that you can use a new character 
 to the series is the young man Nero. Nero has a arm posessed by a Demon that can unleash amazing 
 powers. Dante however is still cool. With his bossy attitude and the way he looks when hes fighting, 
 like hes not even trying. They are both cool, but the story mode is extremely choppy. First your 
 Nero in a city the you go through a tiny tunel and your in a frickin tundra, then the rain forest 
 then back to the city and so on, and so forth. Then you just basicly do all the levels again with 
 Dante. Even though they jump around the world it is still an amazing game. But I recomend you to 
 rent it and then choose if you like it or not. Peace out people.

Review:  This game feels less like a sequel and more like an expansion pack. While there are a few solid 
 improvements, overall it feels like Capcom didn't move forward enough to justify a sequel. Nero 
 (the new protagonist) feels like a carbon copy of Dante; he looks the same, he's just as pompous, 
 and he uses the same weapons (Distinction! Dante uses two guns that fire one bullet each while 
 Nero uses one gun that fires two bullets) . The only real difference between the two characters, 
 as you play as both of them, is their use of the B button. Dante still has his different styles 
 from DMC 3 with a few moves added to each, only now he can switch between styles at will (a nice 
 bonus, but why not just do that for DMC 3?) . The B button for Nero, however, serves 1: to grab 
 enemies and bring them closer, and 2: as an automatic "kill" button for most enemies.
  This leads to one of my two biggest beefs with this game: no strategy. Instead of trying to find 
 a boss's weakness, it's now about waiting for the opportune time to hit B and watch Nero kick the 
 crap out of it. Also, if you die more than three times, the game handicaps itself for you. I assume 
 this is to throw the player a bone and allow them to continue the story, but isn't that missing 
 the point of action games completely? Devil May Cry has always been a "no mercy" game, one that 
 will kick your ass. Now it will kick your ass, but only until the fourth time, where it will break 
 the boss's arm and then let you fight it, all so you can experience all the plot twists and turns 
 before throwing your controller at the screen. Oh, I'm sorry; did I say plot twists and turns? 
 I mean a plot so bad and straight forward, Squaresoft could have written it. The plot consists 
 of you (Nero) leaving a city trying to save your girlfriend, and then Dante moving in half way 
 through only to go back to the city to kill, all together now, a giant demon. How original. And 
 when I said Dante has to go back to the city, I meant it. Dante plays the same levels that Nero 
 just beat backwards, even the bosses. Only now there's no magic win button and you'll find yourself 
 dealing with the same problem Dante's always had: maintaining combos while every attack blasts 
 enemies 20 yards away.
  If you're still not sick of the same old DMC formula, by all means rent this game. The minor tweaks 
 to game play will be good enough to keep you interested. But unless this is your first DMC game, 
 I'm going to guess that you'll be pretty sick of it by the end of your first run-through.

Review:  Lets recap. Devil may cry 1 (i was a little too young to be good at it) but its still a decent 
 hack and slash game. Devil May Cry 2..... nothing said here that hasnt already been said, Devil 
 May Cry 3, Greatest hack and slah action game accept for God of war and ninja gaiden. Devil May 
 Cry 4 sadly falls in the middle of the series, is this good? no because its only in the middle 
 because nothing can be worse then DMC2, DMC4 is still litteraly ingulfed in the flames of disgusted 
 and flaws. 
  
  Admiting to likeing newcomer Nero is admiting to likeing Raiden from mgs2, nero is only liked because 
 of his trigger sword (which becomes useless later on in the game) like raiden is now liked because 
 he is a ninja.
  
  At first you will notice in the first 2 levels this game is addicting and fun, you will also notice 
 the cutscenes are something more of a matrix movie, pure fun to watch these fight scenes, and thats 
 where you get most of the fun.
  
  nero controls nice with his trigger but later in the game when enemys are faster then the speed 
 of light, charging you sword ends up being a waste of time. neros blue rose is also useless once 
 you power it up but even then it only helps for one boss, 
  
  speaking of bosses. this just shows capcom got lazy halkfway through making it, there are 4 bosses 
 you fight 3 times each. 2 with nero 1 with dante. and fighting them with dante is a shame sence 
 we doesnt have the devil arm and cant do cool finishing moves and make boss fights end faster. 
 they still drag out and end up tedious like all of the other boss fights for capcom. not only do 
 you fight the same bosses but poor dante also has to backtrack to where nero has already gone before, 
 DMC has always done this and its been interesting but not in this sequal. it has no variety. no 
 style. no point, the dialog is more corny then the imaginaition of a 12 year old that plays final 
 fantasy all day. its pathetic how the cutscene fights are more exciting then the accualy gameplay.
 
  
  of course the music is the same old reject emo but it works for the game sence the shadows look 
 like they where drawn by a 6th grader. good thing xbox 360 has custom soundtracks..... and sorry 
 once again for ps3 owners...
  
  its almost as bad as dmc2, the only thing that keeps it on its toes is its potential but other 
 then that, holding the L button to charge up your weapon for just 3 quick attacks does not add 
 fun. nero has no place in DMC, the story makes no sence, (but when have they evrer) the fighting 
 is cheaper then ever. as in enemys will launch into you and dmg all of your heakth without warning. 
 you will like this game for a while. but it downfalls as soon as you play dante, its not dantes 
 fault either, its the game developers fault for just being lazy and making dante secondary. its 
 rude to try to replace him by someone younger. i couldnt help hoping Vann from FF12 to come in 
 the game and get stabbed multiple times by dante. but ill dream on and accept thie below mediocre 
 dissapointment

Review:  After a mixed batch of previous efforts, varying from near perfect, blindingly difficult and downright 
 ugly, anybody would have been forgiven for thinking that this game would either fail big time or 
 only appeal to the hardcore gamer. Well I would have to say that neither of those statements are 
 true... entirely.
  
  DMC4 is at heart an arcade inspired action/slash em up game with nods to other games such as Resident 
 Evil and Ninja Gaiden. You take the role as Nero and Dante (the latter of which DMC fans will be 
 accustomed) and your job is to run through castles, crypts and other fiendishly halloween inspired 
 locations. The only hitch is that situated in each of these beautifully crafted locales is a plethora 
 of demon spawn and other unsightly creatures from the night. You name and it DMC has it, and will 
 throw at you as hard as it possibly can. The joy of this game lies in the action, and being an 
 action game I wouldnt expect anything less. The controls are responsive and the combos you can 
 pull of feel fluid and make your eyes orgasm. The more you progress and the better you get the 
 more points you will earn which in turn can buy you more moves and combinations to help you kick 
 demon butt in an even more stylish manner. 
  
  This game has tons of replay value, with varying difficulty levels and achievements to obtain, 
 but unfortunately this is also where the huge pitfall of the game lies. With so many reasons to 
 play over and over again, I would have expected Capcom to have implemented a little more effort 
 in varying the levels a little more. Back tracking is all well and good... but in the latter half 
 of the game when you play as the original anti hero of the series you find yourself gunning through 
 practically all the same areas as you did with nero. As unfortunate as this may be, it does little 
 to harm the overall package. Beautiful visuals, smooth and fluid controls and positively oozing 
 with style and pizzaz, this game should feed the hunger of any DMC fan and anybody else who wants 
 a simple yet fun and inventive action game

Review:  Ok. I was sitting at my PC thinking. You know what. I'm tired of paying so much money just to upgrade 
 and play newer games. I saw DMC4 on youtube and i was like HOLY COW ILL CONVERT TO THE 360!
  
  So i did! =D
  
  And DMC4 was my first game, WOW IT BLOWS!
  
  The combo system is an 
 Epic Failure. You have to hit Y with different timing to pull off combos.
  
  No one likes to sit there, pausing for 3 seconds waiting to hit Y only to wait another 2 seconds 
 to hit Y just to pull off a combo!
  
  Its bull!
  
  You end up mashing Y as fast as you can, pulling 1-2 of the same combos over and over again.
 
  
  X is the gun. Pretty much useless with the amount of damage you do.
  
  And B is used to grab enemies which it can be pretty Over Powered with the slam ability which kills 
 enemies in one hit.
  
  Ok and on top of the controls crap.... this game is repetitive like NON OTHER.
  
  You walk around. 
 Take a few steps into a new room. BAM you see the cutscene of red spider web thingy closing a door 
 to where you have to kill more enemies to open the door. its awesome at first. but after 400 times 
 of seein it over and over and over and over. it makes u wanna puke.
  
  ANOTHER THING! THE CAMERA! BLUGHHHHLAHLHLAHAHLHA!!!!!
  
  You get this, overhead view of your 
 character, and when you go into another room, it changes the camera angle to a completely different 
 position to where if you were holding FORWARD the room before it, because of the camera angle, 
 FORWARD is now backwards. It gets annoying as hell.
  
  **** game. dont waste your 60 bucks.
  
  I traded this game for 17 bucks at Gamestop and Traded 
 it for Crackdown. And i wasnt even disappointed at all the money i lost cuz DMC4 is so horrible 
 and Crackdown is so awesome.
  
  DMC4 was a bad first impression on the 360 for me.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4, to make a long story short, is AMAZING!! Or should I say... breath-taking... umm 
 I really fail to find the right words to describe how I feel about this game.. It's altogether a 
 peace of win brought for you to enjoy using your console!
  
  Now why am I being so overly melodramatic when I talk about this game? I wish I could answer you 
 but.... It's kinda hard to find something to start with.. but what the heck, let's start with the 
 graphics..
  The graphics are BEAUTIFUL!! One of the best you'll ever see! Just look how those awesome polygonal 
 graphics that look just as good as pre-rendered ones! So smooth and pleasant for the eyes to see! 
 And the character design... the environment.... All together = LOVE! PURE BEAUTY!
  
  The gameplay is easy as everyone can control a character, which by the way is Nero who can be either 
 a human or a devil, It's your choice! Then you get to control our beloved hero Dante! So simple! 
 just walk your character through the lovely places you're supposed to walk in, and that's it! though 
 fighting takes the gameplay to a whole new level, not every baby can fight hehe =P But the fights 
 are still much easier than DMC3! You kinda get these points after finishing the missions... and 
 you use them to get new moves/skills for you Red Queen [Sword] and Blue Rose [Gun] ... you also get 
 ranked after each mission according the the number of enemiies you defeated and how much time you 
 spent to finish the mission and other factors.
  Besides the main missions you go through to proceed in the game, you have what they call "secret 
 missions" in which you play just for fun and to get a better walkthrough reputation! hehe, when 
 you tell your friends "Yeah I beat that secret mission number 13"
  The bosses, some of them are fun.. like, seriously =P Others are plain annoyance  __ ; you just 
 want to defeat them and never see their faces again!
  
  The story is... WAAAH!!!!!! CUTE! Nero loves Kyrie!! The sister of the man in charge to take care 
 of the church Dante attacked, and Nero's mission is to hunt Dante and finish him..!!
  Dante and Nero have this AMAZING fight at the beginning of the game! FUN! This is as far as I know 
 about the story, because I didn't play the previous games of Devil May Cry series.
  
  The soundtrack is a master piece!! The song which Kyrie sings in the Intro and the Instrumental 
 version of it plays in the places where you buy items and skills makes me cry @__@ 
  
  Memories~! I still remember how I used to stay up till 5 in the morning playing this game!
  
 
  So in essence, It's MUST-HAVE!!!! The game is a combination of LOVE AND WIN!!!

Review:  I'd not come across this title before, and only bought it because I was late to preorder GTA IV 
 and so bought this as part of bundle which meant I wouldn't have to wait two weeks to get my hands 
 on GTA IV. I didn't touch DMC for a couple of weeks after it arrived, it was still in the cellophane.
 
  
  But the other day, I decided to take a break from Liberty City, and try out this other game I'd 
 bought. I'm glad I did! After a few false starts where I was not able to work out how to return 
 to the point I'd previously saved (just confusing UI rather than any ineptness on my part) I really 
 started to get into DMC. I usually really don't like this type of game, but this is visually stunning, 
 it moves quickly, and you don't (well, not yet!) get stuck in a plot hole which means you just 
 abandon the game through sheer frustration. The controls take a little getting used to, but once 
 you do, it's a delight to play, and quite intuitive. The fights are not too hard, and the addition 
 of the style meter does make you try harder to fight and not get hit in pursuit of that SSS rating.
 
  
  As I said before, the visuals are stunning - the buildings are beautifully rendered, and the characters 
 are all brilliantly realised. The exaggerated weaponry strangely doesn't really look that at odds 
 with the situation, and the various baddies are all very individual, and excellently done.
  
  The game cracks along at a good pace, although some missions do tend to get a little confusing, 
 and you can find yourself retreading old ground before finding the path you should be on - but 
 this is not such a bad thing, and does add some interest rather than following a completely linear 
 road with little or no interaction from the player. The only negative I'd really point out is the 
 secret missions. Some of these are just impossible, and as such can be very annoying. I presume 
 (I haven't read any spoilers to find out) that I may get the chance to try these again later on 
 in the game, but some challenge you to perform feats with skills you don't currently have, and 
 with no simple way (that I have found) to cancel a mission and return to normal play without forfeiting 
 your 'life' this can be a right pain.
  
  Not being aware of the plot, or story from the previous DMC titles, I have no idea where this one 
 is really going, but to be honest, the story is incidental to the game which can be played in complete 
 ignorance of any history. I'm certainly enjoying it, and Liberty City is going to be on the shelf 
 for a few more days yet while I try and get further with Nero and chums.

Review:  I feel that this game should of at least gained a better score than Devil May Cry 3. The 8.0 is 
 a little misleading. This is a terrific game in my opinion.
  
  First and foremost, Devil May Cry 4 is visually STUNNING. It's like a movie. Graphics and cinematography 
 just don't get much better than this. Everything is so detailed, it is the cleanest most crisp 
 game I've ever seen. You have to see it for yourself. Cutscences are so beautiful. If your a person 
 that appreciates HD visual quality, you'll definitely enjoy this game.10/10
  
  Gameplay is awesome as always. Im sorry that people think that it's repititive... I disagree with 
 that... Compared to the other Devil May Cry's, there is no freakin way this game was as repititiive 
 as them!! I never get tired of slammin people (especially the bosses) with the devil bringer. The 
 devil bringer is so innovative and so cool to use, especially on bosses, the first time you use 
 it on Berial you'll be like, whoa. Plus you get to play as Dante, and you can switch weapons, guns, 
 and styles all at the same time, and when you learn how to use combine which weapons to use, the 
 system is so fun and flawless. You can learn how to annihilate your enemies while trying to keep 
 up your S rank. It's the same fomula but it's so much more improved. 10/10
  
  The story is terrific. I mean the dialog perfectly fits every character. I believe there are two 
 words that can sum up Dante and Nero... Bad-Ass!! If you love a protagonist with that Bad-Ass attitude 
 like nothing gets to them then you'll love the story and the characters. I guarantee it. I don't 
 think of DMC4's dialog or characters as over the top, I just think of them as COOL. Devil May Cry 
 4 succeeds as having the coolest, most bad-ass characters ever seen in an Action/Adventure game, 
 in my opionion. It all fits so well. 10/10
  
  I love this game, and I am a proud owner of the entire Devil May Cry series. I am an expert gamer, 
 and I know great game when I play one, and this is definitely a game any action/adventure lover 
 would love to own. At least, anyone with a 360/PS3 should at least give this game a try.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4
  
  By: Fs_Metal
  Game title: Folklore
  Genre: Action
  Platform: Playstation 3 & X-Box 360
  ESRB Rating: Mature
  Developer: Capcom
  Release date: 
 February 6, 2008
  Overall rating: 8.5/10
  
  Devil May Cry is a series that has gathered up a fanatical following of the truly hardcore that 
 play it religiously much like the Zelda series. Playing the first game would certainly give people 
 an idea as to why that is. When it was new, there was nothing else like it. It was an action game 
 that moved at breakneck speed. It was certainly faster than any other game on the market at the 
 time. It's sword swinging gameplay was unlike anything anyone had played before, and it's bad attitude 
 and gothic atmosphere really helped with getting into the world. It's style has been copied by 
 other games such as God of War and, quite possibly, even surpassed. The problem with such a fanatical 
 following is that if you change anything, fans cry murder, such was the case with Devil May Cry 
 2 with it's new character, it's emphasis on gun slinging instead of sword swinging and it's change 
 of enviroments, and, to a lesser extent, Devil May Cry 3 with it's absolutely absurd difficulty. 
 The fourth installment in the series promised a return to form with lessened difficulty and the 
 same very in depth fighting style that the fans expect from the game. With the game moving into 
 the next generation, however, is this a good thing?
  
  Gameplay - 7.5
  
  Let me start off by saying that I am not a Devil May Cry fanatic. I don't run through the games 
 again and again trying to get the S rank on every level like many of the series fans do. The rediculous 
 difficulty of the third game in the series ultimately drove me to stop playing it, even though 
 I thoroughly enjoyed the combat. The bosses in the game started off hard with Cerberus and just 
 continually got harder and harder to the point where I just said "This is absurd" and quit. With 
 that in mind, I hope to provide a bit of an outsiders view on the game. With the series moving 
 to the next gen, I was a bit afraid that, because of the fanatical hardcore fanbase, the gameplay 
 would not follow suit. I was right.
  
  Allow me to explain. There are alot of things to like about Devil May Cry 4. Everything that I 
 liked about the previous games is still there, and it is all considerably less difficult without 
 sacreficing any of the depth and strategy involved in any of the previous game. The battle system 
 is as fast paced and as frantic as it ever was, and there is still alot of depth with various combos 
 that you can learn and pull off. It isn't just button mashing and merely button mashing will not 
 get you through the game on it's standard difficulty. At the same time, it feels like, aside from 
 a couple of minor tweaks (that are nice by the way) the developers did nothing to bring the combat 
 into the next gen. As a direct result of that, the gameplay feels dated. It's fun and satisfying 
 for the most part, but it cannot escape the 'been there and done that' feel.'
  
  In Devil May Cry 4, there are two characters that you will play as. You start off the game playing 
 as Nero who has a sword called the Red Queen. This sword has a small gas powered engine attached 
 to it that you can rev up to strengthen up to 3 blows in a row. This is a cool feature and is quite 
 useful. As usual, you have your sword and your gun. Nero only has one sword and one gun that he 
 uses throughout the game. Unlike Dante, the other character and primary character throughout the 
 series, he does not have a choice between multiple weapon types. It's not really a problem, though, 
 because the Red Queen is a badass sword anyway. The y button is used to have him swing the sword 
 with the right shoulder being used for lockon and the left trigger being used to rev his sword 
 up. The x button is used to fire his weapon, the Blue Rose, which is a large revolver. It can be 
 charged up for a few seconds for a more powerful shot, but, of course, that means a slower rate 
 of fire. In typical Devil May Cry fasion, you can do a large number of combos with your sword and 
 your gun that it pays off to learn atleast some of them over the course of the game. The a button 
 is used to jump as well as examine objects.
  
  Nero has one other weapon at his disposal, and it winds up being the most useful weapon in the 
 entire game. His right arm is called the Devil Bringer. You have no idea just how useful his arm 
 is in combat until you use it for yourself. It's one of those things where, once you get used to 
 it, you have to wonder how you ever lived without it. I won't lie. The Devil Bringer is extremely 
 cool. Nero can throw his right arm out and extend it to reach enemies that were previously out 
 of reach and draw them to him. This is what he does with it if you are currently locked onto the 
 enemy and you hit the designated b button. This is an extremely useful tool in combat. It brings 
 the enemies to you, instead of you going to them. It makes combat both easier and quicker. That 
 is not it's only use, however. If you are not using the lock on feature, Nero will do some sort 
 of super move on most non boss enemies with it. For instance, there is one enemy that he grabs, 
 spins them around like they weigh nothing, slamming them into the ground repeatedly and anything 
 else unlucky enough to be in the way before he tosses them away from him to come crashing hard 
 into the ground. It is both brutal and badass. IT is almost as much fun to watch as it is to do. 
 This is what makes it DMC4's most useful tool. The problem is, however, that even with the addition 
 of the Devil Bringer, combat with Nero is, for the most part, the exact same as it always has been 
 with Dante. He controls the same. He feels the same. He even LOOKS the same.
  
  About half way through the game, player control switches over to the main character Dante. This, 
 alone presents one of the games biggest gameplay problems. When you switch to Dante, you don't 
 go through another part of the game. You go back all the way you just came to where the game started 
 and fight most of the same bosses. IT is still fun, but this is just poor game design at it's best. 
 It makes it feel repetitive. You are doing everything all over again, except backwards. Dante, 
 for the most part, controls exactly like Nero does. Y to swing his sword. B to shoot. A to examine 
 and jump. The difference here is, although he cannot rev his sword, his attacks deal out a bit 
 more damage than Neros do. Instead of the Devil Bringer, he has the ability to switch between the 
 same four fighting styles that were used in Devil May Cry 3, which are Gunslinger, Sword Master, 
 Trickster and Royal Guard. I used Sword Master for when I wasn't fighting bosses and Trickster 
 for when I was. You can switch styles on the fly with the directional pad, which is cool, but it 
 doesn't really add much to the game. I only switched styles before boss fights anyway. The b button 
 does different things for the different styles. For Sword Master, it performs a special sword attack 
 that is quite powerful. In Trickster, it performs a dodge move, and so on. The combat for Dante 
 is tweaked even less than it was for Nero. It is, basically, the exact same thing as DMC3 with 
 the ability to switch styles on the fly. That is the only difference. While the combat is satisfying 
 for the most part, the fact that it doesn't really do anything new is disappointing.
  
  Graphics - 9
  
  Devil May Cry 4 is not the best looking game on the market. It never was. No 
 fan of the series, however, will be disappointed. The game does look great, as is expected from 
 these games. They always have and, probably, always will. The character models are rich in detail. 
 The sword swinging animation is as slick as it ever was, but don't come here expecting Uncharted. 
 That level of realism won't be found, though there is alot to like about DMC4 in the graphical 
 department. Everything is high in detail, and it all gleams with the level of polish that fans 
 of the series have come to expect. You can tell that, in many ways, these games are a labor of 
 love for the staff that creates them. They spent about 3 years developing this game, and it does 
 show. It is not 'uber-realistic' but it was not meant to be.
  
  One of the bright spots of Devil May Cry has always been the enemy design. The team did not slack 
 off in this regard. The enemy design is as sharp, cool looking and as gothic as it ever was. One 
 would expect nothing less from a world where humans and demons interact with one another (usually 
 in violent ways) on a daily basis. Some of the classic enemies, such as the cackling ghosts that 
 have been there since the very first game in the series, are still here in a new and redesigned 
 form, and they are as ready as they ever were to attempt to kick your ass. Their flowing black 
 cloaks have more life to them now than they have ever had before, and watching those cloaks get 
 less and less thick as Nero rips the layers off with his Devil Bringer is extremely well handled 
 when it could, easily, have looked cheap or downright stupid. There is also a variety of new enemies, 
 such as an ice demon known as the Frost. They also look great and fit perfectly in with the world 
 that the developers have created over the course of four games. The true spectacle, however, are 
 the bosses, and this is evident from the very first boss fight against the fire demon Berial. His 
 entire body, as well as his sword, is covered in flames, and the effect is very cool. When the 
 flames go out, his back looks like it is covered in burning hot embers, another great effect.
 
  
  The other thing that has always been great about the graphics in Devil May Cry are the enviroments. 
 The enviroments have always been big, beautiful and, yes, gothic. Devil May Cry 4 is no exception, 
 aside from the fact that many of the enviroments are even larger than the previous games, which 
 is truly a noteworthy achievement. The enviroments in this game are beautiful. IT is a sad thing 
 that the game does not have a first person perspective to allow you to get a better look at them. 
 This needs to be changed, and soon. The game has a variety of indoor and outdoor enviroments ranging 
 from the city streets to castles and even labratories, and everything is heavily detailed and fun 
 to explore. The art style of the series holds true in every single part of the game, even when 
 they are very different from one another. That is impressive, if you think about it. It cannot 
 be easy to make a jungle fit well within the DMC world, but they found a way. They even fit in 
 a good and impressive boss fight in the previously mentioned jungle. The enviroments are the highlight 
 of a great looking game.
  
  Sound - 8.5
  
  If you have played Devil May Cry before, then you know exactly what to expect from the sound. You 
 know that this game will have decent voicework for the most part, but it will feature a couple 
 of real groan inducing moments. You also know that the background music is, mostly, going to consist 
 of various industrial metal tracks and that there will be sword slashing sounds. Devil May Cry 
 4 delivers all of this. From the persective of sound, it is exactly what you expect from the series. 
 It is nothing more and nothing less, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The sound in Devil May 
 Cry has always been decent. The swords slashing sounds sound meaty, as they should. The different 
 guns all have different sound, though they have always been a little weak in comparison to something 
 like a good first person shooter. Nothing has changed here, though it doesn't really matter all 
 that much in the first place. The industrial metal is in full force here as well.
  
  The surround sound mix is good, and the stylistic cut scenes definitely put a 5.1 system to good 
 use. They sound great. Hell, even the in game sound put a Dobly Digital system to good use, which 
 is a bit harder to do. It sounds as good as Devil May Cry has ever sounded. IT is crisp and clear, 
 though I do have a bit of a problem with the sound. As I am sure everyone who knows me is aware, 
 I am a metal head. You would think I would be all over the DMC soundtracks, and I loved alot of 
 the music from the first and third game. The music in this one, however, is forgettable to me. 
 There is nothing too special about any of the industrial metal tracks here. You can't exactly expect 
 Strapping Young Lad from a video game, but, after how good the theme from DMC3 was, I did expect 
 better from this one. That's not to say that the music isn't good. The main theme is not a metal 
 song, though it is quite pretty. The metal tracks, however, just aren't memorable like they were 
 in the past. It doesn't quite stack up to the sound in 1 and 3 as a result, despite being more 
 clear and crisp.
  
  Story - 8.0
  
  One thing that Devil May Cry has always been good at is telling a story. While the story has always 
 been relatively simple and, sometimes, predictable, the DMC team at Capcom has a way with story 
 telling that makes even that entertaining. This game opts for a more complex story than the previous 
 games, though the same that held true for the previous games does for this one as well. It is fun 
 to watch the story unfold and how the story is told is half the battle. This one is, most definitely, 
 well told, and that results in it being more than the sum of it's part. Being one hundred percent 
 honest, the story told here is nothing too special. It is a step up from previous games, but that 
 really isn't all that hard. It is fairly easy to predict what will happen in the story, and nothing 
 should come as a shock to anyone that plays it really. That being said, it is told in such a way 
 that it will keep you interested right up to it's finale
  
  Devil May Cry 4 takes place in a castle town known as Fortuna. Within this town, there is a religious 
 cult known as the Order of the Sword that is very secretive in nature. Everyone outside of the 
 cult is kept in the dark as to what is going on within it. They worship the legendary demon knight 
 and father of the main character Sparda. Nero, the primary character for half the game, is a member 
 of this cult. At the begining of the game, he is running through the streets on his way to one 
 of their meetings, the annual Festival of the Sword. Demons have been attacking the city recently, 
 it would seem, and Nero is the one doing the clean up work. He is taking care of the demons while 
 on his way to this meeting. Investigations into the recent appearance of the demons were done, 
 but nothing was found. His girlfriend, Kyrie, is singing when he arrives at the meeting. Shortly 
 after his arrival, Dante drops in and cut down Sanctus, the leader of the cult. Has he turned evil 
 or are things not as they seem? The cult sends Nero out to hunt down Dante and get some answers 
 while various members tend to Sanctus' wounds.
  
  What makes Devil May Cry 4's story cool, and what has made the previous games stories fun as well, 
 are it's cut scenes. You can bet that, if there is a fight cut scene, it will be both well choreographed 
 and fun to watch. That was a sure thing heading into this game for anyone that has played the previous 
 entries in the series, and DMC4 does not slack off or let down in any way in this regard. The fight 
 scenes in this game are great. Ontop of that, the characters are4 fairly interesting, and the cut 
 scenes that don't involve fighting are relatively well directed. You will be sitting and watching 
 cut scenes more than any previous entry in the series, but don't regret. You are not forced to 
 watch excessively long cut scenes in annoying spots where you die alot, such as right before boss 
 fights. The same style that made the previous games cut scenes great is present here, and it works 
 again. They look and sound better than ever, thanks to the power of next gen machines, and it all 
 helps to make the game entertaining, even when you are not playing.
  
  Replay Value - 9
  
  Every DMC fan knows exactly what to expect from the series. Once you beat the game, you unlock 
 a harder difficulty. You can play through it again to try to better your skills and achieve better 
 ranks on the missions, or you can play through it again on another difficulty. You can also collect 
 orbs and proud souls to upgrade your characters further. Furthermore, the Bloody Palace mode from 
 DMC2 and 3 returns here, and you have two characters to choose from when you play it. With the 
 Devil Bringer for Nero and the fighting styles for Dante, the two characters would offer up a slightly 
 differing experience through the Bloody Palace. All of this adds up to plenty of reasons to keep 
 playing after you beat the game once. Ontop of that, both versions of the game offer up some form 
 of achievements. If you are a fan of earning achievement points, then you can try to get as many 
 of them as you can from this game as well as all that is listed above. Devil May Cry 4 definitely 
 has alot of replay value for a game without multiplayer, and other game should learn from this 
 series example.
  
  Final thoughts -
  
  Devil May Cry 4 is a bit tough to review. The game is fun. It definitely does everything that I 
 like about the series, and it does it all very well. The combat is as in depth and as engaging 
 as it ever was. The story is fun to watch and the fight choreography is great, all allowing for 
 an awesome gaming experience. The additions of the Devil Bringer and being able to switch styles 
 on the fly are great, and they help to revamp the gameplay. The problem is that they don't do enough 
 to the gameplay to make it feel like it has made the jump to the next gen. This game feels like 
 Devil May Cry 3 without the extreme difficulty, though the challenge is still there. That part 
 was a bit disappointing to me. I was expecting a bit more of a jump than just the graphics, but 
 that is all the series offered up with it's first next gen game. Furthermore, the game feels a 
 bit repetitive because you go through it as Nero and go through it again, backwards, as Dante. 
 It is not a bad game. Infact, it is a very good game. IT is well worth a pick up if you are a fan 
 of action titles, but don't expect anything new or truly next gen from it. You will be disappointed.

  Everything that is great about Devil May Cry is here, but nothing new to bring it into the next

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is the next installment in the series brought to us by Capcom.
  There are some new things added this time around that returning veterans to the series will find 
 useful. To begin, Nero is a new character that players will have fun getting to know. He has different 
 types of weapons such as his red queen (his sword) the blue rose (his pistol) and the highly regarded 
 demonic arm called the devil bringer which lets you grab enemies and throw them into the air and 
 you can do crazy combos to them while in the air. His weapons can be upgraded with different types 
 of skills and power. The combat in DMC4 is good because it is just more than hack and slash because 
 you can do many different combos which makes the combat deep and rich. Don't worry because players 
 will be able to play as Dante as they progress in the game. The boss fights (including the ones 
 where you fight Dante are a big plus because depending on the difficulty you set it at, you are 
 in for a big challenge. The sound is clear and crisp, and the AI is generally good with many enemies 
 to fight. The addition of a leader board is good because it shows you where you stand and how good 
 of a devil may cry 4 player you really are. The addition of a theater mode is good because as you 
 progress you can get all the cut scenes and watch them as many times as you want and all of them 
 are well done. the camera angle in the game seems to be sightly off because the angles at times 
 seem to be broken. The music while fighting is not very good at can be annoying at times. For some 
 who do not like backtracking can get easily frustrated while playing dmc4 because you could get 
 lost easier than you think. DMC4 does not really show "Next Gen" material however, the features 
 and combat save it and a little old school changes things real well. Many people 
  will say it is only worth a rent, however, the combat and new features are worth the purchase. 
 I recommend DMC4 to all fans, people new to the series, and people who like action/ adventure games.

Review:  At start it's just awesome, you can't get enough of it. That is while you are in charge of Nero 
 actions. But when begins Dante's part it feels kinda dull. = ( First, you are exploring the same 
 locations as Nero was, second... after letting you try Nero, Dante no longer seems to be a cool 
 character anymore. He doesn't suck, he's elaborated as deep as Nero (or almost) , but he lacks that 
 passion for the battle, that fury... Consider me strange. =)
  Thus, I couldn't wait to take control of a Nero-character again... unfortunately it happens near 
 the very end of this pretty short game (I spent ~ 11 hours) . Mixed feelings after all. If not the 
 repetition (GameSpot guys say it right - some Bosses you'll face for 3 or even 4 times) and the 
 weakness of Dante in comparison of Nero I would give this baby solid 9.5 or even 10, it deserves 
 it.
  P. S. Best cut-scenes in history. Even MGS-series can't compete, in my opinion (still wonder about 
 4th installment, though) .
  P. P. S. Nice replay value. FAQs say on the higher levels of difficulties not only enemies become 
 stronger (and you weaker) , but also they obtain new kinds of attacks and they appear in different 
 places and in different amounts.
  P. P. P. S. Devil Bringer ROCKS!

Review:  I have had no prior experience with DMC. I was vaguely aware that it was a gothic series from Capcom, 
 renowned for its stylish combat and some light exploration. So I went into DMC4 completely fresh, 
 and willing to indulge in some joyfully excessive demon-slaying. However, by the end, I was fairly 
 disappointed. 
  
  The game sacrifices substance for style to such a degree that it becomes rather difficult to care 
 about the characters, the story, or even the initially pleasing art-style. Beyond the solid combat 
 system and the great-looking cut-scenes, there's just not enough here to warrant a full-price purchase. 
 Too many of DMC4's parts feel somewhat generic or a bit shallow. 
  
  These problems are highligted by the huge amount of repetition. It's not an overstatement to say 
 that Devil May Cry 4 is one of the most repetitive games in recent history. Not only are you force 
 you to backtrack through nearly all the areas you've already been to in the second half of the 
 game, it also recycles many of its boss fights up to 3 times. These boss encounters are fun the 
 first time around, but by the third time you're forced to fight the same poison-spewing toad, the 
 initial wow-factor well and truly disappears, and fighting becomes a bit of a chore. Which is a 
 problem for a game like DMC4, because the combat is the game's main draw. 
  
  The story is certainly not interesting enough to sustain the gamer's interest by itself, nor to 
 justify the surprising amount of annoying grind inherent in DMC4's gameplay. For example, you're 
 forced to fight a meaningless battle against respawning demons whenever you take a wrong path in 
 some areas, leading to a healthy dose of needless frustration and mind-numbing repetition. The 
 storyline itself falls terribly flat, and is one of the game's biggest flaws. It's so incredibly 
 cliched, predictable, and dull, that it's surprising developers can still get away with such horrible 
 scripts. It's yet another "saving a damsel in distress and the world from a power-hungry old man 
 whose only motivation is that he's eeevil" type of thing we've all seen a million times before. 
 To make things worse, the game never really settles on a tone, seemingly deadly serious in one 
 cut-scene, but knowingly tongue-in-cheek in the next. It's all a bit too... schizophrenic for my 
 tastes. 
  
  Another problem is the game's puzzles, which are very uninspiring in both design and execution. 
 These puzzles are all pretty simple, but they tend to get very frustrating, as it's all too easy 
 to miss an inconspicuous door or an innocuous lever. So you may spend up to half an hour walking 
 around in circles, until you finally realise what the game expects you to do. It's a pity the solution 
 is never as satisfying or as logical as it should be. There are also some light platforming elements, 
 but these feel rather awkward and imprecise. The semi-fixed camera angles that the game employs 
 just aren't suitable for platforming, so it's just as well that jumping from ledge to ledge doesn't 
 take up a large amount of gameplay. 
  
  And yet, despite its flaws, DMC4 is not a bad game. The combat is varied and mostly fun (apart 
 from the afore-mentioned grind element) . The cut-scenes dispay extremely high production values, 
 and even though the story they tell is not captivating in the least, they are nice to look at. 
 The game in general looks rather pretty, with some nicely detailed environments and well-rendered 
 character models. 
  
  There is an impressive range of fighting moves and combos, and the superbly fluid battle animations 
 make fighting very entertaining (in small doses) and a pleasure to behold. And despite the shameless 
 repetition, the boss battles are definite highlights, particularly one near the end, in which you 
 fight a massive stone behemoth across an entire level. Plus, it all runs smoothly, with very few 
 hitches in the framerate, and no pop-in to speak of.
  
  So it's not all bad, but DMC4 is definitely not a great game. Many will enjoy it for its outlandish 
 cut-scenes and stylish fighting, but overall, I found it rather disappointing, and even a bit boring 
 at times.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 was my first experience with the series (yeah, I'm a late comer) , and I must say, 
 that it was an awesome roller coaster ride of a game! Excellent controls, beautiful graphics, rockin' 
 sound, big-bad-ass bosses, and stylish heros. I love being able to upgrade my weapons and abilities 
 between stages; it makes kicking so much ass worthwhile.
  It's true that is repetitive; however, being able to play through the stages again with Dante made 
 it different enough to really keep the repetition from being over bearing (and the damn good graphics 
 of the stages helped) . What knocks a point off for me is the platforming parts. They wouldn't be 
 so bad if THE CAMERA DIDN'T SUDDENLY SWITCH UP. The unstable cam on the jumping areas makes hopping 
 from platform to platform MUCH harder and more frustrating than they should be. Oh well... luckily 
 there are only a couple of those parts (though I was tempted to pull some of Nero and Dante's combos 
 off on my controller!!!) . 
  Anyways, bottom line is.... the game kicks much ass and should be played by all. Peace.

Review:  If you love the Devil May Cry series then this is a buy right off the bat. If your new to the series 
 then at the most you have to at least rent this game. The game has superb graphics and the fighting 
 is very fun and addictive. Game has alot of different difficulties that you unlock as you beat 
 others, with the only two playable right from the start are Human Mode (easy) and Devil Hunter 
 mode (normal) if this is your first time playing Devil May Cry then some stuff during the game 
 may confuse you. One of the things being Dante the devil hunter. He's the main character in the 
 other Devil May Cry games, dont know why they chose a different character for this new installment 
 in the series, Nero, but he works great in the game. His devil bringer arm can and will save you 
 alot throughout the game by grappling enemies to bring them closer to you or to grab a boss to 
 bring bring you closer to the boss. There is also a great variety of enemies that you fight throughout 
 the game that will keep you satisfied. You play as Nero for the first 11 missions, then the game 
 switched to Dante until near the end of the game. The missions you do with Dante are basically 
 the same stuff you did you Nero, just from Dante's perspective. It works out great how they did 
 it. And incase your wondering, there is a mission where you fight each of the bosses right after 
 the other without saving. I dont want to spoil too much of the game for you as im sure by now youve 
 decided to buy or at least rent it. The game is well worth the $59.99 price tag, and should be 
 in any hack and slash fans collection.

Review:  When I heard that was no more Dante I was annoyed because I thought Dante would have nothing to 
 do with this, but looking at the box art I saw Dante and was proved wrong. Nero is an amazing character (not 
 better than Dante) . First of all there is twenty missions most of which are challenging and well 
 put together, but there is like three levels which you see often and really makes you think did 
 they really care about the levels. Some of the missions though are just a boss fight which I have 
 to talk about, there is way to many. Well there is like seven or eight boss'es but you fight them 
 once with Nero then with Dante (who is still a total badass) then again with Nero at the end. But 
 you fight Agnus four times which is incredibly repetitaive. It's also tough to switch from Nero 
 to Dante in mission 12. The controls are great and very sharp. The graphics are a masterpiece too. There 
 is no multiplayer which isn't a shocker and I dont take off for no multiplayer. The moves are really 
 good and worth the work to get the orbs. One hint if you are fighting Credo, he is very hard, so before 
 you fight him get holy water it then becomes much easier. The achievements are really tough to get, through 
 one play through on human mode I got eighty points. The ending leaves you guessing will there be 
 another and will you be Nero or Dante? We will have to wait and see. This isn't better than the first 
 and easily better than the second the third was great but this one is better. This is suprisingly 
 a rent because there is no replay value unless you want to spend months trying to get the achievement 
 points. By the way G-spot didn't mention the humor in this game, sorry just had to mention that.
 
  
  Real score:8.3

Review:  over the years devil may cry has changed. it started off being very slick and slender. but as with 
 most good games squeals arrive with a rubbish new character that no one likes or remembers i. e 
 the girl in number 2. but then when number 3 popped it head up everyone thought "this game is sooo 
 good. i might infact die im too amused" straight away i was there must be a fourth and bang a quick 
 nothing to do with it trailer was showned. the hype was in me, i must get this game and for along 
 time i was dishearened that it was only on the ps3 but then bill gates opened his wallet and there 
 it was on the 360. so with a preorder and lots of course work too o i waited and waited and then 
 it came. as soon as i got it i turned up the pendulum, turned down the lights and on with the hd 
 tv. i was taken away, the graphics were so smooth and and slick. the reds and blues glowed at me 
 like a lightbulb trapped in a burning microwave. then there was the new character he wasnt just 
 liek danta, he was him in so many way but the demon arm jus tmade him great. but luckly danta showed 
 his head and i got to show the new kid how its done. after i finished the game i loved it althought 
 redoing it was still fun the little bits capcom seem to thing are fun more than once were annoying. 
 most of all the stupid ass dice game. and the re use of boss's but over all i love it and am still 
 playing it now and again for the achivement (who doesnt) . if anyone owns a 360 and thinks to themself. 
 "hey i really wanna kill sumthing in a very stylish and unrealistic way" then by jolly this game 
 is made for you.

Review:  For months I had been excited out of my mind for Devil May Cry 4 to be released. When it finally 
 was and I beat it I knew it was a fun game and that it was all around very good, but I couldn't 
 help but shake the slightly bitter taste it left. Devil May Cry 4 does what the other titles in 
 the series have done right and amps it up. The combat is very similar to the third installment 
 (on both Nero and Dante's parts) with flashier moves and with an easier method of purchase. Dante 
 plays almost exactly as he did in DMC3 with a few new bells and whistles such as the fact he can 
 change styles on the fly using the D-Pad. This takes a little getting used to, but nonetheless 
 comes in real handy in execution and makes it possible to pull off even crazier combos. Nero on 
 the other hand plays similar to Dante in terms of his sword, but differently on other fronts. For 
 one, his single gun (The Blue Rose) is unfortunately weaker than Dante's trademark Ebony and Ivory. 
 However, this isn't much of a problem since you won't be using it much. The real kicker to Nero's' 
 arsenal is the Devil Bringer, the single demonic arm that Nero possesses. With the Devil Bringer 
 Nero can pull off some really cool special moves against enemies and bosses. (The latter having 
 a lot in common with Resident Evil 4 or Kingdom Hearts 2's reaction commands) Both character's 
 control fine combat wise, but once you take control of Dante you may miss the advantages the Devil 
 Bringer gave. The graphics look gorgeous on the 360 and the voice acting and production values 
 are top-notch as always. The music is typical Devil May Cry fare, haunting music for walking around, 
 and ridiculous butt rock metal for going head to head with the minions of Hell. While the combat 
 music is not my favorite kind of music, it does fit the game well. Oh, and I don't care what anyone 
 says. The slow version of "Shall Never Surrender" during the credits, corny as it is, is awesome.
 
  
  So with this all in mind, why is Devil May Cry 4 a disappointment? Simple. The level set-up and 
 story. While this doesn't affect gameplay per se, it is a bit of a butt headed decision on Capcom's 
 part to the point where you have to wonder, "what WERE they thinking?" Basically, you start off 
 the game as Nero and the story progresses reasonably well. Then, through a series of events the 
 game has you take control of Dante. Here's where things start to go awry. As Dante you progress 
 through all of Nero's levels backwards with little or no changes to how the level appears. (Such 
 as the addition of rain in one area) Not to mention you fight three of the same bosses with Dante. 
 To its credit, DMC4 delivers probably the best boss battles in the series yet. I can understand 
 Capcom may have wanted it so you could fight these bosses as Dante and experience the levels with 
 a new character, but since it makes little difference gameplay wise, it feels cheap. Had Capcom 
 simply given Dante a new path and new bosses, DMC4 could have easily been contender for game of 
 the year. It's a nitpick, but it effects the overall atmosphere of the game. Not to mention, the 
 story never reaches a real climax and feels like a bit of a letdown after it's buildup in the beginning. 
 I'll leave it at, many questions that are dying to be answered in this installment, are simply 
 never brought about. 
  
  With that said, it's really up to the player how they want to interpret Devil May Cry 4. The combat 
 is just as fun and stylish as it was in 3 and it's most definitely worthy of carrying the Devil 
 May Cry name. But is it the best in the franchise to date? Honestly, I went back to Devil May Cry 
 3 and enjoyed it more for it's more fleshed out experience that I felt 4 was missing. DMC4 is a 
 good game not doubt and not nearly the disappointment Devil May Cry 2 was, but keep in mind it 
 may not live up to the expectations that were put out for it.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4, what can I say that hasn't already been said... its a Devil May Cry game you know 
 its gonna be good. I'm a huge fan of the Devil May Cry series and if I hadn't won my Xbox 360 I 
 would have bought it just so I could play this addtion to the series. I was a little upset at first 
 when I saw that Dante wasn't the main character that it was some new kid that looked like him named 
 Nero. I almost wasn't going to play it for that fact alone but then I sucked it up and would have 
 been horribly upset if I hadn't. The game play is top notch like the pervious games each time adding 
 something new. The story is very well and fits perfectly in the DMC world. It seems to talk place 
 a few years after the 3rd since Dante has aged and is a little bit more mature, little bit mind 
 you. But the graphics, controlls, story, and game play are all top of their game. If you're looking 
 for a good action game with some plateforming this is your game! And the beauty of it is you don't 
 have to have played the previous 3 to understand whats going on.

Review:  Devil May cry 4 is an awesome game. It has awesome graphics, those cut scenes look sweet as hell. 
 Awesome game play, almost the same as the other DMC. Our new Hero, Nero, is not a disappointment 
 or a bad thing for the game, it makes the game more fun, he can almost match up to Dante. The new 
 technique, Devil Bringer, is really fun, and lets you do superb combos in the air and in the ground. 
 But as always, you feel like playing as Dante again, and that won't be a disappointment either. 
 With a full new arsenal of weapons and new techniques, including the ability to change stances 
 while fighting, make him funner to play than before. But even as fun as Dante is, you feel like 
 something is missing, and that is the devil bringer, but to me, Dante is still better than Nero. 
 The only disappointment is all the backtracking in the game. The first 11 levels you play as Nero, 
 then you play the next 7 levels as Dante, but those levels are the same as the ones you play as 
 Nero, with even the same bosses. And then you play the last two levels as Nero, but in one of the 
 last two levels you have to defeat all the bosses again. Still, it feels like a completely different 
 game since you play as Dante and get new weapons like Lucifer, Pandora's Box, and Gilgamesh. There 
 are many difficulties for the game if you are looking for a challenge. And for those who want a 
 challenge after they beat the game, there is the Bloody Palace, 99 floors of different enemies 
 configuration. DMC 4 is a must play for not only DMC fans, but everyone that likes Hack-and-Slash 
 games.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is the successor to the massively popular DMC 3, which was in every way a superb 
 action game. So it's fair to say that Capcom has a lot to live up to with this one, and in places 
 they succeed, but in others they fall on their collective asses. In other words, if you thought 
 that the series would be at its best on the new generation of consoles, you will be disappointed. 
 If, however, you just need a good fix of DMC's unique brand of stylish combat with pretty graphics, 
 you will be satisfied by this chapter of the series.
  As soon as the game begins, it is clear that the developers have not lost their ability to create 
 slick, entertaining cutscenes. The story is kicked off by the assassination of the leader of the 
 'Holy Order' (a cult that worships Sparda, the demon who fathered Vegil and Dante) by Dante. A 
 swarm of bodyguards are then cut down in the ensuing fight, and it is up to Nero, another platinum-blonde 
 wisecracking dude with demonic power. This is your character, which is where the game's first major 
 disappointment lies. 
  Devil May Cry has been awesome since it started, and in part thanks to its terrific main character, 
 Dante. By the end of DMC 3, Dante had 5 melee weapons, 5 guns, and 4 fighting styles, which made 
 him basically the ulimate demon-killing machine. Now we get Nero, who is likeable enough, and has 
 a cool glowing demon arm, but comes off as a Dante Jr. who is whipped by his boring girlfriend. 
 No adequate explanation for his demonic power is given - presumably he is a cousin or some stupid 
 thing. Nero is OK, but no Dante. 
  Playing as Nero offers a different combat experiene than playing as Dante. He only has one gun, 
 a double-barrelled revolver called the Blue Rose, and the Red Queen, a sweet sword with a motorcycle 
 handle attached capable of charging up the blade. The charging mechanism allows for special supercharged 
 versions of Nero's various negular moves, and is quite useful when used properly. The Blue Rose 
 has a charge shot with 3 levels, and while it takes while to charge all the way, it packs quite 
 a punch if you do. Nero also has a Devil Trigger, and a few moves unique to his DT mode, which 
 is nice since Dante just becomes faster and stronger in DT. While there is a decent amount of depth 
 to his combat scheme, playing as Nero just isn't as fun as using the tried-and-true antihero. 
 
  Fans of the series will be relieved to know that Dante has not been completely left out, as you 
 take control of him midway through the game, but only 7 of 20 levels are played with him. It's 
 a shame, too, because on this outing Dante's combat has been perfected. While in DMC 3 you were 
 forced to select one of his four fighting styles at the beginning of each stage and stick with 
 it, this time around you can switch on the fly using the D-pad. There is nothing quite like performing 
 a vicious combo in Swordmaster, switching to Gunslinger for a finishing blast, and then using Trickster 
 to escape. Royal Guard is still around too, but as before, it is an acquired taste. A fifth style 
 has been added: Dark Slayer. Dante uses Yamato (the katana Vergil had in DMC 3) in this style, 
 and it can be deadly if used properly. 
  Dante's arsenal has been cut down from 5 to 3 of each Devil Arm and firearm. However, since you 
 can equip all 3 at once and cycle through them, you have more options at any given time. In addition 
 to Rebellion, his trusty sword, Dante can use Giglamesh, which is similar to Beowulf in that it 
 is best used on one strong, slow enemy rather than a group. Another melee weapon, Lucifer, materializes 
 magical swords and really isn't all that great. It's a decent selection of weapons, but I do miss 
 Nevan. The pistols Ebony & Ivory as well as the shotgun return in DMC 4, and the newcomer is Pandora's 
 box, a truly excellent weapon that takes on a different form for each attack, from a boomerang 
 to a hovering missile battery.
  There are so many combinations of attacks and techniques to use with Dante it is positively dizzying, 
 which leaves the player wondering why the whole game wasn't played through as him. He is more fun 
 to use and more varied than Nero, whose addition was completely unnecessary. This is a big disappointment 
 and the fifth game in the series had better be a Dante-only adventure. 
  The greatest failure of the game, however, is not its adolescent character: it is its atrocious 
 level design. The amount of repetition present is staggering, and makes the Halo games look like 
 an exercise in original level layout. The normal irritations for this genre are of course all there: 
 fixed camera, invisible walls, linear paths, and the forced confinement of battles by magical barriers. 
 This I can deal with. Puzzles in this devil-hunting outing are extremely sparse and seem thrown 
 in as a lazy afterthought, and the platforming bits are simply clumsy. This I can also live with. 
 What I take issue with is seeing the same place not once, not twice, but three different times. 
 The levels themselves are repetetive, often involving searching for some power-giving artifact 
 and then returning to an obstacle near the beginning of the mission. Worse, the game's content 
 is half what it would appear to be, since after the transition from Nero to Dante, you are forced 
 to play Nero's entire journey in reverse order, As Dante, you will also fight the same bosses, 
 and their attack patterns aren't even altered to alleviate the repetition. Adding insult to injury, 
 the penultimate stage has you fighting all the bosses in succession a third time. 
  Considering that the game is designed to be played over and over again (there are 6 different difficulty 
 levels, ranging from the breezy and easy to the absurdly sadistic) , this is a huge failure on the 
 part of the developers. 
  Terrible level design notwithstanding, there is a lot to keep you busy in DMC 4. Perfecting the 
 stylish brand of combat the game has to offer is great fun no matter what the background, and between 
 the returning Bloody Palace challenge mode, Devil Hunter rankings, and secret missions, this game 
 will keep fans slashing away for many hours.
  An unexpected stumble after the majestic leap that was its predecessor, Devil May Cry 4 nevertheless 
 has retained enough of the core demon slaying experience to be worth checking out.

Review:  Fans of the Devil May Cry franchise will feel right at home with this one, with a interesting twist. 
 Instead of playing as Dante you are a new character to the series, Nero. Players will feel right 
 at home when Dante does become playable as the fighting styles of Dante make a return. Excellent 
 storyline with plenty of twists and surprising turns to keep you guessing until all the pieces 
 fall into place at the very end. Great graphics and gameplay with challenging enemies and puzzles 
 to keep interest going. Replay value is also a good part of this game due to the fact that you 
 can play through many difficulty levels and earn achievements as you go. Combine all of these things 
 and Capcom has once again brought a very solid Devil May Cry to the series. I strongly reccomend 
 that any true fan at least give this one a rent.

Review:  awesomely fun game with sweet cut scenes, like playing an awesome movie. its got me hooked, a much 
 better version than most the others, no devil may cry 1 but still, kind of repetitious but it works 
 out. cant find a flashier or more cinematic game out there than this one for sure. i loved the visuals 
 and everything about the game, the fighting i really well done although somewhat the same thing 
 over and over, everything else makes up for that perfectly. Nero is a good addition to the game as 
 well even though hes just like a mini Dante whos really cocky, reminds me a lot of MGS. This game 
 totally just blew me away. it may get repetitious like i am right now but the cut scenes and just 
 the whole style of the gameplay just keeps you drawed in, sure its hard at times but that makes 
 it all the funner. Ya diggg?

Review:  Devil May Cry is automatically one of my best gaming series of all time, thanks to great graphics, 
 addictive gameplay and a storyline to keep you on edge. Devil May Cry 4 is the latest in this series 
 and it keeps the same idea of the previous games, unlike some (*cough*Halo 3*/cough*) . The game 
 is aesthetically pleasing with amazing effects and detailed character models and stages. The story 
 is based around Nero, who seeks revenge for His Holiness, a prophet who is murdered by an assassin 
 during a speaking. However, while searching, he makes a discovery of His Holiness' true intentions: 
 to take over the world. After a second meeting with the assassin, who is revealed to be Dante, 
 Nero changes his ambitions, and works to defeat His Holiness, and rescue Kyrie, his love. Although 
 the game is only 20 missions long, the missions take around 15-20 minutes to complete, and filled 
 to the last second with amazing action and mind-bending puzzles, making a total of around 6 and 
 a half hours per full play through. Add Devil Hunter, Son of Sparda, Heaven or Hell, Dante Must 
 Die and Hell and Hell difficulty modes, and a Bloody Palace minigame, gives you about 45 hours 
 of pure awesomeness. This game caught my eye in my local game store, and I can't put it down, and 
 chances are, neither will you. 9/10.

Review:  From the extendible arm to the crazy sword combos, Devil May Cry 4 is continuing in its predecessors 
 footsteps with fast-paced, "no way he could do that" gameplay. The main protagonist this time around 
 is Nero, but do not fret because although you will be playing as Nero for a majority of the game, 
 Dante also makes an appearence as a playable character for nine missions and in the unlockable 
 Bloody Palace. I have to admit though, I was shocked when in the very first mission you face off 
 against Dante complete with Rebellion and Ebony & Ivory. 
  For $60.00 you may want to either buy second hand or off a internet sight for a discount. However, 
 with the Limited Edition of the game only for ten bucks more ($70.00) , you may actually want to 
 bust out some cash. The Limited Edition comes in a metal box, complete with an assortment of DMC 
 goodies. 
  Although completely up to you, any fan of the series should pick up this game just to give it a 
 go-around. Once you master the sick combos in mid-air and beyond even the devil may cry.

Review:  
  PROS
  
  Combat - The combat is pretty fun without any upgrades, but the real fun comes when you buy new 
 skills and try them out on helpless monsters. Also, the boss fights pit you against giant demons 
 with their own distinctive look. In these game, you are a new character, Nero, who has a demonic 
 arm that allows him to hurl and crush demons with ease. So, as you can imagine, the boss battles 
 tend to be awesome.
  
  Graphics - The graphics in this game are smooth and beautiful and the frame-rate never freezes. 
 even when displaying the most epic of pictures. 
  
  Story - The story in DMC4 is told through beautiful cut-scenes. The story starts slow and a bit 
 confusing but as you go on it sucks you in and gets a little emotional. The cut-scene fights are 
 breath-taking and belong in the movies. 
  
  CONS
  
  Repetition - The only REAL downside to this game is that you have to go back the exact same way 
 you came the second half of the game. But even this backtracking isn't boring, because you play 
 as a different character the second half, and this character is none other than Dante. (Other than 
 telling you that he has different attacks than Nero, more than one style, and more than one weapon, 
 I won't say anything.)
  
  Pace-chopping Puzzles - I won't go into detail with this, but I will say that there are a few puzzles 
 that can leave you stuck and that slow down the game majorly. But once you are out of these parts 
 you are happy.

Review:  I went to the game store to get Condemned: Bloodshot, but they ran out so I ended up bringing DMC4 
 home. And I was very pleasently surprised how good this game actually is.
  
  First of all, the thing worth pointing out is that this game is way easier than DMC3. If you are 
 familiar with the previous game and the control/combo system you may want to start playing on the 
 Devil Hunter diffuculty level. If you played DMC3 the Human level will simply be too easy for you. 
 I played through the game on Human level and didn't die once, even the boss fights were not a problem 
 whatsoever. So just to have a better experience, if you know how to control the game already, don't 
 bother going through the Human difficulty. And another thing worth mentioning is that the puzzles 
 here are much easier and not so frustrating, although you probably will have to do a lot of running.
 
  
  The combat system has been improved and it's no longer so confusing and demanding as it was in 
 DMC3, which is good, because you can now actually focus on how things look like and what you're 
 doing on the screen rather than on how not to break your fingers while playing. 
  There are moments in this game, during the cutscenes, when you're just go "damn!". Yes, it; gets 
 really really cool. Surprisingly cool to be honest. If you remember all the badass stuff that Dante 
 was doing in the previous game... well, let me just say this, multiply it by 10 and and HD quality. 
 Rawr. 
  
  The thing I want to point out in this review is this: it's an insanely good looking game. Even 
 if the story was about wrestling amputee midgets, even if the gameplay sucked beyond comprehention, 
 even if it costed twice as much as it does this game would still be worth buying JUST to see the 
 cutscenes. They're nothing short of amazing. I will say it again, this game is worth playing just 
 to see the cutscenes. They really know how to pull off a very impressing show. 
  
  So if you can't decide whether you want this game or not, just think of it as a really top of the 
 line fantasy action movie. You'll be at the edge of your seat.

Review:  Now let me start by saying I haven't finished DMC IV. I just couldn't bring myself to progress 
 with the game after reaching a certain point. It's not to say that DMC IV is extremely bad, or 
 an awful game it isn't, it's simply very mediocre and essentially the same game Capcom have released 
 every other time.
  
  Speaking of Capcom, lets picture the scene at Capcom HQ when development for this title is just 
 beginning. 
  "You know, we really need a new hero for this title, Dante has been around for a few games now 
 and we need someone else to capture the gamers attention" says one guy. 
  "But, but.." pipes up another "what about the huge fanbase, they LOVE Dante how are we going to 
 keep the screaming fanboys/girls at bay?". 
  "Well.." says the original speaker "I've got this really cool idea.. how about we introduce a new 
 character.. BUT keep him almost exactly the same as Dante in every way except.." *he pauses for 
 effect* "we make him... younger and with even more irritating one liners". 
  "You sir are a God among game developers" say the others. 
  O. K it may not have happened quite 
 like that and the conversation would have been in Japanese but you get my point..
  
  Moving back to the review, DMC IV is certainly a good looking game. It's smooth, it's fast, it's 
 fluid and very visually competent. Dante and Nero look fantastic both in and out of cutscenes and 
 each blow and attack no matter how extravagant is animated beautifully. Unfortunately while a great 
 focus has been placed on the epic style of the attacks and just how close they can make the camera 
 get to moving inside Gloria's clothes in cutscenes I feel the gameplay has been neglected.
  
  This is essentially the same game that was released on the PS2 all those years ago except for 
 a few new attacks, some shinier graphics and even more bucketloads of cheesy dialogue. The newest 
 addition to the DMC arsenal is Nero's grappling hook like arm. It lets him climb walls with ease, 
 pull himself up onto bosses heads for some mid air attacks and pull weaker enemies to their knees 
 in order to give them a swift blow to the skull. There are a myriad of skills and combos to unlock 
 in the game too all of which look newer and shinier than the last one, but essentially do the same 
 thing:- kill enemies. Each section of the game is a repetitive hammering of the combat button and 
 watching the various animations of Nero and Dante handing out death. Granted some of these are 
 mildly entertaining, watching Nero repeatedly thrust his lance into knights is hilariously homoerotic. 
 
  
  The game does attempt to add some variety, with puzzles, platforming and various other bits and 
 bobs making an appearence. Unfortunately platforming in fixed camera games is never a good idea 
 and lets be fair only three companies have ever got platforming right and they are Nintendo, Naughty 
 Dog and Eidos. The puzzles are fairly dull and irritating too and seemed to be just an attempt 
 by Capcom to add to the games length. Timed jumping puzzles are bad, puzzles involving dice are 
 bad (AS DICE WORK BY CHANCE YOU IDIOTS) and I can't believe these things still exsist in gaming 
 outside of Nintendo games.
  
  One thing the game did right was the boss fights, all the ones I played (and watched my other half 
 play) were appropriately adrenaline thumping and had me shouting at the screen in excitement. Come 
 to think of it if the game was just a series of boss fights, dropped the new character and all 
 dialogue I might have seen it through to the end.
  
  In short, DMC IV is a game for fans only. It's simple, it's shallow and behind all the visual fluff 
 and story is essentially the first game all over again. That said if you love DMC this probably 
 isn't a problem, unfortunately I don't.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4
  
  Since its inception on the PS2, the Devil May Cry series has been on the forefront of action gaming 
 in the new generation. Intertwining solid multi-layered action, with spectacular graphics and a 
 sense of style, DMC was and still is the greatest action-adventure series available.
  It should be no surprise then that after the utterly awesome Dante's Awakening on the PS2, Devil 
 May Cry 4 lives up to and exceeds in many ways its predecessor.
  Shipping on both the 360 and the PS3 DMC4 both looks and plays fantastically.
  Introducing the 
 new and rather cool Nero, DMC4 kicks off with a beautiful opening cut scene seamlessly worked together 
 with a tutorial. Is if that was not enough there is quite frankly one of THE best action face-offs 
 between Nero and Dante that would make even Michael Manns mouth water.
  The story is, like its fore-fathers, rather convoluted, and all that really matters is the action 
 and the look 'n feel of DMC4, the story is not its strongest point, but strong enough as not to 
 put you off.
  DMC4 trots along nicely, forgoing the extremely unforgiving difficulty of DMC3, but manages to 
 stay hard enough that you will find the game a challenge from the offset. Even the first boss will 
 pose a problem, and that should be all fair and well seeing as you are going to face every boss 
 THREE times throughout your adventure.
  Personally, I think this is a bit much, but with both Nero and Dante's own personal retinue of 
 moves and style, you have plenty to work with.
  Nero is a simpler character to play with, but not necessarily easier. He relies very heavily on 
 his Devil Arm which has two primary attacks. The Grim Grip which pulls foes in, and Buster which 
 performs enemy/boss specific moves that are devastating and really cool to watch. To spice things 
 up, he also has an Exceed move which involved you pulling the right trigger just as Nero attacks 
 to give a large boost to your attacks strength, Nero is about sheer power. His Blue Rose double-barrelled 
 pistol is a treat!
  Dante is as always flashy, quick and stylish. Eschewing brute force for a much more florid stance. 
 He has the four styles he was granted in DMC3 here, but this time at the push of a button he can 
 switch between all four MID-battle at any time, this also goes for his luscious array of over the 
 top weapons - Pandora especially.
  This ability to change weapons and styles so freely is the balance point to Nero's focused devotion 
 to his two weapons.
  The fighting mechanic is much the same as all the DMC games, but its how you interact with your 
 character that will decide just how a deep combat experience you will get. Rest assured both the 
 game play and the graphics moulded together are of the highest quality.
  The graphics are breath taking, its just a shame that despite how large the DMC4 world feels, you 
 only get to see it a fixed area as you are forced back over it all as Dante after fighting your 
 way to the end as Nero. Do not let that put you off, as the game play alone is enough to compensate 
 for this.
  Musically DMC4 is nothing to write home about, the usual rock and metal tracks are played frequently 
 to juice up your fighting, and occasionally there is some more touching musical scores played, 
 but not very often.
  The voice acting is top notch, and always manages to stay on the right side of cheesy, even when 
 Dante decides to tangodon't cringe, just watch and laugh.
  The sheer amount of replay value is astounding as there are two modes to start with, normal and 
 Devil Hunter, the latter being for experienced players. Once you finish these it will unlock various 
 other modes, like Bloody Palace or Dante Must Die modes, providing you with more of a chance to 
 perfect your skills, and get up on an online leader board, or just crack open those achievement 
 points. There is plenty to see and do.
  
  Considering the lapse of DMC2, DMC4 does a wonderful job of keeping the series fresh and exciting, 
 and gives plenty of ground to work on for future titles, for any action junky this game is an absolute 
 must.

Review:  This game is one of the best in its series. The camera is done the same as it was done in the first 
 one and Dante is still a character in the game. I like how the game starts out, i feel that the 
 introduction to the game was well worth the 20 min haha. The cutscenes were utterly amazing, and 
 the story is just as good as the first three. The game does have its flaws, i didnt like the fact 
 that this is the first devil may cry where Dante is not the first character you see... or play. 
 You start the game out as Nero, which is cool because its nice to have something different, but 
 it sucks cause as i was playing the only thing i wanted to do was play Dante, and my wish eventually 
 came true. You do eventually play as Dante, but Nero is the first. The graphics of this game are 
 over the top, and rather amazing, i love the different bosses, each with their own unique look, 
 and abilities, that are eventually obtained by the player. If i had to reccomend this game to be 
 bought, then i say do it, cause you will enjoy it and you will love it, but i would only reccommend 
 you buy if you have played the first 3, if not, then rent it first.

Review:  This game is just one of those games that just astonishes me every time i play it, even when its 
 the second time through you will never forget the certain cut scenes that actually make a tear 
 come to my eye.
  
  This game is one of the most under rated games of the 07/08 era you may say. people expected Halo 
 3 to come through and it did, people expected call of duty 4 to become just another war game and 
 it didn't, it became game of the year! now if everyone played this game the same amount of times 
 the played the other two it would be well remembered. my university has out of all the students 
 a small 20 students actually play it and enjoy playing it, and an incredible 8 people post in the 
 DMC union.
  
  So all-in-all if you haven't played this game or brought it, please do because you want regret 
 it!

Review:  You surely must have gotten this game already if you have an Xbox 360. I already finished the story 
 4 times and almost done for the 5th time. It will never bore and there is enough to do!
  
  When you're done with the story, try the bloody palace too if you unlocked it. It's 101 levels 
 with bosses every 20 stages. You even have to kill 44 angelo bianco's with 2 angelo alto's that 
 can use devil trigger in 1 level. Think you got what it takes to beat all of the bloody palace. 
 Oh, i forgot to say it: You can't use items and the only way for health is hoping on health drops 
 or using your devil trigger.
  
  If you managed to finish the story on Dante Must Die and Hell or Hell mode (great job if you did) , 
 then you should have a go for the achievements. Think you got to get an S-ranking on every level, 
 every difficulty? Yeah, it keeps you busy for a while.
  
  Surely a must have, but it has some things too that are less good. Like the bosses. They are sure 
 fun like hell, but you have to kill most of the bosses 3 times per story... maybe not enough inspiration?
 
  
  But you should get the game, it's good as hell and you won't regret it.
  Now go make the devil cry!

Review:  First of all I want to note that I didn't play all the way through yet, so this is based on my 
 first 5 missions.
  
  I haven't played another devil may cry game, but I've always wanted to.
  
  The moment you put 
 the disc in your 360 you'll get blown away by a very cool intro. It's not just the visuals, it's 
 also the sound, choreography, editing and all that things combined make the intro (and the rest 
 of the cut-scenes) oh so good.
  
  When I first came to the menu and the loading screen I was a little disappointed. The design is 
 not that good, I just think it looks cheap and dated.
  
  Another thing that looks cheap and dated (already) are the ingame visuals. You know, they are good, 
 maybe even beautiful, but COME ON, is this NEXT-GEN? Don't think so. But don't get me wrong, it 
 does look really good (enviroments are gorgeous) . This could be because the cut-scenes are even 
 better. In the forest levels there seems to be something wrong with the shadows though.
  
  Ok, but now from the beginning.
  
  First you get to choose the difficulty setting. You have 
 2 options, 1 for newcomers to the series and 2 for "those who've played and lived to tell the tale" 
 or something like that. I chose the second, I didn't play the previous games, but I wanted a challenge. 
 You play as Nero, a guy, who possesses a demonic arm. How original... it reminds me bit of Soul 
 Reaver... oh lord, make us a next-gen Soul Reaver.... Later in the game you get to play as Dante 
 (so I've heard) , can't wait. About the characters I think Nero is really cool, but the developers 
 didn't really change the main character. So it is a different character, but it has almost the 
 same hair and clothes (though I think Nero looks really cool) .
  
  The game starts with a cool intro, it is a bit long, until the point you can't wait to get to play 
 the game, but you don't want to miss anything.
  After this you get to face Dante, the main character from the previous games. This is a tutorial 
 fight, so you can't die. After a few blows you get a cutscene, than you can fight him again, another 
 cutscene, fight, cutscene, fight, cutscene COME ON! Let me just play the freaking game already! 
 Sorry... although the cutscenes are beautiful I think it could have been either more combat or 
 less cutscene. It really spoils the fun of kicking the hell out of Dante. The first missions I 
 was like "well, if this is the highest difficulty I am either really really good, or this game 
 is easy as... 'hell' ", but further in the game I'm getting really frustrated by those damn demons 
 who keep killing me and send me back to the beginning of the checkpoint. And there aren't that 
 much checkpoints (damn you capcom!) .
  
  There are also big boss fights, which are fun, but don't give a feeling like: "I'm fighting a big 
 monster". It's more like: "let's get this over with", without feeling thrilled because the guy 
 is like ten times bigger.
  
  The battles are really fun, although they are repative (I don't like repative games, but this seems 
 to be an exception) .
  
  Than there is this camera angle, when walking from one point to another it's
  really not that 
 cool. You get some weird camera angles and you just walk to your next battle. Sometimes there's 
 a puzzle which are relatively easy. And sometimes you'll even get lost (I did) .
  
  There is, however, a way to customize your character's abilities, like moves for your gun, sword 
 and demonic arm (Death Bringer) .
  They do cost a lot of "proud souls", which you'll collect during the game.
  
  You can also 
 buy health stars and other stuff to recover your health, magic and everything. You buy these with 
 red orbs you collect by killing enemies and smashing barrels, tables, chairs etc.
  
  I think the game is just plain old fun, like games used to be (remember streets of rage?) . But 
 somewhere it feels like the game misses some opportunities to be original and "next-gen". It almost 
 feels like a stripped down version (like games on the PSP) . But I do not know how much missions 
 I still have to do and how much time I will spend playing through this game.
  
  So, the short version:
  
  The game's cutscenes are beautiful, but the in-game visuals do not 
 feel like its a next-gen game (though they are really good as well) . It is like they could have 
 done the same thing an a PS2 or X-Box. The bosses are cool, but not as thrilling as the ones in 
 let's say God of War and the camera is a bit... annoying to look at. You also don't want to die, 
 because it will send you back to a checkpoint, which aren't there a lot. Also I think they should 
 have made an option to save the game wherever you like, so you can just pick it up and play from 
 where you left of. Still I think this game is really good, it doesn't try to do anything special 
 and that's it's power and handicap.

Review:  I have been through all four games in this series and I must say that this game was better than 
 I expected. I felt like the graphics were very good and the introduction of Nero actually added 
 to the gameplay and story. Capcom is finally getting closer to what they had in the original DMC.
 
  
  I felt like the first game was awesome and couldn't wait to see what the sequels would offer. Then 
 came along DMC 2 which is the worst in the series. The game could be beaten in one day with both 
 characters and the graphics were worse. So Capcom took alot of flack and tried to make DMC 3 more 
 like the original. Well they did to a certain extent. The graphics were great and it was a longer 
 more indepth game. The one thing wrong with it was it was nearly impossible without having to go 
 back and play the same stages over and over to power up enough to proceed. Also Dante just kept 
 getting cheesier and cheesier with his lines. 
  
  That now leads us up to the latest installment. I felt like I had to give a little backstory since 
 this series is so inconsistent. Well this game finally gets back to where it is really fun to play. 
 The balance is finally back to what the original was able to produce. It also introduces a new 
 character that gives the DMC series a more engaging story. I felt more with Nero and his life than 
 I have ever felt with Dante. He actually was a little more fun to use with his Devil Bringer ability 
 which is attached to his arm. You play more than half the game with Nero and I almost felt like 
 Dante just made a guest appearance since when you play with Dante you are playing stages you have 
 already played in reverse.
  
  DMC 4 isn't without its faults. The game can be finished rather quickly (around 10 hours) . Also 
 Dante's levels are the same as Nero's which makes his part feel like filler. Although there is 
 reasons to play through it again. The camera still gets in the way at times and can lead to some 
 cheap hits by your enemies. The secret missions are super frustrating and you will get a feeling 
 of series de ja vu.
  
  Overall this is a wonderful action game with plenty of wow moments from the massive boss fights 
 to the beautiful cut scenes. This is worth a buy if you really love the series but a great rental 
 for action gaming fans.

Review:  It seems like just yesterday that the originalDevil May Cryappeared on store shelves and captured 
 the attention of many PS2 owners. Demon hunter Dante's first adventure was arguably one of the 
 best action games for the system, introducing a great beat-em-up engine with plenty of over-the-top 
 boss battles and a bottomless reserve of style. Perhaps it was the original success of the first 
 game that madeDevil May Cry 2 a disappointment. Fans were let down by the second, but they didn't 
 need to worry. Devil May Cry 3 was Dante's comeback game. The game introduced Styles, variety-filled 
 move-sets that gave players many different ways to approach a battle. But today, Dante's fourth 
 adventure isn't a PS2 exclusive. The Xbox 360 and the PS3 get a beautiful newDevil May Crygame 
 featuring Dante andsome guy named Nero. Yes, there's a new character to play as. Does Dante's 
 newest adventure and Nero's debut continue to make the series great?
  
  Devil May Cry 4 begins with the story of an odd Dante look-alike named Nero who has been "cursed" 
 with a demonic arm called the Devil Bringer. Nero, along with his love interest Kyrie and her brother 
 Credo are part of a sacred Order who worships the demonic hero Sparda. During the Sabbath, son 
 of Sparda Dante shows up and makes a mess of the place. Nero begins his journey to bring Dante 
 to justice only to get himself wrapped in a conspiracy beyond the Order's original goal. Dante 
 and some other familiar characters make appearances throughout Nero's narrative and there are plenty 
 of twists to keep the player interested. Don't expect Final Fantasy quality storytelling, but you'll 
 find yourself paying attention to the storyline, at least to get to the next battle.
  
  Controlling the characters is generally like past games in the series. Run with the left thumbstick, 
 jump with A, shoot with X, melee attack with Y. New to the series is Nero's special attack using 
 the Devil Bringer. Pressing B lets Nero unleash an enemy-specific attack. Want to take out that 
 lance-wielding enemy? Why not steal the lance and attack him with it? The Devil Bringer can also 
 be used to grab enemies from a distance and can even be used as a grappling hook for specific areas. 
 Playing as Dante, however, is mindfully reminiscent ofDevil May Cry 3. The multiple styles return 
 with their expected movesets, and they can now be switch off on the fly with a tap of the D-Pad. 
 Switching weapons was cool enough, but now successive combos are even easier and cooler to utilize. 
 The game's controls feel a bit more confining than those ofDevil May Cry 3, but there's enough 
 room to practice and playing as both characters turns out to be a serious blast.
  
  If you've played any of the pastDevil May Cryseries, the core gameplay will seem familiar to you. 
 As either Dante or Nero, you must explore these extravagant worlds of gothic castles to refreshingly 
 bright outdoor environments. Along the way you'll find simple puzzles and fetch-quests, where you 
 need a specific item to progress. These aren't entirely difficult to figure out, but the game breaks 
 up the simplistic exploration with some of the most enjoyable beat-em-up combat seen on the 360. 
 That being stated, the combat remains over-the-top and enjoyable. Enemies, though there aren't 
 many types, come in some interesting forms. Fortunately, Dante and Nero's skills are fun and diverse 
 to use, something essential when aiming for a high rating. At the end of a mission, the player 
 is ranked in specific skills, mostly how diverse your fighting style was during the mission. The 
 combat is easy to link together; going from sword to gun on the fly is plenty fun and is a healthy 
 balance to the rather sparse enemy types.
  
  Devil May Cry 4 has its moments of repetition, and a major point is the bosses. The bosses are 
 definitely creative and are a serious blast to battle both as Dante and as Nero. Which brings up 
 a good point: you will fight them as Dante and Nero. The bosses are creative, challenging, and 
 can be pretty colossal, but half the game is tracking your steps and fighting these gargantuan 
 creatures once more. This still manages to be pretty interesting, but the diversity feels a bit 
 staggered once you face down these monsters again. Also, the camera has a nasty tendency to get 
 in the way. The camera can be controllable in specific moments, but the lock-on targeting (which 
 will be a good friend during the course of the game) can make chasing an enemy a bit troublesome. 
 The camera and repetition may set in, and some DMC veterans may find the checkpoint difficulty 
 a bit on the light side, butDevil May Cry 4 is a great step in the series, keeping many of the 
 better moments in motion.
  
  Presentation has always been a solid factor in theDevil May Cryseries and being the first next-gen 
 installment of the series is no simple challenge. Fortunately, Devil May Cry 4 is a great-looking 
 game. The lighting effects are crisp, and many of the outdoor levels are impressive. Dante and 
 Nero's over-the-top action sequences look even better thanks to the 360's increased power and you'll 
 be seeing them a lot. The scenes are beautiful and brilliantly-choreographed; Dante's absurdly-gravity-defying 
 antics have never looked so good. To top off the amazing graphics is a soundtrack that just plain 
 rocks. The sounds of metal music echoing during a high-intensity battle are great to listen to, 
 although it would've been much better if the same themes weren't recycled during every single battle. 
 The voice acting is also a step up fromDevil May Cry 4. Nero's story is remarkably deeper than 
 Dante's, and the excellent voice acting from near all of the characters is a much-needed improvement 
 from the game's predecessor. Famed anime voice actor Johnny Yong Bosch performs Nero's role extremely 
 well, as does Dante's voice actor Reuben Langdon. Unlike the storyline of pastDevil May Crygames, 
 the fourth installment is deep enough to even be called heartwarming. But don't worry; the sounds 
 of crushing armor and sword slashes will keep the action at a good level, so the story isn't the 
 main event.
  
  Pros
  + Consistently chaotic combat is fun
  + New story and characters are a clever diversion
  + Presentation is full of flare and action
 
  + Difficulty is successfully more merciful
  
  Cons
  - Platforming sequences are weak
  - Level design and bosses are repetitive
  - Camera can get in the way
  - Gameplay feels a bit 
 dated
  
  TheDevil May Cryseries has no doubt had its amount of successes, and although the fourth installment 
 doesn't stack up to the amazingly over-the-top action of the third, Devil May Cry 4 is a great beat-em-up 
 with some cool new ideas and classic combo-happy combat. It takes awhile to understand a lot of 
 Nero's character, but his solemn narrative is definitely worth fighting through the battles for. 
 Fortunately, his battles are easier and considerably more merciful than Dante's battles in Devil 
 May Cry 3. There's plenty of amazing cinematics and the entire game manages to look very good and 
 runs at a solid clip. The smaller inclusions like Nero's Devil Bringer and Dante's style changes 
 make the game a blast to play; there's plenty of ways to shoot, slash, and take down enemies. The 
 repeating of boss battles and the repetitive level design are annoying, but behind these nuisances, Devil 
 May Cry 4 is an intriguing, though familiar step in the right direction. It's not the best in the 
 series, butDevil May Cry 4 is a great action game with plenty of style, some excellent combat, 
 and a brand new story to fight through. Just be sure to stock up on Yellow Orbs

Review:  I expected a lot from the new Devil May Cry game and that's exactly what I got. 
  I have to say that the best part of this game is the story, involving Nero, the new character, 
 Kyrie, his girlfriend, The Order Of The Sword and Dante, the legendary devil hunter. The story 
 is just amazing so I won't spoil it for you and the cut-scenes also look awesome.
  Nero's signature feature is his demonic arm known as the Devil Bringer. The DB will be a big part 
 of your fighting technique and switching to Dante will be kind of disappointing at first but after 
 you get sucked into his amazing styles you can forget the DB. For me, playing as Dante is just 
 plain better than Nero because Nero doesn't have the diversity of attacks like Dante. Nero's gameplay 
 consists of Red Queen, his sword, Devil Bringer and occasionally Blue Rose, his handgun. Dante, 
 on the other hand, has a massive diversity of attacks because of his four styles and all of the 
 amazing weapons. Still, my favourite weapon of his is Rebellion, the sword. I really like it because 
 of it's speed, power and combo value. Nevertheless, having Nero in the game is a great refreshment 
 from Dante's combat and it's a great move by the developers.
  I think that Devil May Cry 4 is the best game for the Xbox 360 to come out this year and I recommend 
 it to everyone.

Review:  YAYS
  - great graphics and sound
  - extraordinary cutscenes (of which are plenty)
  - cool combos and characters
  
  NAYS
  - repetition, repetition, repetition
  - repetition, 
 repetition, repetition
  
  DMC4 had a lot of hype around it which made me get the game, despite the fact that the only exposure 
 I had to the series was a brief hour in DMC3.
  
  I have to say - sorry fanboys, but I am disappointed by the game as much as I was impressed by 
 some of its factors. Read further before you click "do not recommend".
  
  I don't really know where the story picks up in the series, but during the course of the game it 
 isn't extremely significant to keep new comers like me at bay. On the contrary, it is interesting 
 and gives enough incentive to move on to the next level, although I am definite that fans will 
 find a lot of cameos as well as story elements hitting some cords previously established by the 
 other three games.
  
  In any case, the game begins with Nero attending an opera followed by a mass, which is duly interrupted 
 by Dante crashing down from the ceiling and killing off the head of the Order. Chaos ensues and 
 it is up to Nero to stop Dante from killing everyone else, and this first mission serves as an 
 impressive training ground for the gameplay. Dante soon runs away and it is up to Nero to find 
 out the cause behind this assassination, as well as find out more about the Order and what it is 
 doing to the world, and how the demons come into play.
  
  While the story is interesting, any gamer who has played any videogame before that involved the 
 Church knows pretty much how the story will turn out. Despite it being predictable, it is entertaining 
 and provides a solid ground for the gameplay to base itself on.
  
  Which brings us to the gameplay topic.
  
  DMC4 has an interesting approach to the gameplay 
 because it allows you to customize the experience depending on how familiar you are with it. Nero 
 is an great fighter with amusing special abilities as well as attack combos. His main weapon is 
 his sword, the Red Queen, as well as an underwhelming gun called Blue Rose, which is mostly used 
 to vary your combos or hold enemies still rather than inflict actual damage.
  
  Killing enemies - as well as bashing environmental elements - reveals red orbs which you can use 
 as a currency to purchase items. However, what matters in DMC is your killing style, which forces 
 you to memorize the combos and pull them off successfully. Basically, the more DIFFERENT combos 
 you use to kill enemies - without being hit - the higher your style rating will go. It always keeps 
 you on your toes and allows you to pull off great looking combos, rather than simply mashing the 
 same basic combo to get rid of enemies. It helps that they look truly awesome and incredibly flashy, 
 and often chaotic.
  
  At the end of each stage, you are given an overall rate depending on how many red orbs you have 
 collected, the time it took you to complete the level, as well as your style - which matters the 
 most. Getting a high ratings earns you more Proud Souls, which you can use to upgrade or purchase 
 new combos (you can choose them manually or have the game do it automatically for you based on 
 three different settings) . The great thing is that once a combo is purchased, you don't have to 
 be stuck with it if you don't like it. At any area where the option is allowed, you can refund 
 the Proud Souls to invest in different combos. It is a good mechanic because you can constantly 
 vary your fighting styles, but it is also a slight drawback as there is no real feeling of punishment 
 or deprivation - you can finish the game having experienced most combos without having to play 
 again to see what the game would have been like if you chose a different set. What helps in earning 
 Proud Souls is that you can replay any level to boost your Proud Soul number, which seems like 
 the easy thing to do if you want to get to see everything.
  
  This presents an introduction to DMC4's major problem, which is repetition. If it were a case of 
 only replaying some stages to get more Proud Souls, it would have been OK. The major issue here 
 is that half way through the game, a plot twist forces you to switch characters to Dante.
  
  There are two gameplay issues here that are severely affected by the switch. The first and 
 most obvious one is that Dante's combos and playing styles are completely different from Nero's. 
 While it is a good thing, it doesn't play out well when you have played as Nero for 5 hours and 
 got accustomed to the combos only to have a character switch. Dante's combos are significantly 
 more than Nero's as he has four different fighting styles, each with its own set of combos. Veterans 
 of the series probably will be thrilled with the news and would be quite adept with the switch, 
 for new comers however like me, the switch threw me off guard completely.
  
  Thanks to the game's customization, you can actually opt to have the game pull off the combos on 
 your behalf by you only participating in executing partial commands of the combo. I had to use 
 it on Dante because he proved to be quite a challenge, but didn't have an issue with manually pulling 
 off combos with Nero.
  
  The other problem with the switch is that, for some unknown reason, Dante has to traverse all the 
 levels that you have previously finished with Nero, but now in reverse. The end result of this 
 is that you go through exactly the same locations in the opposite direction. Although the environments 
 are cool, the game feels really like half a game. Moreover, you also fight the same bosses you 
 defeated - which are admittedly incredibly awesome - while playing with Nero. To make matters worse, 
 you even fight the bosses for a third round by the end of the game.
  
  Add that to the fact that you will have to play the levels as both Nero and/or Dante if you want 
 to harvest all souls, it means that for a single playthrough on any difficulty you will have to 
 visit each location at least 3 times (once as Nero, once as Dante, and once for soul harvesting) . 
 The repetition is unbelievable and will drive you crazy unless you are hardcore enough to complete 
 each level with SSS rating on each difficulty with both Nero and Dante.
  
  Thankfully - as if the developers knew of the issue - the graphics are just a work of art and make 
 the whole repetition process easy on the eyes. The environments are varied and bind-blowingly detailed. 
 The special effects are awesome, the character models are top notch and the animation is wonderful. 
 What's better is the amount of extraordinarily superhuman cutscenes that nearly border on absurdity. 
 The humor element in most of the scenes is a cool touch but often becomes cheesy, but is nonetheless 
 enjoyable. Certainly, it is a great game to watch more than it is to play.
  
  In the end, your liking to this game depends heavily on two things: Your exposure to the series 
 and how tolerant you are of repetition. If you're into mastering manually pulling off combos, finishing 
 levels on SSS, collecting every orb and finishing the insanely punishing higher difficulties, then 
 give this game a 9 or 9.5. If you're in it for just the fun, then the game is half your money's 
 worth and you'd better off investing in the more mainstream God of War.

Review:  CREDITS TO adakin01
  
  
  The game play itself is amazing yet the story in its own way has a magnificent way of hooking the 
 player into the game and making them just want to accomplish the game in all difficulties and unlock 
 all achievements. This game contains all new characters except the all known DANTE and all new 
 bosses, henchman and NERO the main character of this game. This game made by CAP-COM is personally 
 my favourite game ever mad and i give it a 10 out of 10 because it contains action, good story,
 
  humour and a little love. but most of all it is intensely fun to play.....
  
  I honestly for all you players who read this and own a playstion 3, Xbox 360 or a Pc to buy this 
 game.
  
  WARNING: it is a 16 plus and contains some swearing, highly violent and full of blood and not forgetting 
 death and my favourite total ownage.

Review:  Overall it's a sweet action game. It's just fun to play, and a great thing about replaying the 
 game is that all of your skills and weapons you unlocked carry over from one difficulty to another. 
 So if you're going for achievements or just want to beat the game again it cuts down on the repetitiveness 
 a little bit. But what adds to it is you will be playing the same levels over, and fighting the 
 same bosses twice in one play through. Which isn't TOO bad, because they are good boss fights, 
 and every level is a different experience with Dante than with Nero. But WTH? At least playing 
 as Nero or Dante is very different. Both have their own style of play (well Dante has 4) with good 
 upgrades to pick from. Once you unlock all guns and weapons with Dante I think he's more fun to 
 play but I still miss the instant rev and the Devil Bringer with Nero sometimes. As for bonuses. 
 The secret missions are good, but difficult your first time through, well they were for me on Devil 
 Hunter mode. :D And there's hidden stuff all over the place. Nero has a treasure hunter thing on 
 his arm so the closer he gets to a secret the brighter his arm shines, and when you're Dante you 
 just have to try and remember when they're at. Since you're playing the same levels, remember? 
 Anyways like I said before it's a good action game. The graphics are by far not the best, but they 
 put enough detail and polish into them for you to enjoy the look. I'm only renting it right now 
 from Gamefly, and i think that's all you need to get what you want out of it. My first play through 
 on Devil Hunter Mode was about 13-14 hours. The only time i got stuck was the first (well actually 
 second if you count the tutorial) time i fought Dante. So if you're interested in this game i suggest 
 you just take $14 to gamefly buy the 2 game trail membership and get what you want out of it and 
 something else you've had your eye on :P

Review:  Capcom returns after roughly 4yrs with its demon  Action Adventure 
 series. after a long break of comsuming the role of dante and saving the world, Dmc is such a refreshing 
 experience after all that we longed for and wished to dive ourselves into again, it still has that 
 over the top action with its unhuman difficulty and an melodramatic story like no other. These 
 core elements have been key to dmc's success and it isnt bad to go all the way with convention. 
 But it would be nice to see Dmc get a massive makeover like its other cousin Resident Evil, it 
 is the fourth incarnation and we are in next gen by the way, However this doesnt stop dmc in delivering 
 a good experience that is a great way to start off the year. It has not added any dynamic new features 
 that changes the face of the genre but it is very much polished to the core that there is little 
 complain about. 
  
  For one thing, Nero is awesome, forget all those doubts prior to the games release. He is very 
 much badass as Dante and incoporates many new mechanics in the gameplay, Nero's character takes 
 us away from the tried and done gameplay, sans gun slinging, sword wielding dante. Nero has those 
 perks too butNero's demomic arm brings a weapon that dante can never could wield. You can endlessly 
 chain together comboes and bash, rip your opens in with this beast. Nero is not as skilled with 
 guns and blades but he is close, the only difference is the demon arm. Which makes Nero a much 
 better character to play as, and yes Dante is still a beast but we have used him so much nero seems 
 more appealing. You play as both characters threw the game, (70% Nero, 30% Dante) and they both 
 fight diffrently. Dante is much more quicker while swinging and shooting, and has styles, but nero 
 is more faster with his feet and body, and can battle better at distances because of his arm, he 
 also battles heavily aerial staying in the air for seconds pulling out massive comboes, Nero also 
 can rev up the red queen (his sword) to enter a new range of deadly attacks, Whether what character 
 you like best to play as, it will always be fun and challenging no matter what. 
  
  In past Dmc titles, you had to choose between skills or items. This time seperate points are used, 
 The classic known red orbs are used to purchase valuables and a new orb called proud souls that 
 is used for skills. Even if you dont like the skill you just acquired you can refund your proud 
 souls back into a pool so you can reselect them. This is much better than saving up for one skill 
 even if you dont know what it does and not liking it. Also the graphics in Dmc are very good, its 
 not leaps and bounds past dmc3 but clearly you can see it has entered next gen. Its lighting is 
 so beautiful and the backdrops and characters are the same (Especially in its cutscenes) But the 
 gameplay is where the game shines the most. The insane enemy encounters, the badass comboes, the 
 intense boss battles have all found their way back into the game. Lots of outdoor fighting though, (DMC2=yuck) 
 and i now offically hate castles in action games. The game may be split up in missions but it feels 
 like a living world because the areas are connected, you can always go back to a previous area 
 or advance foward. The sad thing is that there is a massive load of backtracking in the game, one 
 time you have to travel back to the begining of the level just to continue, which most action games 
 dont do. Usually you just keep heading foward but dmc4 you actually have to go in reverse which 
 is a problem that should be left in last gen. 
  
  The sound is pretty decent but the characters lines can be pretty cheesy, but the dialouge is pretty 
 much humorous and melochanoly. sometimes things in the game make no sense like why is dante singin 
 an opera before fighting a boss? but the battle music is nice and the voicework is decent, but 
 the outstanding sound effects and soundtrack is what really shines.
  
  The story has gone under a "softer, less darker" approach this time, but it is still every bit 
 goth and deep. This approach seems a little bit Rated "T" but i guess you can argue with ESRB. 
 As i mentioned before Nero is a new and playable character but he is also the main protaganist, 
 while Dante plays a major role, Nero is still the star. The game takes place between the first 
 and second game and Dante plays as the advisor to Nero. The story starts out with a bang, from 
 the intro to the final scenes the game delivers the goods. It is as much well rounded as its big 
 brothers but it adds on certain japanese perks that a jap rpg can have. After Devil May Cry1 Dante 
 is viewed as a hero and a unstoppable powerhouse, he is indeed known as the son of sparda but he 
 isnt known by the peoples of this game world. The setting of the game is a isolated discreet island 
 that is run by the order of the sword (an religous group that looks over the cities simple minded 
 people) Not much is known about the order of the sword and there are tons to discover about them 
 in the game, Nero stars as one of the orders naive henchman that does the work thats dirty, even 
 if Nero doesnt know why he has to. One day the order has a meeting of a spiritual session, hailing 
 down to the dark knight sparda telling stories of him and such. Nero is running late to the meeting 
 and battles monsters on the way there while his girlfriend kyrie is singing. After a long cutscene 
 showing this, A unknown warrior breaks threw the buildings ceiling and attacks the head of the 
 order. The warrior is Dante, after these impressions you'd believe he has become evil but there 
 is more that meets the eye. Frightened by these current events the spectators flee into the city 
 where demons await them and Nero charges into battle against Dante, this leads us to one of the 
 best fight scenes i 've ever seen in a videogame, thus the tutorial starts alongside the fight. 
 Nero unexpectly wins but it seems dante didnt even put up a fight which is what exactly happened. 
 Dante then escapes into the city and Nero is sent after him not knowing exactly who he is but Dante 
 is considered a threat. Later in the game you learn that the order of the sword is a twisted corrupted 
 organization that only wants to bring chaos to the world and its up to dante and nero to stop them. 
 Its a story that is filled with many touching moments and many badass fight scenes. Its one of 
 those better stories that i havent seen in a while, but it isnt epic, it is just fine storytelling 
 that will stir your emotions.
  
  Although the game is quite immaculate it does have its major problems, for one thing the boss battles 
 are recycled too many times. Yes they are good but you will fight the 3 times! And its such a waste 
 to play as dante for the same bosses, also the in-game graphics aren't nearly as good as the cutscenes. 
 The games difficulty will also turn many gamers down but at least its not as punishing as dmc3. 
 I wish there were more checkpoint though, i found myself throwing down my controller too many times 
 because i had to start a mission from the begining after playing 20min. Again the story can be 
 cheesy but in the end is is still above the bar. The game is literally short but luckily the game 
 has numerous game difficulites to back it up. Sadly, you'd only play the game at least twice as 
 it seems repetive after that. Dmc4 is a must play and is the one action adventure game that is 
 good for next gen, their arent many but this a superb pleasure. But be warned, this isnt better 
 the original devil and feels much diffrent than its older brothers. But if you are looking for 
 a completety revolutionized dmc stay far away. other than that, it will make you have a deal with 
 the devil.

Review:  Capcom has finally dished out a helping of its smart-ass demon hunters to next generation platforms, 
 this time following a fresh face with his own dark secrets. When you begin the game, you'll be 
 treated to one of the most fantastically captivating cinematics you've ever seen, depicting Kyrie 
 (new hero Nero's love interest in the game) singing a gripping ballad at the head of a church, 
 while a tardy Nero races through an alleyway, slaying as many demons as possible on the way. The 
 excellence on this front doesn't let up through-out the entire game, however, the same cannot be 
 said of the gameplay itself.
  
  During the opening scene of the game, you'll witness the leader of church give its members a speech 
 about Sparda, the dark knight who they worship as their god and savior. No sooner than when he 
 gets these words out, Dante crashes the party, killing the leader in the process. The game is quickly 
 injected into a tale of revenge, and you are tasked with the duty of finding and killing Dante 
 any way you can.
  
  As you set off, long-time fans of the series will be pleased to know that practically nothing has 
 changed, and you'll feel right at home. Herein lies the first problem though: it feels too much 
 like home. You'll find that it can get a bit repetitive slashing the same few types of demons, 
 especially after seeing the "area is being blocked by some red wall" cutscene for the 1000th time. 
 That's not to say the combat is bad by any means, because it is still really solid, and is by most 
 means better than other games in the genre.
  
  Where the second most prominent issue lies is within the level design and game structure. Often 
 times you'll be wandering around rather bland environments not quite sure what to do, or you'll 
 find yourself backtracking far more than you'd ever want to. This becomes much more apparent as 
 you are introduced to playing Dante at a point in the game, as you'll mostly only get to use him 
 to backtrack through levels you've already completed with Nero. Were there some serious time constraints 
 over at Capcom? Sometimes your destinations can be somewhat unclear as well, and you might find 
 yourself wandering around for a good while before figuring out where you're supposed to go. I did, 
 and trust me it's not very fun.
  
  Speaking of Dante, he is far more fun and versatile to play than Nero. It makes you wonder why 
 they didn't just create a story exclusively around him in the first place. Okay, to be fair, Dante 
 is far too snarky to drive anything resembling a sensitive storyline, but that eludes the point. 
 When playing Dante, you're treated to various different fighting styles and weapons selectable 
 on the fly from both the d-pad and triggers respectively. When playing Nero, you're stuck with 
 the one sword and one set of pistols, yet he has a few more tricks up his sleeve, including his 
 Devil Bringer arm, which can grab enemies from afar and do all sorts of nasty melee moves to them. 
 This can be very useful, but also feels a bit broken in some respects.
  
  Probably the most fun to be had in the game, besides gawking at the incredibly choreographed cutscenes, 
 is fighting bosses. It's a good thing too, because you'll be fighting the same ones over and over 
 again. I did notice that the bosses were much easier with Dante however, because his arsenal of 
 weapons and tricks far outweigh even the handy Devil Bringer that Nero packs. You'll fight various 
 formidable foes (including the towering flame boss Berial as shown above) , as well occasionally 
 getting introduced to some humorous villains. It's worth noting that there are quite a few chuckles 
 to be had during the pre-battle banters.
  
  The visual presentation of the game is top notch as far as console action games go. You'll fight 
 towering bosses and face dozens of enemies without seeing the game slow down from its solid 60 
 frames per second. It's all quite impressive to see pulled off, but you're not going to have an 
 eye orgasm in result. As for the audio side of things, the voice actors do their job well to get 
 you interested in matters at hand. I would like to point out though, that the way Kyrie is pronounced 
 got on my nerves after a while (they pronounce it something like kitty-ay.)
  
  Finishing the main storyline in the game will take you anywhere from around 8-10 hours to do, although 
 it might feel longer due to the inhumane amount of backtracking and replaying you'll be forced 
 into. There are some reasons to come back to the game, and again, fans of the series will know 
 about what to expect here, being basically the same reasons as always. There are multiple unlockable 
 difficulties including the infamous Heaven or Hell mode where all enemies and yourself die in one 
 hit, there's the Bloody Palace, which basically acts as an extreme endurance test throwing waves 
 of enemies at you, and of course there's the goal of raising your mission ranks and maxing out 
 your characters weapons and abilities.
  
  Speaking of which, I'd like to touch on the shop and upgrade system, because it pisses me off. 
 After each mission, you may spend any red orbs you've earned within missions on items, and any 
 proud souls you've recieved for completing missions on upgrades and abilities. The problem with 
 all of this is attributed to the store's pricing model. You are shown supposedly the exact price 
 for each item you can buy, but every time you buy something, the prices go up a seemingly random 
 amount. This is incredibly annoying when it comes to getting abilities that have multiple stages, 
 since when you buy one of them, the rest skyrocket in price, making you unable to purchase them. 
 Why bother showing me how much they cost if I can't have them at that price. I know this is nothing 
 new to the franchise, but why must this happen? The fact that this also applies to health and other 
 recover items makes it even more sadistic. Obviously if the game is busting a person's balls, preventing 
 them from recieving aid is not encouraging. To make matters worse, this price hike is irreversable.
 
  
  I can't quite put my finger on what to think of this game. There were times that I seriously did 
 not want to continue playing (due to the backtracking, level design and puzzles) , and there were 
 other times where I was having a blast (mostly when playing as Dante and executing "Smokin' Sick 
 Style" combos) . There are times when you don't quite understand what you're doing, and other times 
 when you don't quite care because you're busting some skulls (and it feels so good) . If you're 
 a Devil May Cry fanatic, you should already own this game. For everyone else, give it a rent.

Review:  Devil May Cry is one of the biggest series that was on the Playstation 2, which makes it shocking 
 that Devil May Cry 4 came out on the Xbox 360 and PS3. DMC1 was the best in the series by many 
 fans, DMC2 was a major disapointment and DMC3 was just to hard for most people to every completed 
 easy, but DMC4 has a perfect difficulty which is great for newcomers to DMC and there are harder 
 modes as you complete the game.
  
  Well Capcom decided to bring the series to a bigger auidence which is why Nero is taking Dante's 
 role of bad arse. DMC fans will disappointed by the fact there have to wait untill there can play 
 as Dante. Well the gameplay is the same as DMC3 which has you get your style ranking higher to 
 get more red orbs from enemys to buy new items (blue orbs etc) , the upgrade shop has changed so 
 you can only buy items with red orbs and to buy new/ improve moves you have to use proud souls 
 which you get at the end of each mission. 
  
  Nero has many moves new to the series which is mainly his right arm which is called the Devil Bringer 
 which lets you grab enemys and throw then to the ground or grab then from a distance which helps 
 keep your combo going. Nero has only 1 gun and a sword which means you have to learn multiply combos 
 to get the SSS rating in a fight. Nero will get Devil Trigger (DT) when you are about 25% of the 
 way through the game which will power up his grab move on the Devil Bringer making it cause more 
 damage to bosses making it look cooler also.
  
  Just after halfway through the game you will switch to Dante which for newcomers is going to be 
 a pain but for fans about time. Dante has all 4 of his styles from DMC3 which can be switched in 
 the middle of a fight like his weapons to keep your combo at SSS however after playing as Nero 
 it will take some time for people to be able to use all of Dante's styles successful. Dante only 
 gets 3 guns and 3 swords which is ok as you only play as him for 7 missions.
  
  The boss fights are as always stunning as you will have to use all you best moves to take them 
 down with out using to much health to get a good rating. People who have played DMC2 and DMC3 Special 
 Edition, will remember the Bloody Place mode which has returned but you have a time limit now which 
 makes it harder to do but adds more gameplay time.
  
  Overall DMC4 is a great game which has a few problems like all games but is a must get, and if 
 you are wondering what the differences are between the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions are there are 
 none at all but you have acheviements on the xbox 360 version which add to your gamer score.

Review:  The game play itself is amazing yet the story in its own way has a magnificent way of hooking the 
 player into the game and making them just want to accomplish the game in all difficulties and unlock 
 all achievements. This game contains all new characters except the all known DANTE and all new 
 bosses, henchman and NERO the main character of this game. This game made by CAP-COM is personally 
 my favourite game ever mad and i give it a 10 out of 10 because it contains action, good story,
 
  humour and a little love. but most of all it is intensely fun to play.....
  
  I honestly for all you players who read this and own a playstion 3, Xbox 360 or a Pc to buy this 
 game.
  
  WARNING: it is a 16 plus and contains some swearing, highly violent and full of blood and not forgetting 
 death and my favourite total ownage.

Review:  Ok i havent reviewed a game in a while due to work and stuff, plus the fact that ive been playing 
 alot of games and Devil may cry 4 is long when completing the game 100% and unlocking everything 
 which i did becuase i loved the game the first few times round.
  
  Story:
  
  The game opens with Nero hurrying towards the central Opera House where the Order of the Sword 
 is conducting a ceremony, his right arm in a sling. Meanwhile Kyrie, Nero's romantic interest, 
 is beginning to open the ceremony with a song and is disappointed not to find Nero in the audience. 
 She begins her song none the less as Nero encounters several Scarecrow demons on his way to the 
 Opera House; he easily dispatches them without breaking his stride and arrives at the Opera House 
 just in time to hear the end of Kyrie's song.
  
  Following this, Kyrie joins Nero in the audience where she finds Nero has left a present for her 
 in the form of a gold necklace. The High Priest of the Order of the Sword, Sanctus, beckons the 
 Order members to join him in prayer; Nero is visibly bored by this and is about to leave despite 
 Kyrie's protests when his right arm begins to glow ominously. At this moment, Dante bursts through 
 the ceiling and assassinates Sanctus.
  
  The knights quickly rally to avenge their fallen leader but are easily dispatched by the assassin. 
 Nero, under the impression that Kyrie is in danger, attacks Dante initiating a fight between the 
 two. As Dante gains the upper hand, Nero reveals his demonic right arm named the Devil Bringer 
 and uses its power to seemingly kill Dante by impaling him with his own sword upon the statue of 
 Sparda. Dante merely jests "getting better" and pushes himself off the statue. As Dante removes 
 the sword from his chest Nero asks, "You're not human are you?" Dante replies that "We are the 
 same you and I... and them," pointing to one of the dead knights. Nero looks and it is revealed 
 that the knight was possessed with a demonic appearance. Nero looks up to see that Dante is already 
 resting on the hole in the ceiling from which he came. Dante states that he thinks Nero has something 
 different from the others then swoops out of view just as the knights reinforcements arrive.
  
  Nero is charged with capturing Dante and bringing him back to the Order to answer for his crimes 
 by Credo, the leader of the Orders knights and Kyrie's brother. Upon leaving the Opera House however, 
 a demonic horde begins to lay waste to the city. Nero and Kyrie are separated as Nero begins to 
 slay the demons. Whilst journeying to Fortuna Castle he meets Gloria, a new member to the Order. 
 Nero fights his way into the depths of Fortuna Castle, on the way, the player is allowed to witness 
 a scene revealing that Sanctus has been infused with the soul of a demon to revive him. The player 
 is also introduced to Agnus, the stuttering scientist and mastermind of the Orders demonic power 
 manipulation.
  
  Nero finally reaches Agnus' facility where he is defeated and heavily injured. Vergil's broken 
 katana, Yamato, responds to Nero and mends itself before flying into his hand. Nero fends off Agnus' 
 attacks with the aid of a spectral blue demon hovering behind him before he collapses in exhaustion.
 
  
  Agnus flees back to Sanctus and informs him of Nero's new-found power, Credo vows to take care 
 of Nero while Gloria takes over Nero's pursuit of Dante.
  
  Nero is confronted by Credo who also has been infused with demonic power, giving him the characteristics 
 of an Angel, yet is defeated by Nero. However, Kyrie arrives in time to witness Nero with his demonic 
 arm standing over her defeated brother. Agnus uses the confusion and distraction on Nero's part 
 to kidnap Kyrie and flee. Credo postpones his feud with Nero until he can investigate the situation. 
 Nero once more meets Dante, but his quest to capture him is long since forgotten; he wishes to 
 simply pass Dante by. However, Dante wants Yamato, the sword used by his twin-brother Vergil, returned 
 to him. A fight ensues where Dante is victorious; however, he decides to let Nero keep Yamato after 
 the latter has "cooled down". Gloria appears before Dante as Nero leaves, however, it is revealed 
 that Gloria is in fact Trish, Dante's partner in his demon hunting business "Devil May Cry."
  
  Nero reaches Sanctus and the "Savior" an enormous demon which the Order intends to bring to 
 life using Nero and Yamato's power. Using Kyrie as a human shield, Sanctus is successful in detaining 
 Nero. Sanctus reveals that the Savior requires the essence of Sparda to reach full power; he originally 
 intended Dante be used as the core but accepts Nero as a suitable substitute claiming that Nero 
 is also a descendent of Sparda. Credo attempts to rescue the two but is mortally wounded by Sanctus; 
 then Dante arrives and tells Nero give him his sword back. As Nero is absorbed into the Savior, 
 he flips off Dante and tells him to "come and get it."
  
  Agnus uses Yamato to open the true Hellgate; releasing a multitude of demons onto the city; Sanctus 
 arrives with the Savior and begins to exterminate the demons. Dante, upon hearing Credo's dying 
 request to rescue Kyrie and Nero, fights his way back towards the city, on his way he destroys 
 the three smaller Hellgates used to release the demons.
  
  Dante arrives back at the Opera House and kills Agnus; he then retrieves Yamato and uses it to 
 destroy the the true Hellgate before confronting Sanctus and the Savior. After discovering that 
 the Savior is invincible from the outside, Dante drives Yamato into the chest of the Savior, where 
 it is retrieved by Nero. Nero defeats Sanctus inside the Savior and rescues Kyrie; finally, Nero 
 uses the powers of his Devil Bringer to destroy the Savior and Sanctus once and for all. Dante 
 departs after entrusting Nero with Yamato. Nero and Kyrie's tender reunion is interrupted by another 
 demon attack; Nero draws his sword and begins the fight as the credits roll. During the credits, 
 the player is given the task to protect Kyrie from the onslaught of demons for a specific amount 
 of time. If the player fails, the credits are cut short and a secret ending involving Nero and 
 Kyrie does not take place.
  
  In an extra ending scene, at the Devil May Cry shop, Trish and Lady bicker over the small reward 
 Lady had offered, with Lady accusing Trish for having disguised herself as Gloria and delivering 
 Sparda's sword to the Order. After Trish forcibly drags him into their argument, Dante ends it 
 by saying that it's better than nothing. With that settled, Lady sets out to leave -- but the phone 
 rings, with a customer having another job for Dante to do, and the trio moves out to help.
  
  I thought compared to previous Installments in the series the story to this game was refreshing 
 and the cut scenes where especially fantastic from capcom, however dont expect anything amazing 
 within the story as Nero's devil arm has been seen before within devil may cry 1 with dante and 
 his devil powers.
  
  Gameplay:
  
  Some changes introduced into Devil May Cry 4 are the presence of two playable characters, Dante 
 and Nero and a slight modification to the shop system. A new currency called Proud Souls is now 
 implemented which are used to buy new abilities while Red Orbs are used to buy items. Proud Souls 
 are rewarded at the end of missions, the amount of which varies depending on how well the player 
 performs with S rank providing the highest amount of Proud Souls. Costs of abilities also increase 
 with the purchase of other abilities, though they may be sold back if the player so desires.
  
  Nero is played throughout most of the game. He starts and ends the game with his Red Queen 
 sword, Blue Rose revolver and the powers of his Devil Bringer (his magical right arm) . The Red 
 Queen features an "Exceed" Gauge that can be charged allowing for subsequent attacks that are more 
 powerful than regular slashes until the gauge empties. The exceed gauge can also be filled by pressing 
 the rev button at the peak of each slash which allows for more powerful combos, capable of breaking 
 the opponent's guard. Nero also has the powers of his Devil Bringer, using it to pull himself towards 
 enemies or vice-versa. The Devil Bringer may also be used for context-sensitive throw attacks, 
 leading to high damage and various effects depending on the enemy. Nero's Devil Bringer also gains 
 new abilities in the course of the game, such as being able to detect secret missions or caches 
 of Red Orbs. Nero gains the ability to use Devil Trigger, which also increases his Devil Bringer's 
 power, even changing his Devil Bringer attacks into more powerful versions with different animations.
 
  
  Dante is played through seven missions, taking over about half-way through the game. His gameplay 
 is similar to that of Devil May Cry 3, with him having access to multiple melee and ranged weapons -- which 
 he gains after boss battles -- and being able to cycle through them freely in combat, being no longer 
 limited to equipping two weapons of each type as he was in the previous game. Dante also starts 
 with his four styles (Trickster, Royal Guard, Sword Master, Gunslinger) , each of which grants him 
 different abilities, but may now switch them at will with the d-pad, unlike in previous game Devil 
 May Cry 3. He also gains the Dark Slayer style near the end of his section, which only has one 
 style level and can be accessed by pressing a direction button twice. Styles do not level up through 
 experience as in the previous game, but must instead be upgraded in the shop screen in between 
 missions or at statues. 
  
  Dante can also enter Devil Trigger, though this does not change his attacks to the degree that 
 Nero's Devil Trigger does but allows him to use Triple Jump and Double Sky Star, while using the 
 Trickster Style.
  
  Nothing new here basically if you, ve played or seen anything to do with previous installments to 
 the series nothing has changed and you should be used to the combat and slight repeatitiveness 
 to the game.
  
  Controls:
  
  For the 360 version of this game the controls dont really have a learning curve due to the fact 
 that, if your new to the series then you do have a choice to put all the combo's and '' high matience 
 '' moves to automatic which means you just press the Y button and it basically does everything 
 for you which if im honest i had to do on the highest difficulty's last few levels.
  
  A. I:
  
  As with mostly all of capcoms games the A. I within this game are supurb and although 
 there isnt as much variaty as i would of hoped in the enemies they do preform well as each time 
 you play and each different difficulty they preform differently.
  
  Also again with the different types of enemy's, this is really the only main complaint i have is 
 that there isnt anywhere enough variaty within the game which deffently adds to the repeatitiveness 
 to the game.
  
  
  Nero:
  
  Ok so in this new installment of Devil May Cry, Capcom gave us gamers a new character to play around 
 with called Nero which when it was first announced alot of people where pretty stressed about which 
 i could understand with, However to my suprise Nero looks basically the same as Dante with a Devil 
 Arm and a new sword with something called '' Exceed '' which basically powers up Nero's sword attacks 
 and add's to his combo's. 
  
  You use this ability with the Left trigger on your 360 controller and for the most part the Exeed 
 works pretty well and is nearly essential in getting a Triple SSS ranking.
  
  Ok now to Nero's Devil Arm and Devil Trigger, for the most part the devil Arm makes things a alot 
 easier due to the fact that you'll find yourself using it ALOT when you send enemys flying and 
 want a quick pull back to add to your combo's. 
  
  The Devil Trigger is basically the same as Dantes Devil trigger in the first few games, as you 
 press the Left bumber and Nero becomes inhuman and his attacks becomes stronger aswell as a slight 
 health regeneration.
  
  Again with the previous installments your main characters get a sub type of weapon which we all 
 know as a Gun which is practically useless and its the same here with Devil May Cry 4, the gun 
 is basically useless and just a preference.
  
  
  Dante:
  
  Ok aswell as our new character Nero in the second half of the game Dante becomes a playable character 
 and as Devil may cry 4 is ment to be a sequal to devil may cry 2 he looks the same as he did them 
 just with slight facial hair.
  
  Dante's Weapons are the same as in previous installments with his sword, two barreters and a sawn 
 shotgun, However through the course of completing certain levels Dante picks up more special weapons 
 which are pretty cool, these new weapons include:
  
  Lucifers wings 
  
  Pandora's box 
  
  And the best weapon on the game in my opinion which im not going to spoil.
 
  
  Aswell as these new weapons Dante also has a new set of stances which basically acomidate which 
 way you play with him, these include:
  
  Trickster: This style makes use of High speed acrobatics. Dodge attacks and makes toying with enemys 
 using speed pretty easy.
  
  SwordMaster: Helps when using your sword in close range encounters with enemies.
  
  Gunslinger: 
 Keep your enemies at bay by making full use of a variety of long range weapons. For showw offs 
 mainly.
  
  Royal Guard: Use the enemies attack against him and counter to turn the tide and finish them off.
 
  
  
  A few problems i found with the different characters where mainy preferences, however i found that 
 once you switch over from using Nero to using Dante the Devil Arm was really missed when pulling 
 enemies toawrds me and combo's where lost which i got in to the stride of using Dante.
  
  Also Some of dante's attacks although are very flashy there not very effective on the enemy, so 
 watch out.
  
  In the end Devil may cry 4 is everything and more a fan wants with a new installment and should 
 be extremly happy with the new character Nero, But for first timers who are wanting to see if this 
 game would persuade them into the hack and slash genre go and try something more light hearted 
 like dynasty warriors.
  
  Plus the core game is pretty repeatitive which the lack of variety of enemies within the game but 
 with the extra's and unlockable difficulties this game is well worth 40 or even $60 for a devil 
 may cry fan.
  
  The Good:
  
  worth the money you pay for it 
  Nero is great
  Graphics own
  
  The bad:
  
  Repeatitive
  Dante isnt as powerful as expected
  not enough 
 level verity
  
  The Ugly:
  
  May be alittle too hard for new comers

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is a very good game, with some repetition, but with all the things that you end 
 up getting in return, it is definitely worth your money. Devil May Cry 4 is exactly what youve enjoyed 
 from all the other Devil May Cry games, except one new thing, a new character, Nero, so this time 
 Dante isnt the only Bad-Ass swingin around his 10 foot sword, and shooting evrything he sees, and 
 Nero has something extra, a Demonic arm (you know youre jealous of that damn arm of his.) Along 
 with the amazing storyline and awesome puzzles, there is also a lot of fu#$%# fighting and action 
 involved, so dont worry, youll still be able to kick 10 times the amount of ass you can in real 
 life in this game. If you dont hace Devil May Cry 4 GO GET $50 RIGHT NOW AND GET YOURE ASS OVER 
 TO GAMESTOP!! And if you do have it than stop reading this review and play this game.

Review:  Devil May Cry series comes finally to Xbox360 and in it Castlevania meets Ninja Gaiden while taking 
 a few puzzle solving bits from Zelda.
  
  Young white haired Nero is a member of a religious group called Order of The Sword. During a ceremony 
 Dante  the antihero from previous DMC games  interrupts the process and kills His Holiness, the 
 leader of the order. Nero engages to an outstanding battle, which he of course loses. Second in 
 command of the Order is Credo who sends Nero to hunt down Dante. As you might expect, that's not 
 all and there's lots of demonic powers involved and the fate of the world is at stake and so on 
 and so forth. 
  
  Story is told through magnificent looking CG cutscenes and they are long and many. At times you 
 might want to progress the actual game just to see what the next cutscene has to offer. Subtitles 
 are in by default, but you can turn them off if you wish.
  
  Graphics are outstanding, detailed and colorful with changing themes and environments. Trust me: 
 you want to experience this in a widescreen HD-TV. Loading is done often, but they are very short 
 so they don't disrupt the gameplay seriously. Frame rate runs smoothly all the time, but for some 
 reason the interaction with the environment itself is very limited. Mostly you can just walk in 
 them without the ability to do anything: no cutting down trees and no breaking windows (unless 
 the game specifically wants you to do so) . In terms of its level design DMC4 is not top notch quality 
 and in this day and age game environments should be destructible.
  
  Gameplay consists of 20 missions and about 13 of them are played as Nero and 7 as Dante. As a third 
 person action game most of the time is spent in moving from point to point and fighting against 
 demons. Combat system is fun and you can create your own combos to deal with opposition swiftly. 
 Combos and other abilities can also be bought every now and then. You can also play the same missions 
 as many times as you wish and every time gain more points and unlock abilities. This means that 
 completing Devil May Cry 4 is only a matter of patience and skill on a higher  Demon Hunter  
 difficulty setting.
  
  You can save anywhere anytime, but if you reset your game in mid-mission you'll need to start from 
 the beginning. This means that saving in mid-mission will only save your points and stats. There 
 are checkpoints in every mission and there are enough of them.
  
  Boss fights are the best part in Devil May Cry 4: they are very big and epic. Unfortunately there's 
 a taste of recycling, because you fight against each of them twice: first as Nero and then as Dante.
 
  
  Unfortunately not everything is great in DMC4. Gameplay feels a little dated at times with invisible 
 walls and especially with fixed camera angles. At times the camera makes the game harder than it 
 otherwise would be, because you have trouble to see what's ahead of you. Also platforming bits 
 don't really work, because the system has been built as a combat system. All of these drawbacks 
 can't ruin the fact that Devil May Cry 4 is still a great game and a worthy of purchase.
  
  DMC4 is not a perfect game, but it's still a great way to introduce Xbox owners into the world 
 of Demon Hunters.

Review:  Being somewhat a fan of DMC 3, I was expecting a big improvement with the series moving into the 
 next gen consoles. Unfortunately, I have been disappointed once again. Just because I say that 
 does not mean the game is bad. It is actually a good game, with a good plot to back it up. Just 
 not what I had anticipated and hoped for.
  
  The downfall comes with 2 major mistakes. The smaller one, in my opinion, is the repetitiveness 
 of the levels and bosses. There was no variety and the bosses, except for a select few, were incredibly 
 easy even on the harder modes. Obviously I can only say that until you reach Hell or Hell mode, 
 which is the developers funny idea of a challenge. I think Best Buy is going to have an increased 
 percentage of controllers being bought if you know what i mean : ) .
  
  Anyways, the biggest downfall in my opinion is the player change. Its almost as if though making 
 you play as half of the game as a new character and getting used to him then having to switch back 
 to the character we all know and love, was another hilarious joke by capcom. In the earlier stages 
 with Dante, I was finding myself trying to snatch enemies from afar but instead id be doing a pretty 
 useless trickster dash or swinging away at nothing. Something i found to be really irritating.

Review:  Although Devil May Cry 4 introduces a new protagonist, there's little chance of him being booed 
 off of the TV screen like Metal Gear Solid's Raiden. Nero is a bona fide killer and, dare I say 
 it, just as likeable hero as Dante. His Devil Bringer factors brilliantly into combat, and adds 
 an over-the-top edge to his amazing combos. Nero could certainly carry this game on his own, but 
 the shocking events in the introductory cutscene make you count the seconds until you get to suit 
 up as Dante again, which you eventually do. And yes, he lives up to his legacy. For both characters, 
 the series' combat is as exciting as ever, and the bosses they confront are simply some of the 
 best in gaming. The levels, however, suffer from lulls in the action, and far too much repetition 
 in the "fight these enemies to open this door" goals, but their beautiful artistry cannot be denied. 
 Even with some faults, this is the very definition of what I expect from an action game. It's intense, 
 stylish, and all about the cut of the blade.

Review:  The Devil may cry series continues. But this time it changes. You start playing of with a character 
 named Nero. You might think he is Dante but he's not. Play as Nero with his demonic arm and devil 
 skills. Dante is still in the game and you will get to play as Dante later on.\
  
  Lots of skills and upgrades make the game more exciting and it gives you a reason to keep on playing. 
 graphics have improved obviously. Game play is still fast, exciting and fun. Endless combos and 
 tricks in the game. Stylish battles. Nero's weapon is kind of cool. With the engine on it .
  
  Nero goes off after Dante, after Dante kills their leader. But this story gets more exciting 
 and addicting. Puzzles make the game more challenging and hard. But also more fun and different. 
 Game play is hard if you choose the demon hunter difficulty. Hard gameplay is always better.
  
  Boss battles are huge. Gives you more skills and moves to use!
  Definitly worth buying and 
 playing and deserves an 8.5.

Review:  I had never played a DMC game before DMC4, but I had always heard great things about them. When 
 DMC4 was first announced for the 360, buying it was a no brainer for me. Unfortunately, the gameplay 
 and graphics couldn't hold up, and I would have lost interest entirely if it weren't for DMC4's 
 great cutscenes and boss fights. But I'm getting a bit ahead of myself.
  
  DMC4 takes players away from series mainstay Dante and hands control over to newcomer Nero, at 
 least for the first half of the game. Luckily, Nero is pretty bad*** too. His Devil Bringer arm 
 allows players to grab far away enemies and reel them in close for a brutal finishing move. Other 
 than that, he plays similarly to post-DMC3 Dante. Dante, on the other hand, is more complex. He 
 brings all of the available styles from DMC3 to the table, and now you can switch between those 
 on the fly using the d-pad. Despite kicking out the old hero, Dante, the plot isn't exactly shocking. 
 It is good enough to move the game forward, though, and it leads into some very cool battles.
 
  
  The gameplay in DMC4 is very vanilla hack-n-slash from the beginning. Press Y to attack, X to shoot 
 your weak guns, A to jump, B to grapple, etc. It starts out fun, but it's hardly enough to carry 
 an entire game. Once Dante is introduced, the game starts to get more involving thanks to his multiple 
 combat styles and cooler Devil Trigger moves. Still, the game is linear to a fault, and we all 
 know that the invisible barriers that sometimes impede your progress are so last-gen. The most 
 outstanding feature of the gameplay, in my opinion, is Nero's ability to perform different grapples/finishing 
 moves on different enemies. He might rip one enemy in half with his bare hands, while he could 
 swing another over his head before letting go and sending them flying. Those attacks, unlike Nero's 
 core abilities, are always fun to see. 
  
  The level designs, despite being linear, can also be confusing to navigate as you are given no 
 clear instructions on what exactly you are supposed to be doing. For example, one level's objective 
 reads, "Find the ultimate power." Okay, great. What exactly is this ultimate power, anyway? And 
 where am I supposed to find it? The final nail in DMC4's gameplay coffin is the puzzles. All of 
 the puzzles are stupidly simple, but take a long time to finish. For example, one puzzle might 
 consist of slowly punching a statue down a long hallway. When you reach the end of the hallway, 
 punch the statue into a door. The door breaks. Puzzle over. And then there's the jumping puzzles. 
 Let's just say that DMC4's jumping controls were designed with fighting, not platforming, in mind. 
 Buy the double jump ability before level 10, and you won't have a lot of trouble.
  
  The level designs in DMC4 are artistically great. They are always interesting things to look at, 
 and environments often give of a creepy/foreboding feeling. Unfortunately, the graphics are stuck 
 in the last generation. DMC4 often looks like a high end Xbox game, an Xbox 1.5 game if you will. 
 The cutscenes do look better, and the animations are great, so overall the graphics aren't too 
 bad at all. 
  
  The music, on the other hand, is bad. The same song will play over and over every time you enter 
 combat, and guess what? The song sucks. And, although I'm starting to feel as if I'm beating a 
 dead horse here, the sound during the cutscenes is quite a bit better. 
  
  Finally, the game is kind of easy. I have never played a DMC game before, as mentioned above, and 
 I haven't owned a hack-n-slash game since Gauntlet Legends on the N64 (although I've played demos 
 of Heavenly Sword at the store,) and the game is still easy for me to plow through at default difficulty. 
 Hardcore DMC fans will want to beat the game once and then play through again on a harder difficulty 
 (assuming that, because you're hardcore DMC fans, you won't really mind playing through this game 
 twice.) In conclusion, you should just wait for this game's price to drop to $30 or $40. It will 
 be worth the price then, but I just can't justify paying $60 for what amounts to a last-gen game 
 with next-gen cutscenes.
  
  DMC4:
  Graphics: 7/10
  Gameplay: 6.5/10
  Sound: 6/10
  Entertainment: 8/10
  Overall: 7.5/10

Review:  Devil May Cry 4, what is there to say about it? Well coming from my stand point I perhaps have 
 a lot more to say than most others. So before I begin let me note, I beat the first one, hated 
 and never beat the second one and never touched the third in fear it would suck as bad as number 
 2. So during a short time my buddy convinced me to play number four after divulging the entire 
 DMC storyline to me. He won me after showing me a bar room brawl between the mysterious Nero and 
 Dante. So I sent out to purchase and play.
  
  Game-play: 9.5
  Sound: 8.0
  Graphics: 10
  Replay: 8.0
  
  Overall: 9.5*
  
  Synopsis:
  You enter the game as Nero, 
 a young man who serves under the 'order'; a cult like religion who worships Sparda. He fights through 
 a parade of Marionettes to reach the operatic scene of his close female friend. After attending 
 her most amazing performance Dante appears by cutting through cards via the roof top and shooting 
 the 'master' priest. It gets better as Nero defends the church as the Order sends for reinforcements. 
 Here begins a very hands on Tutorial for the basic controls.
  
  Your job starts by trying to track and capture Dante. The story becomes much more cross and complicated 
 as you discover the underworld of the 'Order' which becomes a altered science project and you then 
 become the target when they find out you have a demon enchanted arm. The game unfolds quickly, 
 well, quick enough, and the videos happen often, sometimes too often, but it can't be too often 
 as this game has the best FMV's yet.
  
  Game-Play:
  As Nero, who you play with 80% of the game you learn many abilities that concern [like every other 
 DMC] his weaponry and demonology. This includes a Blade known as the Red Queen which has a motorcycle 
 grip. A single revolver named the Blue Rose which only has charged shots as an upgrade. And finally, 
 his demon arm which can grab enemies from across the screen.
  
  It sounds simple, since it cuts the rich fat of the four styles and gun assortments of Dante, but 
 the arm becomes a very intriguing device which will have you itching for a fight to try new techniques, 
 combos, and throws. The biggest event for me was facing bosses at the end of the game and performing 
 Yamato induced grabs. Which goes to a cut scene every time and shows you laying down serious Armageddon 
 action upon your foe.
  
  You play as Dante and all your points are relayed and spent on the styles you choose and let me 
 tell you the truth. When you switch to Dante you will probably be upset because Nero is a very 
 attractive character to use in game play and it seems just too soon to cut you off from Nero since 
 you probably just are beginning to learn his new techniques. However after a while, Dante makes 
 back tracking a breeze.
  
  Finally, the fighting is just tough enough to make you let out some unsightly curses and maybe 
 toss the controller, but after maybe two or three trial and error you will wonder why you had so 
 much trouble before. Again, even though you are hacking and slashing through waves of enemies, 
 it never gets boring, especially with Nero since you can throw enemies into others, and even force 
 them to launch their own flaming skulls at one another. The game play is superb to any other action 
 hack and slashing game and is complimented by the cut scenes which only unfold your fighting technique 
 ten fold.
  
  Sound:
  The voice acting is superb and makes the cut scenes that much better. Nero has short quips such 
 as 'Slam Dunk' and 'Not a Chance' that he yells and it becomes a bit over done, but it still entertaining. 
 What really makes you gain respect for the Metro dressed Nero is when he punishes his enemies with 
 brutal words before he smashes in their skulls.
  
  The music is sub par and stopped me from throwing a 9 or a 10 up on its roster. Every time you 
 enter battle you hear a horrible riff that sounds like its being played three doors down. The sound 
 effects are great however as everything makes a sound and the feral enemies don't make all the 
 noise that other games present to make them annoying.
  
  Graphics:
  Superb, barely touched. When you begin playing telling the difference between game play and cut 
 scenes is actually difficult. The only thing that troubled me was that once you got to maybe level 
 11 or so there are no more gorgeous scenes you go through until the end. You merely back track 
 through enormous levels that have every color in use.
  
  The graphics segment here represents mainly to the outrageous cut scenes showing Nero and Dante 
 blasting enemies apart and sometimes each other. Dante, like usual, in his cut scenes is non chalante 
 and a complete post-Madonna about everything. From shooting enemies in the head without looking, 
 kicking seeds into a snake woman's face while she's trying to talk, and blasting apart a concrete 
 Hell Portal in the shape of a heart.
  
  Replay:
  The game can be played over and over as there're two more game modes of difficulty to complete 
 and a 'survival' mode. However the survival mode gets boring fast and you usually just let them 
 kill you by round 20. You will play the game over and over though, because when you replay on the 
 same profile, you keep all your previous moves and can keep developing them until you're complete.
 
  
  Other than that, you will probably set up the game on it's DVD like interface and 'Play All' to 
 watch a 20-30 minute video of all the cut scenes streamed into a short movie.
  
  Conclusion:
  This is one of the best games out right now on the 360. It is quick moving and the 
 game play has a standard learning curve of about 1 hour. The motivation exists in wanting to learn 
 new moves, find out the story, and watch the cut scenes. Unlike the other DMC's, the game is well 
 balanced and isn't hard to the point you give up and play something else and forget about DMC4. 
 You will keep playing, possibly skip dinner, to just get to the part where you fight Dante.
  
  *I rated it a 9.5, rather than averaging it all out, because this game although defeated by 
 it's horrible line up of songs and repeated drills of guitar is made up for by it's compliments 
 of graphics, cut scenes, and out standing voice acting.

Review:  This game is surprising awesome. The addition of the new character, Nero, was a gamble but proved 
 to not suffer the same fate as Metal Gear Solid 2's, Raiden. Nero's, Devil Arm and Red Queen, brings 
 a new style of playing the game that was not previously available in other DMC games. The Devil 
 Arm is quite a powerful weapon that can be used to manhandle bosses and regular enemies alike. 
 When used in conjunction with the Devil Trigger, Nero deals massive amounts of damage. The Red 
 Queen can be powered up during game play which increases attack power and adds more detail and 
 style to the game. Dante is also playable but only for a limited amount of missions. He faces the 
 same bosses as Nero and goes back through the entire series of stages the Nero has passed. This 
 might be boring or uninspired to some people but I believe it shows gamers the difference in style, 
 technique, and game play options that Dante and Nero offer. Amazing cut scenes tell the story, 
 which is interesting, but you'll probably be more geared up to get back into the action. The only 
 downside to the game is that there are sometimes back camera angels where your character is being 
 blocked and you cannot change the camera. The game is very smooth and does not slow down (frame 
 rates) . I feel though that the PS3 version of the game runs more fluid then the 360 version but 
 both are equally amazing. Overall, a must have for any fan of the series and any gamer wishing 
 to get into the mix.

Review:  
  Having only played bits of the original DMC games I'm not at liberty to judge this game based on 
 it's series which I love to do with other (Rainbow 6) reviews.
  I can however judge this game based on its own merits which comes down to how long you can tolerate 
 playing the game. 
  You play as Nero at first, he has a sword with a motorbike accelerator handle instead of a hilt. 
 This is cool since you can "rev" up your sword for more damaging attacks, he also has a revolver 
 which doesn't need to be reloaded and really isn't that I good at killing things I found.
  So off you go to rescue your babe and stop the evil demons that have popped up in the city for 
 some reason which is blamed on Dante by your superiors. Of course it wouldn't be a Japanese game 
 if the plot wasn't so twisted that nothing is ever what it seems.
  About (exactly) half way through you suddenly swap to Dante who is a much more interesting character 
 with his selection of weapons and one liners. 
  Then comes the games biggest failure... you now have to back track through EVERY level and fight 
 EVERY (except one) boss in the same EXACT place you fought them the first time! This is mind boggling 
 development skills, sure I don't mind back tracking in games but only to get to new places and 
 find new areas. If I have to retrace my steps all the way to the start it just seems like if I 
 walked down to the shop (minus the demons and babes) and then walk back again.
  The graphics are pretty nice, with the normal Japaneses selection of disproportionate ladies, ugly 
 demons and prepubescent protagonists all rendered in lovely detail.
  The game play is pretty good since you can learn lots of combos to through your foes into the air 
 and then jump up and beat them into oblivion. The only annoying things is the enemies look unimpressive, 
 the first guys you fight are basically scarecrows. There also isn't enough violence in the game, 
 you can't chop your enemies up and they don't bleed nearly enough for a Japaneses game with swords. 
 Although the cut scenes which are even more pretty have a good chunk of crimson rain.
  There's is some fun to be had playing it repeatedly although the repetitiveness scared me away 
 quite quickly, there are lots of difficulties and secrets to unlock.
  My favorite thing in the whole game was the cut scenes involving Dante which are soooooo cheesy 
 and silly that they actually made my laugh in there sudden contrast to the rest of the game.
  In conclusion there is not much to like or hate about DMC4 it's really just an average game that 
 repeats its self too much and could be worth a rent.
  
  
  
  Ohhh and you get to beat up an old man which is always a plus!

Review:  devil may cry 4. where do i start. i was so content with this game that i played through the whole 
 13 hour game in one sitting without even getting up for a bathroom break. you play as nero a teenage 
 punk in who is somewhat outcasted in his very religeous city, the game starts off in a church ceramony 
 followed by dante pumping lead into the head clerigy, as nero you seek revenge to your city by 
 chasing dante through this 13 hour game, for one reason or another ( which i cannot say because 
 it may ruin a the game for some gamers) you enter aboards dantes side in order to bring down the 
 clergy, neros features of very different then many may be used to from previous dmc games. his 
 is a son of sparda just like dante and vergil, he contains this arm which is very powerful and 
 this motorized sword which u can rev up like a motorcycle, fans of dante will not be discontent 
 about halfway through the game you change sides and play as dante which whom picked up a few new 
 goodies in the game, the cinematics in this game in fantastic action scene are put together incredably 
 well which leave you with your jaws dropped .

Review:  My opinion is that this is a good game for people that like to let there inner demon loose. I think 
 the creaters could have cotten more creative about neros gun, the Blue Rose. First of all i dont 
 think poetic names like that suit a gun.
  Guns are suppose to be tools of destruction, so what the heck???
  
  Secondly I think the Exceed 
 feature was out of the box, and totally original... but I honestly dont see how reaving up the 
 handle of a sword is gonna make the damage go up, no matter what the mechanics of that sword are.
 
  
  There are a many problems that i could discuss with the automatic system, but i just dont have 
 the time right now.
  
  The devil bringer was a nice twist for once. Looks like Capcom is getting crafty.
  Lets move 
 to Dante... i couldnt have asked for a better Dante. I loved the new devil arms.
  But i do think they could have made more boss fights (and more interesting boss fights) .
  I didnt 
 like (even though it was with a different character) having to fight the same bosses over again, 
 and the boss fights were so predictable! I mean take a look at Devil May Cry III, the boss fights 
 are just completely random! (loved it!) . 
  But in DMC IV I was bored!! I mean they come straight out and tell you what you have to do (sure 
 i dont want a game were im lost ever five seconds but still) . 
  The animation was nice (Except for in the jungle (i know they call it a forest but it doesnt look 
 anything like a forest to me!) where the shadows were.... well, crappy) .
  The storyline is amazing!!!! (as expected from a game of the Devil May Cry series) .
  This is 
 the first game that i actually shed a tear or two.

Review:  DMC4 was a great game over all. i loved all of it the mix between Dante and Nero was perfect. just 
 having a new person to play Nero was a nice touch and it was different. Nero most def kicked some 
 ass!!! The Colors and sounds were perfect also the graphics were amazing. The sounds track wile 
 you are fighting demons gets u pumpt and just ready to kill. i really cant dis this game at all. 
 But the only thing that did get a little anoying was all the back tracking that you had to do. 
 but dont let that get you down their is alot of fighting and demon slaying to keep you up for hours. 
 All the up grades you can do to your swords and guns and devil trigger just makes you want to play 
 for hours and it wont get boring at all!!! Most def pick this up if you like fighting sword play 
 and demon slaying. The story line was nicely dun as well. But if you really want to get into the 
 story you should play devil may cry 3 first and that will give you some back round to the story 
 of DMC 4

Review:  The first thing you'll notice when playing through Devil May Cry 4 as Nero is that when the you 
 switch to Dante about half way through is that it just gets better. It's not that playing as Nero 
 is a bad or boring it's just that Dante has more attacks and weapons.
  
  I'll start with Nero. Playing Nero is good, the devil bringer arm is great when fully upgraded 
 and keeping combos is easier. With Nero Capcom decided to add more new characters and *gasp* Nero 
 has to rescue his love Kyrie. Capcom also added Credo (Kyrie's brother) , Gloria (a sexy, devil 
 hunter) , and Agnus ( a slightly wierd scientist, sporting a lisp.) The adding of new characters 
 liven the game up for some time. The devil bringer also allows you to do some seriously powerful 
 attacks on both normal demons and boss demons but as said before Dante plays better.
  
  Dante plays better as he's the character you've played in every Devil May Cry game so most die-hard 
 Devil May Cry players/fan/cultists (you know who you are) will feel more in the zone. The reason 
 for this is that Dante has different 'styles.' Styles are different 'skills' Dante has these include:
 
  
  Swordmaster: This style focuses entirely on making Dante's Devil Arms more powerful by giving them 
 a wider range of moves.
  
  Gunslinger: This style focuses on increasing the power of Dante's guns allowing him to put some 
 hurt on enemies from a distance. 
  
  Trickster: This style is based entirely on evasion and dodging out the way of attacks and enemies 
 in order to strike from a different angle.
  
  Royal Guard: This style focuses on the ability to block and counter attack as well as regain some 
 health.
  
  And a new comer:
  
  Darkslayer: This allows you to uses Yamato (the katana of Vergil) and can cause some serious damage 
 to bosses.
  
  The main difference between Devil May Cry 3's style system and this one is that it allows you to 
 switch instantly (while in the other you had to find a gold statue and switch there) this allows 
 much more variation and style points.
  
  The graphics in Devil May Cry 4 has also been overhauled compared to it's predecessors, but still 
 aren't brilliant and the gothic sound track is also quite good, if you enjoy that sort of thing.
 
  
  But the major problem with Devil May Cry 4 is that while playing as Dante you have to back track 
 through the entire game to kill all the 'Boss' Demons. Capcom makes up with it by giving you a 
 new 'Devil Arm.' these are weapons for those new to Devil May Cry. But some of these fall a bit 
 short of being as useful as Rebellion. Although Pandora is possibly the most overpowered gun in 
 the game, which allows you to turn it into a Bazooka, Laser, Spiny thingy of death and a missle 
 command centre, providing you are in Gunslinger mode. Devil form also makes a return and makes 
 you faster, stringer and to take more damage and it also restores some health.
  
  They have also made Devil May Cry 4 easier than 3 but harder modes can be unlocked later.
  
 
  Overall Devil May Cry 4 is a game full of great Demons and gameplay and shows us that repetitive 
 gameplay can be addictive, but is let down by backtracking and sometimes the story...
  
  Pro's
  
  -Addictive Gameplay
  -New character is intresting
  -Good Graphics
  -Dante Kicks 
 Ass
  -Loads to unlock
  
  Con's
  
  -Repetitive
  -Back Tracking alot
  -Story is a let down
  
  8/10.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is an outstanding game and one of the best ones out this year.
  The graphics are brilliant both PS3 and XBOX 360 are the same more or less.
  The game features 
 a new playable character (Nero) which you will enjoy playing as. Nero has got a 6 shooter Magnum 
 called The Blue Rose, a sword called Red Queen and a Devil Arm. The devil Arm is a new feature 
 to DMC, it can be used to grab items on some occasions, You can use it to do grappel moves on enemys 
 and bosses. Dante is also available to play in the game again to make it more enjoyable with new 
 weapons, styles (gunslinger, swordmaster etc.) and new powerups to buy in the shop menu. A new 
 feature in the game is proud souls. Proud souls are gained by finishing a mission, the higher your 
 rank in a mission the more proud souls you get. Another new feature is theatre mode. In theatre 
 mode you can watch cutscenes that you have unlocked in the game. I gave it a 10 because of how 
 much DMC has improve and its got an epic storyline.

Review:  Devil may cry 4 is spot on, its got the graphics, its got the cool music and most of all its got 
 the gameplay!!
  
  Devil may cry 4 has great combat, its fun and VERY addictive and will probaly have you coming back 
 to try and beat your last score! The game forces you to play as character named Nero, which as 
 far as i know is new to the devil may cry series but dont worry because you will get to play as 
 dante - This guy is not short on weapons, theres just more to do with dante.
  
  The story to devil may cry 4 is at best, standard for an action game, so dont go expecting an immersive 
 story or anything like that because thats not what this game is about, this game is about killing 
 hordes of mutant scarecrow thingys and for that it is great. But that said there is a story and 
 it holds up and keeps with the formula.
  
  The audio in devil may cry 4 is great, the catchy rock music that plays everytime you encounter 
 an enemy is great but wears thin fast as it is layed on really thickly, it will play everytime 
 you fight, but apart from that the rest of the games audio is good, when there is some!
  
  Playing devil may cry 4 is great, controls are simple and straightforward and are similiar to those 
 you find in beat em ups, Eg. hold left and press B, things like that, combination attacks. The 
 only problem i have with devil may cry 4 is u dont have anything to help guide you through a level 
 and because of this you will probaly find yourself running in the wrong direction, which is really 
 annoying but thats only a small flaw because once you have played a level a couple of times you 
 will remember where to go and what to do.
  
  Devil may cry 4 has stunning graphics, i mean it has amazing graphics, not many games come close 
 to this, and i dont think many will, environments look colourful and detailed, whilst bosses and 
 main characters look stunning also, all i can say is a lot of work when in to this games visuals! 
 
  
  On the whole devil may cry 4 is great, it has plenty of replay value, unlockables and a few diffulculties 
 to choose from which can provide one heck of a challenge. Just make sure you have a lot of spare 
 time because this game will probaly take up most of it.

Review:  Devil may cry 4 is one of those games were you wait so long and track the days gone by waiting 
 the game and when you pick it up are surprised. The surprise in this case is not to do with the 
 story or the general gameplay from a combat or interaction stand point but rather the level design. 
 The first half when you play as Nero, although not as seen maybe as highly regarded as Dante is 
 rather the more interesting part of the game. This is mainly due to story being driven by the majority 
 of the events focused on him. 
  
  As far as the story goes the game offers an interesting saga to the franchise but in some places 
 fails to explain background to the new devil hunter. My main problem was really who is Nero? As 
 far as i can tell there is no backdrop into were the devil bringer comes from, his past with the 
 characters like Credo and Kyrie. Also how he is able to harness the power of Yamato. This confused 
 me as then is he the offspring of Vergil or someone else related to Dante as Sanctus refers to 
 him having the blood of Sparda in him (sorry for spoiler) . And also how does Yomato get in the hands 
 of the order? These slight details left out are the only disappointments i see when it comes to 
 story. Dante's story seems to pretty straight forward and sadly when it comes to main story takes 
 a slightly backseat in the story to its main events. This is not to completely say he could of 
 been left out but rather just could of been better utilized when it came to story. 
  
  As for gameplay, the combat is just as fast and furious as ever if not even slightly more crazy 
 with the introduction of the devil bringer. At first i missed it when i switched to Dante but level 
 4 trickster fixed that with the warp ability :P The array of weapons is just as grand as any of 
 the older devil may cry games. Other great combat features that return are the devil bringer which 
 in Nero's case makes his devil bringer attacks even stronger. An improvement to Dante's style system 
 comes too i the form of on the fly changeability which offers great combo opertunities. 
  
  The disappointment here is that when it comes to switching to Dante you basically do everything 
 Nero does in reverse order! This slightly effects the experience as we are not introduced to new 
 environments exclusive to Dante but rather just backtrack and fight the same bosses with a few 
 differences toward the end of the game. What makes this less of a burden is that the fact that 
 boss fights as so god dam fun!
  
  As for the cut scenes, the game has some fantastic visuals which are on par when it comes to fancy 
 acrobatics like that in previous game. This cut scenes do a fantastic job in moving the story's 
 plot and express the character's emotions over certain events.
  
  No doubt I've forgot to mention something but as it stands the game is a great addition to a great 
 series. If your like myself you will play this game through a few times and come back to it at 
 a later stage. Fans of the series will enjoy this installment of devil slaying action despite the 
 veteran devil hunter taking a back when it comes to story.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4... well, let's start with how happy I was to hear that this game was coming to the 
 360, I was ecstatic. So this time you play as this guy Nero, he's a demon, but doesn't really know 
 it (at least I think he doesn't know for the first part of the game) . I don't want to spoil the 
 story (yes there is a story) , but let's say that you chase down someone, find out they're good, 
 then find out someone else is bad.... maybe that spoiled it.
  
  Graphics - 9/10- Good god, great graphics AND an incredibly smooth framerate? WOWZA! lol. Anyway, 
 this game looks better then it's predecessors (of course) and uses the 360s graphical power well, 
 it even delivers a solid 60 FPS.
  
  Sound -7/10 - Well, the soundtrack is sort of lacking of that DMC feel, that, or it sounds the 
 same as it did in DMC3. there are some few tracks that sound decent, the rest sound... well you 
 decide.
  I thought the voice overs were done well (as always) , Nero sounded convincing, so did Dante, and 
 all the other characters. 
  
  Gameplay - 10/10 - This is where the Devil May Cry series always shines. There are a number of 
 combos for you to master for the playable characters. Nero's Devil Bringer (freaky arm) is awesome, 
 it allows you to pull enemies toward you and basically unleash hell on them. As always you can 
 link combos together and rank up stylish points. You'll get a grade as always, this time they're 
 called "Deadly, Carnage, Blast, Atomic, Smokin', Smokin' Style, Smokin' Sick Style.
  
  
  
  Overall, this game has a TON of replay value for those DMC fans, I think there are about 5 
 or 6 difficulty settings to play on once you've unlocked them, you can also unlock other version 
 of the characters, as well as the Bloody Palace, a gallery, and some artwork.
  
  This game is a rent at least, if you want to just play it once for the story and some cool graphics/gameplay. 
 If you want to unlock everything, I suggest buying it.

Review:  Bet ya this is one hell of a game.
  
  Straight from the very beginning of the game it has the feel of that capcom elegance, cool story 
 with a long coated main character. That is also the main problem it feels all the same. I`m new 
 to the series so I shouldn`t complain but I`ve played other games of capcom in the same genre like 
 castlevania. And all the things that makes that game good is in here DMC 4.
  Hard to kill and great variety of bosses a bunch of unlockable modes to play and a character switch. 
 The character switch is great Dante differs total at fighting from Nero. Now I`ve praised capcom 
 for enough lets turn to the graphical design. I`m really dissapointed that Nero looks very and 
 I mean very a like Dante. However it has cool looking envirnoments wich has its own problem because 
 if you play it for the second time it really feels repetitive with harder to kill enemies on later 
 stages this can be really a point crack this game down. But the good thing is everything from the 
 platform your standing till the air it is all high quality textures, even the clothes are realistic 
 created.
  
  A issue at wich I hate games are cut scenes but with japanese games there are mostly nice looking 
 enjoyable sometimes even humorous cutscenes and thank god that this game has it.
  
  gameplay is perfect it feels like it has meant to be this way so you dont hear me complaining about 
 that.
  
  Camera hardly gets annoying even if you try to get a bad camera it shows loyal Nero/Dante in view 
 of your screen.
  
  Verdict: a must by game or at least rent it if you aren`t a hack an slash fan.

Review:  If I wanted to point out a flaw I would have to spend a good bit off time looking, the game was 
 like a work of art. I had avoided the series due to freinds simply telling me it was ridiculously 
 difficult, and while I am no lazy gamer, I wont buy a game that will only make me mad. After all, 
 video games are games, and games shouldn't make you angry.
  
  I can say the cutscenes were just great, I was just really impressed with how it seemed to turn 
 what I have scene as of late into near trash. The normal game play graphics had me grinning like 
 a mad man as I swept my way through the hordes of angry, sometimes Nightmare Before Christmas-esque 
 demons (the basic enemy with the single bladed limb looks like oogie-boogie when you are third 
 person view mid-battle) 
  
  The fighting mechanic was surprisingly interesting, I can't make up my mind as to whether to say 
 easy or difficult due to the speed I seemed to pick up on it. I was extremely awkward at first, 
 and tried to keep to attacks I could easily remember, but when I did start trying more I found 
 that although it takes a little thought, you learn fast enough to make it work out.
  
  For the first time I have dived into the world of Devil May Cry I feel like I have really gotten 
 something rewarding out of it, I just loved it. I almost know another might come out, this seems 
 like a series that still has the juice to keep it going. Now, I think I am off to look into the 
 rest of the series.

Review:  I read about this game in a magazine before it came out. I didnt reserve it but i still wanted 
 it. When i bought it i wasnt expecting to mutch out of it. Usually game that have 4 or like final 
 fantasy, can be bad, or basically the same as the other ones. When i played this i was amazed. 
 It so so mutch better then the 8 score it was given. The graphics were bauetifull. The story was 
 amazing. The characters were so well designed and they all had there different emoitions. The fighting 
 was also amazinfg. All the level up were awsome and it was just perfect. I give this a 10 because 
 nothing it wrong with it. I have no clue why its and 8. Its fun, hard, funny, and its just perfect. 
 This should be the game of the year and it should be ranked higher then an 8. Its long also. Even 
 when you beat the game, more modes and games are unlocked and you find yourself going back and 
 playing them again. Its so fun, i would trade in all my games if i had to, to buy this one. Its 
 so great. The character swich between nero and danta its perfect. They both also have different 
 styles and fighting ways. Its great and its kinda a challange to get the hang of Danta after playing 
 with nero so much, but even that is perfect, i give this a 10, game of the year, and the most amazing 
 game ever in the history of games and science and life.

Review:  Ok devil may cry 4 great game lets roll.
  
  Story:
  You play in the begin as Nero a fighter of the order of the sword you fight against demon and protect 
 the people. But then a mysterious fighter comes in and kills the leader. You are sent on a path 
 to kill him. On the way you get to know more about the order and their false intentions. The story 
 is really great good voice acting and good script. Though the lines arent really always smart and 
 funny. Its actually your average devil may cry story with boss fights and great script.
  
  Gameplay:
  The gameplay is really good. There are a hell lot of combo's and you'll want them 
 all. But Nero just doesnt feel really good he doesnt have as much attacks as Dante and not so cool 
 attacks as Dante but dont worry Dante offers great fun and Nero isnt bad. The puzzles are to simple 
 and can be annoying on higher difficulties. The camera can sometimes let you down but no worries 
 devil may cry 4 has a great gameplay.
  
  Extra:
  The game is about 10 hours depending on your skills but if your a true devil may cry fan you'll 
 finish it quick and go to Dante must die mode. You still have the secret missions and bloody palace 
 and more modes so you can be busy for a long while. The difficulty is actually not so hard on the 
 hardest mode its good for newcomers and for fans but it can be a little dissapointing since the 
 orbs can help you to much. The graphics were an extra to my cause i didnt really pay a lot of time 
 thinking of it they are just great and nothing wrong with them.
  
  Conclusion:
  For fans its a must buy and if you didnt like devil may cry you still might to want and give it 
 a shot
  
  Story: 8.5
  
  Gameplay: 9
  
  Extra: 9.5

Review:  This game (visually talking) looks beautiful. I loved the game play and the action involved in 
 this sequel of DMC. And dont worry if you havent played the previous DMC, this title does not 
 require you to do so. In fact once you finish the game you will able to read a summary of Dantes 
 history :)
  
  The main ingredient which makes this game so addictive is the fast attack speed of Nero and Dante 
 (Dante being the fastest) . The music gives a great environment to the fight sequences that makes 
 a lot easier your immersion in the fights. 
  
  Not only the graphics but the history is very good. Once I started playing, I could not stop. The 
 game is not that long and this makes the game more appealing to re-play it. If you are thinking 
 about it, do not hesitate, go ahead and buy this title you wont regret. You will get: Amazing 
 Graphics, great sound, good story, and evil bosses waiting for you to destroy them.

Review:  Simple! A very good game!
  Devil May Cry was always one of the best series of Action of all time. It may be repetitive, but 
 not enjooa ever. Devil May Cry 4 is a game for Xbox 360, PS3 and PC, which is extremly similar 
 with the other, but of course there is news. Beginning with the possibility of playing with 2 very 
 different character, with different powers, Nero, the beginner and Dante, the veteran. The Scenarios 
 are the same for both, plus the Nero goes back and Dante. First begins with the adventures with 
 Nero, which has a Pistol, 3 Canos, Espada''Moto Hand''and the Demon. After Heads Interesantes Well, 
 the character changes. It is the time of Dante. The gameplay is much better with him with Dante, 
 but in return is much more difficult. Dante is also better because he has more weapons and is more 
 stylish \ o \
  The Game Rating is 10 and deserves to be played.

Review:  The Devil may cry series has always had alot of boss fights and action and this is no different 
 with two characters Nero and Dante to play as and many difficulty levels the game is going to keep 
 you occupied even with no multiplayer.
  
  This has a awesome story it starts off with everyone in church listening to a old guy and out of 
 now where Dante jumps through the roof and well kills the old guy and then after a few cut scenes 
 you'll have a boss fight don't worry it's not a serious battle just a easy one.
  
  This is a game you will be playing even after finishing it because of the achievements the game 
 has some of the shortest load times i've ever seen in a game especially with the graphics. so please 
 do yourself a favour and buy this game for your xbox 360 you'll have so much fun cause if you dont 
 the devil will cry.

Review:  So, it's a good game, but it is completely ruined by a couple things. Mainly, it's because once 
 you play through the first 11 stages as Nero [who is just as cool as dante] you have to play through 
 those exact same stages in reverse order as dante. You even fight the same bosses. The game has 
 good graphics, sound, and basic gameplay, but the story is just hard to follow.

Review:  The great thing about DMC4 is simply the fact that it's SOOO Devil May Cry! 
  
  Fans of the series should be chuffed with this rendition, crisp graphics, not a bad storyline, 
 great cut sequences, good surround sound and a SERIOUS amount of hacking and slashing! 
  
  If you're new to the series, to put it simply, it's 'hack n slash' at its best. You could call 
 it a gothic fantasy ninja gaiden if you like. 3rd person fighting with waves of enemies and loads 
 of combos and weapon changes. 
  
  I'm quite a fan of this game, and found it pretty enjoyable. Word of warning though, I'm a big 
 gamer and yet never, NEVER have I got such bad thumb ache!!! Yep it's button smashing crazy to 
 the extent that your fingers start to die, in particular your left thumb joint, so give it a break 
 now and then! Maybe it was just my rubbish thumb but I can't remember the last time I got rsi like 
 it, anyone remember Atari console joystick wiggling!
  
  In terms of graphics, Capcom deliver, as always. Crisp enough to look great on a big screen, and 
 yet a decent framerate. 
  As per the other DMCs the design of the game is gorgeous, fantastically rendered enemies, especially 
 the bosses. But it's the architecture of the surroundings as well. You can ALWAYS tell a DMC game 
 by the wickedly gothic backdrops, nice one Capcom.
  
  The sound of the game is good also, quite immersive music sometimes, with perfect sound FX. It's 
 also pretty decent in surround sound. 
  
  Halfway through the game, it unfortunately gets into a mega repetitive rut. You find yourself going 
 up and down the map, through the same parts, same respawn of enemies. GRRRRR!!! Did anyone get 
 lost in that annoying garden?????
  
  Anyway bear with it , trust me. The game suddenly goes into nitro and fires up with a brilliant 
 second half. The bossess are good fun, and Human Mode is just right for newbies. Anymore and your 
 thumbs will never forgive you. 
  
  To conclude, DMC is a brand to recognise, and this game is a great addition to the series. It's 
 not groundbreaking but it's also not rubbish. It's all round great viewing and an enjoyable purchase. 
 Well done Capcom, keep it up!!!! 8.5 / 10

Review:  "Devil May Cry 4" ups the action amp from the DMC 3 combat engine courtesty of the power of next-gen 
 consoles. No, it doesn't dethrone the king of action-combat fighters "Ninja Gaiden", but it's still 
 the best combo-filled action-adventure since last year's "God of War II". This is perhaps the most 
 enjoyable DMC ever due to the more casual difficulty (no punishment for newbies!!) , the best story 
 in the series and of course, the combat mechanics which have been refined. Even the cutscenes are 
 better than the over-the-top, cheesy ones shown in the last entry.
  
  Nero is the new hero in DMC 4 and has an ever helpful demonic hand that makes fights unfold faster 
 with quick smash 'n grabs. The new moves, weapons and purchasing features along with the ability 
 to play as Dante help make this latest, great looking (the visuals are awesome) game a complete 
 joy to play. Fans will not be disappointed!

Review:  Dante is back with an Emo wanna be named NERO. 
  
  Grpahics are great, and the gameplay is EASY. Much easier then DMC 3. 
  
  The Highlights include 
 new powers including "devil bringer" and spectacular, over the top, Boss battles.
  
  The negatives would have to be the same ole' same ole' when it comes to the DMC series. Fans of 
 the series will love this game. However if you are NOT a DMC fan, do NOT buy this game. Rent it 
 first.
  
  The same things that annoyed you before, will annoy you here. Odd and un-needed shifts in camera 
 angles, as well as un-wanted repetition will have you cursing CAPCOM and CAPCOMS mother. You may 
 even find yourself having nightmares that involve copious amounts of red orbs.
  
  Japanese anime, combined with B movie over acting and demons. Bad, evil, nasty demons are what 
 this game is all about.
  
  The ending leaves many questions unanswered and is very similar to the ending in the original DMC.

Review:  Alright, I'll admit it. Picking this game up, I was more than skeptical about Nero. I seriously 
 couldn't help thinking, "When will I get to play Dante?"
  
  All of those thoughts went away as soon as I started playing. 
  
  Nero was a far better character 
 than I had expected and it was immensely fun to play with his arm. So much so that when I got to 
 Dante, I got so frustrated when he didn't have Nero's arm. 
  
  Nero was a brilliant character play, and, after playing him, playing Dante isn't nearly as much 
 fun as it used to be.
  
  Nevertheless, Dante remained awesome and equally equipped for battle. It's still some of the most 
 fun you'll ever have, just beating up those bosses feeling as though you're the coolest thing ever. 
 
  
  As for the actual game, the storyline is easy to get into and gets you through the game itching 
 to know more. 
  
  The cut scene graphics are great, and the in game graphics are still of the best I've seen. It 
 feels like you're in the cut scene. 
  
  The demons and bosses are all unique and require some sort of strategy to beat. 
  
  
  Despite 
 what some may say, I wasn't all that frustrated with backtracking. As much as I kept thinking, 
 "Not this again", you get far too into it for it to matter all that much. You just go out there 
 and kick some butt. 
  
  Of course, not all is happy and fun in the game, one thing that constantly bugged me throughout. 
 The camera. My god did that infernal thing frustrate me. (hah, pun.) Most of the time it didn't 
 really effect the most crucial moments, such as during a fight, but, when it did... you want nothing 
 more than to throw the controller at the TV. 
  
  Despite that, the game pulled through spectacularly. I recommend it to any fans of the first three, 
 or anyone who's into a good game with loads of fighting.

Review:  Capcom have done it again!!
  
  with this very stylish game!
  you start as new comer Nero and his mysterious arm!! which you come to find out about as you progress 
 throu the game.
  He has an aray of combo's and attacks to tortally kick ass!! and got a temper to match those skills, 
 but no where in Dante's league!!.
  Who you will have to fight too, and he;'s no push over!!!!
  
  I'm a little disappointed that 
 you only use Dante for 8 level's, after all he's the hero of the game it's HIS GAME!!!!. which 
 you have to fight back through the bosses you've already beaten with Nero!!.
  
  Over all a well good game!!!. had a great soundtrack sang by the same guy who sang the DMC3 soundtrack 
 (Shawn McPherson) Scootie G.
  any fan of the Devil May Cry series will no be disappointed with this game!!
  I just can't wait 
 for DMC5 to take off where DMC4 left us!!
  
  Come on CAPcom, kick some more ass!!
  
  Reveiwed by me

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is a really good game. The new character Nero is. well sadly to say way more bad 
 @ss than Dante if you can believe that. He has some really neat abilities. But don't get me wrong 
 Dante also has a bunch of new things he can do as well but you will miss the Demon Arm. Play the 
 game and you'll know what that means lol. It's not all that hard but you can set it to harder levels. 
 There are some pretty neat Achievements in it to. The game play is smooth as it gets and the graphics 
 are really impressive. When you get to the forest that is one of the best looking parts of the 
 game. The voice acting is done well as is pretty much every other thing about this game. The story 
 is good and keeps you playing. And for the guys that are into hot virtual chicks this game is rite 
 up you're ally. ;p lol So on that note. GO GET THIS GAME!!!

Review:  Its finally here devil may cry 4 for the 360 and PS3, all DMC fans will love this game. There is 
 a bunch of new content espicially nero who can pull off a bunch of moves but he kinda steels the 
 spot light from dante and dantes my man. ANYWAYS the gameplay is awesome its deep rewarding and 
 fast paced. The graphics are the best our there for rite now except for maybe assasins creed. But 
 u still get to play as dante so yea-even though ur going through the places Nero went to its still 
 fun and its part of the story. Btw the story is pretty good even tho i didnt really get it. Capcom 
 should have put in a co-op but im still kinda ok with that. The game is fairly lengthy in devil 
 huntermode considering how long action games r these days. The bosses r great- u fight some of 
 them up 2 3 times but its part of the story and its still funnish. Cammera can be bad but u can 
 get over it. 
  GOOD
  1. Nice deep fast paced action
  2. Sweet sweet graphics
  3. A swell storry
  4. Nero is a great addition.
  5. Dante can now switch styles on the go
 
  6. Has tons of replay value
  7. MANY MANY MORE
  Bad. 
  1. you repeat places u go 2 w/ dante and nero
  2. u fight each boss 3 times
  3. camera can 
 suck
  4. no co-op
  Other then that nothing really
  So Every 1 w/ a next gen system should do every1 a favor and buy this game. I really wish they'd 
 make a DMC 5 (hint capcom hint)

Review:  Devil may cry 4 is a great adition to the legendary action series. The graphics are great and vary 
 greatly. the action is great but can get repedative especialy boss fights. over all great game 
 and great adition to any action gamer's collection. 
  
  The graphics in this game are very good on alot of aspects. the character models are very detailed 
 and the enviroments are differant and detailed as well. the animations are very nice and are cool 
 to watch. the game has asolid frame rate and i have experince absolutely no slowdowns.
  
  The audio is great as well. the music sits nicely behind the action being not to loud or not to 
 quiet. the effects are very good and the voice acting is amazing. i swear though that ive heared 
 nero's voice somewhere else though, anyway audio is just a good as the visuals
  
  Ahh the gameplay this where it all matters, this makes the game great but handicaps it at the same 
 time. the action that it delivers is great, but the boss fights and some backtracking get repedative 
 and tedious. the combos are easy to pull of and the moves are just as easy and deliver maximun 
 damage with minimal skill on the easiest difficulty and the automatic function turned on.
  
  Overall this game is great and its only major drawback is its repeditive boss fights and some 
 minor backtracking.
  
  
  9/10

Review:  It's a pretty good game. Playing with Nero does bring a breath of fresh air to the DMC series. 
 Beautiful graphics, great controls, and interesting storyline. The new battle animations when you 
 use the Devil Bringer are great. 
  That's about it after that. Playing with Dante wasn't as exciting as I had hoped even with some 
 of the new weapons. The smart mouthed comments that both characters spit out is getting kind of 
 old and.... corny. 
  The boss battles are pretty good the first time but after that, it's pointless. The platforming 
 aspects and puzzles kill the flow of the game and are basically pointless. No real replay value. 
 After the first finish, there's no reason to go back and play again. 
  For the big DMC fan, this is the best game in the series. For other games, this is a good rental 
 and will hold you over until the next big game comes out. I hope that DMC 5 will reinvent the series 
 and make me want to play again.

Review:  From an even perspective, this is a must play game for any player. I can understand why DMC enthusiasts 
 like myself, are dissapointed with the challenge level. We will say that it's a great game, but 
 it is no DMC3.
  
  Aside from the challenge level, it was smart for Capcom do reduce the difficulty of the game to 
 attract more players. I didn't understand why other people were put off by DMC 3's difficutly, 
 when I absorbed it as a challenge. If a great RPG like Oblivion came out, and I couldn't escape 
 the first level, I would fail to see the greatness that comes in the game. 
  
  Hopefully, Capcom will release some DLC on Live to make Dante Must Die seem like a cakewalk to 
 DMC enthusiasts.
  
  From a non-biased view (abit biased) , this is a great game overall, and should not dissapoint newcombers 
 to the series, and hopefully the DMC fanatics will take it with a grain of salt.
  
  Thumbs Up.

Review:  Dispite Gamespots review for the game, I personnaly believe this game is one for the year.
  
  This one introduces a new character Nero. Not your regular Dante, he is still an amazing character. 
 He has the Devil Bringer Arm, which is a powerful attack. Use it in combos to have an advantage 
 over the enemy. It is also useful in Boss Battles. This is also where you should be using it when 
 the boss is down, for an amazing attack sequence, and damaging the boss. 
  The next weapon Nero has is his sword. This sword has a unique ability. It can rev up to provide 
 and even more damaging attack. Using this wisely can boost up your combo, and give you more points. 
 
  Last weapon of Nero is his gun. Stylish, but just regular gun.
  
  It's detailed, and well written storyline fits perfectly where the last one left off. The story 
 takes place in a town that worships the demon lord Sparta. This of course brings demons and such 
 to the town. 
  
  The graphics are truely next gen. Running at an astonishing 60FPS, this game looks like a movie. 
 Over my time playing the game, I have never ran into a situation where the frame rate drops. Along 
 with the graphics, is the sound. Accurate sounds to every point, hit or crash in the game. 
  
  The only thing that may upset the player is playing the bosses more then once. Although, in 
 my view, this provides the player to try new combos available from the store. 
  
  Lastly, is the cut scene. Seriously, I pissed my pants watching these cut scene. Amazing dialogue, 
 corography, and the jokes make this game worth a movie. 
  
  I highly recommend this game, for all players of all genres. This game is one for the books.

Review:  It was a saturday in the year 2006, I was invited to my friends to play ps2 and he showed me a 
 game called devil may cry 3. From that day on my life changed forever, I was a dmc fan from top 
 to bottom, now I'm not here to talk about dmc 3, but I DO want to stress how good it was. Now 2 
 years later, the long long long awaited devil may cry 4 is out. It is good? hell yes, is it better 
 than dmc 3? sorry, but NO NO NO!! I've finished all difficulties and is currently S'ing all the 
 missions. And I'm only going say what I don't like about the game, if you want the good part, go 
 find other reviews thanks....
  First of all the graphics. Now I'm not a graphics fan, and seriously, every next-gen graphics for 
 me have passed my standard, so I've got nothing much to say about this. It's good, you want more? 
 I've got no more to say, well I'm pissed about the developer making everything in the room destructible, 
 it's the stupidest thing they've ever done in dmc 4 and I'll talk about that later.
  As we all know the new charactor in the series is nero, yeah the story pretty typical and standard 
 with nothing much going on, but they really should have gone deeper into nero's side story and 
 his devil bringer arm. Red Queen, nero's sword, is one of the best aspects in dmc 4, with its act-ex 
 and max-ex, it truely separated boys from men. And his trusty pistol, Blue Rose, is actually really 
 powerful when it comes to charge attacks against bosses. And of course the devil bringer, the DB 
 is truely a disapointment for me, before the game realease, capcom focuses so much on the devil 
 bringer, saying how it can be used to do all kinds of stuffs and sh*t like that. But this arm is 
 lacking, grim grip and buster, the only two moves the devil bringer has, sure they are useful, 
 but that's it! ONE sword, ONE gun and an arm with two available moves. Sure the sword has a ton 
 of moves, but a bit of variety could have helped a lot. Now let's talk about the devil bringer, 
 let's just say it's got absolutely no effect on the plot what so ever, all is does is help nero 
 kill off bad guys, the game never explain what is in the arm, how nero got it ect ect.... grim grip 
 is cool because it saved you the trouble of having to walk towards your enemy, but the buster is 
 really kind of a beating for me. Especially during boss fights, gone is the creativeness and strategies 
 you'll need during boss fights in dmc 3, now pretty much everything revolves around the DB, every 
 boss fight is like this, fight the boss, wear it down, get close and use buster, watch nero do 
 his crazy moves and bam!! the boss rebounds and you repeat the same thing again. When bustering 
 a boss, there's this really long animation showing nero just annilating the boss, kinda like.... kinda 
 like.... god of war? *gasp*...... Now that's just great.... of course in higher difficulties, it's 
 harder to buster the boss but it's kinda the same deal. Which breaks the formula I grew to love 
 in dmc 3, is it bad thing? who knows, but personally, I don't dig it.
  Now where will dmc be without dante, now I'm a dante fan, the coolest thing about dante is his 
 different styles, and now you can have all four of them (five actually) at the same time *gasp*, 
 and now you can carry 3 swords and 3 guns at the same time *gasp*, but wait.... oh..... there're 
 ONLY 3 swords and 3 guns for dante. And they actually took out some of the signature moves for 
 dante, triple dash, wall run, free ride... and where the hell is my DT explosion?!?!? Guns played 
 a much more important role in dmc 4 now, the shotgun is much more powerful and shoots much faster 
 in mid air, and the pandora... oh.... the pandora, the first time I saw that things in action, I 
 stared at the screen and just screamed: WTF?!?!? Don't get me wrong I think the weapon design is 
 awesome. Speaking of weapons, the way dante gets his weapons is kinda obsurd, after dante defeats 
 a demon, he goes toward the demon gate and a weapon is just put there for him to take, and he takes 
 it to blow the gate up... ok, sounds logical... but the weapons don't logically relate to the boss 
 dante fought at all, you kill echina (the viper) and you get a gaunlet? er... ok... makes sence... you 
 kill berial, a huge bull-like demon surrounded in burning flame and wields a huge flaming sword, 
 and you get a thing that shoots exploding arrows? alright... if you insist... but then you kill dagon, 
 a frickin TOAD, and you get a brief-case that turns into a bazooka/boomaran/laser cannon?!?! The 
 bosses don't connect to the weapons in any way, I mean in dmc 3 the weapons countain the souls 
 of the defeated bosses and the weapons still countains the element of the original boss, but here 
 it just doesn't make any sence, and there still no logical explaination to why the hell would someone 
 just put a weapon in front of the hell gate to let someone blow it up....
  The level design's standard, but the repetitation just baffles me, now I don't complain about back-tracking, 
 but fighting three bosses three times in the exacly same place pretty much spells repetitive for 
 me. Good thing that the bosses are cool and all. But the final boss is just lame.... just LAME I 
 tells you. The sanctus flies all over the place using LAME moves like fireball and thunder, and 
 he's so easy to beat, and when I was thinking the way he dashes around with the sparta sword was 
 actually pretty cool, I realized I can buster THAT too.... and that spells the end for the lamest 
 end boss I've ever fought, wait there's more, then we have another very stupid scripted fight against 
 the false savior which capcom is probably trying to make an epic ending battle but it ends in less 
 than a minute, lame, just lame...... Oh and I almost forgot, remember when I said it's stupid when 
 they make everything destructible, yeah it's stupid and pointless.... and very VERY annoying. Why? 
 Well that bringers us to another of my complaint, the grading system, gone is dmc 3's 5 categories 
 grading, now we have only 3, time, style, and orb. I won't say too much about the others but the 
 orb part is just annoying as HELL. Things in the game are destructible and have red orbs in them, 
 and getting them actually effects the orb category in the end. So I actually spend a lot of time 
 just trashing every chair, table, pole or whatever in the room. It's so tedious and pointless, 
 and even the secretly HIDDEN orbs count. So I have to spend time jumping around stages, wrecking 
 chairs, collecting orbs while all I should be doing is fighting! Also other than the 3 categories 
 we have bonus and penalties, and if you count these in too, it's actually harder to get a high 
 grade in dmc 4 than dmc 3. Oh and guess what, no SS grade, just what the hell man, back in dmc 
 3, an SS grade in dmd mode is like everyone's greatest goal, now no matter how hard you fight, 
 all you get is an S... 
  Ok.... that's it, that's all the complaints I've got, don't get me wrong the game is still very 
 good by a high standard, but where dmc 3 succeeded: the details, dmc 4 failed miserably, it looks 
 great, the controls are great, dante is still as cool and corny and cheezy as ever, the boss fights 
 are great. but there are still things that went wrong with the game as I have talked about above. 
 And the sad thing is all of these problems can be summed up with one word: LAZY... So reviews said 
 there's not enough new things in dmc4, so? If it's not broken why fix it? I would rather play dante 
 with the exact same 5 weapons in dmc 3 than play with 2 new weapons, new things are great... but 
 why take out the good old stuffs? They really don't have to, I've waited 2 years for this, and 
 I expected more, and the unlockable? What a joke, they actually made in-game cutscenes and game 
 informations unlockables, where are those cool video clips and hidden customs back in dmc 3? I 
 want those back, they won't make the game bad just gives it a little more style, and is that a 
 bad thing?!? I don't think so. Play it, but don't ge t you hopes up too high, thinking it's gonna 
 be a classic action game like dmc1 and dmc3, cause dmc4 will never reach that standard, maybe another 
 special edition will help, but there's really no excuse for this kind of laziness...

Review:  Devil May cry series has entertained its fans beyond imagination. With its stylish and fast paced 
 action, it is one of the best hack n slash game to be released in the market. The series is also 
 known for its graphics and DMC4 completley shakes the ground off with spellbounding graphics and 
 amazing textures. Hence, it is one of the best looking games to arrive on the xbox 360 and the 
 ps3.
  
  In the start of the game, u r given control of a new character who very much resmbles Dante in 
 his attire. Equipped with a demonic arm, Nero has the power to kill waves of demons with his trusted 
 sword Red Queen. In the start, we him one on one with Dante and at that point, u will want to look 
 again and again at the cutscenes and admire the action which is fast paced and also stylish. The 
 story starts with Dante killing a few holy knights and preist and people are left to ponder wheather 
 dante has joined the ranks of a demon. To find out more, Nero leaves the city in search of Dante 
 and find out what the young son of Sparda is upto.
  
  Along the way, u will fight waves of demons who will get tougher and tougher as u wil proceed forward. 
 The formula of Divinity statues is the same as it was in the previous games. U will get orbs as 
 u kill enemies and those orbs will be used to buy health packs or other majical abilities.
  At the end of each level, u will be given a certain rank according to the quality of your style 
 as well as the time u spent to complete the level. U will also be given proud souls according to 
 the rank u acheieved and they will be used to buy sword upgrades as well as devil bringer upgrades.
 
  
  Speaking of devil bringer, its a powerful demonic arm which Nero possesses. It is capable of lifting 
 up enemies and smashing them to the ground with hard force. According to the size of the enemies, 
 u will either be able to bring them over to you or go towards them. The demonic arm is the main 
 difference between Nero and Dante. True, u will get pretty attached to it and it will be difficult 
 for u to switch back to Dante in the middle of the game. Yes! U will be given control of Dante 
 in halfway of the game but that will be for only two to three levels.
  
  The boss fights in Devil May Cry are lengthy. Boss are well designed and every boss is tougher 
 than the one before. But the problem occurs over here. U will have to face some of these bossess 
 twice or thrice. That gets pretty frustrating when u see the burning huge demon again and again. 
 When given control of Dante, u hace to go across those same levels again and that gets pretty boring. 
 In my dictionary, this sort of gameplay is called repitive gameplay. It gets pretty frustrating 
 and that is the main drwback of Devil May Cry 4.
  
  If u played the previous games, u will wonder what sort of sword does Nero has? Is nero epuipped 
 with Devil Trigger. Well, Nero has a sword named red queen which is equibbed with a powerful new 
 ability of exceed. U will be able to burn your sord with hot flames by using the exceed power. 
 By pressing LT your sword will start to bun. There r basically three levels of exceed. The third 
 level is the most dangerous one which has its own stockpile of moves which inflict a painful amount 
 of damage on the enemies. 
  
  Nero also has a revolver called Blue rose. To tell the truth, this revolver is useless. Not totally 
 but mostly, u will be depending either on ur arm or ur trusted sword to wipe out the countless 
 waves of demons. I played the whole game without upgrading the blue rose.
  
  I ended the game in 6.5 arms. Some may take a little longer. The game has two difficulty settings 
 and i reccomend u guys to play the Devil Trigger difficulty bcoz it is not that much difficult. 
 U will certainly enjoy this game. After u have ended it, u will keep asking for more.
  
  In short, Devil May Cry 4 lives up to its potential. Though it gets repitive some while later, u 
 will have a blast playing it till the very end. So pleaseuy this game and u will see that I was 
 not wrong!

Review:  Devil may cry has been one of those series now one can forget expect for number 2 though you may 
 not care for the story ill tell you about it anyway u play as Nero a young blades man in a mysterious 
 order just a day day when holy **** Dante shows up and kills your leader then he coolest action 
 seen ever in the history of mad pops up but the rest you could forget about
  
  Nero has your standard gun and blade but the coolest addition is his devil bringer which can grab 
 pull and help with puzzles and platforming graphics and slick and combos are brutal u the single 
 best thing in the game is its game play hard to master but so sastifying there are 2 difficultly 
 levels and more unlockable ones but I suggest easy which will take 10-15 hours but if you try every 
 difficulty level you have yourself a game that will last

Review:  The Good: Great new characters and story, wonderful graphics and music, perfects the DMC formula
 
  
  The Bad: Same thing we've seen three times already, repeated bosses isn't fun, can get very very 
 hard at the end
  
  I was so jazzed about DMC4 that I thought Capcom was going to revamp the series, but I was wrong. 
 Instead we get DMC3 with a little next-gen flair. The only main thing you'll notice are the new 
 characters (Gloria is a major hottie) and the new story. You play the first half of the game as 
 Nero: A gloomy version of Dante who has a new Devil Bringer which can grab foes and slam them around 
 everywhere. You are involved in a religious cult trying to take over the world through the Savior. 
 While trying to stop the crazy old man Nero is trying to save his love, Kyrie, along with many 
 other people. Dante steps in half way through and that's when the difficulty ramps up (thanks to 
 not having the Devil Bringer) and having the same exact moves from DMC3 along with all the styles. 
 The game also gets very repetitive thanks to having to beat the same bosses over and over again 
 (about 3 or 4 times EACH) throughout the whole game and this got so old I never finished the game. 
 You have your secret missions (which some are IMPOSSIBLE to beat) and achievements that you'll 
 never be able to unlock, but even for this hardcore this is dull. DMC4 is great (mainly for new 
 comers) but if you wanted something new for the series you'll be lucked out.

Review:  This is a story of Hate, Love and Retribution. You mainly play as Nero, a young, cool man working 
 for an organisation called the Order of the Sword. Everything is going well for him until a mysterious 
 assassin murders Sanctus the High Priest of the Order during a ceremony in front of everyone in 
 the Opera House. Now Nero is given the task of finding this assassin and bringing him to justice. 
 The story unravels further on involving Kyrie (Nero's romantic interest) , Dante, Credo (Kyrie's 
 brother and the Leader to the Orders Knights) . The story is one of the best i have seen from a 
 game and has some fantastic cutscenes.
  
  The gameplay is top notch as you would expect from a Devil May Cry game. The way you can just string 
 combos together effortlessly is astounding and amidst all this sword fighting and gun shooting 
 there is a couple of puzzles to keep you thinking. There are plenty of secret missions hidden in 
 the 20 main missions throughout the game, these require you to complete a certain task to pass 
 the test. As you play as the main character, Nero, you have many tools at your exposal, these include: 
 The Devil Bringer, the Yamato sword, the Red Queen sword and the Blue Rose revolver. Nero is playable 
 from mission 1 to 11, then Dante is playable from mission 11 to 18 and you finish off the final 
 two missions with Nero. Dante has four different styles, these are Trickster, Gunslinger, Sword 
 Master and Royal Guard. Also he has his dual pistols called Ebony and Ivory, his shotgun and the 
 Rebellion sword.
  
  Graphics in DMC4 are outstanding, the attention to detail is unbelievable and has to be challenging 
 Gears of War, Bioshock and Mass Effect.
  
  There are some problems that let this game down, for instance, the camera angle can become confusing 
 at times when it can change when it doesn't really need to and you can find yourself running the 
 wrong way. Also when you do get to play as Dante, you have to play all the same levels as you did 
 with Nero so it is pretty disappointing to see that Capcom couldn't be bothered to design new levels 
 especially for Dante. But these aren't big problems to stop it becoming a great game.
  
  Finally extra modes and options include a Survival mode, Theater mode, Library mode and Leaderboards 
 to view your ranking on Xbox Live.
  
  So what can I call Devil May Cry 4? 
  
  BRILLIANT

Review:  Ok so many complain about the revisiting of the same locations, but it only happens with each charachter. 
 This gives the levels a different twist, with new enemies and playing against them with different 
 tactics.
  
  The introduction of Nero to the series will please newcomers, as he is an easily usable character 
 that takes about 15 minutes to get used to provided you play games regularly. 
  
  The most difficult time during the game comes during the change over between the two character's 
 - Nero to Dante - where you may be initially confused. Dante requires more dexterity to play with, 
 but once you get the hang of it you wont want the levels to end.
  
  The Human ( easy ) setting is advised to those new to the series, but for those who played DMC 
 3 to the end should breeze through Devil Hunter ( normal) . When this mode is completed you unlock 
 Son of Sparda and then later on Dante Must Die, of which the latter difficulty setting will assure 
 many tears.
  
  However in conjunction to this you will also unlock Blood Palace mode, a survival mode in which 
 you will face multiple enemies, each stage getting more and more challenging. Completing all 100 
 levels will provide hours of entertainment.
  
  Aside from all else the cut-scenes in this game are amung the most entertaining I have seen. The 
 physics may not always stay true to life but ignoring this, they are highly detailed and the fight 
 senes are immense 
  
  a highly recomended game for rental or purchase

Review:  I rented Devil May Cry 4 expecting a great game that was really fun. I got that and more. This 
 is a game that i think is just as good as god of war. It has combat so badass and satisfying you 
 might put Nero and Dante up in the catagorie of Master Chief and Gorden freeman. Wait a second 
 did i type gorden freeman never mind that, Gorden OWNS all so hes more badass. But Nero and Dante 
 are still pretty high up there on the badass scale. The gameplay consists of using various sword, gun, 
 grab/dantes various abilities. You lock on to various demons and use your awesomeness to kill them. 
 The action is fast and rediculously cool. Nero plays extreamly well and implementing his grabs 
 into combos is great. Dante is excellent also and has Pandoras box which just kick ass. You will 
 fight a couple bosses throughout the game most of them you will fight 3 times. Then there is the 
 only problem BACKTRACKING. I dont no if capcom got lazy or what but the dante portion of the game 
 is basically the Nero portion in reverse with new cutscenes and stuff. It would have been so much 
 cooler if this was not the case. But the star of hte show is indeed combat. So if you like that 
 part of it and dont mind it then give this game .5 higher point.

Review:  Devil May Cry was really fun to play, but I really thought there would be more coming from this 
 game besides a graphics upgrade. Nero was fun to play with, but I wish they would have given him 
 more features with his Devil Bringer. I thought it was cool to play with Dante, but it was sort 
 of a drag to relearn Dante's moves and then be force back into playing with Nero. I don't like 
 the fact I had to fight the same bosses 3 times and all of Dante's missions were pretty much the 
 same as Nero's except backwards.
  
  The story was pretty lame as usual and they really didin't attempt to try and develop the characters. 
 I wish they would have been a little more clear on the relationship between Nero and Dante as well. 
 Devil May Cry was still a fun game and I can't wait to see what's in store for the 5th installment.

Review:  Another Devil May Cry game, every time they bring a new one out i alway hope that it will be as 
 good as the first game in the series, but this one dose come really close. the new guy Nero make 
 a really good new playable character and with his devil arm it adds something new to the fighting 
 mix. this game also has a really good story to it and nice cinematics to go, i would of like the 
 game to be longer and to of added some new levels when playing as Dante instead of all the same 
 ones that you had already done with Nero. But still the game is very fun to play and will keep 
 you coming back for more ( i've play'd it 3 times though) . Once you've finished the game you will 
 unlock new mode to go though and a sort of fighting arena were you keep on going untill you die 
 or your time runs out, some of the best bits in this game come from the bosse fight with are really 
 good to do with Nero and his devil arm its just a shame that there wasn't more of them.
  So over all go out and buy this game!

Review:  After 3 years of waiting, we finally got Devil May Cry 4 and it is multi-platform this time. The 
 fans was excited for being published on next-gen video games because the game will have much more 
 better graphics. It was also exciting to hear the new character Nero but it was worrying not to 
 see Dante at all in the game but Capcom was generous and they allowed you to play as Nero or Dante 
 with their own story and missions.
  
  The story of the game is quite nice. It will take time to describe the story so better check it 
 out yourself. The beginning of the game is fantastic. The cut scenes are awesome, and I guarantee 
 you that you don't want to skip the cut scenes at all. You will start of play as Nero for the first 
 11 missions. You will learn that Nero has completely different fighting style. It uses only 2 weapons: 
 Red Queen as a melee weapon and Blue Rose as range weapon. You will only use Yamato during the 
 Devil Trigger. Nero demonic arm allows you to perform several different deadly combos to your enemies. 
 You can perform throws for lesser demons and bosses which deals great damage or grab them from 
 afar and bring it beside to you. So count the demonic arm as weapon.
  
  You will play as Dante from Missions 12 till Mission 18. Dante has 7 weapons (quite less than the 
 other Devil May Cry series) but they are completely unique from each other. You will start using 
 Rebellion like before, Ebony & Ivory (Dante's traditional weapon) and Coyote-A which is a very 
 powerful shotgun. Later on you will earn the weapon Gilgamesh, which you had it before but it was 
 called Ifrit in DMC1 and Beowulf in DMC3. It keeps changing its name. Then you will get Lucifer 
 (nice name) which allows you to stab six explosive sharp blade which later explodes when you perform 
 the trick. The coolest weapon is the Pandora box (a ranged weapon) which allows you to use as six 
 different weapons: Gatling gun, crossbow, bazooka, cannon, three headed boomerang and the judgment 
 weapon (quite hard to explain) . You will also use Yamato during the Dark Slayer mode and very deadly 
 indeed. Other than that Dante can perform its own styles at any time. Just use the D-pad to select 
 your style at anytime you need: Trickster, Gunslinger, Sword Master or Royal Block. In DMC3 you 
 had to go to the shop and choose your style. So this time the characters are unique and each has 
 weak and strong points.
  
  Other than that, the character design is cool. More different characters in the cast. Different 
 types of demons and cool, fun giving boss battles. The level design is mouth dropping. The rooms 
 and levels are much more brighter than before. Less difficult puzzles to solves. Loads of exciting 
 cut scenes etc. Every aspect in this game is beautiful. The game can be sometimes frustrating and 
 repetitive but it is one of the greatest games of 2008. Another game to add it to your collection.
 
  
  Pros
  - Nero is a great new character
  - Stunning graphics
  - Each character has its own advantages and disadvantages
  - Great and fun boss battles
  - 
 Level designs are fantastic
  - Breath taking cut scenes
  - Great voice acting
  - Lots of bonuses to unlock
  
  Cons:
  - Can be frustrating
  - Enemies can be sometimes 
 unfair
  - You may repeat the stages and boss battles again and again

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 the sequal to the famous action adventure title developed by Capcom. In the past 
 titles your main character has always been Dante, but things are a little different in Devil May 
 Cry 4. Replacing Dante as the star of the title is Nero, a very similar young looking guy to Dante 
 with a few tricks up his sleeves. Nero possesses a demotic arm called the Devil Bringer which let 
 him grab enemies from a long distance, make high leaps, and trigger certain combo moves onto enemies 
 and bosses. 
  The gameplay in this game is solid and style is the main thing in combat. Because of Nero's Devil 
 Bringer it opens up many combination of combos to unleashed on your enemies. Once you get use to 
 the combos and know when to use your attacks at the right time you could pull off some insane stylish 
 combos which makes the Devil Bringer add depth to the combat system. Besides his Devil Bringer 
 along his set of weapons is his Red Queen (his sword) and his Blue Rose (his twin barrel magnum) .
 
  The story takes place as Dante assassinated the pope and Nero was sent to kill Dante. As Nero 
 progresses through his journey every enemies he will kill will drop Red Orbs. Red Orbs are use 
 to buy healing items, health upgrade, and reviving items. How you purchase more combos is by collecting 
 Proud Souls. How you obtain these Proud Souls is by getting a getting good ranks by completing 
 each mission.
  If you're missing Dante already then let me cheer you up and say Dante is playable in DMC4. You'll 
 be able to play Dante about half way through the game, but most of his levels are retracting where 
 Nero was which made the campaign seems repetitive and recycled. Even though Nero and Dante kinda 
 look the same the gameplay between the two is pretty different. Dante doesn't have the Devil Bringer 
 obviously but he still have his own deadly weapons. While Nero own have his Devil Bringer, Red 
 Queen, and Blue Rose, Dante has the ability to switch between his many variety of swords and guns.
 
  The enemy in this games are aggressive and can be challenging at times. Each enemy requires a 
 different tactic and won't be push overs. One of the best part of the game is the boss fights. 
 Each boss fights has their own way of killing them and weak spots to take them down. Because of 
 the backtracking in Dante's part you'll have to fight the boss again which can get tiresome. Even 
 though the boss fights are 100% pure awesome having to fight them again is just dumb for the developers 
 to do instead of introducing Dante a new boss to fight. What is even more stupid is that you'll 
 have to fight the boss a third time, that's right, a 3rd time later on in the game as the story 
 progresses!
  Despite the repetitiveness of the campaign there is a lot of replay value in the single player. 
 The campaign should take you about 10 hours to complete depending on the difficulty. There are 
 5 difficulties to choose from and the last 3 need to be unlock. 
  Another down side to the game is the camera angle. There are some parts of the game that will have 
 fix camera and a free camera for you to rotate around your character. The fix camera areas I have 
 to say make some of the platforming areas frustrating and it is hard to identify which place to 
 land or if you're far enough to reach a platform. The free camera angle is a little better then 
 the fix camera but it still have some problems. Some situation that I got into even though I have 
 a camera to locate 360 degree around my character, is that I can't see the enemies or if I'm stuck 
 in the corner the camera would zoom into my character too much. 
  The graphic I have to say is great and the details are top notch. The game runs in a silky smooth 
 60 frames per second and during my gameplay experience I encounter no frame rate problems. 
  The audio is great and it gives you that really bad A word feel when the metal music starts playing. 
 The voice acting is pretty good but there is some really cheesy dialog at times, especially when 
 it come to Dante with his very sarcastic and non serious attitude. 
  Overall this game is solid and people who are the Devil May Cry series will love this. The hack 
 and slash gameplay is similar to the gameplay of Ninja Gaiden for anybody who is familiar to that 
 series and it is just hardcore slashing all the way. Despite the repetitiveness of the campaign 
 and camera angle, people who are looking for a decent action adventure should check this out.

Review:  Capcom has released many amazing titles on the 360 and PS 3, from Dead Rising to Lost Planet, and 
 now Devil May Cry 4. The problem with these titles is that they lack true evolution in game play 
 and mild evolution in graphics. Devil May Cry is by no means a bad game. It is actually one of 
 the better action games released on the 360. It's combat is fast paced and intuitive and the presentation 
 is smooth as butter. If you have never played a DMC title before then DMC 4 will blow your mind 
 out the back of your head, but for veterans it will feel all to familiar and less then the high 
 expectations that someone has for a popular franchise such as DMC. 
  
  You start as The new hero Nero fighting through slews of odd scarecrows and demons collecting orbs 
 and racking up points in a very arcade like execution. Each level ends with a point tally where 
 you are rewarded points to buy or upgrade new abilities. Unlike DMC 3 you won't often need to repeat 
 levels over and over just to level up. This time around Capcom has gone for a more balanced difficulty 
 which is still more challenging then most games out today, but less then the close to impossible 
 DMC 3. About half way through the game you will take control of Dante and be able to respend all 
 the points gained with Nero to level up Dante. Also at any time you can get points refunded to 
 requisition to a different ability giving a great amount of freedom and versatility. Both Nero 
 and Dante have quite different fighting abilities and move sets so when you change over it takes 
 a second to get used Dante's own unique style, but this also enhances to the feeling that these 
 are truly two different people rather then a new face on the same body.
  
  Graphically DMC4 looks amazing but I just can't help thinking that Capcom could do better. It comes 
 down to style. DMC along with almost all Japan created games hold on to the classic cartoonish 
 character models. Which is fine but you must work two times as hard to truly impress visually with 
 fluid animations and atmosphere. I may have just been spoiled by Gears of War and Bioshock ,but 
 I believe Capcom being one of the best game creators in Japan really needs to evolve to catch up 
 to the European, Canadian, and American creators who are dominating the current consoles.
  
  In the end DMC 4 is a must have game even though it could have showed off the power of the 
 consoles more then it did. The audio, visuals, gameplay, and compelling cut scenes do more then 
 earn your $60. Even though I criticize, I also know that DMC 4 is the best at what it does, and 
 I would put DMC up against Ninja Gaiden any day.

Review:  First of all, this is a brand new story that many people would enjoy, the story is constantly epic. 
 The new graphics make the game look even more sweet, it is just nice to look at and things are 
 so clear. 
  There are more bosses than in the other games, some people liked more bosses but I think there 
 are too many frequent bosses, you have to face some of the same bosses twice and it is irritating 
 when you only just killed them the first time, some bosses can be the same but slightly different 
 the next time you face them which is better to facing the same boss all over again. The demons 
 you face set a great variety and you have to find out their weak spots.
  Now onto the characters, Nero is half demon just like Dante but he has a demonic arm called the 
 Devil Bringer, it is a very handy weapon because you can use it to use speacial moves on enemies 
 and slam them into the ground, you can even stretch your arm out to reach items or pull enemies 
 towards you to save walking over to them if your getting your style points up, Nero also has a 
 sword called the Red Queen and a pistol called Blue Rose, the sword can rev like a motorbike and 
 it will increase in power, the pistol has two barrels insalled and it fires at the same rate as 
 Ebony and Ivory, Nero can also charge the pistol to increase firing power. Dante is just as cool 
 as he always has been, he doesnt have the Devil Bringer but he has the classes like Gunslinger 
 and Swordmaster just like in DMC 3, Dante get weapons further along in the game when you play as 
 him, Rebellion is the best for all kinds of fighting and perfect for any job, Dante also has his 
 shotgun with Ebony and Ivory so you can swap between both weapons when you feel like it.
  Overall I was happy with this game and it was worth the money, people should seriously consider 
 giving this game a go.

Review:  Overall this game was amazing. This is the first Devil May Cry game I have played, and I was impressed.
 
  
  Graphics: Some of the best graphics that I have ever seem. There was zero problems with the frame-rate.
 
  
  Cinematics: Very impressive. What I liked about the cut scenes was that they were professionally 
 done and had top notch music accompanying it. At time the control would vibrate during these scene 
 which was quite convincing that you were in the middle of the scene.
  
  Game play: The controls were just right. For the first half of the game you play as one character. 
 His fighting style was dead on perfect, easy to maneuver, and packed a hefty punch. The later half 
 of the game you switched to playing as Dante. His fighting system was more stiff and not as agile; 
 however, his hefty sword delivered some nasty blows.
  
  Replayability: High if you loved the game.
  
  THIS GAME IS WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!

Review:  Devil May Cry has always been one of my favorite series, and this game is no exception. Devil May 
 Cry 4, is about Nero our new hero, with a demonic claw called a devil bringer. The devil bringer 
 adds a new element to the game, the ability to grapple opponents. It can be quite fun and is a 
 welcome edition to the series. 
  
  The levels are beautiful and well done but there's a problem with them. Half of the game is rehashed 
 levels. Just like past DMC's the game loses points for re-using the same areas too often, its a 
 shame really. Also 13 of 20 of the levels are played as Nero while only 7 as Dante. This is kinda 
 disappointing to many fans of Dante, who feel he's not used enough. But I have to admit using Nero 
 is really fun. Dantes new weapons add some new fun to the series also.
  
  There's game modes and costumes to be unlocked, but there not as good as DMC3's. On a positive 
 note one new feature in this game is the ability to view any cutscene whenever you want. 
  
  The achievements in this game are really hard to unlock, and time consuming, so if you like 
 challenging achievements than this games for you. 
  
  This game has the most fluent combat of any DMC and the best graphics, that alone plus the new 
 story makes this a must buy for any DMC fan. It is great fun unlocking new game modes and buying 
 all the moves (which takes awhile) and inventing new combos. Its more of the same DMC we know and 
 love, and the action is non stop classic DMC, if it ain't broke don't fix it. But for DMC 5 capcom 
 needs to add more levels and game play elements or suffer losing a lot of points. DMC4 can slide 
 this time but DMC5 won't be able to. 
  
  So anyone who likes 3rd person action adventure games will love this game. I highly recommend it. 
 Happy devil hunting.

Review:  The game itself looks good, good graphics, good controls, and Lots to upgrade. But it's not as 
 great as it may look. Upgrading skills is a pain, the fighting mode and orbs is similar to Nija 
 Gaiden, but Ninja Gaiden provides you with automatic upgrade as you go along or beating a boss. 
 DMC4 doesn't allow u to upgrade this mode and secret missions are a JOKE. Some are near impossible 
 to complete and I can live with that, but what makes this worse is that if you die during the Secret 
 Missions you may end up having to repeat a greatly amount of level that you already completed, 
 and try again, and again and again..... Horrible, frustrating and stupid.... I thought DMC4 would 
 be a lot better but is not. Does not make a fun game to play, does not allow player to upgrade 
 unless you finish each level as perfect, and secret missions to allow development of your character 
 are just horrible.. The good things is Graphics, Sounds, Movie Trailers, Moves (except blocking 
 which can only tried with Dante) and the disc does make a GREAT FRISBEE!!! Would not recommend 
 spending anyones hard working money on this game. Yes, it's fun in the beginning, but it's repetetive, 
 and frustaring after half of the game. Ninja Gaiden is a MUCH better and enjoyable game than this. 
 Please CAPCOM or developers out there, do not waste making another DMC series and any other game 
 like this....

Review:  The DMC series has come a long way since the beggining and DMC 4 definately lives up to the reputation. 
 With a new character known as Nero, players get to play the game a bit differently for about half 
 the game, but Nero is just as smart-mouthed and slick as previous protagonist Dante. The game is 
 filled with awesome looking cutscenes, graphics, and wicked boss fights. The game isn't too easy, 
 but poses quite a challenge for any players who like one.
  
  The games story is quite entertaining. Long story short, Dante comes in to take out a diabolical 
 order before they can end the world, and Nero aids him once he finds out the true plans of the 
 order, but in this whole mess, Nero's girlfriend gets captured, and then a rescue mission is in 
 place. Now some people say that this story is a bit plain, but its all a matter of opinion. And 
 for the dialogue, i had no problem with it. Dante and Nero are both always slick at the mouth, 
 but like i said, its a matter of opinion of how the player his/herself views the dialogue. (i personally 
 liked it)
  
  and to my favorite part, the gameplay. The games fighting system is so in depth, you find yourself 
 having a blast hacking and slashing away at the hordes of demons coming your way. Neros fighting 
 can sometimes get a little simplistic, but Dantes is so much more deep and intense, with 4 different 
 fighting styles, and many different melee weapons, it makes the game much more enjoyable to play.
 
  
  and on a final note, i think this game is an instant classic, in-depth fighting system, beautiful 
 cutscenes, entertaining story, and awesome characters, this game is definately worth the $60, and 
 a high score of a 9.

Review:  A game that keeps on giving
  
  This new Devil May Cry is making a brilliant appearance as its first game for Xbox 360. I warn 
 you now; this is not a game for anyone who wants an easy 1000g!
  
  You mainly play as Nero, but Dante does become unlockable later on in the game.
  Nero is an almost 
 younger looking version of Dante, but you are part of the Order of the Sword, a group of warriors 
 that worship the Sparda. He is equipped with the Red Queen, a sword with the ability to rev itself 
 up, and the Blue rose, a revolver with charging ability. The speciality of Nero is his Devil arm 
 used for smacking enemies to the ground and grabbing them and bringing them close to you, ready 
 for your sword. Dante come with Rebellion, one hell of a big sword, Ebony and Ivory, his duel pistols, 
 and his shotgun, but can also receive more weapons as the game progresses.
  
  You play through in the same old style of hacking and slashing your way through demented puppets 
 or ice golems etc, but your skills can be enhanced with new combos by spending your Proud Souls, 
 acquired from the end of level review. These upgrades can be for your sword, gun, devil arm, and 
 trick-styles (if you are Dante) .
  
  This game is substantially bigger than the pervious games, as not only is there 20 levels (with 
 the levels playable are 13 for Nero and 7 for Dante) , ranging in time, length and difficulty, there 
 are the achievements to go with it as well. The achievements are both good and bad, in as such 
 they make you try and do the levels again on different levels of difficulty to try and get your 
 gamerscore, but there are some which seem near impossible to get for me and the other gamers who 
 like to play more then one game for ages, and will sometimes have you frustrated for a while. 
 
  But one of the truly good bits about the game is the cut scenes, yes, okay, they can get a bit 
 too much at times, but the graphics are superb, and tell the complicated story really well, allowing 
 you to understand what is going on in a brilliantly immersive atmosphere.
  
  Once completed on Devil Hunter mode (normal mode really) , you have the chance to try and complete 
 the Bloody Palace, a survival mode challenge that pits you against different formations of enemies 
 that you must kill in order to gain time against the ticking clock. Bloody Palace does include 
 some of you favourite bosses too, and with 99 levels of the Bloody Palace, expect this to take 
 you a while as well.
  
  Finally there are the boss levels, where those tricky achievements begin to seem do-able. They 
 bosses have a sort of routine in which they do their moves, so therefore you can dodge at the right 
 times, without annoying enemies breaking your combo. Because of this, you can either try and learnt 
 what the boss does, which is not recommended, or watch for the 'tells' the boss gives you, so you 
 can dodge them. This makes the bosses both invigorating because they are so different from your 
 average puppet and enjoyable because you can feel you can actually do them well. Of course they 
 are not so easy once you get into the levels of Dante must die mode Overall, this game is great 
 for beginners, but if you are new to the Devil May Cry range, don't expect this to be the best 
 title you can pick up. If however you are not new to the range, and have not yet bought it, it 
 will you last a long time, and for 29.99rrp, it's affordable as well
  
  A nice addition to your games rack.

Review:  Let's begin with one thing. This game is very short, and even with the fact that it's short, the 
 game backtracks. It literally goes to one destination, and then comes back, only with other enemies 
 in some places, and another character.
  The game is short, repetitive, but as long as you can bare the backtracking, it is quite good.
 
  
  The combat of the game is pretty similar to the previous Devil May Cries.
  You have a gun, a sword, the devil trigger which gives you some melee damage boost, and adds some 
 awesomeness to the appearance of the character.
  And what, something new too?!
  The first protagonist you play with, Nero, has a magical demonic arm that can grab enemies, or 
 launch you at enemies, particularly bosses.
  
  Also, as you proceed through the game, you gather experience from monsters, which you can use to 
 buy new combos, devil trigger bonuses, guns, and a bouquet of flowers.
  The combos aren't that much like combos, as they are more just hits like the first one, only just 
 look more awesome or different.
  Also, there aren't any connecting combos, like let's say, Tekken or Killer Instinct etc.
  You 
 must do sword tricks that you have in your "trick book", just like you would with button-mashing. 
 One hit, one hit, one hit, only with the hits launching enemies into air or doing some other things.
 
  
  The game goes through very many environments with different climates.
  While you walk around, cautiously in the snow, because there's a storm and you can't see far away, 
 if there are any enemies, after going through a church/monastery/house thing, you get to a waterfall.
 
  Then, you have to get near the waterfall to get into a tunnel, which is behind the waterfall, 
 a la MGS 3.
  When you left a snowy environment, only 20 meters away, if you go through the tunnel, you reach 
 a sunny, warm rain forest.
  After proceeding through the lush jungle, you reach a long, long alley which takes you another 
 boss, and another house.
  Then, you get into a big house, again, and there you find the main antagonist and some of his friends.
 
  You will notice that this game has alot of bosses. Well, when you confront a huge avatar of an 
 old demon, a big statue.
  
  He (the antagonist) , who controls the statue traps Nero inside the statue, which brings out the 
 old protagonist from the Devil May Cry series, Dante.
  He promises to rescue Nero, and kill the old geezer.
  
  Now, as you probably know, you're going 
 to take the place of Dante.
  As you may notice, the thing that added some new to this game's arsenal, and probably your favorite 
 thing in the game, the Devil arm are gone.
  They are replaced with Dante's speciality, many flavors of kicking a**.
  You get to choose from 
 4 categories of "styles".
  There is Trickster, which allows you to dodge enemies, Swordmaster and Gunslinger, and I think 
 you can guess what they do.
  And then there's Royalguard, which basically improves your blocking, and give you some nifty blocking 
 tricks, which apparently sees Dante blocking with his hands.
  Nevertheless, Dante may, or may not be more suitable for your playing style.
  While the Devil 
 arm was fun, Dante is more useful, and better to play with, because he has better combos from the 
 beginning, and he has many different styles to choose from.
  
  Also, with defeating bosses you get different weapons. Most of them are pointless, because you 
 have unlocked already many abilities which are better with the current weapons.
  And you also get new guns, like the Pandora's Box, which is a very nifty weapon, since you can 
 go through different phases with it, which makes Dante lift the weapon a little bit, and it transforms 
 into something bigger and more damage-dealing.
  And you can obviously get hit while doing all that.
  
  Now, the next thing you may notice is, 
 uggh, that you just basically go back the whole trip you just went through.
  
  Fortunately for us, the unhappy and angry players, Dante is more funnier, and shows off more awesome, 
 mostly cinematic fighting moves, when he meets the bosses.
  At last, when you confront the last boss, you have to go through a long fight, so prepare.
  And 
 you can't save while doing it, at least you can't resume the fight, after you've loaded.
  Anyway, in this fight you have to fire your laser.
  Seriously, you have to hit things, to activate 
 lasers, which totally makes sense.
  The fight starts and ends with an epic fight, with Dante doing stuff you would never imagine doing, 
 even in a movie, but he's a half demon, so no surprise there.
  
  Then, you play again with Nero, as you have to go through a little puzzle game you encountered 
 earlier. You have to hit a dice, and then the character moves.
  Unfortunately, it's a circle, and your avatar can go past the button that leads to the next door.
 
  So also prepare for a long sequential play.
  See, one thing I don't like here, is that you can't resume from half-way through many things, but 
 rather the developers see you start from the beginning.
  When you finish it, and defeat each boss at the portal that leads you to the next stage, you see 
 the boss, who you kill, and live happily ever after with Nero's love interest, Kyrie.
  
  I haven't tried the harder difficulties, but this game is much easier than the previous Devil May 
 Cry games, so no one should be afraid of this game, because they think it's too hard.
  It isn't.

Review:  Having loved DMC 1 and enjoyed DMC 2 and 3 I was excited to get the latest installement on the 
 360.
  
  Devil May Cry 4 is a mixed reaction for certain reasons:
  
  Great graphics with a lot of detail but certain problems with the shadowing (especially in the 
 forest, it is a little bit annoying...) . All in all the images are great and the atmosphere created 
 by them is excellent, but some flaws do make it annoying to look at at times.
  The gameplay is also excellent and shows hardly an flaws. It is one of Devil May Cry's strongest 
 points, the attacks are very well made and in about half an hour you can kill with style. Some 
 times the combos can be a little awkward to master and Dante/Nero may do something you didn't expect, 
 but I believe its more me than the game itself making the mistakes.
  The characters are very well done, though at first I found it hard to differentiate Nero and Dante, 
 they both have their own styles that complete each other. Nero's grab is just great and makes the 
 game easier.
  
  The story is one of DMC's weakest points. Even though it isn't all that bad, and makes you continue 
 the game with some sort of suspense, the story is just to dull and plain.. The whole Nero becoming 
 a demon could have been a little more developed, as many things in the story. All in all, it's 
 really a shame that you end up just playing for the hell of it. 
  
  The biggest problem I see in the game is repetition. As you advance through the game, you will 
 notice it follows a very very repetitive scheme: go from point a to point b, kill the boss, see 
 your stats and repeat. Of course sometimes you're in a race against the watch, but most of the 
 time you're just going to take as much time as you want (if you're not wanting to break your highest 
 score) . I find it a shame, but it was always like that in the DMC series.
  
  All in all, the game is great and presents only a couple of flaws that make it impossible for Devil 
 May Cry 4 to be excellent.

Review:  The Devil May Cry games have always been about dispatching your foes in style and this fourth installment 
 definately doesn't disappoint in the gameplay department. Some may be disappointed to hear that 
 the main hero Dante is only playable for about half of the game whereas the first half you take 
 control of a new character, Nero. He is no slouch in fact his new features such as being able to 
 rev up his sword for more damaging hits and his Devil Bringer arm which can grab and throw enemies 
 around with bring forth some excellent and exciting gameplay opportunities. His arm is also used 
 to grapple onto specific grapple points in the game to traverse some key areas. These areas are 
 usually just pretty straight forward things such as getting across or up to an area.
  
  Graphically this game is very polished and everything is well designed. The backgrounds look very 
 nicely detailed as are the enemies themselves and the bosses. There isn't a huge array of enemies 
 but there is a good variety from your standard Scarecrows to new ones like Frosts and Blitz which 
 are pretty cool additions to the DMC demonology. There aren't a whole lot of bosses either but 
 again they are well done, are generally quite large, and are alot of fun to fight.
  
  The music is pretty much the same as DMC3 with a metal undertone and lyrics sung in a gravely/growling 
 like voice. The sound effects are really good from the metal-on-metal sword clashes to the Frost's 
 ice attacks.
  
  Difficulty wise DMC4 is a step down from DMC3 but that's not a bad thing since DMC3 initially shipped 
 with a busted difficulty setting which was fixed up in DMC3: Special Edition. At first you start 
 out with Human and Devil Hunter difficulties. Human is what should be considered as 'Easy' and 
 Devil Hunter as 'Normal'. After beating the game on Devil Hunter you unlock Son of Sparda then 
 by beating the game on that level Dante Must Die is unlocked. Beat that mode and Heaven or Hell 
 unlocks followed lastly by Hell or Hell so there will definately be plenty to challenge the hard-core 
 players. The Bloody Palace also makes a return with 101 levels of crazy combo stylin' action. Each 
 level getting more difficult with more and stronger enemies all while working under a time limit 
 which can be increased by beating a level with high combos and taking no damage bonuses.
  
  While everything looks and plays great there are some things where DMC4 falls short with. First 
 and foremost there is too much backtracking and repetition in the game. Basically you go through 
 the first 10 Missions as Nero then the next 8 Missions you play as Dante but you end up just going 
 backwards through the same levels and fight the same bosses. Also there are a few puzzles in the 
 game and while they are mostly of the mundane nature a couple points in the game they can be pretty 
 annoying. In particular one where you hit a giant die with an attack and move around a 'board' 
 depending on the number the rolls up. You need to land on a specific place but sometimes it can 
 be quite frustrating if you keep missing these specific spots as you keep rolling and rolling and 
 rolling the die.
  
  The camera can also be a pain at times and makes some aspects of the game more difficult/frustrating 
 then they should be.
  
  All in all though this is a very solid game and fans of the series will most likely be quite happy 
 with it as the gameplay and action is as solid as ever and Nero turns out to be a great new character 
 with some very cool toys to play with. Some other characters make a return appearance although 
 it's just pretty minor cut-scene stuff for the most part.

Review:  Ok, Where to start. Devil May Cry 4 looks spectacular, even on Non High Definition sets, and during 
 my play through on the Xbox 360 the frame rate didn't drop once, which is a pretty good job done 
 by its developers considering some of the graphical punch the game has during large fights or boss 
 battles.
  
  The CGI in the game is simply incredible, and the game does a good job of tying you in with them, 
 The games opening tutorial fight between you and an "unknown Assassin" is one of the most stylish 
 and downright awesome introductions to a game I've seen in recent times. 
  
  Onto Game-play, See here is the thing, It's fun for the first hour or so, then it starts to get 
 a little repetitive, even for an arcade style hack and slash that it is, and even when unlocking 
 new combos they still feel quite the same.
  
  The Games environments are generally excellent, although there is a particular castle early on 
 in the game that to be honest until you hit the lower dungeons is quite dull and tedious.
  
  I think one of the biggest issues I had as well as a lot of other gamers, was the fact that 
 when you finally get to play as "another character" you are simply backtracking through the whole 
 game back to the starting stage, and its just plan repetitive.
  
  Devil May Cry 4 is an excellent hack and slash RPG with a decent story line, that sets out to be 
 more than it can be, however, with that said, its a great weekender game that you can enjoy with 
 mates.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 does very little to live up to expectations. DMC4 begins by bringing in a new anti-hero 
 bad boy named Nero to play the lead role while Dante takes a back seat as a side character. Dante's 
 character and back story are never really explained in DMC4 nor are they advanced or developed 
 any further. Even the story and character of Nero is hardly explained over the course of gameplay.
 
  
  Speaking of gameplay, Dante controls nearly the same as before adding only the ability to quickly 
 and easily switch between weapons and fighting styles. A feature that should have been present 
 years ago. The 4 styles available to Dante are all familiar and involve old moves previously seen. 
 If your looking for new abilities from Dante, DMC4 isn't the place to find them. Thankfully, there 
 are at least a few new weapons to utilize. Dante starts with his sword Rebellion, as well as his 
 set of firearms, ebony and ivory, along with the old shotgun. Along the journey, Dante once again 
 picks up a set of gauntlets. This time the gauntlets are called Gilgamesh. These gauntlets control 
 exactly like Beowulf and Ifrit from previous DMC games. Aside from a minor graphical update, these 
 gauntlets are entirely reused content. The other new melee weapon, Lucifer, is basically a revamped 
 form of the spectral swords used by Vergil in DMC3. Lucifer graphically looks very unique but feels 
 very shallow and limited. All in all, its most advantageous to just stick with the basic sword 
 Rebellion. The one addition weapon is a ranged type called Pandora. It appears to be nothing more 
 then a metal briefcase. Looks can be deceiving, Pandora is probably the most impressive part of 
 DMC4. When opened, Pandora much like the box of its namesake unleashes destructive power. Pandora 
 actually changes shape and function. It has 4 modes, including a gatling gun, an explosive bow, 
 a rocket launcher, and a laser cannon. Each is impressive and satisfying to utilize.
  
  Nero doesn't have styles to rely on. Instead, he has his devil bringer arm. This arm amounts to 
 a grappling ability that almost reminds of the glorious Bionic commando. I guess if a trick works, 
 its worth using again in a slightly different manner. The arm can grab enemies/items from afar 
 and drag them closer. It can also be used for powerful throw attacks. Its an interesting gimmick 
 that is one of the saving graces of DMC4. Using the devil bringer against bosses can net some particularly 
 impressive and violent cut scenes.
  
  The other gimmick Nero has is far less impressive then his devil bringer. This system is called 
 exceed. It involved pulling the left trigger at the correct time to "rev" your sword as if it was 
 a motorcycle thereby powering it up and causing increased damage and stronger special attacks. 
 Whoever thought adding a motorcycle throttle to a sword would be a cool feature needs to be run 
 over by an actual motorcycle and impaled by an actual sword. In addition, the timing required to 
 utilize the exceed system is brutally unforgiving. The control and gameplay is deep enough and 
 complex enough that having to constantly pull the left trigger is simply a mess.
  
  The scenery and setting of DMC4 is varied and impressive graphically. Although, they are somewhat 
 archetypal. Ancient castle, ancient forest, frozen waste. Part of the trouble with DMC4 is that 
 while the setting looks good, it is cheapened by the fact that you roam through these areas twice, 
 once as Nero and once again as Dante. The areas simply feel stale when you must play through them 
 twice to complete the game.
  
  While traveling through these areas twice, you also end up fighting the same bosses, again once 
 as Nero and once as Dante. Despite the different styles each character has, the bosses still feel 
 shallow the second time around. Most appalling of all, you actually end up fighting these bosses 
 a third time!! The bosses are gigantic and impressive and fighting them twice makes some sense 
 in terms of what little story there is within DMC4. Fighting them a third time though is blatantly 
 forced into the game as nothing more then content filler. It really cheapens the entire experience 
 to have to fight these bosses three times just to finish the game. Even having to face most of 
 the bosses three times and running through all the areas twice, all of DMC4 can be finished in 
 around 8 hours. I'm almost surprised the duration of gameplay wasn't extended further by making 
 you fight all the bosses a fourth time just for kicks. Fighting the same boss multiple times is 
 a trick that should be left to the Megaman series. Its a tired gimmick that really deserves no 
 place in current gen games. Its a truly unforgivable offense.
  
  After all is said and done, DMC4 leaves you little real additional content in the post game. You 
 can replay the difficulty level you just beat and try to get better rankings on each stage. You 
 can move on and replay the game on a higher difficulty level. There are 6 difficulty levels in 
 all. Then of course you can replay each of those difficulty levels to try and get top rankings 
 on each stage. I think this is the very definition of repetitive. The only other option is the 
 Bloody palace. This is an unlocked feature that pits the player against progressively more difficult 
 levels. There are 100 floors to the palace. Should you manage to finish the palace you can always 
 replay it to try to get top ranking on each floor. Repetition at its best... or should I say worst.
 
  
  With a mediocre story, familiar gameplay, and lack of a serious amount of content that is only 
 extended by extensive repetition, DMC4 is a mediocre delivery that is nearly the worst is the series. 
 I'd recommend going back and playing the original or number three. Both Devil May Cry two and four 
 should be forever forgotten as sub par entires into an otherwise brilliant series. 
  
  If your a die hard DMC fan or new to the series and don't mind fighting the same bosses three times 
 over, you may actually find the game enjoyable. Otherwise, just rent it and save yourself a bunch 
 of cash.

Review:  It goes without saying that a portion of DMC's fame comes from its excruciating difficulty, but 
 hey who cares when the reward is amazing action and an entertaining story. DMC4 definitely makes 
 the series more accesible to a wider audience, and while this great for the series, I'm sure many 
 of the fans from the first are bothered by this. That, and the fact that Dante let someone else 
 save the world...*gasp*
  
  Story: Some have said that DMC's story is not its strong point, and when put up against its gameplay, 
 I suppose that holds true, but regardless, DMC4 tells an interesting story from the outset, but 
 there's no denying there's a strange emptyness in the first half without Dante. Nero turns out 
 to be quite a capable hero and really avoids driving the series into the ground, like many thought 
 he would. The ending actually gets pretty emotional, but Dante remains as humorus as ever. Of special 
 note, I think, is the scene in which he gets Lucifer and his epilogue. In short, even if you don't 
 play DMC for the story, which is understandable, it'll keep you entertained enough to keep playing.
 
  
  Gameplay: Well, what's to say? The action is as tight and fluid as ever. Nero's Devil Bringer is 
 an invaluable tool and adds a whole new dimension to the combat. Learning to use Exceed will really 
 save your ass as well. Dante acquires several unique and fun weapons, but nothing that I believe 
 truly stands out.
  
  Sound: The game's soundtrack holds up well enough, but the battle song and ending theme, "Shall 
 Never Surrender", which is surprising enough to find out is the same song, really stands out. Aside 
 from the music, most of the voice acting is good, but some of the characters are probably better 
 off silent, like Credo.
  
  Overall, I think DMC4 was a step in the right direction for the series. They implemented a new 
 main character without him hijacking the series, and that takes some skill. IMO, they should keep 
 Nero around. Obviously, it would be insane to keep Dante out of the next title, but I think the 
 two heroes can share the same spotlight equally. It'd be cool if Nero joined Dante at Devil May 
 Cry... hey, just saying!

Review:  DMC 4 is just amazing... it has nonstop action and a very unique fighting system used with the 
 devil bringer or rather neros demonic arm... Nero may not seem like the coolest character to DMC 
 veterens because we all know that dante is a total beast and is one of if not the coolest video 
 game characters ever... come on who could be cooler than someone who has been stabbed by his own 
 sword in every DMC game? Nero, thats who... it may sound suprising but it is in fact true. I didnt 
 really enjoy Nero until i figured out when i was playing that dante just wasnt as much fun to me 
 any more... Neros arm was the coolest thing Capcom could have done. Great Job guys! The only thing 
 i have to complain about is the fact that when your dante you fight the same bosses you fought 
 as Nero earlier in the game. That was just laziness on Capcoms part... But over all this game is 
 my pick (so far) as 2008 Game of the Year.

Review:  When the first dmc game came out i was amazed beyond belief about how cool thrilling and action 
 packed it was. It was everything i could have wanted to see in a game and it was a masterpeice. 
 Awesome bosses, Fantastic cutscenes, Incredible atmosphere, Horrific enemies and absolutely insane 
 gameplay. It was Capcom at their best!
  
  After playing dmc 1 i was dying for dmc 2 thinking how could they possibly ruin a game this good. 
 Yet they managed to, dmc 2 lost the excellent setting and replaced it with a boring sepia toned 
 city, the enemies where boring, and dante lost his wild personality. About the only thing the game 
 had going for it was the new ridiculously crazy fighting moves twice as crazy as the first game, 
 and one perticular boss which was amazing (yes the skeleton that bursts out of the skyscraper) 
 but the actual boss battle itself apart from looking cool was rather boring since all you had to 
 do was stand back and shoot at it. It was a perfect example of a disapointment.
  
  dmc 3 was a lot better than dmc 2 but dmc 3 was nothing compared to the first one in the franchise. 
 dmc 3 had a cool creepy atmosphere, dante had his attitude back but the enemies where a bit boring 
 and the plot wasn't that great.
  Also dmc 3 had a very button mashy style gameplay which i didn't really like but it was still a 
 good game none the less.
  
  After all the dmc disappointments i didn't think that dmc 4 would be very good and i hardly considered 
 buying it. But after looking on the internet for a while i watched trailers and previews for dmc 
 4 and i thought it looked a lot like the first one! 
  They brought back these creepy scarecrow looking monsters wearing creepy looking masks that brought 
 back memories of the marionettes in the first dmc game. And other creepy enemies such as the witches 
 and shield wielding lizards. The bosses where just as cool as well. I recommend to anyone who loved 
 the first dmc you are going to love this new one because its got everything the first game had 
 but better graphics and new awesome moves. Then when i looked at the back case of the game i saw 
 "from the producer of the original Devil May Cry and Resident Evil 4" which are too of the best 
 games ever made.
  
  As all games do this game had its bad moments such as bosses, there are about five different bosses 
 in this game which you have to fight about three times each which does loose the boss fight novelty 
 of when you first meet the boss your completely blown away. The game is a little repetitive and 
 if you don't experiment or upgrade to new moves your not going to have much fun in this game. But 
 then again these bad features are clouded by the sheer awesomeness of dmc. 
  
  I can't say this game is better than the original dmc because thats an all time classic but i can 
 say that this new title is just as good and is made of the same stuff that makes a good dmc game 
 =D

Review:  GOOD- Great visuals and background desgins / brilliant voice acting / Awesome new combat combos 
 / wicked story / Great boss fights
  
  BAD- Dante is'nt as good as he was on the prvious games / Can get abit repetative
  
  GAMEPLAY-
 
  Just like the previous games, 1,2 and Dantes Awakening, DMC4 brings you back to next Gen with 
 even more better combos that was found in DMC3.
  Its realy fast paste with great battles, Theres lots of combos in the game that you can mix and 
 match with your Sword, gun and Devil Arm, The Devil Arm is Nero's weapon that can grab your devils 
 and depending what devil it is you'll proform different grab moves, it can also do other things 
 like grabbing far away items and swingng to far away places. Dont let this new character fool you, 
 he's a great character but i'd still say Dante is better, but saddly not in this game, Dante is 
 a playble character about half way through the game but he's exsactly thesame that was found in 
 DMC3 and nothing new.
  
  GRAPHICS-
  The graphics are great and impressive, the backgrounds are the best asset of the game as you traviial 
 to many different locations in the game that all look terrific and gleem with specil effects, the 
 character desgins are awesome too, specily some of the bad guys you come across. The Human characters 
 all look cool but the colours... for some reason,... look atbit bare, i dont know how to exsplain 
 it,.
  
  SOUND-
  The sound is realy good, the voice acting are brilliant and well dramatic, Nero's cries to become 
 a cocky brave knight, Dantes cool witts and "Dont Care" attitude rules. to the old mans crocky 
 voice and Devils devilish growns. saddly, the music is'nt as good as we listened in DMC3
  
  OVERALL-
  Overall this game is great but still does'nt come up to as the best DMC as there for 
 Devil May Cry 3 : Dantes Awakening is still better!.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is the latest instalment of Capcom's franchise. It's been a bumpy ride, as the 
 first was amazing, the second was disappointing and the third was a return to form. Number 4 is 
 here, with a new character and all the style and flair of it's predecessors. Unfortunately, it 
 is let down by repetition. Making you fight a boss twice is reasonable, but making you fight them 
 three times is just plain annoying. But that doesn't mean this game is bad, as I'd heartedly recommend 
 it to anyone.
  
  Devil May Cry 4 follows new character Nero, a member of a cult who worships Sparda. In the middle 
 of a ceremony, old hero Dante crashes the party, takes out the leader of the cult plus several 
 members, and leaves the place in a mess. When Nero tries, and fails, to take down Dante in a fight, 
 he is then sent to find him and take him out. The plot might not sound like much at first, but 
 when you're hit by several twists and turns as well as amazing cut scenes, DMC4's story is easily 
 one of the most exciting of this year.
  
  DMC4 plays mostly like it's predecessors-you hack and slash through enemies while occasionally 
 doing a puzzle or two. The difference here is who you'll control, as now there is Nero and Dante 
 to play as. Nero has a sword similar to the handle of a motorbike where he revs it up for more 
 power, as well as a single revolver and his devil arm. Dante has duel pistols, a sword and a few 
 different abilities too, like being able to use this box which transforms into cool weapons. Both 
 characters can use an ability where their attacks are much stronger than usual. As you kill enemies 
 you earn orbs and proud souls, which you can use to upgrade Nero and Dante. This adds replay value 
 as you will want to maximise their abilities.
  
  There is also the old platforming and puzzle, and they're still lame. Puzzles are about as simple 
 as pushing crates and other boring stuff and the platforming sections are as responsive as a dead 
 corpse. However, the boss fights in DMC4 are the best yet. They are all larger than life, and require 
 a good amount of skill to beat. It's definitely fun, and whats funny is how both the lead characters 
 constantly insult them as if they're the same size. It's hilarious to see Dante's reaction to a 
 giant horse on fire is sitting on it's tail!
  
  But DMC4 is quite repetitive. The least that can happen is you'll fight repeated enemies throughout, 
 which isn't much of an issue. The biggest repetition comes when you switch from Nero to Dante, 
 where you have to backtrack through levels you went through as Nero, as well as fight the same 
 bosses, except you'll have to change your tactics as Nero and Dante play very differently. But 
 the real kick in the nuts is the penultimate level, where you fight all the bosses yet again in 
 a case of Dj vu. But these issues aside, DMC4 is one of the most intense and fun games of 2008 
 so far. It's a great sequel, but some of it's old gameplay mechanics are starting to feel dated.
 
  
  The graphics, however, are not. DMC4 looks incredible. The character models are top notch, with 
 little intricate details, which are also present in the environments. A nasty thing however is 
 the shadows, which look pretty bad. The cut scenes are incredible. The fighting, acrobatics and 
 stunts shown in these are amazing, and the cut scenes look technically great too. The sound is 
 just as good, with all the cool gothic tunes from previous games. The acting is good and the dialogue 
 is great, with constant one-liners that are sure to at least amuse.
  
  DMC4 is not the best in the series, or the best game on the platform, but it's a quality game worth 
 anyone's time. The game does get repetitive, some may tire of the constant one-liners and the game 
 won't last you long. But if you're looking for stylish action and great challenge, DMC4 won't disappoint. 
 Bravo Capcom, you didn't screw up like you did in DMC2!

Review:  Devil May Cry has always been known for its more stylized gameplay than cliche' action moments. 
 The 4th entry in the series sticks to that formula, and yet, offers some interesting differences 
 and twists' than its 3 predecessors.
  
  First off, you now play as new character, Nero. At first it takes some adjusting. He plays much 
 differently from Dante (the previous protagonist for you DMC newmies) , but for all the right reasons. 
 
  Nero is given a unique weapon: the God Hand. Basically, it's his arm thats enchanted with demonic 
 power, but it's pretty sweet. You can use it to pull off some pretty sweet moves-especially on 
 Bosses.
  Speaking of which, you'll be thankfull all of them are good, because for three of them you'll end 
 up fighting 3 times...
  
  The story remains interesting through the whole game, and when you get to play as Dante you'll 
 get one of the coolest weapons in videogame history, the Pandora, You'll have to play it to see 
 it though ; )
  
  Overall it's an excellent game that should keep you busy until Ninja Gaiden 2 comes out

Review:  Its good to see that Capcom is still on track with the DMC series. Being number 4, Devil May Cry 
 4 has quite a bit to live up to. There are a couple firsts for the series; debuting on the XBox360 
 and PS3, relinquishing Dante from his role as main character. Instead they opt to fill his shoes 
 with Nero, who in all honesty looks like a young Dante. The gamble pretty much works out for Capcom. 
 Nero has a few abilities that Dante doesn't, thanks to his Devil arm he has some pretty cool grapple 
 attacks depending on his foe. Once he acquires his Devil Trigger the boss grapple attacks are downright 
 awesome. His sword can also be charged up to unleash a more devastating attack, for the most part 
 enemies aren't quick enough to interrupt you charging your sword or getting ready to unleash the 
 attack. But don't fret devil hunters, about halfway through the game you gain control of series 
 veteran Dante. He maintains most, if not all, of his abilities from DMC3. You can switch his fighting 
 styles in mid-combat with the directional pad, allowing for diverse fights. Aside from his sword 
 Rebellion he gains 2 other weapons and several firearms. Unfortunetly the game pretty much has 
 you backtracking through the entire game once you control Dante until the final boss, so there 
 isn't a terrible amount of variety in the environments. For those of you familiar with the series, 
 the game can be pretty challenging in normal mode and in some cases will dumb enemies and bosses 
 down for you if you having difficulty. Just as the case with previous Devil May Cry titles, you 
 gain orbs which are used to purchase items, but now you acquire proud souls at the end of each 
 mission which let you power up your character. The interesting part here is that at any time you 
 can cash in your proud souls and start over with a "blank" character, its an interesting concept 
 but if you ask me needs to be refined where you select certain skills you may not want. As far 
 as looks go, the game looks incredible, all characters and enemies are greatly detailed and look 
 phenomenal. Environments (even though there are only a few) look wonderful. The only complaint 
 I have is the shadows, they look awful, most of the time they are pixelated and jagged, which really 
 throws you for a loop. You'll notice it most in the jungle level since the sun casts a shadow on 
 everything. Aside from that the game is wonderful, a great game for any fan of the series.

Review:  Small, insignificant spoilers inside.
  
  GRAPHICS  8.5
  
  The graphics in this game are pretty good, not the best, but there are certain things about it 
 that make you want to cream yourself. The environments are detailed and filled out. The forest 
 feels all there, not as if you're being blocked by some 2d trees way off in the background to trick 
 you. That's a problem a lot of games that have some forest or jungle setting in them, they all 
 feel as if you could go somewhere else, and there isn't much stopping you because they don't fill 
 it out with foliage, they always seem to place the forests in some sort of canyon. Ignore that 
 rant DMC4 does just about everything great. The cut scenes are fun to watch, being extremely over 
 the top and sometimes including a nice sense of humor that won't have you laughing but you'll enjoy 
 it. I must say, though, I did laugh during this game, but not when I was supposed to (pretty much 
 mostly when I was beating the crap out of the Pope of what I could only assume was Scientology) .
 
  
  STORY  6.0
  
  I really wasn't sure what was happening or why during it, and if it was explained, the game wasn't 
 holding my attention enough for me to remember it obviously. From what I could gather, a sermon 
 at some sort of Church is interrupted when Dante drops down and stabs what looks to be some sort 
 of equivalent of the Pope. They tell you to go chase Dante and from there on, most of what's happening 
 is seemingly random, and the things that have to do with the story are strung together pretty loosely. 
 Not in a way to make you think, but in a way that just seems a little like bad writing. Or it could 
 be that I just had to have played earlier games (which I haven't) . Either way, don't expect the 
 story to be the greatest aspect of the game. It's not bad I don't think I just don't know what 
 was going on really. I just knew that at some point the Pope and Agnus were being douche bags and 
 therefore must be stopped. But I don't really understand why. I know Agnus wanted to do research 
 and used demons for forcing evolution or something I can't really remember that part. Anyways, 
 the story isn't bad, and it's not like it isn't there, it's just that it's hard to follow unless, 
 it's probably easier to get if you've played easier games.
  
  GAMEPLAY  7.0
  
  The game is fun, really fun, but there isn't much to it. Literally, all the sword combinations 
 were "On the ground, press Y, Y, Y" or "Press YY, then YYYY" and "Press Y, Y, Y in the air". There 
 were a few things that required me to be locked on to an opponent or holding a direction regarding 
 it, but for the most part it was just various different timings of pressing "Y" repeatedly. This 
 system pays off though, when you're playing and while you're just button mashing the "Y" button, 
 you see Nero or Dante performing over the top moves in strings of combos with really stupid names 
 (ex. Super Smokin' Style) and legions of enemies dying by your hand. Playing as Dante makes you 
 realize just how much more depth they could have added to Nero if they wanted to that is, Capcom 
 is a company that doesn't really like to try or fix things. If you've played DMC3 (I don't know 
 about the earlier ones) , Dante has four different styles you can choose from that changes how he 
 plays, not to mention he gains more new weapons to use in his four or five levels than Nero does 
 in the entire, 7 hour, 20 level game. But it is a Hack N' Slash, and being so, you have more fun 
 just using the sword and using your guns a lot less. The game features boss battles with gigantic 
 monsters, which are fun... the first time. You have to have to fight most bosses 3 times, thats 
 right, 3. They never change, they don't get harder, you just have to do it... again.
  
  DESIGN  6.0
  
  While the characters and environments are great terrible camera angles that 
 constantly and awkwardly change on you throughout the game plague the disc. Many times the camera 
 is set to where you have to fight an enemy off screen or you have to fight them at an awkward angle. 
 The lock-on system used is also outdated and frustrating at times. While the lock on works, it 
 would have been nice to actually choose what I'm locking onto. During normal battles it's not that 
 bad, I don't mind running a few extra feet to a different enemy instead of the one that's right 
 next to me, but in certain boss fights it is extremely frustrating. For an example, (small spoiler 
 alert) a certain fight with Agnus has you shooting him while he hides behind some sort of force 
 field. That would be fine except that you have to target him, and while doing this there are about 
 15 demons flying around you that turn into swords and rape you. Locking onto him is near impossible 
 unless you get right up next to the place he's standing on and hope you get lucky. To make it worse, 
 each time you kill one of these demons, another one takes its place! So you have to try to ignore 
 them. (end small spoiler alert)
  
  REPLAYABILITY  6.5
  
  The game is only about 7 hours long on Human mode (It's what I played on because I heard DMC3 was 
 extremely hard and I hadn't played one before) so you can expect a lot of people will go back and 
 try to beat it on Devil Hunter mode, even if only for possible achievement points. I guess you 
 could find and complete all the secret missions scattered throughout the game, but that also kind 
 of ties into the achievement points thing. After beating the game once, you unlock a slideshow 
 that explains the history of the Devil May Cry series. I don't really understand why 360 owners 
 have to unlock this when the PS3 owners get to watch it for 20 minutes why they wait for it to 
 insta-oh, that's why. I hear Lost Planet is going to do that too. It's not a PS3 thing, it's a 
 Capcom thing, let me get that straight. Anyways, you can also unlock some art from the game and 
 I think that's about it, actually. So there's not much incentive to beat it at a higher difficulty, 
 and the game won't change (unless you make it harder or easier) unless you just want to play it 
 again because its "fun", which it is.
  
  In the end, if you're looking for a game that's fun, you won't go wrong with DMC4, but don't expect 
 it to be the single greatest experience of your life. I honestly don't know why people called this 
 a PS3 killer app before it went multiplatform.
  
  Math Score  6.8
  
  Personal Score  7.5
  
  Worth $60

Review:  Well first things iv gotta say is this is the best DMC iv played by far. On ps3 or 360 this game 
 is breathtaking. Its got the same feel as the old DMC's before them but this time you start as Nero 
 with his devil arm you will eventually (SPOILER) play as Dante after a lot of missions. i will admit 
 after have nero i didnt wanna go to Dante for some odd reason. But i got used to Dante and kept 
 truckin through the missions. For those saying its probably just a hack/slash its not all bout that. You 
 actually have to strategize how to kill some of the bosses/monsters otherwise your ass is toast. In 
 some ways you will be hacking/slashin through monsters but the over all feel and story of the game 
 are excellent. I would recommend for the fans but anyone can enjoy a good old DMC game. If you liked 
 the old ones im sure youll love this. Buy or rent, I know youll have a great tiime with this game.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is the first Devil May Cry game to be on a Microsoft platform. This is the first 
 DMC game I have experienced so all I knew going in was that the main charcter was named Dante, 
 you fight demons, and the gameplay is similar to Ninja Gaiden. 
  The story is nothing great, but entertaining. You start out playing a new character to the DMC 
 series named Nero and his demon arm called the Devil Bringer. His girlfriend gets captured and 
 he tries to rescue her. The plot has some mild twists to it, but they feel predictible sometimes. 
 About halfway into the game you take control of Dante.
  Graphics-They are really good. The character models look great and all the enemies look very distinct 
 from each other. The cutscenes look excellent and very cinematic. The shadow effects loof awful 
 especially in the jungle evnvironment. The environments look good, except you play the same environments 
 as Nero did when you take control of Dante. The bosses are really cool looking too, but you fight 
 each boss three times in the game.
  Gameplay-Its really good. Nero and Dante are very different from each other in their fighting styles. 
 Nero's Devil Bringer becomes a staple in pulling off big combos. When you switch to Dante, you 
 will miss the Devil Bringer. Dante though is a far better character because of all the different 
 weapons and fighting styles at hi disposal. Once you start playing as Dante for a little bit , 
 you'll miss playing as him when you switch back to Nero. The game also has a style meter which 
 fills up as you pull off more complicated and varied combos. The biggest problem with the gameplay 
 is that it starts to get repetitive after a while, which will make you not really want to replay 
 the game again. It is bassically walk down a halway, get to a room that gets blocked off until 
 you defeat all the enemies in the room, and then the blockade dissapears. Multiple playthroughs 
 will unlock more stuff, but unless you want more arwork and achievements, but you will take a long 
 break from the game until you might want to play it again. Sound-The voice acting is very B-movieish. 
 Other than that everything sounds great. 
  Value- The game take about 10-12 hours to beat on the easy and medium difficulty levels and more 
 on th higher ones due to the fact they are more challenging. Their is a bonus game that you can 
 unlock and artwork.
  Overall- Devil May Cry 4 is a really good game. It suffers from some issues, like repetitveness, 
 but it is worth your time to play it. It is a fun ride from start to finish and must be played 
 by action gamers.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is guaranteed to split gamers; from the console fanboys who petitioned Capcom to 
 keep the series as a PlayStation exclusive, to the long-time aficionados who griped that early 
 footage looked identical to previous instalments, the series' next gen debut will struggle to please 
 everyone. Yet despite the developer's dogged determination to stick with a tried-and-tested formula, 
 making everything about DMC4 bigger, bolder and more outrageous than before has spawned an action 
 adventure that's hard to resist.
  
  Focusing on the escapades of a new demon slayer, Nero  silver-haired charmer Dante still appears 
 later in the quest, natch  DMC4 follows the same template as its ludicrous predecessors: slaughter 
 an army of monsters, explore some shadowy crypts, then face-off against a towering hellion who 
 blocks your path to the next challenge. But, while there are few surprises along the way, it's 
 how the action unfolds that will have DMC addicts soiling their leather trousers and Victorian 
 frockcoat.
  
  While preposterous sword and gunplay has always been a hallmark of the series, this time the combat 
 nuttiness has been cranked up a notch, with Nero sporting the ghostly, impossibly-powerful Devil 
 Bringer that allows him to grab distant opponents, wrench them across the room, then unleash a 
 brutal flurry of attacks. The chance to flip into the air then plummet headfirst towards the ground 
 while pumping enemies with bullets still makes the action insanely thrilling, and tweaked attacks 
 such as being able to spike rivals in the air and summon a spirit helper also means DMC buffs will 
 soon be hooked to mastering the fresh moves, just as newbies will be seduced by the ability to 
 unleash absurd attacks with the simplest of button presses.
  
  In terms of presentation, DMC4 also does an incredible job of updating the series, with expansive 
 worlds seeped in gothic moodiness that adds weight to every encounter, and an epic soundtrack that 
 makes walking across an empty room feel like the most significant event in gaming history. The 
 enemies you'll dispatch along the way also take the series' menagerie of monsters to unprecedented 
 new heights, ranging from creepy, Frankstein's monster-style patchwork zombies that never know 
 when they're beat, to hulking devils that dwarf the cocky protagonist and make Lord Of The Rings' 
 Balrog look like a piqued puppy. 
  
  But, like previous DMCs, what makes the game a genuine treat is that it's so damned cool; as if 
 packing a double-barrelled shotgun and six-foot sword wasn't dandy enough, the handle of Nero's 
 blade can be revved like a motorcycle, charging up a devastating attack and making you feel like 
 a diabolical badass. And combined with the game's theatrical action, sharp costumes and briefcase 
 called Pandora's Box that can flatten entire armies with its destructive power, playing DMC4 is 
 an electrifying experience that makes other action adventures feel pedestrian by comparison.
  
  Of course, the fact the game sticks with its crowd-pleasing template  and carries DMC's perennial 
 problems, such as a dodgy in-game camera and lack of multiplayer mode  means DMC4 squanders that 
 elusive fifth star, especially in the wake of this month's star pupil, Burnout: Paradise, which 
 shows what a developer can do by ditching convention and trying something completely different. 
 But even though there's nothing here you haven't seen before, DMC4 is still a blast from beginning 
 to end, and worth a punt if only to wield weapons called the Lucifer, Rebellion and Gilgamesh.

Review:  In March 2005, Devil May Cry 3 was released, and the entire action genre subsequently messed its 
 pants. Devil May Cry 3 took the formula that DMC1 created, and blew it to utterly insane proportions. 
 You got 5 melee weapons and 5 ranged weapons instead of 2 melee and (effectively) 4 ranged, unless 
 you count the Special Edition which added a further 4 melee and 1 ranged from Vergil. On top of 
 this you had the Style system to customize exactly what you wanted to focus on, and even a semi-hidden 
 multiplayer co-operative mode in the form of the Doppelganger style. It may not have had the best 
 story, but neither did 1, and with action that good you really don't need a storyline.
  
  Unfortunately, the majority of fans seemed to disagree. They wanted DMC1 back. I don't know why. 
 Apparently it had a good storyline. Many believe the Final Fantasy games have a good storyline 
 too, so that doesn't surprise me much.
  
  Sadly though, the developers listened to these people, and now we have Devil May Cry 4.
  
  
 Let me start off by saying that Devil May Cry 4 is a great game. Its weapons are very varied, the 
 boss fights are better than DMC3's, and Red Queen is possibly the greatest weapon to ever be introduced 
 into the series.
  
  I'll explain the sword for those who haven't played. Basically, on its own, Red Queen is Rebellion. 
 It plays the same, practically, with only a few small differences. It's once you start toying with 
 the Exceed system where it really differentiates itself. The Exceed system is a way of charging 
 Red Queen, coating the blade if a flammable liquid by use of a motorcycle-like throttle. You press 
 LT/L2 to rev it. However, at certain points during moves, you can 'Instant Rev/EX-Act' it. By pressing 
 the button at the right time, you get a full charge, out of a max of three. Normally it takes about 
 3 revs to get one charge. Later on you can buy a skill that, with INCREDIBLY precise timing, you 
 get all 3 charges instantly maxxed from an EX-Act, called a MAX-Act.
  
  It sounds complicated, and it is. The timing is insanely strict, even for those who've come here 
 from the more technically difficult fighting games. My estimate is somewhere around 1/20-1/30 of 
 a second. That makes it sound harder than it is, but not by much.
  
  Using a basic move depletes one Charge. Using special moves depletes as many as you have, making 
 them stronger the more Charges you have. Basically the idea is to keep the blade permanently revved, 
 so that instead of the relatively slow Rebellion, you're attacking as fast as DMC3's Agni and Rudra, 
 and doing a whole lot more damage in the process. 
  
  It's a joy to watch on Youtube.
  
  As for Dante's weapons, Gilgamesh, the new Beowulf, is much slower, but MUCH stronger, to further 
 seperate itself from Rebellion. Lucifer, his third weapon, acts similar to Nevan in DMC3, in that 
 you need to keep different formations of attacks going to get better Style ranking. The similarity 
 ends there, though, as you use melee attacks to impale enemies with energy blades, and a single 
 command to detonate them.
  
  And that's it.
  
  What, you were expecting more? Yeah, so was I. Dante only has a measely 3 weapons, and while they're 
 more varied in gameplay than DMC3's selection was, it just feels so... Lacking. Dante no longer 
 has a weapon like Agni and Rudra for getting close to enemies without knowing them back, or for 
 its great range of large-area attacks. Cerberus, even though I didn't like the weapon, was a favourite 
 of many for its shield and giant area-effect attack. And though Lucifer is similar to it, Nevan 
 was still unique with its assortment of ranged attacks and odd use of different stances to rack 
 up style.
  
  I mean, there's also Pandora, but that only works if you're into ranged weapons.
  
  Add to 
 this the fact that Yamato isn't even a weapon for either character despite promises it would be, 
 the fact that you backtrack through the exact same levels in the second half of the game, and fight 
 the main bosses 3 times each, and the inexplicably glitchy shadows in the Forest levels and there's 
 really only one thing you can say about DMC4:
  
  It's a really good game... But it just wasn't finished.
  
  More annoying yet is that in the 
 first 5 minutes, you learn exactly where the 3 years of development time and budget went to. The 
 game is overflowing with full-CGI cutscenes, and it has more FMVs than DMC3 had in-game cutscenes. 
 I imagine at least a good 2-2.5 years of time went into the graphics, so I can see why there are 
 only effectively 7 weapons.
  
  A lot of effort also went into the storyline, which is a horribly typical love plot with a predictable 
 conspiracy theory thrown in.
  
  Did I mention that the game is insanely easy? The first two difficulties are both an utter joke, 
 the third is barely better, and the fourth, the infamous Dante Must Die mode, really isn't that 
 hard. DMC3 had me stuck for MONTHS on various bosses in DMD, but it was only 40 hours into the 
 game when I'd found I'd finished Devil Hunter, Son of Sparda, and finally Dante Must Die. I know 
 lots of people whined that DMC3 was too hard, but now it's too damn easy! Keep the Human difficulty 
 the way it is, make all the others harder. Casual players SHOULD NOT be able to beat Dante Must 
 Die mode without PRACTICE. As it is the game lets you store enough healing items to do almost anything 
 you want. Three Gold Orbs? What a joke!
  
  So basically, DMC4 is a great action game, that doesn't quite mark up to DMC3, is much too easy 
 compared to DMC3, with a crap story that they spent a huge amount of time and money on, that overall 
 feels unfinished.
  
  Yup. That sums it up. Hopefully for DMC5 they'll realize they should just stick to gameplay. And 
 PUT A MULTIPLAYER BACK IN! There's nothing worse than when a game takes out features. Especially 
 great ones. Yeesh.
  
  Thanks for dropping the ball completely, Capcom.

Review:  I was talking about the swords. what did you think I was referring to? Perv.
  
  OK, DMC4. When I'd heard that we were going to be introduced to a new character, I was a bit concerned. Let's 
 face it, Dante is one bad dude. Fortunately, he just as cool as ever, and Nero is a pretty good 
 addition to the franchise. 
  
  I'll admit, I wasn't really all that crazy about DMC3. Because of that, I was reserved about this 
 one. In a nutshell, I've got to admit, DMC is back, and better than ever.
  
  The Good:
  Gameplay: Always very smooth, yet fast paced and challenging. There are times when you actually 
 start to feel a bit claustrophobic as a small horde of baddies close in on you. As satisfying as 
 it it to single one poor victim out, and wail away on him in a corner (and it is pretty satisfying) ; 
 you can't get too caught up in your beat down, or someone is gonna sneak up behind you, and part 
 your hair with their cleaver. the hits feel visceral and solid, while the control combinations 
 to pull them off are generally simple and easy to pull off.
  
  Variety: Lots of different demons turn up, each with it's own special knack for making your life 
 miserable if you're not careful. The environments, while basically taking place within three (or 
 is it four) main areas are also varied and interesting to explore and interact with.
  
  Characters: You start with Nero, and eventually move on to Dante. Both have very similar, yet distinctively 
 unique fighting styles, with a broad array of weaponry and attack combos to choose from.
  
  Backgrounds: the world that you're immersed into is beautifully portrayed in this game; and while 
 they are visually stunning, they're also simple to navigate, and well worth exploring. the background 
 story is one that's been done before, more than once; but despite that, it's well done, and intriguing.
 
  
  Bosses: Boss fights are all very well written, and just plain fun. They're also progressively more 
 difficult as you work through the game (which is how it should be, IMO) ; yet none of them are so 
 overwhelming that you just want to give it up.
  
  The Bad
  Not much, actually. there are a few occasions where the camera angle leaves you literally forced 
 to just mash the buttons and hope for the best; but those are very, very rare; and when they do 
 occur, you can correct the problem by merely directing the fight to another part of the area. One 
 or two of the side missions are unnecessarily hard; and from time to time you may see a hidden 
 item (ie a piece of blue orb) , but getting it is next to impossible.
  
  In a nutshell, fans of the DMC series should be rabid over this one. Those who aren't familiar 
 with the series, will also likely find it to be an extremely entertaining and engrossing game. 
 Personally, I've got a feeling that this one isn't gonna be going back to gamefly any time soon. 
 As I said before, this is probably the best in the DMC series, IMO; and a very nice introduction 
 of a classic game franchise to the next gen system. 
  
  If you're a fan of the fantasy RPG genre, I would imagine you'll love this one. If you aren't, 
 check this game out, and you just might become one.

Review:  Gameplay:9.1/10. (Be prepared, there is a lot to talk about in Gameplay since its the main part 
 of the game) Like i said, DMC 4 just blew me away. I was NOT disappointed and the game was DEFINITELY 
 worth the wait!
  
  NERO:
  
  You take control of a new character, named Nero. He has this kind of demonic arm called the Devil 
 Bringer which is basically his main offensive weapon. DMC 4 first starts off, as Nero heads toward 
 the Opera House to see a close friend, Kyrie singing for the Order of The Sword and to trying to 
 listen to the preaching of "His Holiness". The Order of The Sword is basically a group that worships 
 Sparda, the Dark Knight as a god. All of a sudden, Dante appears, and shoots His Holiness. After seeing 
 this, you might be a little puzzle why Dante just came out of nowhere and basically shot the guy 
 in the face, and got his face covered in blood. Play the game, and you will find out. All i gotta 
 say about the story is that, its solid. Nothing special, but very very solid! I was disappointed 
 with the ending boss, But it was worth all the effort. For this game has large replay value, as i 
 have already gotten 79 hours into the game since 2 days after its release date. No im not a fanboy, i 
 like a variety of games (Call of Duty, Halo, Fire Emblem, Etc) for those of you who actually read 
 this review, and thought i was a fanboy. Whoops, straying from gameplay a bit, As i was saying, the 
 Devil Bringer is the main offensive weapon of Nero. While Nero does not have all the styles Dante 
 has, He does quite in fact have his "Own" style of fighting. Though there isnt a lot of combos to 
 buy, This game was basically created to make your OWN combos, by the Style Meter. Nero's main weapon (other 
 than the Devil Bringer) the Red Queen is a powerful weapon, with quite a cool design to it. I have 
 seen a regular Order of The Sword weapon, and the design is pretty cool, but the Red Queen takes 
 the cake!
  
  The Red Queen, has a fuel injection system which allows him to increase the power of his attacks, and 
 unleash devastating moves, Further increasing the ability to make your own combos. Never seen a 
 type of sword quite like it. The Red Queen, has a VERY powerful ability even in the beginning of 
 the game, and it is called EX-Act (i think) . This ability, is not listed, but what it does is.. After 
 every blow you deal, if you press LT right after the attack, the Red Queen fuel gauge will immediately 
 fill up one bar.. an Ability, MAX-Act enables it to fill up the WHOLE gauge (though it requires even 
 more slick timing) . So you see, The Red Queen has a lot of possibilities. The Devil Bringer's main 
 offensive ability.. Buster, can be used on all enemies, and All enemies have their "own kind" of buster, different 
 ways in how Nero deals with them using the Devil Bringer. It can also be used on Bosses, and it 
 does look like it unleashes a LOT of carnage. Another ability of the Devil Bringer, further even 
 more increases your ability to easily do combos... the Snatch ability. This ability, enables you 
 to snatch enemies far away, Meaning you dont have to walk ALL the way over there, and slaughtering 
 them, you can simply PULL them over. This also helps you in combos, because if you knock an enemy 
 back, you can simply FORCE him to GET the damned demon back here and kill him! This ability, however 
 cannot be used on ALL enemies, some enemies is that you do not pull the enemy back, instead you pull 
 yourself over to the enemy if the demon is too big (Bosses for example) . Snatch is still extremely 
 nifty, and will help you in situations in this game, making the game more enjoyable. Nero secondary 
 weapon, which he uses in ranged combat, The Blue Rose is a double firing,6 shooter revolver. While 
 not extremely powerful, it is useful in various situations such as just dealing damage from range, or 
 doing combos. People say ranged attacks in this game are useless, but thats not true. Just because 
 the damage is low, does not mean its useless. The Blue Rose is also a neat weapon, Made by Nero's 
 own hand. Last but not least, Nero himself has a Devil Trigger. While not quite as the same as Dante's 
 Devil Trigger, it is better and worse in several ways. First off, each of your attacks gets an extra 
 attack by Yamato (these attacks are also slightly stronger than your attacks in regular form i believe) , and 
 a health regeneration. These extend combo possibilities even more, and there are two slow, but nice 
 moves to purchase for Nero's DT. There is just one flaw to Nero's DT that Dante's DT had, No staggering. 
 When using Dante's DT, you would not stagger, but for Nero you can. Buster moves however, are strengthened 
 and extended which could deal plenty of damage. Speaking of Purchasing, There is now a new proud 
 soul system that lets you purchase SKILLS, so you can use your Red Orbs for something else. Some 
 people may find this ridiculous, but its actually pretty useful. 
  
  Long review huh? Well a Review is a review
  
  DANTE: Yes YOU CAN USE DANTE IN THIS GAME!!! 
 Dante is about the same as usual from the previous game... EXCEPT BETTER!!! you can NOW change styles 
 on the fly, instead of doing so at Divinity Statues and the beginning of Missions!! This makes the 
 game much easier to play with Dante, and extremely more fun. Dante has the Trickster Style which 
 uses speed to dodge enemy attacks, Swordmaster which strengthens your weapons, gunslinger which makes 
 more possibilities to your Firearms, Royal Guard which focuses on strategy, survival, and defense, and 
 last but not least a new style called Dark Slayer, and not a lot is said about this style. Trickster, can 
 be used to dodge your enemies attacks WITH EASE and quickly overwhelm your foes. Swordmaster, with 
 the Style action button can do a LOT of flashy and powerful moves for each weapon. Gunslinger, like 
 i said doesent really raise the power of Firearms, but makes more possibilities. Royal Guard uses 
 strategy and defense. If your not a pro DMC player, then you prolly wont be using this style much. 
 Wait i take that back, even Pros dont use it at times, this style is just extremely useful in many 
 situations. The last new style, Dark Slayer is a very flasy style, just without variety. All it has 
 is 2 combos, and a Dante version of Judgment Cut (its called Dimension Slash, but i like Judgment 
 Cut better) which looks and is very powerful. But since this game is designed to make your own combos, You 
 can use this style to extend your combos. Dante also gets the Gilgamesh (DMC 4 Beowulf) Lucifer, and 
 Pandora but you should find out on your own what they are.
  
  Whew that took awhile, not sure if you read all that but w/e..
  Graphics:9.5/10. EVERY DMC GAME 
  This is the best looking DMC yet, and looks quite impressive 
 on HD. Devil May Cry, back in the day from the 1st to the 3rd game were ALL one of the best looking 
 games ever (in their days) . This, however.. is just pure pwnage.. BEST CUTSCENES EVER!!! People say 
 there are TOO many cutscenes and its annoying. Annoying? I watch them all. They're cool, and if 
 your annoyed there is something called Skipping the cutscene (though there are some that cannot 
 be skipped)
  
  Sound:9/10. Terrific voice acting, some nice sound effects, What more could you want?
  
  Value:9/10. 
 This is much better than the 3rd game, but does not surpass the first. I was very impressed nonetheless.
 
  
  Overall:9.3/10 (my direct score) Awesome, absolutely awesome. The game excels in every category (not 
 without a few flaws of course.) and i do not expect a DMC5, but would be glad if they continued 
 the series, for Devil May Cry is now considered a Legendary game!

Review:  Four has been a good number for Capcom. Their last game with the number 4, Resident Evil 4, was 
 one of the best games of all time. Now their other title, Devil May Cry has reached it's fourth 
 game. But does the quality match up to that of RE4? It certainly does. Devil May Cry started the 
 whole over the top action and it sure doesn't dissapoint with DMC4. It's full of pure action and 
 high adrenaline.
  The game features a new character, Nero, who has a nifty Devil Bringer that helps separate him 
 from the Main DMC character Dante. He's able to reach high places, grab far items and most of all 
 throw down enemies. At first, it feels as if Nero has the edge over Dante. But once you get to 
 upgrade all of Dantes abilities and gather new weapons, you'll find out that he's the better character.
 
  The games main course are the boss battles. Nothing feels more satisfying than laying the beatdown 
 on them. Each boss is very unique and very fun to fight. 
  Graphically, DMC4 is a stunner, though it's not surprising as Capcom has delivered it before with 
 Lost Planet and Dead Rising. It's real-time cutscenes are just remarkable and plays as if you were 
 in a movie. Graphics whores will drool all over this.
  Though will all being said, there are some cons. Major backtracking, lame puzzles, iffy camera 
 and short playtime keeps this game from being perfect.
  Overall, DMC4 is a must for all action game fans or just those looking for a great quality game. 
 
  Capcom, damn it, you've done it again.

Review:  I have played all of the devil may cries, 1, 2, 3 & 4. All of which have their good points, yes 
 even 2 has good points. I can start the review by saying its 3 with better well everything and 
 yet theres something missing and I just don't know what. 
  You start as the character Nero, a character that resembles Dante but with a freakish hand, the 
 devil bringer. But not forgetting the other one... o yes DANTE. Good thing too as you will find 
 everything a bit easy as Nero. The enemies are on the side of the arena you'll still be able to 
 hit them with your full force. Dante is how he always is, awesome, stylish and well more... well.. 
 awesome.
  Ok gameplays awesome, characters are great with excellent voice acting and well the story now that 
 may be the thing missing... Nero's side of the story is as you'd expect with any Devil May Cry 
 awesome character kicks demons ass. Dante's however seems just to be replaying Nero's side with 
 Dante's charm. Except from this I guess it's a good game, some great highlights throughout but 
 not the best.

Review:  Devil May Cry is a longstanding franchise that traditionally has been a Playstation exclusive is 
 now out on the Xbox 360 to great surprise and joy of the user base. Finally, a great hack and slash 
 game for a new group of people to try, but is it worth your 60 bucks?
  
  The first thing to keep in mind is that Devil May Cry 4 is not just a hack and slash game but also 
 an action-adventure game set in a fictional world. Unlike the previous games though, DMC4 may be 
 considered a departure from the series for multiple reasons, the foremost being that you only play 
 as Dante for less than half the game. The game introduces a new character as well who is the main 
 focus of the story and the first half of the adventure, and since Dante is also motivated by his 
 actions, that would make him almost more important of a character in the grand scheme of things.
 
  
  Nero, the new character, is not a religious man. He and one of singers at his church, Kyrie, have 
 a little something going on. So naturally the game starts off with Nero being late and Kyrie looking 
 for him while singing her piece during mass. Kind of typical; that being said, Kyrie is also the 
 sister of Credo, a member of "The Order" a nefarious organization that you'll learn about over 
 the course of the game, so I won't give too much away here about it. 
  
  If you're a hardcore Devil May Cry fan and you're immediately disappointed by the lack of Dante 
 in the game you won't be upset for long. Less than halfway through the opening cut-scene Dante 
 drops in on a church session that Nero and Kyrie are attending for seemingly no other reason than 
 to assassinate the pastor leading the mass, Sanctus. Thus, the events set off by him turn the cogs 
 of destruction and mayhem that lead the course of the newest iteration of the franchise.
  
  The playing style from experience players will have to be slightly refined to match Nero, as he's 
 the character you'll play for most of the game. While not too dissimilar from Dante, there are 
 a couple key differences that make him a unique character. Both Nero and Dante have gigantic disproportional 
 swords, but Nero has a sword with a handle that resembles a motorcycle allowing you to rev it up 
 to make the blade get red-hot to increase the damage with doing a move combo. This allows you to 
 do some really damaging moves if you time your button hits right. Nero also has an arm called the 
 "Devil Bringer," it looks and acts like a demonic arm should. When doing combos with it you'll 
 pull off some extremely damaging combos that you can even pull off in boss fights. Imagine picking 
 the boss up and throwing him across the stage!
  
  Other than those two differences though, the Devil May Cry formula hasn't really undergone very 
 many changes and retains the same basic puzzle structures and fighting moves you've come to expect, 
 and that's not all a bad thing either. While the game has a variety of environments you'll traverse, 
 it's worth saying that this game looks amazing. From the first cut-scene you watch up until the 
 last one, you'll be oohing and ahhing at the gorgeous videos and the extreme attention to detail 
 that is still rare in gaming today. 
  
  The loading times are minimal taking only a couple seconds to load each area. However, the areas 
 are small and sometimes you'll be wishing they took a couple more seconds to load a bit of a bigger 
 area since you'll be hitting a load every few minutes it seems like. However since there is no 
 actual loading screen and it seems fairly instant, the only legitimate annoyance would be the noise 
 it makes when you enter and exit an area. Talk about annoying!
  
  The other annoying trend is also a major complaint with the entire game. Once you get exactly halfway 
 through the game (which takes only about 5 hours) you're forced to switch to Dante. This wouldn't 
 be so bad if you didn't have to unlearn the "Devil Bringer" mechanic and retrain your mind without 
 any kind of intro to the character (which would have been nice for newbies to the series like myself) . 
 However at this point, you have to backtrack through the entire game, fight every boss over again, 
 and return to your starting point to finish the game. This both is annoying and obvious filler 
 which they don't even bother to cover up. 
  
  While you're backtracking though, Dante acquires the most powerful moves and equipment for your 
 face-off with "The Savior" (again spoilers I won't mention) . Some of the equipment includes Pandora's 
 box, which is basically a super-weapon that you can pull out at will. Dante can transform Pandora's 
 box into about 2-6 of the 666 possible combinations.
  
  Clocking in at just 10 hours of game play for the average player who's never touched a Devil May 
 Cry game before, it's the best hack and slash adventure game you can buy right now for $6 an hour. 
 It's not going to change your mind if you hate the genre, and it's certainly not going to be the 
 most innovative title you've ever played. But while the replay and the achievements might not be 
 that fun or worthwhile, you'll want to at least give this game a rental because of its phenomenal 
 story and genuinely interesting characters.

Review:  * note from chaos: if you are a fan of the devil may cry series, or dont nessecarily mind what 
 I put as negatives, bump the overall score up by a whole point *
  
  Pros
  + fun, high paced action
  + lots of "wow" moments
  + good character models
  + entertaining 
 story
  + Much more playable for newbies
  
  Cons
  - Groan Worthy Dialouge
  - Mildly Repetitve
  - Dated Presentation
  
  In the fourth installment of the Devil May Cry, 
 developer Capcom have done something they have been trying to do for years, a sequel that is almost 
 as good as the origianl Devil May Cry. 
  
  The gameplsy is standard DMC, go in room, kick a$$, go into next room, kick some more a$$, occasional 
 platforming scenario etc etc, but within the formula is where DMC thrives and fails at the same 
 time. The game is fun, lots of fun, but the biggest fault of the game lies within how it is presented. 
 The game just feels old. Cheesy voice acting, effects (i. e bullets shattering the screen whenever 
 you beat the level, or a female voice stating the title seductivly whenever you load the game up) , 
 static camera angles, and levels that harken back to pre-rendered level design really take away 
 from the experience of this game, especially when games like God of War are uping the standards 
 in the "hack & slash" genre.
  
  The graphics are great. The facial animations of the characters are some of the best in games thus 
 far, but the level design is where the game falters. While the levels look nice, they also feel 
 vacantly empty, which through out the course of the game always felt strange. Besides that though, 
 the game has excellent graphics.
  
  Audio is by far the games weakest element, with cheesy dialouge and one song that replays over 
 and over everytime you engage in combat. The voice acting is good, but you cant help but wonder 
 if some of the dialouge got translated properly.
  
  The game is also much more playable for those who dont live, breath and sleep DMC, than its previous 
 installment, which is a huge plus in my mind.
  
  Overall, DMC4 is a great, fun game for the Xbox 360 and PS3, and even with its dated presntation 
 is still a worhty purchase if your a fan of the series or action games like God of War & Ninja 
 Gaiden.

Review:  Though the focus might be more on Nero than Dante, and could've been named something else with 
 a Dante cameo, DMC4 still has everything that fans expect of the game  over the top fight sequences, 
 tons of replayability and an experience with an excellent production value. Whether it's on the 
 PS3 or the 360, action fans are going to get one incredible experience with this game, and if you 
 own either system, you'll have a great time. While this is more Nero's story than Dante's, this 
 chapter of the DMC franchise maintains just about every facet of the series fans have come to know 
 and love. Visually arresting and vibrantly depicted, this is one of those games that showcases the 
 power of your system. From sarcasm to apathy, the dialogue is almost perfectly delivered. Mixed 
 with the trademark electrometal soundtrack, this is DMC through and through. Dante feels more like 
 an afterthought than a real addition, the Exceed system is a bit weak, and the repetitive level 
 design is particularly dismaying. The longer load times aren't a plus, either.

Review:  The 3rd game was ridiculously difficult at times, so this game was very easy for me, but don't 
 get me wrong, this game is very good with all the the new features, the awe-inspiring graphics, 
 and the Devil-Bringer (which really surprised me, cause it's so fun to use!) that really makes 
 it feel like a new experience, while staying faithful to the Devil May Cry formula. And speaking 
 of the Devil-Bringer, honestly, I thought of it as some kind of cheap gimmick before I played it, 
 but it's very fun to use, and very effective, but the only thing bad about it, is you'll get used 
 to using it in your combos, and then when you switch to Dante, you can't use it, and it throws 
 you for a loop, having to learn new combos that are effective on which enemies. This surprisingly, 
 enough, makes the game much harder, and that's when it gets frustrating. So, overall, It's the 
 same game, but with enough fresh stuff to keep it feeling new, but the drastically easier difficulty 
 makes you a little bit over confident, and then gameplay changes so much from Nero to Dante, that 
 it gets frustrating.

Review:  I tried out Devil May Cry 1 and 3. I thought they were okay but not good enough for me to play 
 past the first 2 chapters. I bought this and I was very pleased. The graphics are worlds apart 
 from the PS2 graphics of course that the other games had and the music is beautiful and atmospheric. 
 I think that this game is the best in the series so far. I don't agree with the 8 grade that Gamespot 
 gave it, but I usually don't agree with their grades (ie: Heavenly Sword was awful to play and 
 that got a higher grade than this?!) and that's why I write my own reviews. The story keeps you 
 playing wondering what will happen. You have many more moves and magic. Playing as Nero is easier 
 than Dante because the devil arm gives you a one up on the enemies. The only problem I had with 
 the game is that I played it on Human mode as apposed to Devil Hunter. It didn't state that this 
 is easy mode just for people that really haven't played the DMC series. I find the Human mode way 
 too easy, the only thinking I have to do is just where do I go and solving puzzles, so next time 
 I would play it on Devil Hunter mode and I would recommend others to play the game on the Devil 
 Hunter mode as well unless they want easy. I bet you if you play this game you will just go through 
 it, it keeps you hooked. Definitely a must have if you own a 360/PS3/or high end PC.

Review:  Ya know after the 10th level of the same combos over and over again, i'd say that it was a great 
 game, but kinda started to lose my attention... and i play hack and slash games for hours upon end. 
 The graphics didn't look that great either, but what do you expect, it's a console. I've never 
 been impressed with console graphics, hopefully as the abilities become more cost friendly, they'll 
 start buffering the graphics more. But that is me just hoping. I'll try it on PC next to see if 
 it is worth it. It is not the greatest game ever, by any means.
  The repetition becomes obvious when a new foe just feels like the ones you've been fighting for 
 the past 3 hours and every boss uses the same moves. You start to get the feeling like you've already 
 beaten the game, you just have to beat it about 10 more times to actually finish it. But, i have 
 to say that it is very fun for the time it held my attention. 
  The story line is pretty good, no real depth to your new charactor to the DMC searies, but i guess 
 most gamers look past that. I don't, he's very 2-D and says the genaric one liners as he tries 
 to insult the bosses, and his usual "slam dunk" and "go to hell" get old about an hour later. The 
 sound track of snappy, "hard-rock" music when you fight or are getting ready to fight also is repetitious 
 too.
  A big complaint i had was you don't get enough of those blood thingys to buy health and not enough 
 of currency (forgot what it was called) to buy moves, and the moves you were able to purchase just 
 weren't anything flashy and you could do the same amount of damage just with your main moves. 
 
  it's overall a fun game, worth a rent and weekend play but definatly not a purchaser at all.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is an amazing game. It has a wonderful story with phenomenal visuals and sound. 
 The gameplay is addictive, you'll find yourself staying up late at night trying to beat the game. 
 The game is a bit different from the previous ones, but if you're new to the series you wont be 
 left in the dark. The collectors edition of the game includes a bonus anime, with 4 episodes in 
 it that will help explain the story to newcomers, and give DMC veterans a nice extra. Completing 
 the game also unlocks the History of DMC, which explains all the previous games. The game can be 
 spend playing the story mode, watching the cutscenes, or you can just skip them and fight everything 
 that comes your way. There are a total of 5 difficulties, a blood palace mode which is a survival 
 mode with 100 levels. Playing as Dante or Nero, the battles are fun, exciting and different. The 
 360 does not have many fighting games, but this game is all you need. A lot of complaints have 
 been made about the camera angles, difficulty and story. The camera angles are fine, sometimes 
 it is fixed but you can move it and adjust it. There are difficulties to choose from, and honestly, 
 why would you play such an easy game? Each difficulty increases its enemies, giving them new attacks, 
 harder enemies appearing more often, and making them more intelligent. The story, to me, is amazing. 
 Watching each cutscene is like watching a part of a movie, and throughout the game you unlock the 
 cutscenes to watch in the Gallery, rather than completing the entire game to unlock it. So if you 
 miss a line or have to skip a scene, you can always go back without having to beat the entire game. 
 Overall, this is my favorite game, and one of the best games ever. Rent it, or download the demo 
 from XBL (its free) and see if you like it.

Review:  An easy way to start this review is that I'm basically brand new to this series. I've always known 
 about it, but never owned a Playstation console while they were around. I played DMC3 at my friend's 
 house for all of 10 minutes and thought it was incredible, but since it was half way through the 
 game.. the difficulty was unforgiving..
  
  But that's enough of the past, let's focus on the present! DMC4 is a phenomenal achievement in 
 brawler style gameplay. The pace of the game is always fast, stringing together combos is relatively 
 easy and makes for awesome battles, the boss battles are also quite the achievement in there own 
 way too.
  
  Now for the break down, easy way to start it.. graphics. There's nothing exactly "new and amazing" 
 in the graphics for DMC4, though it still has an amazing landscape. The forests shadows are realistic, 
 the bushes and trees look great, though most is just there for show and off the beaten path. One 
 of the main graphics I thought were good was Dante and Nero. They made them both look great, Nero 
 the spunky new young hunter, and Dante the beaten down older of the two. The stubble on Dante's 
 face was actually the first thing to grab my attention, heh.
  
  As far as the gameplay goes, it's top notch. Brawler games are my favorite, and this game delivers 
 what I wanted from it. When you aren't being trapped in by 5 or 6 monsters, you're only walking 
 a bit before the next attack or cutscene. Though that may seem bland, the gameplay gets it right. 
 Every mission something new pops out to try and kill you, with different move sets, but of course.. 
 brings all the little guys from the previous levels to play with. So you're never bored in the 
 fights. But alas, the best of the gameplay.. the boss fights. Well in my opinion anyways. All of 
 them are HUGE, although most of it is just using the same combo, if you string together all the 
 right things you do some pretty cool little specials, especially with Nero's neat little arm.
 
  
  But of course, none of this would be all that good without a story now would it? Luckly for us, 
 the story is good. Really good in fact. The story is basically divided in half, two 11 missions 
 sets (or one 10 and one 11.. there's either 21 or 22 missions in it.. heh) . You start off as Nero, 
 running around being a cocky little ******* like Dante. But, they don't know eachother just yet. 
 Then in a thrilling turn of effects (in the opening cutscenes I may add....) dante busts in, kills 
 some folks, fights Nero (the tutorial is fighting him) , and saunters off. Leaving you confused 
 as all s**t... Luckly the story unfolds pretty fast, running into Dante almost every level after 
 this (and not fighting him again for awhile) . But after a major twist.. involving the capture of 
 Nero (that's all ya get! no spoilers!) , the controls switch over to Dante, you get all your skill 
 points and stuff back to invest into Dante's moves, and then you take off and try and solve some 
 mysterious demon stuff.
  
  Of course, no good game is without it's faults... DMC4's only real flaw I've seen so far is.. well 
 let me put it this way. After kicking 3 huge demonic butts, well.. let's just say you'll see them 
 again as Dante. But Dante doesn't let things escape. The only real saving grace for this flaw, 
 is that when you do finally kill them, you unlock the really awesome new swords and guns. I was 
 never attatched to Redemption, Dante's sword, so when I unlocked Gilgamesh, the friggin' awesome 
 hand to hand combat gloves and boots, powered with that same motor thingy in Nero's sword.
  
  With an awesome story, good twists, plenty of weapons and options, plus two very likeable main 
 characters, and of course Dante's usual hot friends, it's hard to not love this game's charm. Either 
 new or old to the series, I'm sure this is bound to please most people. There's always those few 
 with.. different tastes.. in games. *cringe* It's worth the full price tag, and if you don't think 
 so then at least rent the bloody thing!
  
  9/10

Review:  This has got to be one of the easiest games ive played in a while. Ive completed it twice now and 
 its just no challenge. Still a great game though.
  
  Nero is an awesome character. I love his combat style, he just flows from move to move. The devil 
 hand is easy mode though. I found it a little more difficult playing dante and not being able to 
 just press b to grap the enemy. Despite playing as Dante offering a bit more of a challange I didnt 
 really enjoy it. Playing as him really annoyed me as I felt his style was different to that of 
 the previous games. I hate how cheesy he was aswell. I just wanted him to stfu. 
  
  The worst thing about DMC 4 has got to be the boss fights. Yes they are fun the first time round, 
 but when you have to face them all again while playing the dice game in the saviour, they get a 
 bit annoying. The developers could of added a bit of variation by adding some different bosses 
 for the dice game.
  
  I dont think ill play the game for a third time and neither do I think i will finish off the rest 
 of the achievements. This is deffinetely a trade in game for me. I think Ill trade it in for Turok.

Review:  first of all i'd like to say i've been a fan of dmc since part 1 was released on the playstation2 
 and i was really disappointed when i heard dante was being replaced by a new character Nero but 
 it all worked out fine. The gameplay was kept the same from part 3. this new character nero acts 
 just like dante you won't notice the difference at all if u've played any of the previous games. 
 The only difference is Nero's devil arm (devil bringer) which can reach out and grab enemies from 
 afar which i found made it extremely easy to get high style combo's like smokin, smokin style, and 
 smokin sick style. the overall story was good but to me it wasnt very original it reminded me way 
 to much of part 1 especially the fight with that big statue representing sparda. Towards the end 
 of the game you get to play as dante which was pretty cool he still has all his moves and weapons 
 from previous games and a couple new ones but i didnt like that you had to go backwards in the 
 story and defeat the bosses you already defeated with nero, that was kinda boring to me but i was 
 still happy dante was'nt kicked out of the series completely. the graphics were the best yet out 
 of the series but what would u expect since its the first dmc game to be released on next-gen consoles 
 lol. Overall i would say this was a great game it was a little to easy for me though so the best 
 advice i can give to previous dmc players is to set the games difficulty to the hardest difficulty 
 which is the son of sparda, demon hunter is alright too but it might be a little to easy and im 
 saying this because i beat the game in less than 12 hours the day after i bought it which was the 
 day after it came out lol overall though this is a good game i would say its for fans of the series 
 and a few characters from previous games appear in this one.

Review:  I was psyched for this game the moment they announced it and my anticipation for Devil May Cry 
 4 grew stronger for every new trailer and screenshot posted.
  
  When I finally got to play it I was hooked (and I still am) . Nero is an awesome character who makes 
 fighting in this game alot diffirent, and might I add way cooler, than the previous games thanks 
 to his Devil Bringer and the Exceed system of his sword. Slashing up demons and huge bosses has 
 never been this fun!
  
  The action is top notch regardless of which character you play as. Dante is as cool as he's ever 
 been, with his cocky attitude you'd sure to get some laughs at his comments. He still has his fighting 
 styles from DMC 3 with one major advantage - now you can change whenever you want. Plus he has 
 a lot of weapons to choose from. 
  
  You get to watch some of the coolest cutscenes as you play and it really sucks you in. Now we get 
 to the graphics. All the environments are very appealing to look at, the monsters and bosses are 
 very detailed and effects, reflections, lighting etc completes the visual package. The only downside 
 is that the environments and bosses become repetitive.
  
  If you have played the previous games (and liked them) then this is a must play. If you are new 
 to Devil May Cry then this is a must play as well, if you are an action fan.
  
  + Beautiful graphics
  + Awesome new character
  + Fighting is a whole lot of fun
  + Great 
 cutscenes
  + Rock solid voice acting
  
  - Environments and bosses become repetitive
  - The camera can be slightly annoying sometimes

Review:  I have only been gaming for about two years, which means that I have never played the previous 
 titles of the franchise. This is a shame because I have fallen in love with this installment of 
 the game and so badly would like to play the three previous installments.
  
  Presentation- The game sets you up as newcomer Nero who is the main focus of the game. Dont worry 
 you still get to play as cocky bad4ss Dante for seven of the missions. There are 20 missions for 
 you to play through and, depending on difficulty/player skill, will take you 10-25 hours roughly (each 
 individual playthrough) . This game delivers a great cinematic experience and story every second 
 of the way.
  
  Graphics- The graphics are some of the best I have seen on the xbox 360. Although there aren't 
 as many different levels as I would have liked, the levels that are in the game have fantastic 
 design and textures that you rarely see in games. This game has a lot of cutscenes and they all 
 look etrordinary.
  
  Audio- The game has terrific voice acting and sound effects. The bummer is that you will notice 
 in a few cutscenes, where the characters are talking, there will be music playing that is louder 
 than the volume of their voices.
  
  Gameplay- Stylized action, puzzle solving, and loaded with boss fights! The only negative thing 
 I can say is that once you take control of Dante you backtrack through everything you had just 
 done with Nero. This wasn't a huge deal for me because I was so excited about using Dante that 
 I didn't really care. There are 6 different difficulties for you to blast your way through. Once 
 you have completed a difficulty you can start a new game on a higher or lower difficulty and continue 
 to upgrade your character's skills.
  
  So if you like fantastic graphics, exhilarating gameplay, and an amazing story/cinematic experience 
 than this game is for you.

Review:  Gameplay: The gameplay in this game isn't what I'd call the best since all you do is hit the same 
 buttons over and over to activat your sword, gun, or the demonic arm. In any case the actions work 
 fluently throughout the game and Nero has one of every type of weapon being sword, gun, and arm 
 whereas Dante has three gun and sword pairs. All enemies and bosses are somewhat easy but when 
 hit alot of time, points, life, and style is lost.
  
  Graphics: Top of the Line
  
  Sound: Great
  
  Character: The character design, voices, and personalities are shown well and 
 are easy to relate too.
  
  Achievments: This is not a game for those just looking for acheivments when some want S ranks for 
 all the missions on every difficulty of the game or getting one million red orbs and proud souls 
 not only will have you playing through the game at least 15 time but also stop you from buying 
 new combos or health items. In any case not the game for acheivments. 
  
  For anyone looking for a game with a good story, weird enemies, and aren't bothered by repetative 
 gameplay this is a game for you. Also score would be higher but I personally get annoyed with repetition 
 if playing through multiple missions at once when there are 20 missions.

Review:  After one game that didn't even feel like part of the series, and one game that punished players 
 for purchasing it, Devil May Cry has reattained its old glory with the fourth installation of the 
 series. There's not much brand new here, but what made DMC 1 and 3 great has been massively refined 
 into a gem of a game.
  
  DMC4 follows the shoes of a new character, Nero; and unlike Metal Gear Solid 2, this is almost 
 a welcome change (mostly because Nero doesn't suck) . It helps to breathe new life into the game, 
 since Nero has powers that are quite different from Dante's. Nero uses his Devil Arm, an attribute 
 that is never really delved into, much like Nero's relation to Dante (per DMC's usual idiom, the 
 storyline will mostly focus on the here-and-now, with little to no backstory) . Nero's arm allows 
 him to pull off a few neat tricks that aren't in Dante's bag, including grabbing enemies, rappeling 
 off special points, and do context-sensitive combos. Most of the core moves are still there (aerial 
 combos, gunplay, etc.) , but the new moves are a lot of fun to play around with, especially when 
 some of the higher-level moves are learned.
  
  On the downside, what Nero starts with is what he gets. One sword, one gun, and the Devil Arm. 
 He picks up one other weapon as the game progresses, which brings back a DMC classic. But other 
 than that, he only has the 3 weapons, unlike being able to collect several as the game went on 
 in 3.
  
  About halfway through the story shifts to Dante, who is back in his full glory. He has a grab-bag 
 of DMC 1 and 3 moves, and his weapon sets, styles, and moves pretty much mirror DMC 3 exact, with 
 a few new things here and there. Making the switch from memorizing one set of moves to another 
 can be a bit disorienting at first, but eventually gets easier.
  
  Level design is nice to look at; especially the levels that take place in a forest. Shadows are 
 rendered down very realistically, plant life looks lush. Characters move fluidly, with mostly constant 
 frame rate; can dip on oaccasion when large combos are done with high numbers of enemies on screen. 
 
  
  Unfortunately, the same levels are used for the second 10 levels as the first 10 levels. And while 
 they're good looking, they're not THAT good. The levels are slightly varied the second time around, 
 mostly in a shallow way by blocking off certain areas and bottle-necking the player to where they 
 are supposed to be. It's not a BAD thing, but it does feel like an artificial way to expand gameplay 
 time to fight the same bosses in the same levels. The backtracking in parts of DMC 1 and 3 was 
 bad enough. But there are different enemies tossed in for some flavor, so it's not a complete rehash.
 
  
  The difficulty of enemies stays pretty constant; ratcheting up just enough every so often to match 
 the progression of the game. The punishing difficulty of DMC3 is not present here; it's more of 
 an ease into the higher challenges of the game. 
  
  All in all, a nice package on this game. Two playable characters, a 10-15 hour main storyline, 
 and of course it wouldn't be Capcom without a whole slew of extra difficulties, sidequests, battle 
 dungeons, and unlockables. And on the 360 for the XB Points afficianado is an array of 'secret' 
 challenges to play for. 
  
  Pros:
  
  -New character adds variety to series
  -Excellent looking backgrounds, levels, and characters
  -Evened-out difficulty
  
  Cons:
 
  
  -Limited weapon selection
  -VERY rare framerate drop
  -Same levels for first and second half of game artificially expands gametime

Review:  (Please note that if my proflie shows a 3.5 score for this game, it is incorrect after I have given 
 it an 9)
  
  The 4th installment in the Devil May Cry universe, in this episode a new main hero named Nero joins 
 the players.
  Nero begins in the story as a member of a religious order called the 'Order of the Sword'. You 
 are drawn in straight away with an ingame video showing the assassination of the Orders leader, 
 Sanctus, by Dante the previous hero of Devil May Cry. Nero confronts Dante in a great fight with 
 you in control. This tutorial brings you into sync with the new character and the new style of 
 fighting with Nero's 'Devil Bringer', his right arm which is Demonic in form and wields great power.
 
  For 13 missions you play Nero in an a story which engrosses you in to a story with plot twists, 
 intense fights and bosses which are all unique in style and moves, offering you great challenges.
 
  But Dante is not forgotten and is controllable for 7 missions of intense fighting. Although lacking 
 a Devil Bringer he still packs a punch with multiple choices of weaponry and stunning combos should 
 give an interesting slant of play which will bring in those smiles of achievement and satisfaction.
 
  Bonus features such as leaderboards, harder difficulties and the fighting gauntlet 'Bloody Palace' 
 will keep everyone playing for months to come. The only feature missing is online multi-player 
 and downloadable features which have already been confirmed are not going to happen as Capcom set 
 their sights to pastures new which is one of few downsides. But because of these few disapointments 
 are the only things holding this game back, and for this reason it deserves a 9.

Review:  I've been waiting for a very long time for this game so I expected it to be one of the most amazing 
 games I've ever played. So after beating it I was pleasantly satisfied. That being said this game 
 isn't all just amazing so here is what i thought.
  
  The Good- Great Story, Great Game play (Nero is a great new character and DMC veterans will enjoy 
 the portion where you play as Dante) , Great Graphics, Amazing Cut scenes, Fun Boss Battles, Move 
 sets are fun to dish out as well as combos, Good weapon variety (not as much as 1 or 3 but still 
 a good variety) .
  
  The Bad- Dante levels are basically Nero levels backward (except for the last couple of levels) , 
 You fight some of the bosses 3 times, The difficulty was way to easy as fun as bosses were very 
 few items were needed (however I did die a couple of times)
  
  So Devil May Cry 4 was an outstanding game with very few problems over all a 9.5/10

Review:  For fans of the series, DMC 4 will be everything you want it to be. For those of you who are playing 
 it for the first time, you are in for a real treat that will make you say WHERE ON EARTH HAVE I 
 BEEN.
  
  DMC has always been one of the most visually stunning, action pact, and challenging games ever 
 made; but now in the next gen its just that much better. I was a little disappointed at first when 
 I heard about playing the game as Nero and not Dante but now that I have seen where they have taken 
 the story with these two characters, I am blown away. This series has always had some great characters 
 and Nero is an excellent addition.
  
  For those of you who have never played a DMC game you should definitely check out 1 and 3 to better 
 understand the series. ( DMC 2 was too easy and too cheesy, but still fun) 
  
  The game has everything you would expect from DMC. Serious action that really puts your skills 
 to the test, not only to get through the game but to do it in style. As you may know the game is 
 constantly grading you while in battle starting of at a D when you get going and working you way 
 into the S ranking and now capitalizing on that the the SS and SSS rankings to really make you 
 step your combo game up! It also has some puzzle solving, secrets, fantastic upgrades, and some 
 epic boss battles. Fighting Dante at the midpoint of the game overwhelmed me so much at first that 
 I almost thought it would be impossible until I gathered myself and treated it like any other boss 
 battle. The visuals, the movement, and sounds are fantastic as always. The controls are better 
 than ever, especially with Dante being able to change his styles up so easily. Those of us who 
 played DMC 3 know that before you had to go into the menu to change styles and weapons so to be 
 able to do it without slowing down a battle is enough to put an evil grin on your face.
  
  The thing that impresses me the most is that the developers added new features to the game without 
 over doing it. The secret missions are more challenging and vary in task so that they are always 
 interesting. They are also rewarding because what they give aids you in the regular game. They 
 have also added an online feature that allows you to keep up with where your friends are in the 
 game and how well they do on each mission which makes for competition while really just playing 
 the game.
  The biggest addition is Nero himself. In other installments of the game it was Dante and only Dante 
 to play through until you have completed the game at least once which usually resulted in unlocking 
 a character. The great thing about Nero is that although he has some similarities to Dante he also 
 has some distinctions that really let you know that there us a huge difference between the two 
 and it incorporates his character into the series very well. His slightly different sword style 
 and the ever so powerful demon arm will stand him out in comparison.
  
  The few flaws to this game hardly take away from its value. There has not been a DMC yet where 
 some boss battles are not repeated. If you think about it they are really sub bosses so just like 
 the other demons that respawn they will too. There are plenty of other boss battles to cherish 
 any way so enjoy. You also revisit a lot of the scenery in the game but because of how the story 
 unfolds it actually makes perfect sense so it bothers me none. The only thing that I really wished 
 they had changed is some of the music. At least it only occurs when the action starts so who really 
 has time to listen to it, right.
  
  DMC is definitely getting back to its roots with the fourth installment. There will be many action 
 games that follow this year and the next, but none will have such a well rounded formula as DMC 
 4. I'm just glad they released it for the 360 because it would have been the only reason for me 
 to buy a PS3.

Review:  It took me 10:03 to beat Devil May Cry 4 on Human. Now this review will be covering its pluses 
 and some not so bad negatives. I immediately loved this game and its beauty. Some of the best graphics 
 and game-play I've seen. One bad thing is when I was watching the very first cut scene my audio 
 went out and it went out again but not till the very end of the game did I have another audio problem. 
 I enjoyed the Boss Battles except for Sanctus he's a pain the ass on Harder Modes. I recommend 
 a Walk-through to help with beating stuff to get more bonuses on rewards. I think the new character 
 is way better then Dante sorry to say it Dante but Nero kicks ass. Hand's done the story is really 
 good and you get to play as Dante and get some badass power-ups like Pandora. Over all I rate this 
 game an 9.7 I hope everyone enjoys the review and game.

Review:  Having never played a DMC game prior to this, the fourth installment, I was skeptical about what 
 all the hubbub was. On the surface, the game's a straightforward hack and slasher with some fancy 
 moves, but digging below that, you'll find a game with an intricate fight system, well produced 
 cutscenes, and undeniable charm.
  
  You don't have to have played and of the previous Devil May Cry titles to be able to enjoy this 
 game, but it certainly is advantageous to be familiar with the characters and concept. In this 
 game, infamous demon hunter Dante kills the leader of a religious sect that worships the demon 
 Sparda as their God and has recently been up to nefarious no-gooderies such as capturing and experimenting 
 on various dangerous demons. You'll start playing the game as Nero, one of the knights of the Order 
 of the Sword charged with hunting down Dante, but as the plot thickens and gets more complicated, 
 you'll be playing as Dante again until picking up as Nero again for the game's conclusion. Overall, 
 the plot can get convoluted and it's kinda hard to tell what the hell is actually going on in some 
 moments, but it's overall decently written stuff and charming characters such as the sarcastic 
 tough guy Nero, or the hilariously over the top antics of Dante taking front and center in some 
 of the best choreographed and produced cutscenes that manage to hold your attention throughout 
 the game's lengthy campaign.
  
  And the campaign best be lengthy, because there isn't anything else to do in Devil May Cry 4. You 
 can replay sections of the campaign on higher difficulties and attempt to get higher scores as 
 well as executing the various bonus missions around the levels, but there's little in the way of 
 replay value.
  
  So, it's good that the gameplay you do take part in is rather good. The game's all about chaining 
 sword combos together to pulverize the various demon baddies you take on, coupled with some gun 
 blasting and other abilities. You'll start out playing as Nero who is a very no-frills fighter 
 and has some pretty basic attacks, but his real draw is his possessed right arm known as the Devil 
 Bringer that can grab and slam enemies from long range, and whose skills play in particularly awesomely 
 during boss fights, which overall, makes Nero a very deliberate, yet exciting character to play 
 as.
  
  Once control shifts over to Dante, things get complicated, as the demon hunter has a slew of weapons 
 and fighting styles to choose from. You'll also be missing the Devil Bringer at this point, so 
 Dante might seem like a step down at first. However, once you start goofing around with Dante's 
 various fighting styles (such as Swordmaster and Gunslinger) you'll find he's an absolute dynamo 
 with some lightening fast combos and skills to play around with. It's a nice contrast to have, 
 and both characters are a joy to play as, as their personalities are both likeable and skills both 
 apt. It's hard to choose whether it's funner to use the powerhouse Nero, swatting enemies away 
 only to pull them back in and slam them, or the swift Dante, dancing around enemies as he cuts 
 them to ribbons and fills them full of holes.
  
  On the presentation front, Devil May Cry is stellar. The cutscenes are easily some of the best 
 looking of this generation, and although the action never gets that hot during actual gameplay, 
 and the visuals will look slightly stunted in game, there is still plenty of slick animations and 
 awesome scenery to feast your eyes on in this game. In the sound department, sound effects of guns 
 blazing, swords clashing, and baddies roaring all sound appropriately over the top, as do the voice 
 actors. Some might accuse the actors of being too cheesy in their delivery, but considering the 
 seriousness that some of these topics could have inherited, such as the occult and hyper violence, 
 it's good to see the game has an excellent sense of humor. It's just something you either get or 
 you don't, and I got it.
  
  One thing I COULDN'T get, was that horrible... industrial suckfest music that always plays when 
 you enter combat. Honestly, it's quite grating, and considering the rest of the music is only atmospheric, 
 the sound track takes a considerable hit when this diddy starts playing. Aside from Kyrie's song 
 she sings in the beginning, the rest of the music is forgettable.
  
  Overall, DMC 4 is a great hack and slash game with a surprisingly deep fighting system, and some 
 diversity that other games in the genre just don't have. Coupled with a great presentation, and 
 a cheesy, but well delivered story line, you get a solid action title that is easy to recommend 
 to anyone. Just don't ask me to listen to that combat song anymore.

Review:  The second sequel (DMC: 3 being a prequel) in an ongoing story of demons and humans, Devil May 
 Cry 4 is the first game in the series to make the leap to next gen. Appearing on both The Xbox 
 360 and PS3, Devil May Cry 4 takes everything DMC 3 did for the series and expands upon it, utilizing 
 next gen technology to make it what may be the best game in the series to date. 
  
  STORY
  A rather surprising move by Capcom is not only the introduction of a new playable character, 
 but a move to make said character the game's leading protagonist, placing Dante, the half-human 
 half-demon hero of the series, in a supporting role. 
  Just as DMC 3 was helping Dante get back on his feet after a dismal performance in DMC2, we are 
 introduced to Nero. Nero lives in the city of Fortuna, a place full of acolyte residents who pay 
 tribute to Sparda and worship him as a God. Among those directly involved in this are the members 
 of the Order of the Sword, of which Nero belongs. The order consists of humans who believe themselves 
 to be demon hunters, continuing the work of the great Sparda. Nero doesn't seem as interested in 
 the goings on of the order, mainly recieving their dirty work here and there. One scene has him 
 listening to headphones while a minister recites a prayer. Nice! One could argue that Nero posesses 
 the same laid back attitude Dante had in DMC 3. 
  Suddenly during the prayer, Dante crashes through the glass dome overhead and assassinates the 
 head of the order. Here we see Nero's strongest personality trait; Love. We clearly see that he 
 cares deeply about his friend, Kyrie and has her brother usher her to safety while he faces Dante. 
 This segment of the game serves as a tutorial, teaching you the basics as you fight Dante. He escapes, 
 and Nero is tasked with tracking him down. From there the story unfolds as Nero slowly discovers 
 that not all is as it seems and perhaps the Order has a few skeletons in the closet, or Demons. 
 lol
  
  PRESENTATION
  DMC4 is pure eye candy. It is by far the most beautiful looking of the series, wasting no effort 
 in utilizing next gen potential. The character models are flawless. Rich in detail and bright in 
 color, Dante never looked better. While the character models are amazing, it's the environments 
 that'll take you for a spin. The opening places you in the city of Fortuna, which has a sort of 
 Elizabethan feel in it's building's archetecture and cobblestone streets. The area outside the 
 domed Chapel is particularly breathtaking. Too bad it's destroyed by game's end. 
  Eventually, you find yourself in a huge jungle, lush with plantlife (some of which may try to eat 
 your face) . This is by far one of the most beautiful levels in the game. However, the shadowing 
 of the trees could use a little work. They seem a little twitchy. lol. 
  
  The in-game cinemas are equally impressive. The opening fight sequence between Dante and Nero is 
 just a pleasure to watch. Die-hard Dante fans, get ready to cry when you see your man get a perfect 
 drop kick in the face.
  
  The musical score is a little under-achieved. Nero and Dante have their own seperate theme when 
 battling scores of enemies, however this theme plays each and every time, only changing during 
 a boss fight. This may get irritating. I at one point turned down the music, and played some of 
 my own on my 360's harddrive. The final boss music deserves mention however, as it appeared to 
 be the only track in the game that consisted of an orchestra. 
  The voicework in the game is spot on. Reuben Langdon reprises his role from DMC 3 as Dante, and 
 Johnny Yong Bosch voices Nero. You may know Johnny from his voice work as Vash the Stampede in 
 Trigun and Ichigo Kurosaki in Bleach, as well as other numerous anime. I personally was thrilled 
 by this, mainly because I'm an avid watcher of anime and particularly like his voicwork. He was 
 also the black ranger in the original power rangers tv show. Thought you'd like to know. lol
  
  GAMEPLAY
  DMC 4 returns with virtually the same gameplay as it's predecessor, with a few 
 tweaks. 
  Nero comes packed with some nice accessories. Members of his order are each given a ceremonial 
 sword with which to slay demons. Nero, of course, has to be different and has modified his, the 
 Red Queen. What really sets his blade apart from the others is his tweaking of the hilt. You can 
 essentially rev it up much like a motorcycle. With elongated clicks of the corresponding button, 
 Nero willl rev up his blade up to a maximum of three times, greatly increasing the sword's power 
 and giving it a nice big red glow. 
  Nero also possesses an under and over double barrel revolver called the Blue Rose. Obviously, it 
 shoots two bullets at a time. It essentially works the same as Dante's Ebony and Ivory handguns. 
 
  New to the series is Nero's Devil Arm, his right hand possessing the likeness of a Devil. During 
 combat, the arm serves as more of a way to set up combos that as an offensive asset. After locking 
 onto a target, Nero can extend his harm to grab hold of enemies and bring them directly to him. 
 Once the enemy is close enough, the arm can then be used to perform a "throw" technique, resulting 
 in a different wild animation depending upon the enemy. This snatch and throw techinique can also 
 be done in the air. Bosses can also be thrown about once they're left open to such an attack, which 
 will most likely be the greatest damage dealers during such encounters. 
  The Devil Trigger also makes a return, as well as it should. About a quarter into the game, Nero 
 gains such an ability. While he himself does not physically transform into a demon, his attacks 
 are performed with much more ferocity and his speed increases. A blue "spirit" of a demon does 
 appear behind him, mimicking his every action however.

Review:  Devil may cry 4 is a fantastic action game. It has taken a major step up from the last devil may 
 cry. Devil may cry 4 introduces a new hero named Nero with a cool new ability his powerful "Devil 
 Bringer" arm. This ability helps put together some sweet combos. Of course the infamous Dante makes 
 a few appearances. Devil may cry 4 runs very smooth and the combos are easy to put together. There 
 are also numerous puzzles to be figured out which gives the game more depth. The Boss fights in 
 this game are extremely fun and each boss has its own distinct feel during the fights. There are 
 many different enemies that vary in difficulty. The visuals for this game are just insane. The 
 compelling story is really intense at times and it keeps you wanting more. The game is quite lengthy 
 with two different mode types. Devil may cry 4 runs very smooth and the combos I recommend this 
 game to all.

Review:  when Nero was first introduced as a playable character, i wasn't sure this would be as good as 
 1 or 3 but it has proved me wrong. though not as chalanging as the series' first the game still 
 gives a fairly difficult trip through the castle town fortuna as yet again all hell breaks loose 
 when a red-coat assassin kills the head of a secred order dedicated to the eradication of demons 
 in the name of their devil-god Sparda.
  
  Graphics - the game looks simply stunning, its breath taking visuals is defines what devil may 
 cry is even more with its gothic castle setting.
  
  Sound - though i prefer the music of the first as it was different from any games produced back 
 then, it had it own sort of original music track instead of 4's "generic in your face" music which 
 most action games have now. though it still has a good beat to it.
  
  Gameplay - This is brillient as both characters are pretty unique with dante's multiple styles 
 from DMC3 and nero's Devil bringer ability both give a pretty good experience. the only problem 
 is when i first switched to dante the helmbreaker move was not on the same button config as nero's 
 similar move so it got abit annoying until i got a hang of it.
  
  Story - still a good and interesting story, some plot developments were pretty obvious, but it 
 didn't completly spoil the plot. also the humour that was in DMC3 is still around.
  
  overall i am happy to say that they didn't change the formula again and that this was definetly 
 worth buying a 360 for.

Review:  What can I say about Devil May Cry 4 besides the word "Awesome". After spending many hours and finally 
 completing the game it is definetly the best in the series and a great action game to boot.
  
  Story: The story is one of the best for a video game I have ever played. And I've played Mass 
 Effect. The story starts as character Nero witnesses the leader of his organization get shot in 
 the face by a mysterious assassin in red who fans of the series will definetly recognize.
  
  Gameplay: Gameplay is DMC4's strong point. Whether you are using Nero and his demonic arm or 
 Dante and his multiple styles you will always be having a great time. Boss Battles also allow the 
 use of Nero's demonic right arm for some devastating combos.
  
  Characters: The characters in DMC4 look great. For those new to the series the new main character 
 Nero brings some new and exciting gameplay. For the vets the series lead Dante is also present 
 and playable offering some comic relief in cutscenes.
  
  The Bad: The only bad part is that every place that you went about half way through the game you 
 have to backtrack even fighting the bosses again but as a different character.
  
  Bottom-line: Rather new to the series, or a die hard fan Devil May Cry 4 is one that you can't miss.

Review:  Back in 2001 Devil May Cry redefined hack-n-slash games as Devil May Cry 2 was one of the most 
 disappointing sequels ever made, but Capcom went back to it's roots with Devil May Cry 3 to make 
 it the best in the series. Now Devil May Cry has made it's next-gen debut, but was Devil May Cry 
 4 worth the wait of almost three years? Well yes it was. To me Devil May Cry 4 feels like the true 
 sequel to the original. It has all the kick ass, fast -paced action of the last game. For people 
 who don't know, DMC4 takes place after the first game but before the second one in a city called 
 Fortuna. In DMC4 you play as Nero a member of the Order of the Sword. His right arm is possessed 
 by some demonic power. The Order of the Sword are some sort of cult that worship Sparda as their 
 god. All of a sudden, Dante crashes through a window and kills the holiness. Then the people of 
 Fortuna freak out and the Order try to take down Dante, but fail. So then Nero kicks Dante in the 
 face and that's when the fight between Dante and Nero begins. The story in DMC4 is a little similar 
 to the previous games, but with plenty of plot twists, emotional scenes, and some cool new characters 
 the story will keep you interested from beginning to end. DMC4 is also a sweet looking game with 
 some of the best graphics so far this year. The cut scenes look so realistic and detailed that 
 it your are watching a movie, but the problem is that there is way too many of the them which slows 
 down the game. DMC4 also has some of the best voice acting of the series, but sometimes the dialogue 
 is kind of lame. The music is also another fantastic aspect of the game as it's simply amazing. 
 In DMC4 you play as both Nero and Dante. Nero is both an excellent new character and fun to play. 
 What make Nero so cool is the devil bringer which is a ton of fun to use. With it you can grab 
 demons from a distance and slam them to the ground, punch them real fast, rip them apart, or just 
 throw them around which adds an interesting way of pulling off combos. The only thing I was hoping 
 is that Nero would get some new swords and guns during the game, but instead you get nothing except 
 you can buy new combos and moves for your weapons. Dante is basically has the same fighting moves 
 from DMC3 except now you can change styles during gameplay which adds a variety of new combos. 
 The problem with Dante is that your going trough the same areas an bosses that Nero has already 
 been trough which gets repetitive and boring quick. Dante gats a few new weapons in the game. There 
 pretty strong, but not as fun to use like the weapons in DMC3. The camera is going to be your worst 
 enemy as it jerks around in places you really need it which can be rally frustrating and some of 
 the puzzles in the game are just lame and not fun. After playing this game, you will have a hate 
 for games with dice. There are six difficultly levels and a lot of content to unlock including 
 art galleries, the bloody palace, and a brief history of DMC for people that never played the first 
 three games. Devil May Cry 4 offers a real good story, the fast paced action that we've come to 
 know and love, and a few new gameplay mechanics. At the same time it still offers the same problems 
 from previous games and it starting to get a little stale. For DMC fans, you should add this game 
 to your collection and for people who never experienced DMC, you should check this game out. Overall 
 Devil May Cry 4 is a solid game.

Review:  The Good: Visually Stunning, great cinematic cut scenes, a great new chracter, simple and smooth 
 controls.
  
  The Bad: repetative gameplay (fight sections, boss fights and enviroments) , the platforming and 
 puzzles feel last-gen and bring the game down.
  
  
  This was my first time playing a DMC game and I wasn't partucularly impressed, while visually stunning 
 the game has repetative gameplay that detracts from the overall greatness of the game. While the 
 cutscenes and camera angles can seem cool it can sometimes feel cheesey.
  
  The gameplay can become very repetative. You run for a bit, jump around then you fight some demons 
 then rinse and repeat and then theres the odd boss thrown in. Enviroments look the same and seem 
 lifeless. Combat can be fun combing melee, gunplay and a demonic arm but essentially it is just 
 button mashing which should have stayed last-gen.
  
  Regardless of what platform you play this on the game is a looker. But also on any platform the 
 game is equally repetative. This game is a love or hate affair of which I am the latter so not 
 everyone will agree with this review.

Review:  For those of you that have been playing Capcom's stylish action series since the release of the 
 first Devil May Cry got to know the sheer pleasure of hack'n'slashing through hordes of enemy t'ill 
 they explode, solving sometimes not-so-easy puzzle and , most of all, simply enjoying the intense 
 atmosphere of the title. 
  
  Then there was Devil May Cry 3 (Yeah you heard me ! I hope there is a very special place in hell 
 for whoever put the approval stamp on that abomination that is the second game, and for everyone 
 mentioning it even exist in the timeline.) It had a better combat system ,and (Holy sh...) challenging 
 gameplay. It lacked a few good elements from the first one though, but hey it was still quite entertaining 
 (if you could beat Cerberus that is..) .
  
  And Finally comes Devil May Cry 4, finding a just balance between the two titles. But the question 
 is : Is it good ? The answer...
  
  Visuals:
  
  Whoever put their eyes on a small gameplay session (especially on HDTV) is bound to be impressed. 
 The graphics are gorgeous, literally, and the fixed camera takes advantage of this (we'll get to 
 that one later) . The heroes and enemies in this game are designed in great details and you can 
 spend minutes only looking at the wonders the city of Fortuna has to offer. The action is smooth, 
 with very few FPS drop (if NONE) even when fighting a flaming boss 10 times bigger than you throwing 
 scorching beams at you all the while destroying the surrounding cabins. Sorry El Gigante, Berial 
 just kicked your ass.
  
  But here comes the let down. I can still imagine myself, 7 years back with a Ps2 controller in 
 my hand, pissed off at the game since it wouldn't want to let me see where the hell my enemies 
 are. And now, in 2008, you could see the exact same scenario in my living room. The camera.... 
 is mutilated. Sure, you often get the possibility to control it via your right analog stick, but 
 most of the time, you can't control it passed a certain angle. That would be okay if it wasn't 
 for the fact that you will have platforming and puzzle solving elements to accomplish in this... 
 restrained view. Nothing equals the sheer frustration of pulling out a SSS combo, then receiving 
 a random ice shard behind the head from a monster that you just can't see.
  
  Gameplay:
  
  That's where the game really got something to show off to the gamer. The combat system is stylish, 
 fast paced hack'n'slash awesomeness. The procedures are quite simple really: You get a cutscene, 
 you kick hundreds of demons continuously with sharp objects (while solving puzzle and occasional 
 platforming) , you fight a boss, and on to the next mission. Simple, Old-School. Perfect. By using 
 different types of combo and grabs and (doing your best) not getting hit, your stylish meter goes 
 up from D to SSS. By being more stylish, you get more orbs to buy yourself new items. DMC4 also 
 introduces a new character, Nero and his Devil Bringer (think of it as a hookshot) adding new platforming 
 elements and brand new, shiny, grab attacks which, trust me, will leave puddle of drool on your 
 floor.
  
  At the end of each stage, you will get a rank depending on how well you performed. Then depending 
 on the rank, you will gain Proud Souls which are in turn used to gain new abilities. I have personally 
 never been a fan of games that slap a rank on your performance, as I see them as a nice way of 
 saying "You suck" when you screwed up. Plus the rank's criteria are paradoxal, especially the "Stage 
 clear time" and the "Collected Orbs", since if you hurry through the stage, your clearly not breaking 
 every crates you see for orbs, and vice versa. So you usually get something like "Stage clear time: 
 S, Stylish action: S, collected orbs C. Over all rank: A" 
  
  Storyline:
  
  DMC4's story picks up after the very first title. The game focus around the new protagonist, Nero, 
 that takes on the old protagonist, Dante, in an explosive (literally) showdown after the later 
 one "head shoted" the leader of Nero's order. The storyline follow the young man as he push back 
 a mysterious demon invasion on the (also mysterious) city of Fortuna at the same time as he chases 
 after Dante seeking (gasp!) revenge. Of course the scenario has all sort of predictable plot twist 
 and nothing you have never heard of. But then again, the storyline is secondary to the gameplay, 
 and the fact that its a bit lacky is completely ignored most of the time.
  
  Only thing that tickles me here is that they played the "Kojima" card as in "Let's leave gaps big 
 like LAIR's failure in the storyline" which leaves all sort of out-of-this-world speculations on 
 who the F is Nero. Guess that'll wait until DMC 5...
  
  Music/Sound:
  
  Well there isn't much to say here. The music is average to be polite (if only the same Techno/metal 
 track wasn't playing constantly "na na na na na na and the Devil Cry!") . The sound effect are good, 
 and so is the voice acting although the script is incredibly cheesy, which is a staple of the DMC 
 series... But who cares ? Keep slashing those demons already!
  
  All in all, Devil May Cry 4 is all you could expect from a sequel of the first title. It has the 
 intense stylish gameplay, the great design values and the outstanding graphics. The camera and 
 dialogues are still a bit lacky, as always, but they are not meant to be in the spotlight. Just 
 enjoy !

Review:  The First Twenty Minutes of the game may be a cut scene... but trust whats after is Very Enjoyable!
 
  The game controls are very solid... i like the feel... but be aware this IS A BUTTON MASHER...3 
 Hours of play might break your hands!!! 
  Combo and upgrade system is fairly easy. Moves are purchasable buy collecting orbs or souls buy 
 completing missions or finding them. Music fits the classic DMC standards... i like it personally... but 
 you can always have custom music. The Boss Battles are INTENSE! But on the Highest difficultly 
 level its not really that hard. 
  The Storyline is not tooo Shabby... its ok wont win a Academy Award.... The Game is VERY FUN! you 
 get a nice game for the 60 dollar price tag. O and the option to play as Nero or Dante makes the 
 game very interesting... the characters are very different so it does not feel like the same thing 
 twice... the Graphics are something to enjoy.... the game is simply BEAUTIFUL... the camera can be 
 annoying sometime... but it makes up for the game-play... puzzles are fairly simple, reminds me of 
 resident evil with swords and scarecrows. Great Game AND A MUST OWN!!

Review:  I thought it would have been kind of lame that you don't get to play primarily as Dante for this 
 installment, but Nero, the replacement character, is really fantastic. He's great as an overall 
 character, but he's also a good compliment to the "young kid/old guy" dynamic between he and Dante. 
 I'm whoring it out to everyone. You need to play this game. It is somewhat of a button masher, 
 I must admit, and the initial couple levels are a bit shaky if you're not familiar with the game 
 play or controls. I was a bit retarded for the first 5 or so levels. But once you work out all 
 the kinks, it's a really beautiful experience of a game.
  
  Unfortunately, once you start to play as Dante, the learning curve practically goes back to zero. 
 And there are several moments where the inability to perform a certain task without 4 or 5 tries 
 becomes extremely frustrating. However, the positives definitely outnumber the negatives. This 
 is the video game for those who fell in love with video games in the first place.

Review:  I bought the game and now regret it, don't get me wrong the game looks great, and is fun to play, 
 for the first few hours anyway, then it gets very repetitive very fast, there should have been 
 a lot more combos and spacial moves in the game.
  But still the biggest gripe I have with the game I guess is the limited camera control which is 
 dumb, to make a game this beautiful and not give the player the ability to have freedom to look 
 where they won't from any angle, was stupid. instead you get what angle they give you and sometime 
 it gets in the way and is very annoying.
  Then you have to ask why no online play or coop? this game seems perfect for a coop story mode, 
 but Capcom left the online option out completely .
  I also feel ripped off that half the game is playing backwards through the levels I just finished, with 
 recycled bosses.
  Maybe next time Capcom will work harder on making a complete next gen experience instead of just 
 giving us next gen graphics to look at.

Review:  A game purely for its action and its cool characters.
  
  Arguable a little cheesy in areas and some personalities flaws with Dante being overly cool and 
 calm about fighting nearly everything brings into question whats the point in fighting without 
 a struggle.
  
  The gameplay itself follows the DMC tradition of amazingly awe inspired Combos and demonic moves 
 that will leave you feeling somewhat pleased to slam an enemies face 6ft into the dirt. The controls 
 are fairly easy to pick up and everything feels right where it should be.
  
  Will take you very little time to beat on Human Mode and when you control Dante it can feel a little 
 repetitve over Nero's storyline. Good for a few playthroughs on harder difficulties though if you 
 want to get those prestigious achievments.
  
  Worth buying. (Y)

Review:  Let me preface this review by stating there are **SPOILERS**, just a caution if you haven't had 
 a chance to play the game yet. 
  
  If you have played the Devil May Cry series, then you know what to expect. A lot of action, massive 
 combos, with some minor puzzles solving in between. The story revolves around a new hero/anti-hero 
 this time around named Nero. Oddly enough, he strikes an odd resemblance to Dante, the anti-hero 
 of previous installments of DMC. The major difference is that he is sporting a rather pimp looking 
 demon arm. The arm isn't just for looks as it is used for attacks, setting up combos, and powers 
 that can be upgraded through out the game. Besides the demon arm, Nero sports his own sword and 
 gun. While the gun is useful to get a few pot shots in or slowing an enemy down, the sword and 
 demon arm will be your main weapons of choice.
  
  The story to the game isn't exactly award winning and while the cut scenes will keep you hooked 
 into the game; you won't be remembering it for years to come. It's your typical action themebad 
 guy kidnaps hero's love interest, good guy goes to save love interest, all the while bad guy tries 
 to dominate the world leaving you guessed itthe good guy to stop him. Again, not exactly riveting, 
 but it gets the job done; besides, you care more about blasting the baddies then the story anyways.
 
  
  The game play is fast and furious with oodles of enemies to slobber knock. The game does a pretty 
 good job of helping out the newbie get adjusted to the game, by giving the option to allow the 
 player to perform their own moves through a series of combos, or selecting "automatic", which pretty 
 much means mashing a button and the combos are automatically performed for you. Throughout the 
 game, you'll collect blood orbs of various colors, which may then be spent to purchase certain 
 upgrades for health and magic. You'll also collect souls through various means; i. e. style points, 
 the time you finish the level in, etc. These can be spent to purchase different combos for your 
 weapons. Again, newbies are given the option to have the game auto select their powers, or they 
 can select them individually themselves. The combos that can be pulled off are nothing short of 
 eye candy and will have you salivating for more and within the first few levels I wanted to give 
 this game a rocking score, but as I played through, my euphoria was snuffed out like someone farting 
 into the wind.
  
  The first half of the game plays out rather well, giving that classics Devil May Cry feel, although 
 some of the level designs I wasn't crazy about and the puzzles were more obnoxious and tedious 
 then they were an asset to the game. My biggest gripe has to be with the second half of the game. 
 The first ten levels you battle your way through various levels, dueling it out in massive boss 
 fights. The last ten levelsyou battle your way through the same various levels, dueling it out 
 in massive boss fights against the same bosses you previously fought. No offense CAPCOM, but one 
 word can only evoke the feelings that I and many others posses at this junctureLAME! My final 
 gripe with the game is the last level. In my search of the English vocabulary, unimaginative would 
 best describe the debacle that they put you through. You have already been through the boss fights 
 twice, so if you didn't get enough of it then you're in luck, because you get to fight all the 
 bosses a third time. It's as if they took the most obnoxious aspects from previous platform/action 
 games and crammed them into one thinking this would be a good idea. Whomever idea it was to do 
 that should be fired with great prejudice.
  
  The graphics of the game are great; while they won't blow your skirt up; they are effective and 
 get the job done. The sound is also very well done. My only gripe would be with the cut scenes 
 in that the voice actors are almost inaudible unless the volume is cranked up, at which point, 
 you have to turn the volume back down as not to blow yourself out the room when the action gets 
 cranked back up.
  
  Overall, the game does what it set out to do. It's fast paced, lost of action, big bosses, and 
 gives you plenty of achievements and goals to accomplish. If you're a fan of the series, have never 
 played, or just need something that you can pick up, knock some heads around, and come back to 
 later, then I would definitely recommend picking this up. With that said, the few gripes I have, 
 set the game back a bit as it really shows almost a lack of effort, originality, and becomes more 
 tedium then enjoyment in some parts of the game.

Review:  I really enjoyed this game. The graphics are def. nice, and the action is fun. Main downfall is 
 it still does the camera angles at times. It's not as bad as others, but it just tend to get on 
 my nerves at times. But i'm sure everyone will easily deal with it. Some of the boss can be a little 
 on the easy side, but some boss will have you stressed and ready to just quit. And I haven't watched 
 much anime in my past, but I have to say the cut scenes are pretty amazing, especially the first 
 cut scene. It had me hooked. The whole game is packed with cut scenes that was well put together. 
 I have not fully beaten the game yet, but after owning it for only a short time so far, I've been 
 playing it a lot. Overall its a great game, and I recommand this game to anyone who is into action 
 video games, or just likes button mashing and anime.

Review:  I really enjoyed playing this game in every way. I feel like it's been a while since I've been 
 able to say that. The last few games I've gotten into had some major draw backs or laugh out loud 
 problems such as AC, ME, COD4. Not this game (which I didn't expect) . I bought it kind of on a 
 whim thinking it would be a filler game until another came along I really wanted to play. I wasn't 
 a huge fan of earlier DMC stuff (didn't hate it either) .
  
  Honestly, this game is really solid. It reminds me of Ninja Gaiden in a lot of ways. It's definately 
 a different game in terms of weapons and story but trust me, it will remind you og NG. I mean that 
 in a good way. Although somewhat repeative (which Gamespot beat to death) , I didn't mind it. There 
 is so much action and different weapons/combos, I overlooked the repeativeness. It's not like a 
 hack and slash where you use the same two moves over and over again. You can alternate between 
 guns (multiple types as you play through) , swords, and grabs. Killing enemies is definately satisfying. 
 
  
  The story is totally lame... but in a fun sort of way. It's hammy but I kind of enjoyed it as it 
 unfolded. The music and voice acting is good - it doesn't necessarily add to the experiance but 
 doesn't detract. 
  
  One major aspect that I will continue to enjoy is it's replay value. I played through on the easy 
 mode (human) in about 10 hours or so (I take my time with games) but am totally looking forward 
 to playing through it again on a harder difficulty. I imagine it will be just as fun the second 
 time (but probably quicker as most of the puzzles are easy to remember) .
  
  This was a total blind sided suprise. It might have been hyped pre-launch but I didn't notice. 
 I had zero expectations going in and it far, far, far exceed those expectations. In hind-sight, 
 I waited a long time for HALO 3, AC, ME, COD4 and other games within the last year and was somewhat 
 disappointed. DMC4 came from nowhere from my perspective and I have been really impressed.
  
  I highly recommend this if you're into games like Ninja Gaiden (even games like Jade Empire 
 although this has less of an RPG feel) . It's a lot of fun and extremely stylish. Enjoy,

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is probably my favorite game on the 360 so far. The plot this time doesn't follow 
 Dante (though you do get to play as him a few times) it follows a new character named Nero. I really 
 enjoyed getting to play as Nero with his Devil Arm, you get to play as Dante too which is cool. 
 The weapons Dante get are pretty awesome also, I really enjoyed Pandora's Box. Great Cut scenes 
 and Boss Battles. All in all the game is awesome for any person who likes action games. Graphics: 
 9.5
  Very nice looking graphics, though I cant call them perfect.
  
  Playability: 9
  The controls work pretty well, though switching back and forth between Dante's styles screw you 
 up a little.
  
  Sound: 8
  love the taunts and music
  
  Re-play Value: 9
  You are probably going to end up playing this game a second time, because of the bonus content 
 and the higher difficulties.

Review:  are so beautiful and colorful that sometimes I wouldn`t even leave certain areas because of how 
 beautiful everything looks! Even the enemies are amazing! Now about the game, you play as Nero, 
 a member of the Holy Knights who watched his leader get slain by the one only Dante (who is my 
 boy by the way) . So you end up huntin Dante and in the process run up against some very intersting 
 demons! I mean from the lesser ones` to the bosses, Capcom truly put some serious detail in this 
 game! I don`t really have much to say because I`m excited! Half way through the game you play as 
 Dante and have to back track a little bit which is fine with me. The fighting mechanics is true 
 to the first DMC sayin that old sayinif it aint broke, don`t fix it!
  
  If you`ve played the other DMCs` you`ll feel right at home here, Capcom did a very nice job on 
 the story, character design, action, and environment detail that truly make this game worth checkin 
 out! The bosses are truly HUGE and are some what of an eye candy! Bottom line If your a fan of 
 the DMC series like I`am, DMC4 won`t let you down!

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is probably my favorite game on the 360 so far. The plot this time doesn't follow 
 Dante (though you do get to play as him a few times) it follows a new character named Nero. He 
 goes to a church after tearing demons apart, the church gets attacked by a "mysterious assasin" 
 (you cna tell it's Dante) and you go from there. The gameplay is very fun. A jumps, B uses your 
 Demon Arm, Y uses your sword, X shoots your gun, LB uses devil trigger, RB locks on to enemies 
 (while locked on you can dodge using the joystick and the A button) . While not the next Crysis 
 in terms of graphics the game does look stunning. The sound is also really nice. While don't care 
 for the music many people will. The voice is very well done and the sound effects are all perfect. 
 You always have a harder difficulty to play through which is cool. Overall Devil May Cry 4 is a 
 fantastic action game that new comers to the series and veterens should get their hands on. While 
 not as good as Ninja Gaiden Sigma it is still the best game in the Devil May Cry franchise.

Review:  All in all DMC4 was not a bad game and if you were new to the series it would not be a bad rental, 
 but would not be worth purchasing. I would of liked to have seen some more finishing moves and 
 some different combo's possibly with God of War setting the bar high for hack and slashers it would 
 of been nice to see DMC4 take a run at it or at least try something new and it could of used a 
 little more violence I never really felt I was giving the badguys a good ol beatdown.
  
  Again I would rate the game lower then gamespots score just on the fact that you fight the same 
 bosses 3 times thats right 3 times, twice with Nero and once with Dante which i though was really 
 weak. Nero was a decent character but I would of liked to of seen more Dante
  
  Anywho to sum up my mini review, Devil May Cry 4 is a without a doubt a rental.

Review:  Coming into DMC 4 I was pretty excited for it. I'm a big fan of the DMC series, and I think DMC 
 3 was probably the best game to come out on the ps2. But even with me being a fan I felt a little 
 let down by DMC. Let me explain. While its tons of fun to go around as nero or dante and killing 
 demons, you can't help but feel like you've done this before. Even though nero has the devil bringer 
 which is a blast to use, it isn't enough to really revolutionize the gameplay. In short I think 
 I just expected more from DMC since its next gen, and its a little sad that capcom didn't go above 
 and beyond to give players a true DMC nex gen experince. The last problem is that when you get 
 about half way into the game you take over as dante and have to backtrack from where you ended 
 with nero to where you started with nero. This means the same enviorments and same bosses. Its 
 just not put well into the game, and kinda makes you wonder if maybe they just got lazy with it 
 near the end. Now that that's out of the way besides it feeling a little repetitive any DMC fans 
 will fall in love with this game. It has everything a DMC fan would want from DMC, just don't go 
 in expecting it to be any different or revolutionary from past DMC games and you won't be let down. 
 Gameplay is as sharp as ever and now having the ability to change dante's styles on the fly is 
 a nice addition. The story keeps you intrested in what's going on, but you'll probably be wanting 
 more info on characters (mainly nero) and the plot. Voicework is nicly done and the music fits 
 very well into the series. Graphics for the most part are nice, but the shadowing effects just 
 look terrible. As for buying or renting unless your a big DMC fan you'll probably just wanna rent 
 this one. Its one of those games where you play the single player once or twice, and your done 
 with it. For fans of DMC you'll be satified with what your getting here, but if you havn't like 
 DMC games in the past or just not intrested in them, this won't be the game that converts you over.
 
  
  The Good
  Nero is a great new character
  Gameplay is very fun
  
  The Bad
  Nothing done thats really different from past DMC games
  The backtracking in the end of the game 
 isn't well implemented in the game

Review:  Devil may cry is one of the best games in 2008. the story is really good and interesting. The sound 
 is exxcellent, especially when u you stab a demon. The graphics are so good that you can clearly

 are also intense when dante gives nero vergil's yamato. o i forgot to mention nero has spardas

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is leaps and bounds ahead of most other games on the market today. Sure it's not 
 perfect, but I had more plain fun playing this game than any other videogame I've ever picked up. 
 Thanks to an amazing story with a cast of characters you can't help but root for all the way to 
 the end, gameplay that makes you feel like you are smiting all of Hell with each powerful drive 
 forward, cutscenes that Hollywood could take tips from, an overall presentation with stellar graphics, 
 spot on sounds for every sword clash and demonic explosion of power, and a mood fitting score to 
 accompany them, this game has everything needed for one Hell of a good time. 
  
  Devil May Cry 4's greatest strength is its frantic, constantly intense combat. Your goal is basically 
 to unleash the largest onslaught of blades, bullets, and other action packed demonic arms on any 
 poor hell-spawn foolish enough to cross your path. As you progress through the game and power up 
 Nero and Dante with various new skills, the two become juggernauts of power whose fighting combos 
 engulf the entire screen with chaos on your enemies. By the end of the game some of the moves you're 
 pulling off with your character have you jumping out of your chair in disbelief at how you just 
 pulled off an amazing takedown on even the fiercest foes in the game. No other game I've ever played 
 made me feel like such a badass. The puzzles and breaks in combat give you some room to breathe, 
 creating the perfect balance in gameplay. Unlike past titles in this series (either far too easy 
 or just plain punishing to the player) this difficulty level is perfect. By the time you've worked 
 your skills up and developed your character on Human difficulty level you are ready for Devil Hunter 
 and levels beyond. It's very accessible for any action junkie. 
  
  Perhaps even more amazing than the combat you control are the astounding feats you witness Nero 
 and Dante perform in the game's stellar cutscenes. The story in Devil May Cry 4 is the best of 
 the series because of creative use of preexisting characters and the introduction of compelling 
 new ones. The twist at the beginning with Dante playing the role of the antagonist was a great 
 way for Capcom to dust the cobwebs off on the usual story they weave around the red coated Son 
 of Sparda. Nero quickly proved to be one of the most gripping (no pun intended) characters in the 
 series. His mysterious connection to Sparda and the twins is never addressed in the game, nor is 
 how the underhanded Order of the Sword managed to get their hands on Vergil's old sword Yamoto, 
 but the narrative flows such that the player can infer for himself just what is really at work 
 beyond the immediate story of the game, which is exceptional on its own. The mystery of the Order 
 of the Sword combined with the need to help Nero recover his lost love Kyrie is one of the driving 
 factors to complete the game the first time through and seeing them finally united and together 
 by the end leaves you with the sense you accomplished something more than just finish a game. The 
 inclusion of past characters around Dante like Trish and Lady was a great call on the writers' 
 part, as they add an entirely new flavor to everyone's favorite demon hunter. Hopefully Devil May 
 Cry 5 will answer the question of Nero's origins. Is he Vergil's son as his resemblance to the 
 twins and his reaction to Vergil's sword suggests, or something else? Like this game's predecessors 
 the dialogue and action that unfolds in the cutscenes stays just on the right side of the line 
 between badass and cheesy, bolstered by exceptional voice work by the entire cast. This really 
 is just as much a movie as a game, but it's in no way a detriment to the overall experience. 
 
  
  The only fault to be found in Devil May Cry 4 are a few natural cobwebs beginning to form on the 
 series' usual mechanics and traditions that are beginning to feel a little dated. The addition 
 of the new gameplay mechanic in the Devil Bringer did much to update the old combat of Devil May 
 Cry 3 and make this game unique, but despite the awesome action the hack and slash mechanics of 
 Dante in particular begin to grow a little stale by the end of your time with him, and you'll be 
 glad to be returned to the game's central hero. The score throughout the cutscenes was perfect 
 but the main theme was a little weak this time around as well, as if a weak stripped down version 
 of the theme from Devil May Cry 3. The critics have cited problems with the camera and platforming 
 controls at times, but it was never an issue for me. The bonuses like the movie viewer and Bloody 
 Palace can provide entertainment for hours outside of the main game.
  
  Overall this is the most fun I've ever had playing a videogame and the most immersed I've ever 
 been into interactive entertainment. Between the engrossing story and amazing gameplay that transforms 
 you into a one man army stamping out the darkness of Hell from the face of the Earth, it's impossible 
 not to make a connection to Devil May Cry 4 that will last long after you beat it. I can't recommend 
 this game more to fans of the action genre and anyone else who is even curious. This is the game 
 to own on the Xbox 360 and the PS3.

Review:  Let me start of by saying that I was REALLY nervous when I bought this game. In the past I had 
 only one experience with a DMC game, can't remember if it was DMC2 or DMC3, what I do remember 
 is that I never made it past the first level/mission and I never picked it up again, now I feel 
 like I really missed out on something.
  
  As I put DMC4 in my 360, the only thought going through my mind was "man, I hope I just did not 
 waste $60 on a game I will only play for 10 minutes" wow, was I in for a shock!
  
  Within about the first 3 minutes of this game I was totally, and completely sucked into the story. 
 The use of perfectly blended cinematic cut scenes, voice acting and just overall completeness of 
 the game really makes you feel like you are involved at some deep level.
  
  Upon starting the game you will see right away the simply crystal clear graphics, and will notice 
 the smooth, yet tight controls, there is no noticeable lag between button mash and character response, 
 which is good because you will need to act fast throughout this game.
  
  The overall difficulty of this game seems just about perfect, at least to this noob. The amount 
 of enemies you encounter are not overwhelming, but seem to be just enough to challenge you most 
 of the time. And as you gain more and more experience, and unlock new moves or abilities, the battles 
 (as they should) become a little easier. Speaking of enemies, the detail on them is OUTSTANDING! 
 Just looking at them is cool, and seeing some of the other characters "second skin" is very impressive. 
 I often rate games on how many times they can make me say "THAT's F COOL", and this game has 
 made me say that A LOT!
  
  Besides a great story, great graphics and being a great hack'n slash game, this game also has some 
 fun, yet pretty easy puzzle solving to do, along with good exploration aspects. Overall it has 
 a very "finished" feel to it.
  
  But hold on, DMC4 is not without it's issues. This is probably the Ratchet & Clank gamer in me, 
 but I often wanted complete camera controls. In some parts of the game they give it to you, and 
 in others, they are just flat out missing. Also, because of the lack of camera controls there are 
 times when you can't see something that you are SUPPOSED to see, and will have to depend on pure 
 luck, or faith to find the object that you are looking for. You will understand this if you have 
 played, or will play this game.
  
  I also felt that the automatic camera angle was sometimes more of a hindrance then anything. For 
 instance, you could be running one way down a hall, or through a door when all of a sudden the 
 camera angle would change, this would often lead to a moment of confusion as to what direction 
 you were going, or wanted to be going.
  
  Now for the boss fights. WOW, just WOW, there goes that "HOLY S#! T was that F%*&! N COOL" phrase 
 again. I think I might have said 18 times during this game, once for each level :)
  
  In summary, DMC4 is 18 levels of pure sword slashing enjoyment! Pick this game up if you are a 
 fan of the series, or even if you never played one before. Or, even if you only played 10 minutes 
 of a previous DMC game, it's well worth it!

Review:  Devil May Cry 4, the 4th entry into the DMC series, but not chronologically. The series starts 
 with the third, Dante's Awakening. Standing as a prequel. With the first game following up, and 
 in between that and DMC2 is this; Devil May Cry 4.
  
  So, as the technically third game, what does DMC4 bring to the table? To be honest, it doesn't 
 change much, but this is far from a let down. For about 60% of the game, you play as a new character 
 to the DMC universe, Nero. Nero is in possession of a demon arm, which is awakened during the course 
 of the game, and can be used to grab, throw, and buster the many demons you'll encounter.
  
  Of course, what's a DMC game without our favourite protagonist? That's right, Dante returns 
 triumphantly in this game, and he's as cocky and arrogant as ever. You only play as Dante for about 
 40% of the game, but during these parts of the game, Dante shines. With all four of his main styles 
 from DMC3 returning, all mapped to the D-Pad so you can switch them on the fly, it's the most fun 
 with Dante you can have. Of course, Rebellion and Ebony & Ivory return in this game as Dante's 
 signature weapons, as well as a sawn-off shotgun: Coyote-A, and some other guns and Devil Arms 
 you'll pick up as you progress.
  
  Nero himself, uses his Devil Bringer *his arm*, The Red Queen *his sword* and The Blue Rose *a 
 double barrelled revolver* to get the job done. Aside from the Yamato *how Vergil loses this is 
 never explained*, Nero picks up no new weapons throughout the game. It focuses more on his Devil 
 Bringer expanding in power.
  
  Fortunately for the series, Nero didn't turn into a Raiden from MGS2, Nero's character is well 
 thought out, and very similar to Dante... too similar. Nero is by no means weak either, after his 
 Devil Trigger is unlocked just over a quartre of the way into the game, his power increases incredibly, 
 along with his Red Queen, which has to be used skillfully to make use of Instant Exceed.
  
  The Devil May Cry series is known for its notorious difficulty, and 4 is no exception. With six 
 difficulty settings *Human, Devil Hunter, Son of Sparda, Dante Must Die, Heaven or Hell, and Hell 
 or Hell* all with ranging difficulties, this game won't be over in a hurry. After completing any 
 one of these levels, you unlock bonus art among other things, one of these being Bloody Palace. 
 Bloody Palace is an arena where you can choose to play as either Dante or Nero, and battle it out 
 through multiple stages with increasing difficulty under a time limit. Which is a great way to 
 increase your skills, and share your score online. The combat system in this game is as stylish 
 as ever, both Nero and Dante pull off astounding combos, the whole game is flashy and looks brilliant. 
 The style meter on the side of the screen tells you how stylish you're being, awarding you ranks, 
 from D too SSS. To add even more depth to the combat system, both Nero and Dante have a range of 
 upgrades, adding new combos and other tricks to their arsenal.
  
  Of course, all of this wouldn't work without presentation, and this is another area where Devil 
 May Cry 4 doesn't fail to impress. The graphics are stunningly beautiful, and the whole game never 
 drops below 60fps *aside form cutscenes* for a second, so you see all of the action with absolutely 
 no slowdown. The story is interesting, though not the best, but the DMC games are all about gameplay, 
 and they never fail to deliver.
  
  To wrap this review up, DMC4 is fantastic addition to the series, with a beautiful and addictive 
 combat system, brilliant graphics, replay value and great voice acting, this is well worth your 
 money.

Review:  With the mix reviews that Devil May Cry 4 has received from numerous sources a lot of people are 
 unsure of whether this sequal is worthy of surpassing its predecessors. No doubt that DMC4 is much 
 similar to DMC4 but it is all for the better. Like always the controls are slick and the style 
 is smooth and the difficulty still very very difficult. Despite some repetitiveness and backtracking 
 being mention in other reviews it is still a very addictive game with plenty to go back and play 
 through. But the repetition has always been around in this series so it wouldn't be too bad for 
 past players. So if you are a true DMC fan or a gamer looking for a break on FPS give a swing at 
 DMC4, if you are looking for fast hard and stylish action and don't mind old formulas there is 
 no better way to start 2008 off with a worthy sequel.

Review:  Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad game. The oter DMC had more graphic and stylish moves then 
 DMC4. Butthis has better graphics better bosses and has a good storyline. The voice acting is good 
 and so is the gameplay. Theystill could have added more enemies and more battles but its just right. 
 The cuts scenes have the best graphics and the details on the weapons especially the gun. So far 
 I still only have my pistol but Im hoping theirs more guns in the game. The demon hand moves are 
 better then expected and they could have made the sword and the gun do more damage but overall 
 this is a good game to get and a must buy for any DMC fanatic. So buy it!!!! Ok so just buy it 
 and theirs nothing to it just buy it ok! Blah blah blah buy it buy it buy it yeah yeah yeah its 
 good now go get it!!!!

Review:  Ok, so this review is more of a complaint/review.
  
  DMC 4 is a pretty damn good game. I went into it expecting a game that was just like the rest. 
 And for the most part it is. The visuals and action are amazing. They didn't try and reinvent the 
 wheel and they didn't need to. If you like DMC than u will love this game. Its starts a little 
 slow but by the 6th mission you realize that you are thouroughly enjoying urself.
  
  The only issues with the game are as follows.
  The same rocka dn roll techno song plays everytime 
 you fight.
  The waepons/skills and RPG elements are to thin. It would be nice to upgrade more and feel like 
 you are powering up as the game proceeds.
  Finally, the standard difficulty is WAAAAYYYYY to easy. DMC is supposed to be infuriatingly hard. 
 I understand making it easier for the masses, but at least unlock the 3rd difficulty for the long 
 time fans that basically have to spend 15 hours breezing through the game just to unlock the real 
 difficluty.
  Other than that, his game is great.
  
  Now for my complaint. I saw DMC 4 got an 8.0 and i was kinda surprised, i know they didn't make 
 a new brilliant game and they stuck to an incredible formula. But an 8? Fine I'll take that, unless 
 its Warcraft or Zelda or Metroid, gamespot hates whena game s like an older version.
  But than I think back to the 9.0 they gave Assassin's Creed. A review that led to me going out 
 and buying that game. A game that I played for a few hours and has spent months on my shelf collecting 
 dust. I don't care what anyone says, that game was TERRIBLE and wasnt even a video game... it was 
 just a big world with nothing to do. I can go outside adn do nothing 115 times.... Terrible.
  Gamespot... pelase recognize that people do read your reviews and use them as an aid in buying, 
 And that even though Ubisoft prob gave u some good cash or some nice T-Shirts... they also took 
 $60 bucks from me. $60 bucks i could have thrown into a garbage or a slot machine adn got more 
 enjoyment out of.
  
  Thanks
  Jerks

Review:  I'll start by saying that you get a demonic arm. Review over. Go buy the game.
  
  No, that's not all, you get a big eff off sword. Go buy this game.
  
  Oh ho ho ho. There's 
 more. You start the game facing off against Dante in a tutorial, the usual, do this, do that, press 
 this to do this and press that to do that. After watching Dante fly through the roof, you venture 
 outside to see these clown thingys wandering around, after and action packed cutscene you get to 
 start slaying.
  
  The cutscenes are cinematic and belong in a feature length movie, they're jewels that break up 
 the slightly linear levels. 
  
  It's not an easy game, even on Human Mode (easy difficulty) you'll encounter some snags. The bosses 
 are somewhat repetitive as it's just the old 'get in close and mash on the 'Y' button'. They're 
 fun, for a time.
  
  The major issue I have with this game is that when you press X to shoot your gun, it just appears, 
 when you've stopped shooting it disapears, sorry but in my opinion in this day and age there shouldn't 
 be spontaneous weapons.
  
  Another little warning to those who didn't play Devil May Cry 1,2 and 3, you won't be able to make 
 anything out of the story, you'll enjoy it just as much as anyone else.
  
  Despite some oddities (Lesbian fairys anyone?) this game is the best beat 'em up on the 360. Bring 
 on more sequels!

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is flat out addictive game to play. The action is intense, stylish, and very fun 
 throught. And while there are some repetative and occasionally frusterating platforming, the game 
 tends to be a very fun experience. In Devil May Cry 4 you start out playing as Nero, a man with 
 a demon arm, and who looks very similar to Dante. As Nero your arm will play a big role in the 
 gameplay. While hacking and slashing demons to death in stylish combos, you can grab them right 
 back up and contiune beating them to pulp which can become extremlly enjoyable. The demon arm even 
 comes into play during some platforming sections involving you to jump and move from place to place 
 through your demon arm. Nero also has guns, but they are not nearly as effective as the sword. 
 While sometimes Devil May Cry 4 is just button mashing, against many enemies you will have to do 
 certian moves with perfect timing, and even try to latch onto the back of them with Nero's demon 
 arm. It's also important to try to find red orbs, because through them you will be able to buy 
 healing items, which are essential throughout the game to survive. You will also want to rack up 
 the style points and finish the mission as fast as possible, so you can obtain more proud souls. 
 With proud souls you can earn better combos, learn new skills, and power up different weapons. 
 It is excedingly hard to earn an S rank, as I have only S ranked 2 missions throughout the 20 different 
 missions. The mission ranlking system is really cool, because it encourages replayability throughout 
 all the missions. By about mission 11 you will start controlling Dante and the fighting will change 
 quite a bit. As Dante you have about four different styles of fighting such as sword master, and 
 gunslinger. It is fun to switch between the styles to fit the type of fight that you are in. As 
 Dante you have a whole lot more skill with the sword, and it is much easier to completly annilate 
 enemies when you get a good combo going or when you pefrom a special move. It's cool how Nero as 
 the arm, which makes him have certian cool abilites, and how Dante has a lot of different styles 
 to fool around with, and how awesome it is to perfrom combos with Dante perfectly, then watching 
 enemies nearby getting completly annialated. The game also has a lot of amazing bosses that are 
 addictive and still have you being strategic to kill them. The game also has fantastic graphic, 
 exellent voice acting, and really memorable characters. Unfortunaetly there are some minor issues 
 with the game. The game's bosses are repeated three times, and while they are still fun, it gets 
 pretty annoying by the time you fight them three times. The game's enemies are repeated throughout 
 and most of the enemies you fight within the first few levels represent the kind of enemies that 
 you will fight throughout the whole game. It's also unfortunate that you see the same enviornments 
 so much throughout the game. Basically once you finish the first 11 missions as Nero, you go back 
 to those same places as Dante. I also find it cheap that you can heal while the game is paused, 
 and when you have plenty of healing items, it makes some places overly easy. Overall 9/10 Despite 
 the repeated enemies and enviornemnts, Devil May Cry 4 is an addictive, stylish, and exciting game. 
 If you like action, Devil May Cry, or just own a 360 this is a game you should check out.

Review:  Devil May Cry 3, was a game that was so frustrating that you couldn't get through the game, without 
 throwing the controller into the wall. But with Devil May Cry 4, all that has changed. I mean yeah, 
 it still has a little bit of difficult parts in it, but nothing that extreme. Devil May Cry 4 is 
 a pretty long game, full of action, new weapons, new characters, and new twists. Before you choose 
 to play, you can choose from a couple options to make the game less challenging. Like choosing 
 difficulty, and you can even tell the game to go into automatic mode, which makes it complete combos 
 for you. But if your a real game player you won't have them on. This game also features tons of 
 unlockable content, such as:
  
  Son of Sparda Mode: A slightly increased difficulty, but you have to score an A ranking on each 
 mission to move on.
  Dante Must Die mode: A psychotic difficulty, where even the most minor difficulty will inflict 
 major damage.
  Heaven or Hell mode: (my favorite mode) In this mode, you get the power to defeat every enemy in 
 one hit, but the same goes for you too. If you get hit once your dead. But the mode gives you three 
 gold orbs that let you continue on the spot. 
  Hell and Hell: Almost the same as the one above, exept the enemies don't die in one hit. Only you 
 do.
  and Bloody Palace: You have to battle through 101 stages of mayhem, in an attempt to get as far 
 as possible.
  
  All of those modes have different thumbs up and thumbs downs. But my favorite would have to be 
 Heaven or Hell mode. 
  
  The game is filled with many combo's that can be performed with each set of weapons, to get major 
 Stylish points, which go towards your overall grade for that level. And the boss battles are amazing! 
 All the boss' are about 4 to 5 times the size of Dante and Nero. And all the boss fights get you 
 so pumped. But don't worry with the power each of the main characters wield, you shouldn't have 
 a problem beating them, on human mode. There are also many stunning videos with incredible graphics. 
 I mean the DMC girls look stunning, and the fights are always awsome to watch no matter how many 
 times you watch them. Trust me, you will never want to stop playing this game once you start.
 
  
  There's no suprise as to how fast paced and incredibly brutal the fights are, considering the game 
 has Dante the most well known demon slayer in the world. Sure your thumbs may be hurting after 
 you pull of some wonderfully amazing combos, but it's well worth it once you see you character 
 suplexing a white knight, and then drop kicking it in the face to shatter it to peices. But the 
 one thing that will always satisfy your need for violence, if it isn't already full-filled, is 
 using the Devil Bringer arm of Nero's. This weapon is going to be ure most used, and faovred weapon 
 out the game. You can use this on every enemy, and with each one it has a different jaw dropping 
 move. Wether it's lifting them by the face and slaming it into the ground, or gabbing them and 
 riopping them in half. This weapon is also a good way to beat down bosses quickly. Like most enemies 
 it inflicts a major amount of damage to them.
  
  Dante has some new weapons as well. After you beat mision 11, you can then use Dante. After the 
 first couple levels you unlock three new weapons for Dante; Pandora's box, Gilgamesh and Lucifier. 
 Lucifier is a melee weapon that throws exploding magical daggers in all directions, tying up your 
 enemies and killing them in the most painful manner. But it is hard to use this weapon, you will 
 have to pratice using it in order to use it the right way. Gilgamesh is another melle weapon that 
 allows him to perform magic-enhanced martial arts against your enemies. Each punch or kick from 
 these things sends your enemies flying. The final weapon you get is the most enjoyable, the Pandora's 
 box. The Pandora's Box transforms into a number of devastating attacks. At first it is a gernade 
 shooting crossbow, then a rocket launcher, and finally a cannon that shoots a beam through all 
 your enemies. It can also tranform into a moving tank like thing, that fires seeking missles at 
 youenemies.
  
  Although Dante is great you are mostly Nero most of the game, which is not a bad thing. Nero is 
 an awsome character. He wields a sword called the Red Queen, which you can rev up to increase it's 
 power. He also wield a gun called the Blue Rose, which is good for keeping your enemies away. But 
 the most effective weapon is the Devil Bringer Arm, which is awasome. But when you become Dante, 
 you sort of feel lost without it, since it make everything so much easier. You can grab enemies 
 from across the stage room and bring them to you to beat the crap out of them. It also helps you 
 get special items that you can't reach.
  
  The game is about trying to save Nero's girlfriend Kyrie, but while also saving the world. All 
 the people Nero new and trusted turn against him, and show there demon forms. They take Kyrie, 
 and offer her to there savior. Along with her they offer Nero. So you have to fight your way out 
 of the savior and save the world and Kyrie. But if you save Kyrie will she still be with Nero knowing 
 that he is part demon? You have to beat it and find out. The story isn't to suprising as to what 
 the final outcome may be, but if you have never playe any of the other games in the series, you 
 will be suprised more than others at some of the cut-scenes. Which by the way are going to be some 
 of the best you've seen in a long time, or possibly ever. With the amazing visuals, the impossible 
 actions, and brilliant work from the camera. In on of these cutscenes you will get to see Dante 
 dancing and doing theater. 
  
  Aside from the refgular 20 mission story mode, there are secret notes tagged all around the story. 
 When you observe one you get sent to a secret mission. Upon completing it you get a blue shard, 
 whcih when you get four you will get another slot added to your health. Collect them all to get 
 an achievement. Aside from bringing your health up, you also have to bring you Devil Trigger gauge 
 up. This gauge determines how long you can stay in devil form and it makes your attacks a lot more 
 devastating. It also enhances the effects of your demonics arm. So if you normally would suplex 
 an enemy, you would now throw them in the air, grab them and tumble down to earth doing increased 
 damage. In misions upon defeating enemies, or destroying furniture you get red or green orbs. They 
 both add to your orb count, but the green ones also restore health. Your orb count lets you purchase 
 items from the shop, like blue shards, gold orbs, purple orbs, and other accesories. Depending 
 on the amount of Stylish points you get in a level you get proud souls, which are used to purchase 
 new skills and upgrades for your weapons. Which you will need to do in order to find everything 
 you need to beat the game.
  
  
  The boss' are great to fight, not giving you the biggest challenge. Which is a bad thing because 
 you have to fight each one a couple of times in different parts of the game, and they will get 
 easier, because by the time you face them again, you have new weapons and combos. So you will be 
 able to take them down in less than a minute. You will probably find the levels actually more of 
 a challenge then the bosses. I say that because the enemies swarm you, atleast with the Boss' you 
 only have to deal with one, even if it is 5 times your size.
  
  Aside from the visuals the sound design is very good. The music they use for it will be stuck in 
 your head for a while after playing. They did a very good job of choosing what music to put into 
 each senario of the game. The voice acting was pretty good too. Especially for Nero having to display 
 different moods, like crying, or screaming. They did a good job on this game. Good Job Capcom!
 
  
  No matter how many times you beat it, there are loads of unlockable content and achievements sure 
 to keep each gamer busy for a while. Playing this game will add a great deal of action to your 
 gaming experience.

Review:  Before even putting the game in my Box i was expecting a bad character relationship with Nero from 
 the get-go no chemistry no relativity to the game watso ever and what was up with the weird looking 
 hand?
  Didnt like the immediate intro even though the graphics and visuals on HD were stunning but when 
 it got to the introduction of the game Nero actually looked pretty cool.. a laid back sort of rebel 
 guy who has no respect, which is always good for the hero of the game. The introduction of Dante 
 was just what i expected no bulls**t from anyone and gets the job done... Dante didnt fail to impress 
 me with being as strong as ever.. as the game progressed the story line got better and better with 
 stunning visuals and cutscenes.. Hot women is always a plus especialy on next gen consoles..
  The map is bad because it has no legend to tell you what is what or a marker to show you were to 
 go so you may get quite annoyed running around while worrying about what rank your gona get for 
 your completetion time and the platforming can be sooo very annoying i dont like games with alot 
 of jumping but this game has an exceding amount.. the boss battles are good with a great level 
 of difficulty and great visualy and over the top massive which is great.. Nero as a character has 
 his pluses he has the buster ability with the extending arm which when you get used to it is hard 
 to shake with Dante but after playing the other three you gt back into the sing of things.. The 
 gun he carries has nothing on Ebony n Ivory and his sword has nothing on Rebillion there isnt much 
 development with any of the other characters in the game you see brief glimpses in cutscenes but 
 there is no great connection not even with the girl Kyrie who is trying to save there is no sympathy 
 for her or her plight because there was no time to get to know her. i think if the game was made 
 a little bigger then character development would be a great plus to the game because the foundation 
 is there with great potential. 
  As always the camera angles can get pretty annoying and some of the secert missions are a bit silly.. 
 also some of there is alot of running back and forward in this game which foes eat up the pace 
 abit and makes u wanna go mad for sumit to kill.. the level of difficulty is amazing its just right 
 you will struggle on some bits but you will get there and will feel rewwarded for doing it some 
 of the boss battles can be a bit gruling and may take some time!
  All n all i think this is a game which will probs hit the top ten for this year and has other modes 
 for replay abitlity in my opinion for DMC fans its a must own!

Review:  Review Summary: 
  +Incredible combat 
  +Incrdible graphics 
  +Great cast of characters 
  +Imaginative enemies 
  +Great dialogue 
  +Challenging 
  +Fantastic 
 new character 
  +So good you'll watch them again & again cut-scenes 
  +Dripping with cool 
  
  -Recycled environments 
  -One of the worst last levels ever 
  -Recycled 
 bosses 
  
  What a refreshing & brilliant little game. 
  
  The aim of the game is basicaly to get from point A to point B & kill everything that gets in your 
 way in the coolest & most stylish way possibe. In a generation full of open worlds & promises of 
 game changing moral decisions that fall flatr on their face its so refreshing to get one that just 
 shoves you in a linear level & tells you to get on with it. 
  
  This also extends to the difficulty. I played it on Demon Hunter mode & it was pretty damn difficult. 
 Ive been hearing this is easier than DMC3, being someone who thought DMC3 was too easy this worried 
 me. However I died more in the first few missions than the whole of DMC3 so i can say this is not 
 true & thank God. Its been ages since I played a game that was a actual challenge & didnt hold 
 my hand all the way through. But its never unfair. If you button mash & just go into every battle 
 waving your sword around blindly you will die many, many times. It forces you to switch tactics 
 & learn different moves. It makes you play well & put thought into battles. It also has the hardest 
 boss battle ive had in a long time - fighting against Dante, my God its hard. But if you die its 
 always your fault for fighting sloppy or not having quick enough reactions. 
  
  Next the presentation & graphics. In a word - superb! It has some truly jaw dropping vistas with 
 scenery extending naturelay & beautifuly as far as the eye can see. A particular highlight being 
 wlaking to the exact of a cave into a forest - the light beams just shining through the entrance 
 - Beautiful sight. All the character models are expertly rendered & move incredibly smoothly. It 
 has some of the most imaginative & cool creatures to fight against too. The framerate never drops 
 & the camera is fantastic - only costing me a tiny amount of health or a loss of direction on the 
 odd occasion. The cut-scenes are also superb - as fantasticly OTT as ever & great to watch. It 
 has a surprisingly good story too which does leave you playing on to found out what happens next. 
 Each character also has more personality & charm to them then most games manage in their entire 
 cast. Each retaining the magical 'so bad its good voice acting'. Especialy when Dante reaches the 
 opera house in the 2nd half. I was almost crying from laughter. Its brilliant. 
  
  Next we've been given a new main character to play with - usualy something to be terrified of. 
 But Capcom have created another great character in Nero. they havent gone far from Dantes character 
 at all which helps - he just looks like a younger brother wearing a slightly different jacket. 
 Big differnces are in the combat though. The first is teh exceed techinique. You have a split second 
 moement with every attack where you can tap the L button & it revs your sword up in a blink so 
 the subsequent attacks are more powerful & quicker. Each of these subsequent attacks can then be 
 chained into revs attacks too & requires some great skill to get the timing correct, but is the 
 only way of getting SSS style rankings. But the main difference comes in his Devil Arm. One of 
 his arms is hugely powerful & can stretch, pull enimies towards him (or him towards them if they 
 are big) & also throw them. This works fantasticaly well & presents whole new combo opportunities 
 as you knock a enemy miles away & then just snap them back to you in a instant for more slicing. 
 Brilliant fun to use. 
  
  It also creates some spectacular scenes against bosses. If you can get a good enough combo on a 
 boss you can stun them. Then if you get close you can perform earth shattering throws with his 
 arm. Just wait until you see him casualy throw a monster the size of a building with ease. Its 
 a great spectacle. 
  
  You also realise how attached & debendant you become on this when you take control of Dante halfway 
 through. It feels like youve lost your right arm (which is kind of true) & requires some serious 
 brain rewiring to get used to not being able to snatch the enemies back. Dantes move set is largely 
 unchanged form DMC3 & he still has the 4 types of combat that can be switched on the fly. But once 
 i'd rewired my brain to this & picked my chosen fighting style I was pulling off combos I could 
 only have dreamed of with Nero. The fact you can also gain new weapons & switch these on the fly 
 too creates some mind boggling combos possibe. Also just wait until you get the Pandore Box - BEST 
 WEAPON EVER! All this makes Dante the superior character IMO. He also has a coolness about him 
 that Nero lacks, especialy in cut-scenes. Nero is like a shouty, young kid. Dante is wise & just 
 effortlessely cool. 
  
  But Dantes section is also where the problems show. Capcom have been incredibly lazy with this 
 game. You basicaly fight through every section youve just done with Nero - you even fight all the 
 bosses again. Although the change in character, normal enemies, style & the slight change location 
 appearence (imagine the difference being switching between light & dark world in Zeldas) does make 
 this bearable & Dantes unique fighting style does make it feel new. In fact it feels so new & different 
 that I forgot I was basicaly in the same locations. What is confusing though is that Capcom keep 
 throwing new & imaginative creatures to fight but gave you the same bosses. It kind of fits with 
 the story but i would have mutched prefered some new bosses & the new enemies show they werent 
 short of ideas. 
  
  Even so I think I would have still given it 9/10. However it throws on of the worst final levels 
 in history at you (not Halo Flood levels bad, but bad) & it forces you to fight almost every boss 
 again one after the other. This leaves a very sour taste in the mouth just as you finish. & unlike 
 the re-used scenery & fighting bosses again for the sake of the story with the freshness of a new 
 character. It is unforgivable & some very sloppy work from Capcom. 
  
  Just fell short of classic status. A damn shame. However dont let this put you off it is still 
 a fantastic game everyone should play through at least once, or at least until that final level.

Review:  Well, lets face it, the Devil May Cry series is AWESOME, to say the least.
  And DMC4 is no exception.
  
  Lets start with the graphics:
  Gorgeous! I really found them 
 amazing to look at, Excellent lighting, everything seemed polished, awesome job Capcom.
  
  The Story:
  Well I wont give anything away because i dont want to spoil it for anyone. What i 
 will say is I personally found teh story very intriguing, and i was freaking out at certain cutscenes 
 because of the plot twists. My only complaint about the story (*POSSIBLE SPOILER*) is it wasnt developped 
 enough ( a. k. a. we dont find out how Nero got his demonic arm) . I'm hoping Capcom will bring Nero 
 back in another installment of the series and further develop on this.
  
  The Characters:
  
  Nero: Newcomer but definitely no Noob. I found it really fun playing as 
 Nero due to the devastating combos you can perform with the Devil Bringer. Nero only has one sword 
 ( Red Queen) and one handgun (Blue Rose) but they are more than enough to take down even the biggest 
 of foes. The introduction of the Devil Bringer system was a smart move on Capcom's part. The Devil 
 Bringer only starts off with Buster ( a punch) but you gain more abilities with it as you progress. 
 As a side-note I'd like to mention that Nero's personality resembles Dante's in the sense that 
 they are both layed back and both have a good sense of humor, which I find helps the player relate 
 to the character.
  
  Dante: Ah yes, good-old-ass-kicking Dante. Who could forget that wise guy we've grown to know and 
 love. Playing as Dante does take a bit of getting used to ( well it did for me anyway since i was 
 so used to Devil Bringer i forgot Dante doesnt have it :P) . The ability to switch styles on the 
 fly is excellent because you can adjust your fighting style to the situation you're in. Though 
 you may not be able to percform all your favorite moves from DMC3 there is still a decent range 
 of techniques Dante can perform and its quite satisfying. Dante has 3 melee weapons including the 
 Rebellion ( i wont give away the other 2, but one of them is really kick-ass, though very similar 
 to one of the weapons we've seen in DMC3) and Dante also has 3 guns : Ebony+Ivory, Coyote-A [shotgun] , 
 and another which I dont want to reveal but trust me, you'll love it, especially when you buy the 
 2 upgrades.
  
  The game play:
  One of the biggest components to a game is how well it plays, and DMC4 is not let-down. The controls 
 are very similar to DMC 3 (maybe also 1 and 2, idk i never played them) and they are very easy 
 to get used to and very smooth. Though they may seem to get a little repetitive at times, I'll 
 admit that much. Theres still the Style system which is a good thign because if you're going to 
 kill something, do it with style. And as stated earlier the Devil Bringer system is AWESOME.
  
  The Enemies: 
  What would Devil May Cry be without demons coming to crash the party. The 
 enemies are fairly varied, though I think DMC3 had more variation. Some are easier to take down 
 than others, of course, and some will seem like minibosses (much like the Hell Vanguard from DMC3, 
 you know, that crazy with-like thing mission 2?)
  The bosses unfortunately are not so varied. Sure they're fun to take down and fun to fight , no 
 doubt about that, but there are only about 8 bosses, but
  about 16 or 17 boss fights. What does that tell you?
  Yep thats right, you have to fight some 
 of the bosses on more than one occasion. While yes that was also in DMC3, theres was still about 
 10 bosses. Anyway, this doesnt really do much to take away from teh game, but it doesnt add much 
 to it either. Although fighting the bosses with Nero, then Dante sure is different, You'll need 
 a different strategy for each, well, more or less.
  
  Upgrade sytem:
  Something new. You no longer use red orbs to buy upgrades and abilities, instead you use Proud 
 Sould, which you receive at the end of each mission ( and from Bloody Palace) , the number depends 
 on your score. If you're not happy with the skills you purchased, you can refund all you Proud 
 Souls and start from scratch, this can be done at anytime before a mission or when at a Divinity 
 Statue. Red orbs are still used to purchase health and gold orbs and holy water, etc.
  
  Bonus stuff:
  Bloody Palace is back, and its as fun as ever, though I dont think there are as 
 many levels as there was in DMC3 SE.
  Nice artwork
  and a "History of Devil May Cry" is available, for trhose who haven't played the previous games.
 
  Yes there are more game diffculties to unlock dont worry about that.
  
  Well now for a quick recap:
  
  THE GOOD:
  The game looks fantastic.
  Devil Bringer feels 
 like a fresh new experience.
  The game still has its great sense of humor.
  Boss fights are fun.
  Combos are great.
  Weapons are fun.
  Introduction of a new main character 
 turned out to be a fun experience ( who wouldve thought? :O)
  The story is new and intriguing.
  The dialogue was great except for maybe a few cheesy lines.
 
  Excellent voice-overs ( *FUN FACT* The guy who did Nero's voice also does the voice of Ichigo 
 from Bleach. He also played the black ranger Adam in Mighty Morphing Power Rangers the movie)
 
  Not too hard, not too easy.
  Excellent upgrade system.
  
  THE BAD:
  Repetitive boss fights.
  Story could have been developped a little more, especially Nero's past.
 
  I found the game to be a little short ( but that's probably just me since i played it a lot. I 
 beat it in about 14 or 15 hours ,spread out over 5 days, on Devil Hunter mode.)
  
  Overall, 
  the good out-weighs the bad.
  I give this game somewhere between an 8.5 and 9 out 
 of 10.
  Definitely worth picking up and adding to your collection.

Review:  DMC1 brought us stylish 3D gameplay that marked a strong debut for a series with a now strong following. 
 Reminiscent to a 3D version of Castlevania done right, it easily gathered many interests eagerly 
 waiting for a fresh sequel named DMC2 and indeed DMC2 came but not nearly as grand as people expected 
 to be. Finally DMC3 came much to everyones surprise showing that a fresh return to a series that 
 made many originally dismayed fans from DMC2 come back with absolute flair.
  
  Here comes DMC4 with it's debut into the next-generation systems and its certaintly takes off after 
 the DMC3's gameplay with Dante's character along with a new protagonist that brings in several 
 fresh mechanics. Capcom swings the balance so that anyone that doesnt like Nero as much can still 
 enjoy Dante through the other half of the game, so that it can keep fans happy.
  
  DMC4 plays like a blend of DMC3 and DMC1 along with some character switch event thats pretty similar 
 to Capcom's own Resident Evil: Code Veronica. Pulling off sword combos is pretty easy for both characters 
 with just the right amount of complexity to keep you coming back for those later difficulties which 
 ill get into later in the review. Nero doesnt recieve any new weapons or guns, so you'll pretty 
 much stick with his Red Queen hybrid of a sword and a motorcycle, the Blue Rose revolver and than 
 his devil bringer which comes in form of a hand that can grab an enemy from a distance or throw 
 them down into to kingdom come while Nero shouts out "SLAMMM DUNK". 
  
  Thankfully though all of Nero's weapons are good enough to last players a good amount of time, 
 Nero can accelerate his sword (In this case it's called "Exceed") to bring a more devestating and 
 faster variant of the intended attack which can be upgraded three times. There are two ways of 
 using it, one is by charging it up by pressing the exceed button and holding than repeating the 
 step or he could opt to quickly squeeze the exceed button right after he does an melee attack. 
 Timed right and Nero instantly levels up his exceed meter but the act of timing the attack itself 
 is fairly difficult to do. Next is his gun which plays out like a standard revolver that can be 
 fired rapidly or he can charge it up to 3 tiems given that you upgraded it so that it fires 2 bursts 
 of shots that does a fair amount of damage. Now we have arguably the most interesting mechanic 
 in the game which is the demon hand named Devil Bringer. He can grab enemies from a far or objects 
 which plays out with some platforming elements and he could use his buster which depending on the 
 enemy or boss varies from throwing down his enemies hard into the ground or something even more 
 devestating which involves grabbing a lance from a particular enemy, thrusting it into him and 
 then sends him flying into the ground. Another case is Nero doing a suplex and than kicking a knight 
 into the ground which is just plain awesome.
  
  Dante's no slouch either. He has access to all his main styles from DMC3 so he can dodge enemy 
 attacks with the use of the Trickster style, bring new melee combos into the table with Swordmaster, 
 using Gunslinger to shoot enemies from the sky while spinning and finally guarding enemy attacks 
 and holding stored energy until he releases it into a form of a devestating burst of damage which 
 is the Royal Guard. You can do this all in a fly while switching his weapons real-time to add to 
 more devestating combos. You've seen Dante do all of this before but he was never able to switch 
 styles on the fly until now. You can see him dodge an enemy attack with trickster and then the 
 next second do a deadly combo that involves stabbing someone many times with his sword with swordmaster 
 and after that he begins launching them off by sending them up to the air and swinging his sword 
 like a baseball bat. 
  
  Gameplay aside, the graphics and animation is simply one of the best ive seen. The environments 
 are varied too from a European styled city, snowy dark castle and a lush forest. Its far and above 
 a simple "HD Devil May Cry". The enemy models look fantastic, the giant bosses look superb and 
 the animation present in the game is a pure bliss to watch giving players some incentive to do 
 those SSS combos aside from getting a new fresh rank given at the end of each level or achievements. 
 The soundtrack is not everyone's cup of tea but it shouldnt kill anyone either although its not 
 as strong as DMC3's hard metal rock battle theme if you're in that kind of stuff. The voice acting 
 is also top notch filled with melodramatic dialogue and keeping in touch with DMC3's same cheesy 
 dialogue which can either drive you nuts or glee in joy. The story is there but is neither very 
 strong nor weak but much in the same vein as DMC3 was. 
  
  Devil May Cry 4 has unfortunate problems though. There are some puzzles that detriment the flow 
 of the game's superb action which ranges from a physics type puzzle that involves you moving an 
 object to certain position but the problem is that you dont have total or good in a matter of fact 
 control over it. Another one involves a particular dice, gameroom and a chance to move back, forward, 
 verse enemies or win orbs which doesnt fit in with the game at all. Finally there arent a wide 
 variety of enemies in the game in comparison to several others and also for those that played the 
 other Devil May Cry has seen these enemies from time to time before so it feels as if Capcom simply 
 decided to recycle several enemies from previous titles. The bosses is another problem but not 
 in the way you would think. All bosses in the game are great, there are no bosses in particular 
 that offers a bad or unfair fight, to simply put they are all very fun but the fact that you have 
 to repeat these bosses over and over again is where you would begin to wonder where the boss variety 
 from DMC3 is. Another rather personal problem is a certain huge backtrack that happens during the 
 character switch. The game screams "recycle" and you'll probably be sorely disappointed by the 
 fact that your going do the same things over and over again from fighting the same bosses, fighting 
 the same enemies and backtracking.
  
  Overall despite the game's problems with repetition, it's superbly addictive combat more than makes 
 up for it. Of average length of 9 to 10 hours with a pretty easy difficulty, Devil May Cry 4 is 
 a predictable yet satisfying sequel that invites both players that never played it before and veterans 
 to join in on the stylish action. While it may not be as strong as DMC3 was, if you're looking 
 for some great combat and not afraid of some repitition than Devil May Cry 4 is definitely worth 
 looking at.
  
  Since I love DMC's ranking system soo much...

Review:  I ordered this game the day I found out I could reserve it. Being a big fan of the Original (hated 
 the 2nd one, didn't have a ps for the 3rd) and knowing its making a next gen debut I knew this 
 was going to be auesome. I'm not going into the story because enough people want to spoil that 
 for you, I hate SPOILING JERKS in forums.
  You play as Nero in this series. You are a demon butt kicker. You can play on easy or hard and 
 plus unlockables in the end. 
  The graphics are amazing, The story is amazing, the voice acting is amazing, the fighting is amazing. 
 THIS GAME IS AUESOME!!! Having finished Heavenly Sword on PS3 the day before I thought no good 
 game like that could be made, I was wrong. This game is Sick! Easy to control, easy to get sucked 
 in. This game will make you play it in one setting, you just want to keep going.
  I'd say a kind of low replay value but you will want to do a couple of things with the game afterwords 
 (not saying nothing) .

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 is a breath of fresh air for a console that is stereotypically a shooter console. 
 So whiles its nice to have games like Vegas on it, its also nice to have a game like this
  Unfortunately the game is painfully short at just 13 hours long but its extremely addicting at 
 the same time and comes with lots of replay value. In the form of unlockables and much more challenging 
 difficulty settings. 
  The story isnt very strong but its not very weak either. The game never bothers to explain why 
 Nero looks so much like Dante and even goes to the extent of fighting like him, while being dressed 
 like him as well. In this chapter of the Devil May Cry franchise we see the spot light on newcomer 
 Nero. While his move set is extremely limited, he does have some things going for him. Hes got 
 his devil arm which has some very stylish and often insane finishing moves, which really comes 
 into play during boss fights. Fleshing out his personality as a man whos on a mission to save the 
 woman he loves and hes pissed. You'll know what i mean when he fights a boss before you jump over 
 to Dante.
  So for more than half the game you play as Nero and then they change it up on you by letting you 
 play as Dante. Whiles its a relief to finally play at the son of sparda, its also a pain at first 
 too. Since you've spent over half the game as Nero its going to take some time to readjust. But 
 once you do you'll see its much more fun to play as Dante just because of his versatility. 
  I actually enjoyed the cast of characters for the most part. I really didnt care for Kirie very 
 much because she was the damsel in distress and nothing else really. He brother actually has the 
 same voice actor as Frank West of Dead Rising fame and when i heard that i was like, "Dude its 
 Frank West!" I really wished the used Lady more in this game. She seems much more mature now and 
 they used her for no more than 30 seconds of cutscene. Dante's arrogance and wit are a welcome 
 sharp contrast to Nero's straightforward approach, which usually involves him flying into a rage 
 and beating the tar out of the enemy. Not that thats a bad thing.
  Boss fights are engaging and challenging. Bringing back memories of games where you had to fight 
 insanely huge enemies with crippling attacks, and endless life bars. A welcome challenge indeed. 
 If theres one thing i live for in games, besides the story, its the boss fights.
  My only major gripes are that this game could have been a couple hours longer, a more fleshed out 
 story/characters, and sometimes the camera is a handicap. 
  So if you want a game where you know you will go back just to unlock every single thing and love 
 replaying it on higher difficulties, then pick this one up. If not, do yourself a favor and rent 
 it first.

Review:  This game is a welcome and fun addition to the Devil May Cry series bringing us not only a new 
 character but also the ability to play as Dante, the main protagonist for the previous three games.
 
  
  I enjoyed this game fully when I played it, but in my opinion you have to be a fan of the series 
 to totally enjoy this title. It's not a terribly difficult game until you turn up the difficulty, 
 then it gets to be a real lesson in humility.
  
  If you've played any of the other titles in the series this game will feel very familiar to you. 
 It has the same basic mechanics with a few new added twists, such as the ability to bring enemies 
 in to you instead of having to chase them down constantly.
  
  Graphics wise this game looks gorgeous. The graphics never really slip up and keep looking crisp 
 during the lightning quick action.
  
  Sound wise the voice acting is great and the music is true to the series. The only problem is the 
 same problem the other games had, the constant catch phrases being spouted out as you do combos. 
 You can only here "Slam Dunk!" so many times before you wanna blow your own head off.
  
  So, in conclusion, if you were a fan of the other games and have been wanting more on your next-gen 
 system, I recommend picking this game up.
  
  Cheers!

Review:  But nothing more. 
  
  Being somewhat a fan of DMC 3, I was expecting a big improvement with the series moving into the 
 next gen consoles. Unfortunately, I have been disappointed once again. Just because I say that 
 does not mean the game is bad. It is actually a good game, with a good plot to back it up. Just 
 not what I had anticipated and hoped for.
  
  The downfall comes with 2 major mistakes. The smaller one, in my opinion, is the repetitiveness 
 of the levels and bosses. There was no variety and the bosses, except for a select few, were incredibly 
 easy even on the harder modes. Obviously I can only say that until you reach Hell or Hell mode, 
 which is the developers funny idea of a challenge. I think Best Buy is going to have an increased 
 percentage of controllers being bought if you know what i mean : ) .
  
  Anyways, the biggest downfall in my opinion is the player change. Its almost as if though making 
 you play as half of the game as a new character and getting used to him then having to switch back 
 to the character we all know and love, was another hilarious joke by capcom. In the earlier stages 
 with Dante, I was finding myself trying to snatch enemies from afar but instead id be doing a pretty 
 useless trickster dash or swinging away at nothing. Something i found to be really irritating.
 
  
  Apart from all the criticism I have given this new installment, I still think this game is good 
 and possibly worth the buy. This game is definitely worth the rent if you just like to play the 
 games like me and worth the buy if you are an achiever.

Review:  This game honestly makes me feel the way I did when I first picked up DMC 1 back in 2000. The atmosphere 
 this time around is a tiny bit darker than in DMC3, but Capcom certainly retained all the challenging 
 elements that returned DMC to glory in its previous franchise. This game throws players straight 
 to the lions if one decides to play on the normal setting (dubbed "Devil Hunter") buy opening the 
 game with a tutorial that leads straight into a boss fight. The game only picks up from there by 
 adding more challenges, a ton of boss fights, and of course the new element to the series found 
 in newcomer Nero, the weapon called the "Devil Bringer". 
  
  ***POSSIBLE SPOILER***
  I don't want to spoil anything for those who are new to the franchise, but the enemies in this 
 game are certainly praise worthy and rival those found in DMC3 and especially those in DMC1. The 
 Frosts have returned and the Assault has been introduced as an homage to the Blades found in the 
 first game. Once you make the switch to Dante though, this makes the game that much more addicting. 
 Being able to switch between styles was sexcellent. Sure some elements of the game could use improving, 
 such as certain camera angles that can impede game play and puzzled that might cause frustration, 
 but overall, this game is worth the price and gives the DMC franchise a more sturdy foundation 
 for its future. 
  
  This game certainly made up for the space between God Of War 2 and now that lacked many action 
 adventure games.

Review:  played Devil may cry 4, after each mission i was thinking to myself, hey, the ending on this mission 
 was kinda exciting, ill try just one more mission, and so i did on all 20 missions.
  
  I stretch played this game like a obsession, i couldnt find myself to take it out of my Xbox, it 
 was damn near impossible, i bought it at 11:00 Am on a friday, finished it the next day at 06:50, 
 several beers later
  
  The game in itself didnt excite me as much as the different charachters that i wanted to understand, 
 their personality, why did they fight? why did they do the things that was done?
  
  OH yeah, this is my first devil may cry game ive played, so i had no idea about the back story, 
 all i knew was that Dante was so much cooler then Nero, and i didnt understand why they looked 
 exactly like eachother, i didnt understand alot of things really, but i thought maybe next mission 
 i will get my answers, and slowly the puzzle assembled for me, they story was by then finished 
 and it is now time to do it all over again, to rack up the grades on the different levels, but 
 i had a blast with this one
  
  Graphics is amazing and u could even zoom in a little bit in the cutscenes and move the camera 
 a little bit in each direction if u get bored of the cutscenes you can even skip them by pressing 
 the start button which i found really good when i already saw the different cut scenes once
  
  The controls was abit awkward though, i run into a a new camera angle and at first i run forward 
 but now i run backwards, i didnt understand this concept of using controls and camera angles and 
 infact that was the one thing that disturbed me the most about this game
  
  The gameplay was otherside really great, there were alot of combos, i used two of them, two different 
 charachters with different styles, i prefered nero coz i thought that Dante was abit strange, like 
 he had 4 different styles, and none of them were as good as neros hand, it could be my imagination, 
 but i think the game was much easier at some points with one of the charachters and sometime it 
 was much harder, the difficulty curve was really a rollercoster of doom
  
  All in all, i thought the game was amazing, not a perfect game not even close, but it had alot 
 of ingredients that made me both sweat and cry at the same time

Review:  
  The next installment of one of the premiere action franchises is here, so let's cut the formalities. 
 DMC 4 has great action, an interesting story, good music, some fairly good level design, and all 
 the over-the-top coolness and humor you could want. But of course the main focus is the game play, 
 and it is good. This game is pretty much a hybrid between DMC 1 and 3 in every respect. It does 
 mix things up a bit having 2 playable characters. Both characters are vastly different and have 
 an impressive array of moves and weapons. Nero brings a little freshness to the series, other than 
 being new, with the devil bringer which is a great weapon with some amazing moves. Everyone who 
 feared that Nero would suffer the fate of Raiden can rest easy- he's a great character in every 
 aspect, not Dante good, but good. Dante plays just like DMC 3 with the addition of switching between 
 his weapons and styles on the fly and this can lead to some insane combos. If you played and enjoyed 
 DMC 1 and/or 3, you'll feel right at home. But of course the game does have problems. Just like 
 DMC 1 there is a considerable amount of backtracking but if you don't get lost it won't bother 
 you much. Fighting bosses and going through the same puzzles a third time, however, can be annoying 
 but luckily that only happens in just one level (Mission 19- be prepared) . Dante doesn't have as 
 many weapons/missions as you'd want but the weapon and style quick-switching does make up for some 
 of that. As always the camera is occasionally problematic and will make you sometimes go where 
 you don't want to or be attacked by something you can't see when the camera changes positions, 
 but most of the time it's manageable. Occasionally shadows will look bad but really only a few 
 areas of the forest are noticeable, and the graphics are very good by the way. I find these problems 
 be minor. And those who like a challenge will be happy to know that DMC 4 has 6 levels of difficulty 
 as well as the return of the Bloody Palace, and unlockables like artwork and a cut-scene viewer. 
 If you liked previous DMCs and don't mind it being pretty much the same as them then you will enjoy 
 Devil May Cry 4, I sure did and I'm continuing to do so.

Review:  I'll start off by saying that I've been a big fan of DMC ever since I got the first game for $20 
 at GameStop...
  I've seen its up and downs (DMC2 *shivers*) and I've still stuck by the series through the thick 
 and thin.
  
  I'll start off with the graphics they are simply beautiful the environments are so great that sometimes 
 I just sit there and look around (Although don't zone out to much the hordes of demons might kill 
 you.) There was this big issue between the 360 and PS3 over load times but the longest I had to 
 wait in game was a second so if you can't sit and wait that long you might as well throw away any 
 gaming systems you own.
  
  The battle system is the same old DMC style combat although with the new character Nero there is 
 a twist to the combat you now have access to the Devil Bringer which althoughs you to reach out 
 and grab enemies from afar and slam them into the ground (The move you do on the enemies depends 
 on the type of enemy.) And now Dante can now switch Styles on the fly during combat so be prepared 
 to be able to pull off some crazy combos.
  
  Storyline wise the game had a very interesting storyline I personally don't think if a new player 
 came and played DMC4 that they would need to have played the others but I think it would certainly 
 help, Pretty much the story revolves around Nero the Dante look-alike who has a Demonic Arm called 
 the Devil Bringer and he has been sent to track down Dante who killed the Order Of The Sword's 
 Leader.
  
  I say to any DMC fan that this is a must-buy I don't care how you get just go out there and get 
 it!
  And to any newbie to the series give it a try maybe rent it and if you like it go out and buy the 
 box set that comes with the first three games.

Review:  Capcom's stylish demon killing action series returns for its fourth outing with Devil May Cry 4. 
 In an interesting design choice, series mainstay, and fan favorite Dante takes a back seat this 
 time around allowing newcomer Nero to take center stage. For newcomers to the franchise this will 
 not make any difference. For longtime fans such as myself, it is a point of ire, however one that 
 ultimately does not hinder the game in any way. The combat is as fast and slick as ever and ultimately 
 Nero's story serves as a focal point while at the same time being a vehicle to continue Dante's 
 story through a different perspective.
  
  The single most important part of any game is the gameplay and it still shines in DMC 4. As previously 
 mentioned combat is as fast and frantic as ever, with a few interesting additions to spice things 
 up. The most notable of these being Nero's Devil Bringer a fancy glowing blue demon arm that factors 
 into combat and platforming in interesting ways that really feel fresh and exciting, and the EX-gauge 
 a system for powering up Nero's sword attacks. From grabbing ledges to slamming enemies around 
 like ragdolls, the Devil Bringer is a mechanic that adds greatly to the game and remains fun through 
 to the end credits. On the other hand, the EX-gauge is useful yet ultimately unnecessary. Of note 
 is the fact that the combat this time around is more offensively based as the developers interestingly 
 decided to take away the ability to block. For series veterans this may feel a little off but it 
 is quickly overcome.
  
  Dante returns in this game sporting his style combat system from DMC 3. Because Dante does not 
 have, the Devil Bringer his play style is quite different than Nero's and when the switch occurs 
 it may take a little while to effectively make the transition. This time around, however he can 
 switch between styles on the fly making for some truly awesome combo possibilities. Dante is also 
 considerably more powerful than Nero is and enemies will generally fall before his might much more 
 quickly. Sadly, he is only playable for about a third of the game.
  
  The notorious difficulty of Devil May Cry 3 is absent in this outing. In an attempt to make the 
 game, more accessible DMC 4 starts with two different difficulty choices. Human and Devil Hunter. 
 Devil Hunter is roughly equivalent to DMC 3's easy mode so Human is really only present for those 
 who either have not played the franchise or do not usually play action games in general. This may 
 prove to be another point of ire for those who stuck with the original version of DMC 3 but with 
 the return of the Bloody Palace mode and a number of harder unlockable difficulties there is sure 
 to be a challenge for anyone.
  
  Without giving too much away the story this time around centers on a cult like group of which Nero 
 is a part and Dante is out to take down. It is not the most in depth story of the series but serves 
 its purpose to drive forward the action and fits the style developed in previous entries. 
  
  Visually this game holds its own against the other top visual titles currently on the market 
 and is expectedly the nicest looking DMC game to date. Slowdown occurs only in rare instances with 
 large numbers of enemies attacking and even then, it is minor. The shadows in some instances such 
 as the forest level are a little erratic but overall this is a very nice looking game.
  
  The voice acting is as solid as always and fitting for the serious but not too serious tone that 
 each of the Devil May Cry games is known for. Music can be repetitive and the same battle theme 
 will be heard countless times before the adventure is over. Gunshots and sword slashes all sound 
 appropriate.
  
  The old camera system once again makes a return in DMC 4 and this is possibly the biggest detraction 
 from the game. Usually the camera is good and does not get in the way. However, in long hallways 
 and tight spaces it often results in the player moving in the wrong direction or occasionally being 
 attacked by something that cannot be seen.
  
  So in the end Devil May Cry 4 is a great looking, great sounding ultra stylish action game with 
 attitude to spare that will likely take between 10-15 hours to beat on an initial play through. 
 The switch between characters can be a little jarring and the camera can get in the way but this 
 is a rewarding and fun game with enough unlockable content to keep people playing. For fans of 
 the series this game will be a must play, and with the more forgiving difficulty and new character 
 those who have not played Devil May Cry before have an accessible entry point. So with Devil May 
 Cry 4 being a success 2 remains the black sheep of the franchise (had to get a dig in at the very 
 mediocre DMC 2 somewhere)
  
  Overall: 9/10

Review:  This is the first real sequel to the original devil may cry as 3 was a prequel and 2 doesn't exist 
 (it sucks so bad I don't consider it a game) . Now I have read several reviews of this and each 
 one I have read has been lower than I could have ever expected. After playing and beating this 
 I have come to one answer as to why these scores are so low. Every one is nit picking the crap 
 out of this!
  
  I truly expected a metal gear 2 after reading the reviews but really this is a worthy sequel that 
 fixes the older problems and adding to stuff to make me smile. The story is pretty good, nothing 
 mind blowing but really all the setup is for some real ass kicking. Some people were angry that 
 you don't play as Dante because he was such a awesome badass of a devil but nero is not as lame 
 as I thought he would be. He is basic Dante but younger and with a little love but that said, he 
 still beats the crap out of everyone in the most unpredictably sweet fighting scenes in the series.
 
  
  Action movies need to play or at least watch this game. It has some of the most amazing fighting 
 scenes you can ever see. I can't describe them other than say that if you have played 3 then you 
 know what I'm talking about. Speaking of 3, this is a lot easier to play meaning that this really 
 is a good place to start if you haven't played the other games in the series. But for people like 
 me who beat 3 and want more challenge, some of the later difficultys are impossible. They also 
 have my favorite mode heaven or hell. Which is both the easiest and hardest mode in the game. Where 
 everything dies in one hit.
  
  The new weapon (devil bringer) is basically a grapple that has better range. You grab guys and 
 bring them towards you and vice versa. When you do become Dante again you may miss grabbing them. 
 Anyway you play as nero 2/3 of the game and Dante 1/3. For Dante the best new feature is an old 
 one. In 3, you had different styles you had to pick from and now all you have to do is pick with 
 a d pad. You really understand how useful trickster is when it gets as hard as it does. Also now 
 you just use the triggers to switch swords and guns, no pause menu required.
  
  One nice thing is they brought back lady and trish which means he is not james bond anymore. However 
 the girl from 2 is not here, and thank god for that. The game is pretty short, I beat it in under 
 7 hours on the easy and 9 on normal, but it's worth playing. Dante is still just as cool (maybe 
 even a little cooler than last time) as he has always been and I can almost promise that this is 
 not the last of the game series.
  
  Overall I say get it if your a fan of the series and rent it if your low on cash. Sadly I am the 
 latter and the rest of my money has to go to smash. Any way 5 out of 5 and xplay was retarded giving 
 this a 3. One extra note though, if you get this on the ps3 you have to wait a half an hour to 
 get it installed. (When did systems get games installed?) On the 360 there is no wait and I have 
 also seen a clip of the ps3 and it looks exactly the same as the 360 with a little quicker load 
 times.

Review:  the game is amazing and a lot of fun. it looks incredible on my lcd screen and the music/sound 
 crystal on my 360 and for dante veterans [like myself] , nero is a lot of fun and you'd come to 
 understand more about why he became a main factor this time around. dante is still playable. u 
 could play in human mode: nero or devil hunter: dante for the run through but even if u pick nero. 
 u get to spam dante throughout a portion in the story line. which is sick and a bit too exaggerated 
 as far as :ahem: weapons go. WHICH is cool. don't get me wrong but for a run through it was incredibly 
 easy. like stupid easy. i literally didn't die ONCE or had to repeat a boss fight or use yellow 
 orbs ONCE until ONLY the last "boss" because i was careless and stupid other than being careless 
 i was just amazed at how dumb down it was but it doesn't mean u can't enjoy it. once u finish the 
 run through... u could unlock the difficulty to something much harder or in real DMC normal: which 
 is "HARD" 
  
  anyway i give it only an 8.. because it was too easy first run at it and backtracking is never fun 
 .. not even for platforming. other than that... it's a definitely good game. and check out the anime 
 series because the volumes are coming to the states. the series as pretty good

Review:  From the first time i picked up the control pad i was just knocked back by the sheer brilliance 
 of this game, its smooth faltless control system to its beautiful locations and outstanding voice 
 talent. This is Devil May Cry at its best. I have to admit im not a big DMC fan only renting and 
 testing earlier titles but Capcom have made the latest edition to fit New Commers and Veterans 
 of the franchise. You will wander where the hours went as the game draws you in with its epic gameplay 
 and story line and holds you there till matter over mind turns off your console. It throws everything 
 that a good hack and slash should be and revs it up to maximum without any damage to how the game 
 looks of feels. The fact of the matter is Devil May Cry 4 will keep you entertained for hours withouts 
 getting repetative. If you have the cash then get yourself this game. This is Devil May Cry

Review:  Just picked it up and can't put it down. I gotta get up in the morning but I say **** It !!! This 
 game is so worth the lack of sleep, bags under the eyes, and girlfriend nagging at you to pay attention 
 to her. I'm new to the series cause I always heard the negatives about it but then I downloaded 
 the demo and it blew my mind. I played that demo to death before I finally got my hands on it. 
 At $59.99 it's a steal in my opinion. A definite Greatest Hits for the future. If you're a fan 
 of the series then I highly recommend it. The new character, although I'm not familiar with the 
 old one, plays amazing. The combos are glorious and nothing beats impaling someone with a giant 
 lance (except killing nazi's in every WW II FPS) . If you're down with blood, guts, and mayham then 
 chuck on some tunes and let the slaughter begin.
  
  
  Devil May Cry 4... just can't say it enough.

Review:  In 2001, Capcom introduces Dante to the gaming world in the first Devil May Cry, a hero unlike 
 no other at the time with a cocky personality and fights with lots of style. Since then, the series 
 has gone through a roller coaster in terms of quality with the second game being one of the most 
 disappointing sequels in recent years, and the third game returning it to greatness while being 
 harder than usual (unless you played the Special Edition of DMC3) . Devil May Cry 4 is the first 
 entry of the series on the current generation of consoles and Capcom decides to change the script 
 with Dante taking a back seat for newcomer Nero, a boy with the Devil Bringer on his left hand 
 and a little more serious version of Dante, but maintains some similarity for personality. While 
 Nero is a great addition to the series, the usual flaws that plagued the series from total perfection 
 are still in DMC4 such as repetitive gameplay, backtracking, and bad camera angles at certain spots. 
 Despite those flaws, Devil May Cry 4 is still as fun as the first and third game especially for 
 fans of the series as well as newcomers who never experienced the previous games last generation.
 
  
  The story of Devil May Cry 4 is your typical blockbuster summer movie and similar to previous games 
 with predictable plot twists and a love angle between Nero and Kyrie. At the beginning of the game, 
 Dante seems like the bad guy of all of this, but as you progress, he is still the same old Dante 
 and the bad guy is someone else which I won't spoil here. The supporting cast is not as much as 
 importance compared to the stars of the game, with Credo, Kyrie's brother, being the captain of 
 the Order of the Sword, Angus, some research scientist for the Order, Gloria, some assassin, and 
 Dante's female buddies, Trish and Lady, which are just there as cameo appearances and nothing else. 
 What makes the Devil May Cry games cool is the gameplay as a whole. While Dante takes a back seat 
 till the second half of the game, Nero is not that bad of a character to control in a DMC game. 
 He is definitely better than previous non-Dante characters in previous games like Vergil from DMC3 
 and Lucia from DMC2 since he is actually the main character of the game. Like Dante, Nero has a 
 sword, the Red Queen, and a gun, Blue Rose. The Red Queen has its own special ability being able 
 to rev it up for more power, but experienced players will be able to use that to their advantage 
 compared to casual players. The Blue Rose is a double-barrel pistol and it is not as special or 
 even cool as Dante's iconic twin pistols, Ebony & Ivory. Eventually Nero will gain the ability 
 to Devil Trigger like Dante transforming him to a devil dealing more damage than normal and gains 
 health slowly in a limited time. The Devil Bringer is Nero's main weapon as it has special abilities 
 pending on enemy or boss. It is also used as a grapple type of weapon where Nero can grapple enemies 
 close to him like Scorpion's spear and also be used for platforming sections like Lost Planet and 
 Bionic Commando. Overall, Nero is not Dante, but the Devil Bringer makes a huge difference towards 
 his gameplay which makes him an unique and fun character to use.
  
  Dante, on the other hand, is the same Dante we all know and love from DMC3, but the new change 
 for him this time is being able to switch styles (which return from DMC3) on the fly compared to 
 sticking to one style, which is mapped to the d-pad buttons pending on style. For example, you 
 can play defense and parry with Royal Guard, then start a juggle combo with the Swordmaster style, 
 continue to juggle with Gunslinger, then switch back to Swordmaster to finish it off. The Trickster 
 style is also there used for evading purposes. Other than that, Dante still has his Rebellion Sword 
 to dish out damage, and his pistols and shotgun for long distance. His new toys in DMC4 are actually 
 cool and has perhaps the best weapon the series has to offer, which is a briefcase called Pandora 
 that can transform to different guns dealing massive damage in a limited time. His new melee weapons, 
 Gilgamesh and Lucifier, are welcome additions, but feel somewhat rehashed or influenced from DMC3. 
 Playing as Dante for a short time is still as fun as ever and better than Nero's experience, but 
 you can tell Capcom's design philosophy for this game focusing more on Nero.
  
  Devil May Cry 4 did fix the difficulty problem that DMC3 had with giving two different difficulties 
 to start with. Human is the easiest and recommended for newcomers while Devil Hunter is the one 
 to play with for veterans of the series, which is basically the real game. Beating the game takes 
 as long as DMC3 especially for veterans, which is 10 to 15 hours on Devil Hunter. The harder difficulties 
 is where the true challenge comes in with Son of Sparda being Hard difficulty, Dante Must Die and 
 Heaven or Hell making their return appearances, and Hell & Hell is basically a different version 
 of Heaven or Hell. That alone gives the game significant replay value being a single-player only 
 game. As mentioned earlier, you will play as Nero for about two thirds of the overall game, but 
 the switch to Dante feels awkward at first, but you'll eventually adjust in a matter of minutes.
 
  
  The bosses of Devil May Cry 4 are also another shinning moment of the game being epic battles against 
 large beasts with different strategies per boss. The only thing that is bad about them is actually 
 fighting them more than once, which is actually three times for some of them, if you mind repetition. 
 Backtracking is another returning flaw of the game with seeing the same locations at least twice 
 and at times, you can easily get lost somewhere. In addition, bad camera angles also return in 
 certain spots that causes some problems if in the middle of action especially when the camera is 
 fixed. Certain spots do allow the camera to free roam with the right stick, but the majority is 
 fixed. The puzzles and platforming sections such as the grapple points for Nero are also affected 
 by these flaws and also feel somewhat rehashed from previous games.
  
  Other mainstays of the game return like secret missions scattered throughout the game and some 
 are heavily focused towards one character earning blue orb fragments for beating them. These still 
 offer the challenge as previous games did offer. A new twist in DMC4 for buying skills is the addition 
 of Proud Souls. Proud Souls are gained pending on mission performance of being fast, stylish, and 
 finding red orbs, and become its own currency for buying skills for both Nero and Dante. You don't 
 gain red orbs after each mission like previous games, which makes gaining and finding every single 
 one of them a little more important to increase health and devil trigger meters as well as buying 
 gold orbs for continues right away from death, holy waters, and health / DT recovery items. Another 
 way to gain Proud Souls and red orbs is the Bloody Palace mode, which returns again. The new twist 
 for this mode is a time limit for beating stages, but it is gained on style bonus, no damage, and 
 more per stage. The mode ends when you run out of time or health. The Bloody Palace, just like 
 previous games, is a decent distraction from the overall game when unlocked.
  
  The graphics for Devil May Cry 4 are amazing on both Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. Sure, the PS3 
 version has the slight advantage of shorter load times due to the initial install and better textures 
 in certain spots, but the 360 version is no slouch. The load times on 360 is not that bad and long 
 as well as no slowdown at all running at a consistent framerate. There are some instances of bad 
 textures when in close and screen tearing, but that is fairly minor. The backgrounds themselves 
 look great and diverse from previous games especially with outdoor settings like the snow-filled 
 mountains and the forest, but most of the game still feels mostly indoors in some sections remind 
 of you of previous locales from previous games.
  
  The overall sound for DMC4 is pretty good and faithful to the series. The music is still the same 
 with lots of emo rock and metal when in battle, which fits the game's style. Sound effects also 
 mostly feel the same with sword and gun effects as well as when finding hidden items. Since this 
 game does feel like a summer blockbuster movie, the voice acting can be a mixed bag in terms of 
 dialogue, but it caters to the series well. Nero is being voiced by former Power Ranger Johnny 
 Yong Bosch, and he does a good job being him especially when he is mad or sarcastic. The returning 
 voice actor for Dante returns maintaining his cocky personality and somewhat cheesy dialogue. The 
 other characters are not that bad as well with predictable dialogue and more.
  
  In the end, Devil May Cry 4 does not really reinvent the wheel for the action genre, but it is 
 a still a great installment for the series with nearly the same flaws of previous games. Nero is 
 a fascinating character and welcome addition to the series both on a gameplay aspect and presentation. 
 Dante is still as cool as always despite his limited playable appearance and being the same dude 
 we know and love since 2001. It is Capcom's best looking game on this current generation of consoles 
 and definitely one of the better looking games in general too. While this game may feel like a 
 HD version of DMC to some people in terms of structure and presentation, DMC4 is still a fun time 
 and a great action game for fans of the series as well as newcomers who do not really need to play 
 the previous games to understand the story. It is about time Devil May Cry has made it to 360 and 
 PS3 and here's hoping for Capcom to continue this successful franchise.

Review:  Remember how Devil May Cry 3 was hard and kicked your caboose every which way but loose? Well, 
 welcome back! Devil May Cry 4 can be just as difficult, but the satisfaction of beating a tough 
 mission or boss is a rush.
  
  I know what everyone is thinking, "Why Nero? What about Dante?". Well don't worry, this is not 
 Metal Gear Solid 2 all over again, Dante is playable in the game, with all his styles from Devil 
 May Cry 3 along for the ride. Nero, on the other hand, is very similiar in appearence, attitude, 
 and control. Other characters from previous games make an appearence, although they don't play 
 as much of a role in the story as you would like. Lady and Trish appear in certain cutscenes throughout 
 the game, but that's it. They feel like a celebrity guest star on your favirote sitcom.
  
  The story is descent, although nothing surprising. It can be a little overdramatic at times, but 
 it fits in with the other DMC's and feels right. Graphically the game is stunning. With a stable 
 frame rate, realistic lighting, sharp textures, and awesome effects. The frame rate never drops, 
 although there are a few times where the screen will tear but it's a pretty rare occurence. Load 
 times are quick, with two seconds between areas in a level, and not much longer before cutscenes. 
 DMC 4 sounds as good as it looks with kickin' guitar riffs similiar to DMC 3, and descent voice 
 acting from Johnny Yong Bosch (Akira, Bleach, Trigun) playing the cocky Nero. Reuben Langdon, from 
 DMC 3, reprises his role as Dante as well.
  
  Devil May Cry 4 dosn't take any chances with the DMC formula, keeps it simple and adds just enough 
 to make it feel new. The newest addition to the games mechanics is Nero's Devil Arm. With this, 
 Nero can grab an enemy from afar or from the air and continue a combo, or just grab him and throw 
 him to the ground. This mechanic makes for some cool combos, with enemies flying everywhere. The 
 Devil Arm can also be used at key moments in boss battles that are extremely satasfying. Also a 
 new addition is Nero's sword, the Red Queen. The Red Queen is sword infused with an engine that 
 Nero can rev up to cause more damage. 
  
  Both the Devil Arm, and the Red Queen, along with Nero's twin barrelled revolver, the Blue Rose, 
 can be upgraded. In DMC's of past, you spent red orbs to purchase new combos and upgrades. Not 
 so in DMC 4, now after each mission you are awarded Proud Souls, which instead can be used to purchase 
 combos and new abilities. Red orbs are still used, but only for items such as vital stars and blue 
 orbs. Where the Proud Souls are different is they can be exchanged at anytime, before a mission 
 or at Divinity Statues within missions. Don't like a combo you just bought? No problem, refund 
 and get a new one. This makes it less frustrating than saving red orbs only to get a combo that 
 dosn't fit your play style.
  
  All of this makes DMC 4 a fun and hard experience, but it can be reptitive due to recycling of 
 levels and bosses. This playing of old levels dont make them any different. The bosses even have 
 the same patterns and attacks. The leves are changed up with some different routes and harder enemies, 
 but it feels lazy.
  
  Devil May Cry 4 won't change anyone's mind who didn't understand why people like the series, but 
 for those who do, they know what to expect and will enjoy every bit of it. 
  
  Also, there is a Collector's Edition for $80. This set includes a case that can be reversed in 
 the sleeve to display Dante or Nero on the front cover. Also included are 2 DVD's. One with the 
 first four episodes from the Devil May Cry anime series, along with some extras from the game. 
 The other is a "Making Of" and includes an interview, along with an art gallery and some PC exclusive 
 content such as songs from the game's soundtrack. If your a huge fan of the series and still pop 
 in previous games from the series for old time's sake then yes, get the collectors edition.

Review:  The first DMC was a truly exciting step forward for action games. It brought new levels of atmosphere, 
 presentation, attitude, and style to the action genre. In DMC4, the only single thing "next gen" 
 about this game are the visuals, and even then some repetative level designs make things look boring 
 as well. 
  
  DMC4 has really good gameplay, but the enemies aren't fast nor varied enough to become really unpredictable 
 and the bossfights aren't as epic as their size would have one think. The level becomes really 
 repetative and the backtracking is flat out a slap in the face to DMC fans. 
  
  My biggest gripe is that the game keeps getting more and more cheesy to the point of it feeling 
 like teenage mutant ninja turtles, in terms of dialogue and attitude. I can picture the TMNT saying 
 half the lines in the game. I know it's all tounge 'n cheek, but it still grows tired hearing lame 
 cocky one liners that sound like they belong in a really bad 80's action movie. 
  
  The gameplay is fun and challenging, but not nearly varied enough w/ a huge lack of truly dynamic 
 enemies to face along the way. It's a fun and tough action game for those who love the series, 
 but fans of games like Ninja Gaiden and God of War will be letdown by this game's many flaws and 
 shortcuts. 
  
  I'm still waiting for a return to form that will remind me of what made the first game so special. 
 Everything since has been leaving a much more shallow impression. The game is fun, but it's just 
 that, a fun action game. It has nothing special that puts it up there w/ the likes of Ninja Gaiden 
 and God of War, or the first DMC for that matter.

Review:  The Camera angles are strange and awkward to say the least. Half the time you can change you camera 
 view and the other half it put you in some weird angle and you can't turn anything. This game was 
 released way too soon. I don't even think the developers even played this game or they surely wouldn't 
 have released a game with so many flaws.
  The enemies are way too easy to kill. I don't even think they even fight back. Some of the bosses 
 seem to fight back but it isn't all that entertaining to say the least. Now understand I"ve only 
 played thru the first two missions and about 4 hours worth of play. Maybe this game is tailored 
 more for people who've previous played the game, which I haven't played any prior versions of DMC. 
 I'm finding the whole concept of play very strange and not very exciting. I'm playing on the easy 
 level and maybe I need to play on a harder level but easy should be a little more challenging.

Review:  Wow! Thats all I can say about this game. It looks great, it plays great, framerate never drops, 
 and the cinematics are amazing!
  
  The main appeal to this game is that almost anybody can start playing this game and have a blast. 
 After enduring all the first person shooters for months, the XBOX 360 finally has a masterpiece 
 action game. 
  
  DMC4 is all about style. I've never played a stylistic action shooter such as this, probably because 
 it doesn't exist. The cinematics (cutscenes) are top notch and give you small breaks to further 
 the story and plot. There are many of them as well.
  
  While there's not much variety of enemies between boss battles, it pulls it off nicely because 
 the boss battles are so satisfying. From snake-like creatures to a HUGE statue-type boss, each 
 boss battle is different and requires different tactics. Some boss battles can take you quite awhile 
 as well, but they are not too difficult so you get frustrated.
  
  If you are new to action games, the easiest setting is a breeze and gives you a feel of how to 
 work things. You can also unlock harder settings which you will probably do to give you more bang 
 for your buck and for a harder challenge.
  
  One problem I did have with this game is the map function and not being able to tell which direction 
 to go. Some people will not knowingly walk to the beginning of another stage when the door you 
 have to go through is right next to you. I got lost plenty of times and it does get frustrating. 
 Also camera function while going through certain hallways will actually confuse you because the 
 controls get reversed when it switches angles.
  
  I haven't played DMC since the first one, but I have to applaud CAPCOM for porting over one of 
 their best franchises to XBOX. Good call since they will sell more.
  
  All I can say is this game was fun from the first time a put it in, with awesome gameplay, great 
 story, cool cinematics, and the coolest characters ever created, I would highly recommend this 
 game.

Review:  This is the first game in the series that I have played but needless to say I am a little impressed. 
 Graphically it's beautiful. Story so far is great. I like Nero and want ot know more about Dante. 
 The cutscenes are great.
  
  However I have noticed a couple of thigns that take away from the game. The first is the fact that 
 melee combat is essentially broken down into hittign the same button repeatedly in combination 
 with only one or two buttons. Although some of the moves look cool, it seems a little too repetitive 
 and takes away from the game. Also there is, from what I have seen so far, there are only a couple 
 of weapons, one of which at this time seems a little underpowered; though I will admit that once 
 I get more into the game that this may change.
  
  If you can overlook these two things, the game is a good buy or rent. I've enjoyed playing it so 
 far.

Review:  I had never played a Devil May Cry game, but the moment I played the demo, I was like wow im definitely 
 going to buy this.
  
  The Visual / Graphics in this game look pretty fuken nice. The gameplay is very entertaining. I 
 dont know much about the storyline of the DMC games but you dont need to really know it to play 
 it as long as its fun and looks nice.
  
  I like how you can guy new abilities for your weapons so you dont do the same attacks thoughout 
 the whole game....
  
  Since I never played the previous DMC games with Dante I dont know the difference between him and 
 the new character in the game, I dont really care even though I have heard Dante is badass.
  
  Overall its a really fun game, visuals are amazing, I would recommend it to anybody who would 
 enjoy slashing a bunch of bad guys with a huge sword and battle huge ass beasts 10 times your size.

Review:  I started playing this game and I loved it! I love the very simple gameplay and the graphics in 
 the game are stunning. The characters in the game are very lifelike, when I played the game I thought 
 I was looking at real people and real scenarios. The battles in the game are amazing and the boss 
 battles are amazing the first fight with Dante is nothing compared to the other bosses in the game. 
 The combos are very satisfying and do a lot of damage. The only weapon not worth using is the gun 
 because you have to fire off at least 20 shots to kill a single enemy. Nero's Devil Arm is a very 
 good weapon usually killing an enemy in a single attack. The sword is very cool because you can 
 rev it up to do more damage. The cutscenes look good and when there is an action scene the battle 
 choreography is just awesome and its something the movie studios should take a look at. Me being 
 new to the Devil May Cry franchise I thought I would have no idea what I was doing in the game 
 but the tutorial in the game really helped me out and will help out anyone else in the game. There 
 are a few problems though, first of all the camera can suck at times and sometimes when you are 
 in heavy combat the game will slow down. You probobly won't even notice it but I did and its not 
 that big of a deal. There are some little problems but nothing enough to keep this game from being 
 one of mny great games in 2008.

Review:  To be fair, I've never been a Devil May Cry fan, and to be fair, I was raised on PC gaming (read: 
 plodding point-and-click adventures, massive scale but also plodding RPGs) . 
  
  However, despite what really are fantastic visuals, I think DMC4 is the game for me that has tipped 
 the balance on the "new gen" console games. No longer are gorgeous 3d renders within cinematics, 
 and vivid, detailed character animations going to make a mediocre game great. Basically every game 
 short of downloadable titles (e. g. XBLA and PSN) for these new consoles look and sound great. If 
 you've played Heavenly Sword, Ninety-Nine Nights (N3) , any previous Devil may Cry games, Ninja 
 Gaiden, Bladestorm, Kingdom Under Fire Circle of Doom, etc. etc. then you're probably OK missing 
 this one or waiting for it to come down in price.
  
  The Good:
  1. Very well done visuals and sound
  2. Intense combat, particularly in boss battles
  3. Well-polished 
 -- frame rate (played on the 360) was always very good, and the controls are solid. Combat pace 
 is generally well balanced -- not too hard, not too easy.
  
  The Bad:
  1. Very traditional formula -- endless baddies followed by long and tedious boss battles, very 
 basic storyline.
  2. Main character's bravado/machismo comes off as cheesy.
  3. Nothing new to offer over the gazillion other games of this type.

Review:  i have to say that no one, i mean no one can stand up against Dante just Virgil, his own brother. that 
 was what that DMC was learning us, but suddenly a young boy came and even beat Dante ,i think cap-com 
 is destroying everything that earns in these years.
  I accept that the game play was awesome but there are laws in any games that must not be broken 
 but when u broke them u have to face many things, like what happens in DMC 4, many players focus 
 on the game play and im sure they are not agree with me but i'm sure there are some gamers agree 
 with me. I think these kind of games like DMC or POP have some respect and any one even the producers 
 must not beak them because the game is up because of the respect , because gamers love these respect 
 , loves to respect Dante as a Hero and even his own brother cant stand up against him , this is 
 the respect of these game , but me and my friends are not agree with destroying this respect with 
 a young boy that are not even deserves to be a new DMC hero.
  
  Thanks for your time.

Review:  a stylish game must has stylish ideas behind it; a top game must has top shapes in it; a great story 
 must has un-for-e-seen-able challenges in story-lines; in this game we have them all, but you and 
 me as a gamer want more;
  why?
  from the first demos and screen-shots i understand that we have a great game coming to us; new character, new 
 styles, new story, new gameplay and new engin for the game; anything else?
  we want a hot game in this cold winter; and we receive it;
  GRAPHIC: it is beautiful and perfect 
 but not the best; we except more; no bad shapes, no buges, no ugly thing in anywhere but in this generation 
 we wnat excelent and the best; and it is not that one; and in the other hand;
  huge levels with a demonish design and barok style; every building has it's own map in design and 
 you so not find two same things in this game alike; in details they are defferent; charaters models 
 and thems are perfect; in every scene you face with a huge environments in around; fantastics views 
 with a long range draw distance help you to eat the game; sometimes you feel that you are watching 
 a movie beside a game but something mention you this is not; and that is the effect of the weapons; they 
 are not as the same as the other elements; they are like the previous gener effects; textures are 
 so amazing; and the layers use in right places;
  GAMEPLAY: in this serie, gameplay is the flag; it was the best in past and it is the best now; easy 
 control with easy moves can manage fatal styles with deadly enemies; handling the characters are 
 so smooth, you can move in the direction that you want in the right time that you want; counter-attacks 
 are under your control and fast moves are so slow to you to perform; buttomes are so reflexable 
 to your actions and touch; jumps, rolls, back attacks, forwards attacks, combos and more are in the 
 service of the gamers and the game; fights are so stylish, because your enemies are smart as you 
 and know the style in the fights; boss-fight are so amazing; boss do not let you to breath;
  AI: when an enemy feel your style of fighting and disguise it, what is your answer to level of his/her 
 IQ? when you attack, the enemies do not look you like a stone to hit them, they hit you hard if they 
 can moves fast like you; the greater enemies will eat you in a second; the way that they block your 
 attacks and then they face you to a deadly counter-attack is so perfect and is like a real fight;
 
  in the end i must say that you must play this game if you want experience a top game;

Review:  I never played a Devil May Cry series. So after I saw the trailer, I couldnt wait for Devil May 
 Cry 4. The action sequences in the trailer were breathtaking. The final game sure lives up to the 
 hype and is pretty much what u expect it to be. This game is simply AWSM. The fighting actions 
 are jaw-dropping. Having the blend between sword, gun and spacial power ensures a crazy number 
 of combos. You can also buy and upgrade new combos. The story is great with great cutscenes. Graphics 
 are just what u saw in the trailer, which is A GREAT LOOKING GAME. Sounds are also satisfying. 
 Combined all this, killing enemies never felt much better. The boss battles are probobly the highlights 
 of the game as they are huge and somewhat challanging. This game isn't all about mindless button 
 mashing. There are elements where you have to solve some puzzles but they are not so challanging 
 and it is generally easy to figure them out. All in all, u'll be spending a lot of time in this 
 game cause the game is fast paced and packed with action.

Review:  So back in August i had a plan of what games i would get with the money that I had and this game 
 turned out to be the final game that I new about so it was last on my list. Ive waited for a long 
 time and heard the demo was coming out on the 25th of January and was really looking forward to 
 getting an oppion on it.
  
  I got the demo played it and i had beaten in 3 times..... and was.... pacing back and forth afterwords 
 going... that.... that wasent that great only playing 10 minutes then getting to a boss then took 
 mabey 5 minutes to beat.... with not many combos or any idea of what your doing?
  
  Frankly I said to myselfwhat will i do...." and now im at this point playing the game half way 
 through and say to myself.... never will I let a demo control my actions on what game to get again 
 I got this game after school and Immediatly i found greatness and suprise.
  
  I will start of with the story of this game, SO there is now a cult that is worshiping the god 
 sparda (i call it a cult well..... people praying) who just happened to be Dante's father, Dante 
 comes in wrecks up the place kills their leader and now the new character (who is in fact Ichigo 
 Kurosaki's voice) Nero comes in going..... too bad for you buddy BOOM climatic event already.
  
  So this is basically a revenge story (until mabey later on in the game no spoilers i try my 
 best) where you are now ordered to go out and kill Dante which... is a hell of alot of fun especially 
 when you fight him, a few characters from the other DMC will also be reapearring in this game the 
 most of them all to me is Lady with the huge Bazzoka who was back in DMC3.
  
  Now on to the gameplay, as i said through the demo I was Sceptacal wether the gameplay would be 
 better with more combos... and yea it is alot better probably the best part about this game is infact 
 using a combo to cut some dude to shreds, the combos are really really deep and thought forward 
 especially when you get to the part where you get to play as Dante and be able to switch between 
 5 diffrent fighting styles ( with some no hella cool new moves) .
  
  Their are also two diffculty setting one easy and one hard, now by chosing one of these difficulties 
 your basicaly sighning a contract that states i will play the game through this difficulty or have 
 to start over a new game because is to easy or too hard its really up to you.
  
  On Nero's side he has a demonic power controlling his arm or in better words the Devil Bringer. 
 You use this to grab eneimes from afar then slamming them into the ground as well as using it in 
 some combos which make things alot more bloody... use also use his arm to latch on to these floating 
 blue orbs in the air which are later used for puzzles which are really just like..... meh....
  
  This does not mean that his weapon Red Queen and his gun Blue Rose are complete push overs 
 no no no..... his motorcycle sword is definetly a cool new weapon to the game since you are allowed 
 to charge up the swords attacks and create a diffrent set of combos which is absoloutly playing 
 but when it comes to diffrent styles of fighting he only has his new arm.
  
  The bosses in this game are truly marvelous that will make you use diffrent combos and tactics 
 each time you face them the only problem that i found is that the same boss will appear over and 
 over to you again but hey.... nothing like showing a old dog new tricks.... by that i mean beating 
 him down again and kicking him back into a fierry hell.
  
  There is also if i should mention some puzzles that are in the game that have to do with like hitting 
 this huge thing that floats in the air around or to changing diffrent areas or slowing down time.... to 
 me i got this game to see cool characters fight and to see sweet anime cutscenes then be able to 
 fight my counterpart thank you very much... As well as the camera giving you a couple of difficulties 
 but nothing major
  
  Through the game you will also encounter secret missions as well which are for the more experienced 
 players on experiece i learned ill play the game a couple of times first.... these are hard and 
 diverse but allow you to just hack through eneimes over again.
  
  The Graphics are absouloutly some of the best i have seen on the 360 (i have looked at the PS3 
 and they are almost identical... except for the shadows from the light through like trees) as much 
 as you want to kill that enemy just stare at him for 3 seconds and think.... what if..... awww screw 
 it lets just slice him to pieces and looking at his body later if it hasent dissapered.
  
  The Cutscences in this game are.... ahhh.... look at the pretty blood.... but really ive been playing 
 this game non stop and DMC4 could show a thing or two too Naruto and show them how really anime 
 should be presented.
  
  The controls are also great as well allowing you to move with grace and almost feel like your sliding 
 around the area or jumping down to a near by building or putting a nicely red blade into someones 
 stomach.... yep... these are what controls should do.... stab people with big red swords... THIS dosent 
 mean that they are all great it is sometimes frustrating to keep trying to jump to his ledge over 
 and over again.
  
  Now for the sound and music (which people think is terrible but i say NAYYYYY) the sound in this 
 game is great you can hear your sword swinning and slash and been thrown pretty sweet as well as 
 your gun firing off countless bullets over and over again and dropping to the ground as well as 
 blood splatering on the ground. The music that starts when you enter combat is this hardcore metal 
 kind of music which... to me.... is sweet.... I might hear it over and over again but it continues 
 to get me pumped up.
  
  Overall as i said at the top THE DEMO IS NOT A TRUE REPRESENATION OF THE GAME. Thus game MUST be 
 played by any DMC4 fan or even someone off starting the series.... or for someone who just wants 
 to get some hack and slash action in. The point is just because a demo might suck.... dosent mean 
 that a game can still truly stand out... and be amazing..
  
  (P. S Critics.... stop giving this game a hard time... jesus christ... lighten up and just play the 
 game and have fun not for who your working for)

Review:  Too many people just hated the idea of changing the great Demon Genocider Dante, but Nero its jut 
 a step behind and yet getting closer and closer.
  
  With the demo i just realize of some stuff, but now that the game is on i can ensure the following 
 things:
  
  First: The soundtrack fits perfectly with the game and it makes it a Terrific game even more.
 
  
  The graphics are just amazing, the buildings, the streets, the characters, this is a strong proof 
 of the Xbox 360 capacity.
  
  The gameplay is what we needed; swinging a sword and shooting at same time with some cool grabs 
 from your demonic hand? You want more!?
  
  Well it has some of the best boss fights you'll ever have and a great arsenal to eliminate with 
 alot of SSSTYLE.
  
  If your thinking about a February good release for the 360 that you have to have, be sure that 
 this is the one, it worths every single cent you'll spend in it.
  
  So Good Luck and choose well
  =)

Review:  DMC4 is probably one of the biggest exclusive losses for the PS3, but Capcom knows that it benefits 
 more people than it hurts (along with puts more money into their pocket.) 
  
  Incase you've never played a DMC game before, 4 is actually a sequel to 2. This is due to 3 being 
 a prequel. Rather than following everyone's favorite over the top, cheesy, half demon badass Dante, 
 DMC4 follows the story of Nero who... for some reason looks almost exactly like Dante. 
  
  In the beginning of the game, you're Nero watching your childhood friend Kyrie singing at a festival 
 for the secret society/cult that worships the demon Sparda (coincidentally Dante and Vergil's father.) 
 Its then when Dante busts in and massacres a bunch of people, in the chaos Nero eventually faces 
 Dante with one of his arms in a sling. During the fight Nero eventually reveals his arm to be the 
 Devil Bringer a demonic arm that beats the crap out of Dante. Dante eventually retreats leaving 
 Nero with a cryptic message about them being similar. The rest of the story is Nero being ordered 
 to find and kill Dante, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out that Dante isn't the real enemy.
 
  
  The Devil Bringer is one of the biggest gameplay additions to the game being that for the gun and 
 sword play, Nero plays somewhat like Dante. The Devil Bringer allows you to grab enemies while 
 you're in the air or grab them from the air, then swing them around, throw them, and slam them 
 down to the ground. This just adds a third element to your combos which will allow for some spectacular 
 combos all involving swords, guns, and throws. 
  
  The gameplay can get a little complicated at some points, this is due mostly to the exceed system 
 on Nero's sword. By pulling the left trigger at a certain time you will have the ability to power 
 up your strikes making for more devastating combos. To a novice of the series, its pretty hard 
 to figure this out and master it, and it is really one of those things you need to master or you 
 will just not use it at all.
  
  While Nero is the main character of the game, you will eventually play as Dante, and the bad thing 
 about that is, while playing as Dante is awesome, its far into the game so by the time you get 
 to play as Dante, its about half to 2/3s into the game. And while Dante doesn't have the Devil 
 Bringer, he has many of his attack patterns from DMC3 are present along with some ridiculous weapons 
 to use which are just awesome additions to the game. 
  
  I really think Capcoms MT Framework engine is really underrated. Dead Rising and Lost Planet both 
 were awesome looking games, and DMC4 is no exception. The graphics are superb and run at a constant 
 60fps no mater how quick the action. The only bad thing is the shadows. there are some weird jaggine 
 shadows at some point that just look bad and distracting. Other than that there is nothing bad 
 I can say about the graphics.
  
  The cinematic in the game are also something to be praised. The fight scenes are well edited and 
 choreographed and over all they just have a very movie like theme. The best part in these are Dante's 
 over the top one liners which for some reason some people don't like. Thats part of Dante's badassness 
 just because he's such a badass that he can give stupid one liners and pull them off. Nero on the 
 other hand... no. It really at some times just seems like Capcom really had no intent on trying 
 to make Nero any different than Dante, Nero will at some points try and spit out the lines, but 
 it just doesn't work.
  
  Another little gripe I have with the game is the fixed camera angles. This is what shows that Devil 
 May Cry was originally an aborted Resident Evil game. Resident Evil left fixed camera angles behind 
 in the 4th game, but sadly DMC4 doesn't. This just leaves things to be very awkward when you change 
 from screen to screen. it doesn't really effect the game that much but, its just a very old way 
 of doing things that just needs to be fixed.
  
  In the end, I was debating if I should give the game an 8.5 or 9. Because while DMC is an awesome 
 series, theres nothing completely new and theres a lack of Dante in this game... But I did decide 
 to go with a 9 because of this: the game is REALLY fun to play and thats that. At no point while 
 playing did I find myself disappointed with the gameplay, so if you're a fan of DMC or action games 
 like Ninja Gaiden, pick up DMC4, you won't be sorry. And if you're one of those ignorant Xbox 360 
 fans who won't pick up DMC4 because you like Ninja Gaiden, for gods sake, don't be that dumb.
 
  
  Collectors Edition Note: If you are a fan of Devil May Cry, I'm going to have to say that the Collectors 
 Edition is worth it, even though its $10 more than usual collectors editions. With this you will 
 get the first volume of the Devil May Cry anime (four episodes) which is a REALLY good anime, and 
 a DVD with the making of DMC4, wallpapers, icons, music, screen savers, and a digital artbook. 
 So over all, I'd say its a good deal.

Review:  Devil May Cry 4 offers alot new control schemes for new and vetran players alike I will break down 
 the game in all the aspects right now
  
  
  Graphics: 10/10 -- if anyone has SEEN DMC4's graphics you will know it is hard to trump it DMC4 
 offers so much realizim that its hard to distiguish real from fake all to the movments all the 
 way to the dialouge truely amazing graphic layout
  
  Sound: 10/10 -- What can I say? When playing I DMC game you can expect a REALLY good soundtrack 
 and some sweet dialouge and DMC4 does not dissapoint through the opening theme "The Angel speaks 
 and the Devil cries" all the way to the closing statement of the credits you will not be disapointed 
 with this games sound
  
  Story: 10/10 -- The story acually HAS a story wich is good DMC4 puts you as Nero and you need to 
 comba against Dante and in the end find out who is wrong and who is right
  
  Controls: 10/10 -- For those who have been really used to DMC on the PS2 will notice the 360's 
 layout is not different AT ALL But more about Nero's controls. With the unique Devil Bringer to 
 the Rev Up ability you can get a SSS easily against all the demon baddies of the demonic world
 
  
  all and al DMC4 will rock your world I strongly suggest that hardcore Microsoft fans give this 
 game a shot and say to themeselves "wow I've been missing out." This game is the BEST IN THE SERIES!!!!!!! 
 Untill next reveiw by DV

Review:  At first I should say I waited for this game for nearly 2 years because I was one of the biggest 
 fan of devil may cry series .my major concern was about XBOX 360 version but after finishing the 
 game I understood that this game is even better on XBOX 360 due to Achievement system. Does this 
 game worth your time and waiting ? the answer is a loud YES , YES ,YES. The first stunning aspect 
 of DMC4 is its visuals . 
  The CAPCOM ENGINE which is the same engine used for lost planet and upcoming Resident Evil 5 is 
 under the hood and it is really neat . the texture are really good the lighting is superb and the 
 environment is so detailed .the character ,s models are really great every character is detailed 
 specially the screen filling gigantic monsters and bosses are really good and barley any game had 
 them before. the game consist of 18 so levels and you will see from snowy mountains and huge castles 
 to sunny streets and beautiful forests ( the forest in DMC4 is visually the best forest in a video 
 game after crysis) . unlike the last games in this series DMC4 is extremely huge and most of the 
 time you play in out door areas . the game looks very gorgeous both in standard TV and HD- TV . 
 this game is fast paced game so if you loose one second then you will get hit so you must act like 
 a hero and for that gamers need a solid frame rate . fortunately the game run smoothly at 60 FPS 
 all the time no matter you are fighting with a huge boss with lots of stunning fire effects or 
 a large arena with dozens of enemies . there are loading times in 360 version but there are not 
 a lot of them an also they are not too long . the music and sounds are awesome and voice over is 
 so good. You may ask what about controlling and there is the answer it is not viva so the control 
 may seem a bit complex in the first few hours but the great tutorial system is with you and you 
 will definitely learn the whole controlling in less than 2 hours .there are lots of boss fight 
 in this game (also the best and purest parts of the game ) and you will find your self enjoining 
 boss fights so much .
  remember "SO MUCH" .
  For XBOX 360 (X) is shooting with gun (Y) is for sword attacking (B) is devil bringer (A) is jump 
 and maneuver (RB) is locking and maneuvering (LB) is for turning into a powerful demonic mode (LT) 
 is for powering up your sword and so on .unlike the other XBOX 360 games you wont use game pad 
 triggers so much and the control is very similar to PS3 version . it is definitely the best possible 
 control and it is okay . You can do many artistic attacks and movements during the game play (also 
 if you press back button you can act a funny stuff such as bowing to your enemy or inviting him 
 to battle you and many thing else.)
  The game is full of SUPERB BEAUTIFULL STYLISH cut scenes from start to end . this time the story 
 is more than just haunting demons and there are some romance and love story involved . a religious 
 organization known as "order of the sword" worships sparda and NERO is one of them but he is not 
 a monk he is a young warrior and protect the order and his beloved girl but the story is more than 
 good versus bad 
  [expect surprise] and there is a relation between NERO and DANTE (both playable both crazy for 
 demon haunting both are interested in girls !!!!) .there are many surprise but unfortunately I 
 do not want to spoil it but just so you know THE LAST BOSS is a big surprise. The game is long 
 enough in comparison with the other action games. 
  Time of finishing is totally depends on difficulty and the player itself . if you play the game 
 on the easiest difficulty and would not care about gaining orbs or finding secret missions or searching 
 the beautiful environments and you are good at finding ways without confusing you may finish the 
 game in 8-9 hours but if you want to take advantage of the game you may finish the game in 20 or 
 so hours . the puzzles are a big part in this game and a bit harder than before but not frustrating 
 .it is mostly about finding a magical stuff or using devil bringer and so on. I finished the game 
 once and I do not know whether there is another ending or not but I am fairly sure that the game 
 is liner but totally cinematic . you can find the most professional motion capture in this game 
 and you feel the characters are alive. There is not lots of blood in the game but there are some 
 in cut scenes and also there is little amount of sexual content in the game but it is suitable 
 for teens and is a must play game for every action gamer . DEVIL MAY CRY 4 is the first big game 
 of 2008 and we started this glory year with lots of fun .
