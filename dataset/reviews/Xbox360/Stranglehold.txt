:::Review:::
For as long as it lasts, Stranglehold delivers a satisfying, if somewhat derivative action game 
 experience. 

  It would be very easy for the average person to take one look at Stranglehold and write it off 
 as a Max Payne rip-off. That's because, in a sort of round about way, it is. Midway and John Woo's 
 video game sequel to the director's classic Hong Kong action flick  Hard Boiled  borrows very liberally 
 from the mechanics of Remedy's slow-motion, heavy-action franchise, which is a little ironic and 
 mind-bending because Max Payne was itself a tribute to John Woo's brand of cinematic action. Regardless, 
 if you're going to make a game based on a badass cop dodging, diving, and shooting all over the 
 place in slow-motion, there are certainly worse places to look for inspiration. Stranglehold effectively 
 takes the elements that made Max Payne fun and uses them to its own advantage, while sprinkling 
 in a number of original touches and gimmicks that give the game its own Hong Kong cinema flavor. 
 It's an interesting piece of work that's more fun than it isn't, and fans of  Hard Boiled  ought 
 to especially enjoy watching Chow Yun-Fat reprise his role as Inspector Tequila.  

           Oh, dude, your face...      

  Stranglehold takes place many years after  Hard Boiled 
 , though Yun-Fat's Inspector Tequila doesn't seem to have lost a step. He's still a rogue cop on 
 the Hong Kong police force, and when a member of the force turns up dead, evidently offed by one 
 of HK's major gangs, Tequila steps up to deal with the situation. What follows is a sometimes confusing 
 and ham-fisted story of gangs double- and triple-crossing one another. Somewhere in there, Tequila's 
 former girlfriend and daughter both end up being held hostage by one of the gangs. It's a decent 
 crime tale that's certainly better than much of John Woo's American work (though exactly how involved 
 Woo was in this game's production is debatable) , but there is still something about the whole story 
 that feels very Hollywood. It lacks the gritty feel of the original flick, and a lot of the film's 
 cool factor to boot. Nevertheless, the plot serves as an OK-enough motivation to get Tequila back 
 in action and shooting people in the face -- and really, that's pretty much all you need.  

  You will shoot a lot of people in Stranglehold. This game's body count is pretty staggering for 
 a game that runs only about six or seven hours. Enemies come flying out of every nook and cranny 
 of each stage, and always with guns blazing. Fortunately, they don't have the ability to jump and 
 dive around in bullet time like our man Tequila. Though the game refers to it as "Tequila Time," 
 this is really just the bullet-time mechanic from Max Payne given a fancy makeover. The one trick 
 is that you won't ever go into bullet-time automatically as a result of diving around, unless you 
 specifically have an enemy in your targeting reticle sights. There is also a specific button that 
 puts you into bullet-time completely separate from the shoot dodging, though it's rare when you 
 ever need to use it.  

  That's not the only ability he's got, either. Tequila can interact with practically every piece 
 of scenery in a level. If you run up to a table, you can choose to slide right over it, or kick 
 it over and use it as a temporary cover point. If you run up to a wall, you can dash up it and 
 dive even further than usual. If there's a rail nearby, you can run up or slide down it. See a 
 little wheel cart sitting around? You can jump onto it and roll around the area, blasting everyone 
 silly. Pieces of the environment can also be shot or otherwise destroyed for both fun and efficiency. 
 If an enemy is standing underneath a neon sign, shoot it and watch the sucker get crushed. Exploding 
 barrels are all over the place, and you can imagine the havoc they wreak when shot. There are even 
 occasional environmental puzzles that require wooden poles or planks to be shot out to create new 
 pathways for Tequila to traverse. These are arguably the game's weakest links, in that they're 
 often difficult to discern and sometimes take more shots than they ought to actually work. Fortunately, 
 about halfway through the game, the developers apparently decided to just give up on these distractions 
 and focus almost exclusively on the shooting.  

  There's even more on offer. Pulling off stylish moves throughout the game fills up a meter that 
 lets you trigger one of four different "Tequila bombs." These are special abilities that do everything 
 from recharging your health, to letting you spin around like a gun-toting whirling dervish, killing 
 all the enemies that surround you, all while doves go fluttering off into the sky (what would a 
 Woo production be without doves?) . These special abilities are all useful, though some more so 
 than others. One example is the accurate-shot ability, which lets you move a targeting reticle 
 in slo-mo to any part of an enemy's body, and then watch the bullet fly directly to its target. 
 Save for a few enemies who are especially vulnerable to this move, it's hard to ever really want 
 to use it when the next ability up the scale is an all-out barrage of invincibility and limitless 
 gunfire that usually lasts long enough to clear the room.  

  The last element of gameplay isn't so much an ability as it is a sort of minigame. Periodically, 
 Tequila will run into a group of enemies and end up in a standoff. These standoffs quickly snap 
 Tequila's focus around from one enemy to the next. Using both analog sticks on the controller, 
 you have to simultaneously dodge enemy gunfire and move a targeting reticle over enemies to take 
 them out one by one. It's tough to do, though once you get the hang of it, it's also quite amusing 
 to watch Tequila dart from enemy to enemy while dodging bullets and unleashing hot-leaded hits 
 of his own. Granted, it's a silly contrivance to have only one enemy at a time firing at you; if 
 there are five guys, why don't they all shoot at once? But it  is  pretty fun, so it's a forgivable 
 contrivance.  

  You can't quite call Stranglehold a one-trick pony, given that it does have a few different things 
 going on at all times. However, all those things are fed directly into the act of shooting people -- and 
 shooting them often, to boot. Accordingly, it's good that the guns are appropriately satisfying 
 to shoot. There's nothing remotely realistic about the game's guns, mind you, though that's arguably 
 a good thing in the context of this game. Being able to shoot a guy from a hundred feet away with 
 a shotgun and still take him out is helpful when you've got dozens of heavily armed enemies running 
 around. Apart from that, you've got Tequila's default pair of pistols, along with assault rifles, 
 submachine guns, heavy machine guns, grenades, and even the occasional rocket launcher to play 
 around with. Each gun has its own strengths and weaknesses in power and accuracy, though they rarely 
 matter much. You get to carry only two types of guns at once, and normally you'll want the gun 
 that will do the most damage at all times.  

           Standoffs are kind of awesome, in a contrived sort of way.      

  By no means is Stranglehold 
 an overly challenging game, but by the time you hit the third or fourth level, you'll see a noticeable 
 jump in difficulty. That's a good thing, because the early portions of the game are a bit of a 
 cakewalk at times, even while you're still feeling out all your different abilities. Once you get 
 past the point where the difficulty gears up, you'll actually have to use those different abilities 
 smartly to survive some sequences. Cover points are also helpful, though you can rarely stay in 
 one place for very long, as the environment around you tends to get destroyed very quickly. Likewise, 
 enemies are usually smart enough to run up and start shooting if you stay in one place for too 
 long. The Tequila bombs become a lifesaver in a few situations, though they also tend to make a 
 few of the boss fights overly easy. Turning the game up to the hard difficulty level fixes that 
 some, though not entirely.  

  As helpful as some of these abilities become later in the game, they're not entirely required. 
 In fact, for much of the game, you can get away with just diving around like a crazy person over 
 and over again, periodically ducking for cover for a second or two, and busting out with the occasional 
 Tequila bomb for good measure. In a sense, it makes the gameplay a foregone conclusion. It's not 
 that the gameplay isn't fun, because it is. But it's not so dynamic and over-the-top that you won't 
 ever find yourself bored due to repetition. It's enjoyable to shoot enemies and blast apart the 
 environment in the process, but when you end up doing it the same way over and over and over again, 
 you'll be ready to move on and hope something new comes up. It rarely does. Little of what Stranglehold 
 does ever feels like it operates outside of expected boundaries, and the few things that are original 
 aren't necessarily amazing enough to hold up the entire game. Again, the gameplay is solid and 
 even thrilling in spots, but it's probably not a bad thing that the game only lasts for a half-dozen 
 hours or so. It might have gotten stale beyond that length.  

  Apart from the short single-player campaign, there are some production bonuses to buy through an 
 extras shop (John Woo himself sits behind the counter) , and a multiplayer mode that's probably 
 not going to garner much attention. It's not that it's completely awful or anything, but it feels 
 very tacked-on. You can only engage in standard deathmatches or team deathmatches with up to six 
 players. Though the multiplayer plays a lot like the single-player game, it's not nearly as good. 
 Maps are a little on the condensed side, and though you can use the slow-motion mechanic in multiplayer, 
 its scattered execution in this mode makes it all but worthless. Essentially, it seems like you 
 can't go into slo-mo unless you and your opponents all have a full Tequila time meter. At that 
 point it becomes pointless to fumble around with it when you could just be focusing on shooting 
 someone, and it almost makes things even more distracting when it suddenly pops on. With limited 
 play modes and inconsistent, cramped gameplay, this isn't a multiplayer game to get excited about. 

  Stranglehold's presentation is mostly good, though it's not without blemishes. By far the most 
 impressive aspect of the game visually is the environments, and specifically how awesome it is 
 to watch them get completely destroyed. Whether you're in a gaudy Hong Kong casino, a lavish penthouse, 
 or a cold, sterile-looking history museum, it's great fun to destroy the scenery. It's really quite 
 impressive how much of every environment is destructible. It's also a boon for the gameplay, because 
 each cover point you hide behind tends to get shot to hell very quickly, which forces you to duck 
 and run. On the less positive side, character models are overly shiny and not especially detailed, 
 animations are limited, and the camera periodically gets in the way of the action when it snaps 
 to angles that are hardly beneficial to your survival. At least the game runs smoothly for the 
 most part, save for occasional hiccups when you try to swivel the camera around too quickly.  

 
           John Woo says, 'Buy my game, dammit!'      

  Audio is more consistently enjoyable. Chow Yun-Fat joins several other noted actors for the voice 
 cast. Dialogue is appropriately cheesy, especially when Tequila's boss keeps tossing out every 
 angry police-captain clich in the book. The voice acting is quite solid overall. Yun-Fat occasionally 
 dead-reads a few of his lines, but in general he sells the character as well as he can while speaking 
 English. It is sort of weird that the sequel to a classic Hong Kong action flick would be entirely 
 in English instead of Cantonese, but considering the audience, it's also not really surprising. 
 The soundtrack is a nice mix of typically bombastic orchestral pieces and some Asian-flavored string 
 sections, and the game's sound effects are mostly top-notch, from the gun sounds right on down 
 to the individual effects of bullets hitting each and every type of surface.  

  Stranglehold isn't the sort of game that's going to set the shooter genre on fire. It's a more-than-competent 
 take on an existing formula, and it has enough unique moments and overall challenge to succeed. 
 Sure, it gets repetitive at times, it's got a few design quirks, and the multiplayer is borderline 
 irrelevant. But there's enough solid, exciting action here for shooter fans to sink their teeth 
 into. It's a short ride, but an amusing one while it lasts.

Review:  Strangle hold is a nutty action game which is definitely inspired by Max Payne and is fun while 
 it lasts (10 hours or so) but after that all you can do is play the multiplayer itself which is 
 ABYSMAL.... how do i know this? well i dont because in all the months i have had this game no other 
 person in the human race is playing the multiplayer which means it must be Bad. Those of you who 
 have played the demo would also proberbly believe that the WHOLE game is packed with cool environments 
 which you can shoot and leave an enemy to surrender to his own bloody demise. Well it isnt im afraid, 
 throughout the rest of the game you may only stumble across maybe one or two fire extinguisher 
 at the most which an enemy is standing by and the sad thing is it isnt even stylish.
  
  Overall you will have a good blast on this game, stumble across a few good bosses and a variety 
 of bad guy but im afraid this game only warrants a rental.

Review:  Stranglehold is a sequel to director John Woo's Hong Kong action film Hardboiled. It's also Max 
 Payne featuring constant shooting and heavy use of bullet-time effects.
  
  Story of Stranglehold is not so great, but considering that this is a sequel to a movie it does 
 a fine job, because you don't need to know anything about the movie in order to enjoy the game. 
 You play as detective Tequila, who hunts down big criminals and of course he also has some personal 
 issues added in the mix. Story progresses through quite long and action packed cutscenes, but it's 
 still not that interesting. This is made for worse by the lack of subtitles. In a cutscene it's 
 tolerable, but in an intense firefight you really don't have the time to listen an enlightening 
 dialog between a mobster and detective Tequila. Luckily it's not the story that makes this game 
 worth playing: it's the core shooting action and Stranglehold gives you all you can handle, and 
 then some more.
  
  Graphics are colorful and somewhat detailed, but the star of the show here are those destructible 
 environments. After an intense battle your environment has usually changed quite dramatically, 
 just like in EA's Black from a few years back. Frame rate stays solid all the time so for me this 
 is enough to forgive those blocky and ugly character models. Sound design does an OK job and things 
 sound the way they should sound like, but it's not the incredible sound effects or music that you 
 will remember afterwards. One annoying thing is that the speaking of characters is usually hard 
 to hear, because there are so much other effects going on at the same time.
  
  Gameplay is a third person shooter with lots of tequila-time, which is just a fancy term for bullet 
 time. You'll use tequila-time constantly just like you did in Max Payne. You'll gain more power 
 to your tequila-meter by performing stylish kills and in time you'll get to use 4 different power 
 moves. First there's an ability to heal yourself, secondly there's an ability to shoot in slow 
 motion really accurately just like in Sniper Elite, thirdly the ability to get unlimited ammo and 
 invulnerability for 30 seconds and finally to shoot everyone on screen at once with white doves 
 flying around. The third ability gives you unlimited ammo so it's likely that you will need to 
 use it quite a lot in boss fights. Unfortunately they are just enemies with more health, so they 
 just need a lot more bullets to go down and nothing more.
  
  Structure of the game is very linear and short lasting only about 6 hours to play through, but 
 there's enough action here for a 20-hour game. When I reached those ending credits I had killed 
 953 enemies in total and cost a damage way over 1,000,000 dollars. This linear structure makes 
 Stranglehold repetitive in a long run, so I recommend you to play it in small doses.
  
  Save system uses checkpoints that are usually in a good distance from one another. You can also 
 choose your difficulty setting every time you start the game so it's very unlikely that you'll 
 frustrate too much when playing Stranglehold.
  
  There are some interior environments and those are not good at all, because usually you can't see 
 where a hail of bullets comes from until you're already dead. The second chapter was especially 
 annoying because of this, but luckily the rest of the game was better in this respect.
  
  Enemy AI is decent, even though they just usually run straight at you and always shoot on sight. 
 Bad thing is that sometimes enemies respawn, if you happen to walk backwards too much.
  
  Multiplayer is clearly an afterthought, because it strips away those things that made the campaign 
 fun. Bullet-time works only if all players use it at the same time (and usually this doesn't happen 
 very often) . This means that Stranglehold is not very good for online shooter fans.
  
  After the single player campaign there's not much to do so consider Stranglehold as a nice snack 
 picked up from a bargain bin.

Review:  Stranglehold is an interesting title - Chow Yun Fat and John Woo got together to make a sequel 
 to the excellent film Hard Boiled; and have kept much of what made that movie entertaining in the 
 game itself. First off, guns guns guns is right... you are NEVER short on ammo or guns... the environment 
 explodes into shards as you rip apart everything on the screen. In fact, you get a 'grade' at the 
 end of each level... a big portion of which is based on the financial damage you employ while taking 
 down bad guys.
  
  The main plot is straight forward: two Hong Kong rival mobs are fighting each other; the younger 
 upstart mob (with the help of some Russian mafia thugs) kidnap the daughter and granddaughter of 
 the established mob's godfather and hold her as ransom (trying to get a piece of Hong Kong in trade) . 
 You play Detective Tequila (Chow) who once had an affair with the mob don's daughter (and, of course, 
 the kid is yours) . Along the way, you';; be double crossed; and come to trust no one since both 
 mob families hate you (especially when you destroy their drug trade) .
  
  Upsides: The slow motion jumping is entertaining; the environment is large destructible; Chow's 
 a great voice actor and the graphics are suitable.
  
  Downsides: The story is linear (you can't deviate from the main tale in any way) ; the gameplay 
 gets repetitive by the end; and most unfortunate: the game gets incredibly EASY once Tequila has 
 all his signature moves (you are SO overpowered in 'Tequila Time') .
  
  But don't let those downsides throw you off... this title can easily be found for $20 these days 
 and is an amusing time waster by any measure.

Review:  I recently finished this game a couple of hours ago... This is a great, short and fun game for 
 a weekend. I cannot say that this game is one of the best games I've ever played because it is 
 not. It is a just plain game you can play in a weekend if you do not have anything else to do...
 
  
  This game has a great destructive environment. You can kill the enemies using different kind of 
 methods... Different scenarios, well enough story and well cut scene, this game worth playing.
 
  
  I think this game is short enough longer could have been bored, because the kind of game it is. 
 You have to do the same from the very beginning to the very end It took me 8 hours to beat it 
 in normal difficulty I recommend play it at this difficult because I think that everybody has 
 to play challenging games since where it is the sense of playing.
  I have not played the multiplayer yet so I cannot review that.
  The sound is great This game 
 takes advantage of the 5.1 receiver I have Graphics are well enough but could be better in some 
 cases.
  Now you know you can play it

Review:  Before I bought Stranglehold, I of course downloaded the demo first on Xbox-live. Suprisingly enough, 
 Stranglehold is pretty solid and fun in it's own little way. Without giving too much away, Stranglehold 
 is a Third-person shooter that utilzes a take-cover system that is very similar to that of Grars 
 of war, but not entirely. One of the very cool aspects of Stranglehold is that you have various 
 special abilities at your disposal. 
  
  
  Although you don't have all these abilities in the beggining of the game, you eventually get them 
 when you progress through the rest of the game. I won't tell you all the abilities you get during 
 the course of the game, but all of the 5 are very fun to pull off and makes you feel super cool, 
 kinda like the Matrix. Thats what Stranglehold pulls off, a Matrix-type shooter. Meaning you can 
 do over the top moves and you'll feel like Jackie Chan with guns, which is pretty cool. In short, 
 Stranglehold is a solid shooter that is definetly worth the current retail price {19.99} . If you 
 like games where all you want to do is shoot guys, this is for you.

Review:  John Woo: Presents Stranglehold, or just "Stranglehold". The game is above average and I would 
 recommend it to most shooter fans, it may not appeal to some people because of the okay story but 
 when I rented this game I couldn't get enough of the online.
  
  The Offline game is fun, you unlock new guns, and specials along the way, the characters have some 
 depth in them. Most objects are destructible and you can slide or hide under almost everything. 
 You can go in slow motion which is probably what makes this game different from most others which 
 you can manually choose to use it or when you dive it is automatic (unless you have no more slowmo, 
 which regenerates) . 
  
  You can go in a sort of sharpshooter mode which zooms in on where your aiming in slowmo and you 
 can shoot people anywhere, there are many different actions the enemy does, there are different 
 actions for shooting him in the leg, knee, arm, eye, ear, head, mouth, nose, arm, hand, private 
 parts, and foot. The Online part of the game can be challengng . AS YOU CAN SEE I HAVE MIXED REACTION 
 JUST FOR THIS GAME FOR SIMPLE FACT IS BECAUSE ITS A MUST BUY BUT THEN AGAIN ITS MORE OF A RENTER 
 THEN ANYTHING. I WOULD BUY IT CHEAP ITS NOT WORTH 59.99

Review:  BULLET TIME: The cliche to end all cliches, right? Well, in Stranglehold, a game based on John 
 Woo's movies - all of which contain near supernatural amounts of equal parts flying lead and ham-fisted 
 acting - Bullet Time is not only named after hard liquor, but is also implimented in many interesting 
 ways. 
  The game starts you in the marketplace of chinatown, with environmental kills galore. This is easily 
 the best level, it all goes downhill from here. The next 4 hours are a wash of flying lead and 
 blood, with plenty of glitz and flash. It adhears to the FPS rule that there be one gun of each 
 type, pistols, smg, assault rifle, rocket launcher, machine gun, ect. 
  IF I had a complaint, I would say the game's second half is too bland and samey for my tastes, 
 it's too easy, and the multiplayer could use some more work.
  It also has one of my pet peeves, Multiplayer Achievements. Achievements that can only be achieved 
 in Multiplayer. Since nobody plays Stranglehold online, there is virtually no way to get them. 
 Bleh.

Review:  Stranglehold attempts to remove itself from the pack as a new original ip in the world of 3rd person 
 shooters. The game is directed by John Woo and includes such talents as Chow Yun-Fat. Even with 
 these great names in theater this game has just enough flaws to keep it out of reach of becoming 
 a "blockbuster" title.
  
  The game uses the typical run and gun gameplay. You use Tequila Time to slow down time and help 
 yourself out of sticky situations. You can also use the left trigger to activate alternate versions 
 of slow motion. Diving is the default command and using the environment will activate different 
 actions. Rolling into fire on a cart, sliding down stairs, and sliding across furniture will all 
 seem like childs play as Tequila accomplishes these task with ease. The aiming system is solid 
 and you can use melee attack in close range using the same button, but it seems in Tequila Time 
 that the aiming is a little more difficult. The weapons also play differently allowing you to really 
 tell the variety of the weapons that you have at your disposal. You may also only carry two weapons 
 at one time. To keep the action fast there is no reloading, you just get rid of the weapon after 
 you use it which is fun, but sometimes leaves unarmed, especially if you use the cover mechanic 
 which is solid as well. Adding on to your list of tools for destruction is Tequila's special moves. 
 These are used to either heal yourself or completely annihilate your enemies, and unlike some shooters 
 that you could go without using the things at your disposal, Stranglehold places you in positions 
 where your powers must be used or failure is inevitable.
  
  The game is a constant riddle of bad guys taunting you, bullets flying, and just the sound of destroying 
 buildings with small arms fire. The game seems to focus more on the sounds of the actual fighting 
 than the voice acting. The story is interesting, but the terrible voice acting is really disappointing. 
 It seems as if the actors involved were just tagging along and not really into the role. Especially 
 the main character which is tragic considering this could have been a much more in depth story.
 
  
  As with the voice acting, the graphics just pass mediocre. Character models are fine, but poorly 
 animated. Most of the physics in the game are aged and most of the animations of the entire game 
 feel like they should be on the original xbox without the lighting and graphics. Lighting is really 
 where the game shines as shadows and city lights enhance the graphics that exist, but when this 
 isn't in contrast it, you really don't wanna see this up close.
  
  Stranglehold is a fun game for those looking for a descent third person shooter. There is plenty 
 of game to be had as it lasts much longer than many lacking shooters. With plenty of play and just 
 enough interest to keep you wanting more Stranglehold will leave you wanting a sequel that is much 
 more polished and makes a much larger impact than this one.

Review:  When i first started playing Stranglehold I did not know what to think. I am huge fan of John Woo 
 movies and Chow Yung Fat, but the game wasn't getting the reviews that I hoped for. A little reluctant 
 at first, i decided to give the game a chance. At first I fell in the love with the unique gameplay 
 styles that felt very Max Payne, but after a while I started to tire of the constant stand-off's 
 as they were used way too much and this took away from the fun of them.
  
  Stranglehold's story is a sequel to the John Woo movie Hardboiled. This may be the games strongest 
 attribute, it really does feel like you are playing a John Woo movie, and the way that you can 
 interact with the environment feels like you are in the Stranglehold universe. Chow Yung Fat has 
 lended his voice and body to the game, so you really feel like Tequilla is the character that you 
 saw in Hardboiled. Now the games story is nothing spectacular, but John Woo has always been known 
 for putting action first (expect for Face/Off I thought this had a somewhat strong story/plot.) 
 I actually took a break from playing this game and when I came back to it, I had no idea what was 
 going on because there was nothing memerable about the story.
  
  That being said the levels are quite memerable, and that is all thanks to the destructive environments. 
 The environments are almost 100% interactive and this is another one of the games strongest attributes, 
 you can use everything to your advantage. Now almost every John Woo movie features a standoff between 
 characters (normally one or two) , in this game however there are way too many. They occur constantly 
 and they slow down the pacing of the game. By the end of the game I was so sick of the standoffs 
 that I just let them happen, I didnt care how much health I lost, I just didnt feel like dealing 
 with them.
  
  Stranglehold looks pretty good on an HDTV, the character models and environments look stunning. 
 The voice work and the overall sound in the game feels like a Hollywood movie. Stranglehold is 
 a short game, but that is totally fine, because some of the gameplay features get old very fast. 
 The game features a multiplayer mode, but many times I tried to find someone to play with and I 
 could not, and when I did I found the match to be dull and lacking the fun of the single-player. 
 Stranglehold is much like Jet Li's Rise to Honor, if you have a free weekend rent the game and 
 have a good time, and dont feel bad not exploring the game completely. If you loved the Max Payne 
 series than you will feel quite at home with Stranglehold and you will most likely enjoy it while 
 it lasts.

Review:  John Woo's Stranglehold, is the sequel to the film "Hard-Boiled" from the 90's. You play as inspector 
 Tequila, a cop from Hong Kong who likes to take matters into his own hands, but also likes to gun 
 down EVERYTHING in sight. You'll destroy everything from street signs, watermelons, thugs, and 
 even tankers in this game. The story is refreshing to see and keeps you playing to uncover the 
 rest of it. It has great voice acting, characters, and guns. Killing people in a slo-mo standoff, 
 shooting them from a distance, (also in slo-mo; satisfying) or spinning around in slo-mo killing 
 everyone in sight is the most satisfying thing to watch. Sliding across tables and stands and even 
 down rails, the action never lets up. You get pummeled with thugs to kill any way you see fit, 
 which doesn't get old. Explosions and total destruction of the large, extensive environments is 
 extremely fun and cool to look at. Multiplayer for this game is not all that great, but does have 
 it's good qualities, still, players are most likely looking for more. All in all, Tequila packs 
 in quite the amount of action as he blows through destructable environments and it makes for a 
 very, very fun action-shooter for current gen. If you like cinematic shooters, this is a must have!!

Review:  In Stranglehold you'll be controlling Tequila, a shoot first ask questions later cop that's actually 
 from Woo's film Hard-Boiled. Tequila takes on a case that involves two rival Chinese gangs and 
 also the Russian mob. If you've enjoyed any of Woo's film or are just looking for a shooting game 
 that will feature non-stop action you'll want to give this game a look.
  
  GAMEPLAY (9) - There's not a whole lot of strategy involved, this game gives you an almost arcade 
 like experience where style is much more important than reality. You can run into a room and just 
 start shooting, but there will be rewards for using some style. The more stylish your kills the 
 more "Tequila Bomb" energy will be earned. You can earn style points by interacting with the environment, 
 such as shooting while you're sliding over a table or down the railings on a set of stairs. You 
 can also use a limited amount of "Tequila Time", which is similar to bullet time from the Max Payne 
 games. The Tequila Bombs are special abilities that can come in very handy against overwhelming 
 enemies or Boss battles. They range from simply being able to heal yourself to exotic attacks such 
 as the spin move, where you'll take down every enemy in sight in a very stylish cut scene. The 
 environments are almost totally destructible, and some of the carnage from your gunfights has to 
 be seen to be appreciated.
  
  GRAPHICS (8) - Probably the biggest plus here is the destructible environments that I had mentioned. 
 There is a lot of detail put into the various places you'll visit, ranging from gritty slums to 
 beautiful casinos and museums. The characters can be a bit of a mixed bag. The main characters 
 are nicely detailed and have somewhat realistic faces, though the grunts you'll be shooting mostly 
 look alike.
  
  SOUND (8) - Very nice voicework featuring Chow Yun Fat speaking for his movie character, and the 
 other voicework was done very well. It would have been nice to have the option to play it in Chinese 
 with subtitles. The sound effects are also done well, and if you crank up your speakers you'll 
 be hearing multiple weapons as well as the environment being destroyed and it has a movie-like 
 quality.
  
  VALUE (7) - The game is on the short side. I'd estimate it took me approximately 8 hours, though 
 as with most games there is the challenge of playing at harder difficulties. There is also a multiplayer 
 mode including Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, using shooting skills in an attempt to hit the Leaderboards.
 
  
  OVERALL (8) - Due to it's short length this may be a good rental for people that can put in approximately 
 8 hours before having to return it. Otherwise it's also not too bad of a purchase since the price 
 has recently come down. The relatively short length is the only thing that might work against this 
 title. For anyone looking for a stylish arcade shooter or a decent crime drama in a Hong Kong setting, 
 Stranglehold is recommended.

Review:  Stranglehold is a fun, fast-paced shooter with high production values and loads of great moments 
 brought to us by Midway and the legendary action director John Woo. The game is relatively short 
 (under 10 hours) but the gameplay is solid and it's addicting slow motion controls may keep you 
 playing the game beyond the single player campaign.
  
  Woo is probably best known for his early work in Hong Kong cinema - the Killers and Hard-Boiled 
 in particular, which I would highly recommend for anyone who enjoys action movies in general and 
 doesn't mind high body counts. Woo's U. S. releases haven't quite reached the heights of his earlier 
 work (Face-Off is one notable exception) , but he is still a fan favorite nonetheless. 
  
  What sets Stranglehold apart from other action games is the movie-like feel to it. The story is 
 a sequel of sorts to Hard-Boiled, featuring the iconic Chinese actor Chow Yun-Fat reprising his 
 role as Inspector Tequila. Tequila is a take no BS, one man wrecking crew with a penchant for smoking, 
 downing tequila shots and dual pistol wizardry.
  
  As the game unfolds we learn that Tequila's former flame and his daughter, who he's been separated 
 from for a long time, have been abducted by a crime lord (Mr. Wong) in an attempt to get Tequila 
 to lay off his assault on Wong's operation. Along the way you will meet a well designed cast of 
 characters that are interesting, humorous and add alot to the overall fun of the game. 
  
  The story itself may be a bit thin, but in reality Woo is all about the action. Of course the necessary 
 ingredients are all present - weapons, ammo, and health pickups are plentiful. Stranglehold relies 
 on two mechanics that add to the action. 
  
  The first of which is Tequila Time - slow motion effects that can either be manually or environmentally 
 triggered. When you dive in the presence of a goon, bellyflop on a moving cart, run down a bannister, 
 or a multitude of other strategically placed (and very fun) trigger spots, the slow mo will kick 
 in and you can gleefully fill a goon's face with lead. Yes, the Max Payne comparisons are inevitable 
 - but since when is slow motion carnage not fun? Besides, Max Payne lifted this mechanic from John 
 Woo movies... so who is copying who here?
  
  The second mechanic is a collection of special moves called Tequila Bombs. As you blast you way 
 through the game you will get star ratings for chaining spectacular kills, which at the same time 
 fill up a meter in the lower left corner. The first move you unlock is my favorite - Precision 
 Aiming. Press up on the D-pad and time will slow, your vision will zoom and you can take out far 
 away enemies with ease. The best part is - the camera follows the bullet until it satisfyingly 
 crunches into your target and the enemy will react to where you hit him. Whether he is trying to 
 hold his jaw into place or wondering why you just shot him in the nuts... it doesn't matter, it 
 never gets old. Plus, this mechanic is a life saver and will be the one you most likely rely on 
 to get through levels or fight bosses.
  
  Other special moves are Barrage, where Tequila becomes invincible and begins unleashing an unholy 
 barrage of ammunition, and a Spin attack, which has Tequila spinning around in slow motion firing 
 off bullets in all directions. I found Barrage to be particularly useful in a number of key situations. 
 You can also use your meter for a health boost, which can come in handy if you have a sliver of 
 health left, bullets are raining and that health pack across the room looks far away.
  
  I actually don't have many criticisms for this game. Mostly what you hear is complaints of its 
 length and its derivative nature. To me - fun is fun. Length is only a concern if you just spent 
 $60 on a game that lasts a day. If you buy this game at $25 or less it is a good deal and worth 
 your time. Is it derivative? Yes and no. Most of what is in the game has been done before but the 
 word "derivative" to me means boring. Stranglehold is not boring.
  
  Why is Strangehold not getting higher scores then? Maybe the word repetitive is more appropriate. 
 What you start the game doing, is what you'll end the game doing. For some that may be an issue, 
 but if you're an action game junkie this shouldn't be too big a concern. The other reason for lower 
 scores is that while the game is well made, it just isn't that memorable. What keeps you playing 
 is diving around in slow motion capping fools - not advancing the story.
  
  All in all I would agree with other reviews that place this game in the 7.5 range. I gave it an 
 extra half point due to the high production values and game design. It would be hard for me to 
 think of an action fan playing through Stranglehold and NOT having fun. Look for it in the used 
 bin or at a reduced price and you won't be sorry you added this one to your collection.

Review:  This game is pretty cool I guess, great idea for a new game, great movement with the gun targeting 
 controls. Very Matrixish. Nice slowmow parts to it. Good story in the game. Kinda like a bad tv 
 movie. The only thing that I didnt like was that it seamed not to have many levels to beat. And 
 the bad guys aren't all that smart at times, you can hide in a corner and kill everyone on the 
 level at one try. But hey what can you ask for..
  
  All you get when you beat the game is unlocking harder level.. Which just means more guys shooting 
 at you, wow, what fun : ( I was lucky at buying the game for $15, on sale at Target. Not the $40 
 i see everywhere else. Id say rent the game for a week at first, Try it out for a day or so, first 
 level is the same as the later ones, buildings and tables. If you cant beat it by then, ok you 
 will. And if you dont beat it, I think Pac-man is on sale at Best Buy. Just saying its very easy. 
 Then deside if you want to own it or not. I havent tryed the xbox live with it, so who knows maybe 
 there is luck for this game after all. Because now that I have beat the game, I have no need to 
 play it again, even at a harder level.....

Review:  Stranglehold delivered what it said it would. You get to shoot, shoot and shoot again. There are 
 plenty of badguys to shoot. Plenty of guns to shoot them with and plenty of bullets to put in the 
 guns that put said bullets into the badguys that you shoot.
  
  Did I mention you get to shoot?
  
  That is Strangleholds victory. It was not overhyped and 
 delivers a good fun time. The graphics are decent, though if you have a 1080p tv it can sometimes 
 appear too grainy. The sound is good if a little over the top which I suppose you would expect 
 from a John Woo production.
  
  The gameplay is fun. The story is typical yet adequate. What is the problem?
  
  The problem 
 is as soon as I started playing I realized that I had played this exact game many times before 
 even if it was wearing different games.
  
  The first 20 minutes of gameplay will tell you all you need to know about Stranglehold. You get 
 Max Payne style matrixy bullet dodging and you shoot badguys while in that mode. That is pretty 
 much it. I lost interst VERY quickly in this game. It just is not anything new. The exploding, 
 destructible environments are good but overrated. 
  
  There are other things I don't like but don't know a better answer for. I love the animations that 
 Tequila performs but I don't like how little true control I have over him. Run to a table, do the 
 same slide across it over and over and over again. Let me control it a little more and give me 
 more than one animation.
  
  Don't highlight the rails I can slide across. It ruins the graphical effect (such as it is) in 
 the game. Do it the FIRST time or two I see a rail or an interactive item and then STOP it. I get 
 it, I can slide down it and cap mobsters.
  
  All in all the game is good. It delivered the things it said it would and the gameplay is polished 
 enough to be alot of fun.... it's just fun that I have had over and over again. 
  
  It is akin to riding the same roller coaster 25 times. Somehow that 20-25th time just makes the 
 ride seem less exciting.
  
  One GREAT thing about the gameplay and it's presentation though is that ANY time I watch a Woo 
 flick and am left hungering for more, I can turn on Stranglehold and get some genuine satisfaction.

Review:  John Woo's Stranglehold, based on the movie Hardboiled, delivers using a decent shooting option 
 and other really cool ways to make bloodshed. Inspector Tiquela, a intense cop that must take out 
 a powerful gang in hong kong and chicago. The game uses slow motion or Tiquela time to take out 
 enemys or you could find other ways to kill enemies. There are many ways to do this which include 
 shooting anything thats above the enemy and it will come crashing down on him. This game has the 
 most destructable enviorments in gaming history. You'll find yourself shooting anything and watch 
 it fall apart. The games controls work but there are so many thins to do that you might find yourself 
 confused. Otherwise the games multiplayer is pretty boring but the single player makes up for it. 
 The graphics work and there not much more to say, stranglehold is a great game.
  
  pros:
  1. destructable enviorments
  2. good graphics
  3. lots of original ways to kill your enemy
  
 
  cons:
  1. confusing controls
  2. boring multiplayer
  
  overall: 8/10

Review:  This game could have been amazing, But it falls short by the fact that the story mode is painfully 
 short, and no one plays multiplayer, there are many good things about this game though, so dont 
 let those first few lines drive you away, The shooting is great, with John Woo's Style implemented 
 perfectly into the game. The Dialouge and Music, Is generally very good. As i said in the first 
 line, The story mode is painfully short, I got through it in a day or two easily, but the harder 
 diffiiculty modes are challenging, The multi player is good fun, but no one is ever online! Most 
 of the achievements are online related, so it makes getting your moneys worth a hard thing to do. 
 So overall, This Game is worth it if you can get past the short story mode. Have Fun Playing! 
 
  
  P. S Get the Limited Edition if you can, you get a copy off John Woo's FACE/OFF
  Great film!

Review:  Stranglehold is a 3rd person shooter that has great graphics. It also uses special moves such as 
 running on side rails and hanging from chandilers while raining bullets from above and diving onto 
 carts an rolling while firing off shoots. And tequila bombs that arent bombs but special powers 
 such as instant health and spinning move that kills every enemy in the room which gained through 
 killing enemies and collecting birds. Stranglehold has things in it that should be innovative except 
 they have already been used. For example tequila time that slows down time has been seen before 
 in many other shooters like max payne. Also enemies seem to respawn just to be shot down over and 
 over again and the shootout sequences were fun at first but then got annoying i mean why couldnt 
 you just dive backwords and blow the enemies brains out instead of going into a repetetive and 
 annoying shootout sequence. The bosses give you a hard fire fight but after the first 2 bosses 
 you will notice that bosses are just there to provide a challenge and only get harder each time 
 and nothing else. although there are alot of minuses to stranglehold they are easy to look past 
 and allows a fun shooter.

Review:  Stranglehold is a a gmae that follows the story of a chinese cop through the criminal underground. 
 The game has an excellent sense of style and is also challenging on the default difficulty. 
  
  Fans of the action genre will appreciate the gameplay. The graphics are good most of the time. 
 My main complaint is that the online play is so incredably bad that one might wonder why it was 
 even put in the game in the first place. The game is sooo lagy that I wasn't able to move properly. 
 The maps were poorly designed and the game is just practically unplayable. On top of that the game 
 features downloadable maps that actually cost money..... like anyone would pay money to participate 
 in one of the worst multiplayer games I have ever played.
  
  With that said the single player is very good, and if there is some replay value too. Overall the 
 game is good but unless you are a big fan of the genre or the movie Hardboiled, than this game 
 is probably a rental.

Review:  Strangelhold is a pretty unique game because it's an unrealistic shooter similar to Max Payne or 
 Dead To Rights. You play as a Policeman and you can pull off sweet moves to defeat your opponents. 
 I thought they should of had more special moves instead of just 4. The multiplayer wasn't horrible 
 but it definitley could use some work and they story was fairly short with a decent replay value. 
 The guns were great and the fact that you could slide down rails while shooting at people wasn't 
 half bad. The game was really entertaining at first and it slowly went downhill, getting a little 
 repetitive but not that bad. I for sure would not buy this game for under 20 or 30 dollars because 
 like I said, it's fairly short. It a unique game and is worth trying. If you are looking for a 
 Max Payne type game for the 360, Stranglehold is for you.

Review:  The first time I played this game I completed the first 2 levels and gave up straight away, I hated 
 the fact that every level is going to be the same; shooting hundreds and hundreds of spawning men, 
 I left the came for a couple of months but decided to play it lastnight, I got quite far and started 
 enjoing the levels, especially as I started being able to use more games such as the Golden Pisols 
 and the huge SAW machine gun thing.
  The specials on the game such as the precision aim is amazing and I love the way you can shoot 
 someone in a curtain body area and they act to how the pain really would be (although I have to 
 say, if I got shot in the mouth I wouldn't scream, I'd be dead pretty quick) lol.
  I don't think Midway did a bad job of this game, amazing storyline too, although there are a few 
 cheesy parts to it (such as when his daughter gets shot in the arm on the last levels and blood 
 instantly appears all over her face) hehe.
  Thanks for reading my review,
  
  Liam.

Review:  Odd-looking Achievements
  
  Now I am beginning this review from something bad about Stranglehold. Then I will talk about the 
 good. Stranglehold is a very linear shooter while the story doesn't immerse the player even for 
 a psycho like me. After a first playthrough, the only reason to go back is for hunting achievements. 
 While Stranglehold also provides a maximum of 1000 points, I don't find them very attractive to 
 look at. Except the skill achievements, they are all old-school Chinese figures such as a symmetrical 
 flower in black and red and the trademark Tai Zhi figure. Frankly, I ain't impressed by those. 
 Why not use different in-game items or environments to be the icons?
  
  Unreachable Hardboiled
  
  The Penthouse is extremely hard even for the underground class. I 
 tried Wong's estate on hardboiled being slayed for uncountable times. I began Hong Kong Marketplace 
 and Tai O on Hardboiled and lowered the difficulty to normal in Megarestaurant and Slum of Kowloon 
 levels. Some people say it is alright to get the hardboiled achievement to change it back to hardboiled 
 before the credits rolls. But I didn't get it but only the normal achievement for the completion 
 of game beating Wong on Hardboiled. Weird. Hardboiled is a menace. If not for the achievements, 
 Casual would be the most fun mode for this game.
  
  Mass destructable environment
  
  Ok, what are the good aspects of Stranglehold? To begin with, the developers really bring their 
 words into reality. Everything in Stranglehold can be destroyed by gunfire and by bumping yourself 
 into. Carefully manipulating the environmental destruction to kill foes will earn you the Deadly 
 World Achievement too! I feel so impressed to see a Watermelon breaks. I think not even Crysis 
 can compare to Stranglehold in terms of the possible damage of the environment. For example, if 
 you stay behind a column cover for too long, enemies can damage it. Debris falls and you take damage. 
 No other games have done this before.
  
  Smooth Framerates
  
  Without the pretentious realistic physics of Crysis, mass destruction of environment does not cause 
 severe framerate losses. On the Xbox 360, it runs happily above 60 fps. So am I. Besides, Stranglehold 
 isn't bad-looking either. I don't like to idea to trade off the smooth framerates for some trees 
 falling in a realistic way. I really don't darn care! Same criticism to GRAW PC, another catastrophy 
 in the way of speed.
  
  Fun Skills Achievements
  
  You finally come across these fun achievements. They are quite worthwhile to get. An examples are 
 killing people until a combo of 50 points. It is hard but practical. And the achievements have 
 more interesting icons other than the Chinese figures.
  
  Barrage
  
  Taking too much damage? Get into Barrage Mode! You will consume some energy but it can be really 
 helpful to save your life more than once. During Barrage, your weapon fire at a high rate and has 
 infinite ammo. I suggest you keep the heavy machine gun or the rocket launcher for barrage. If 
 done right, they can make boss fights so much easier.

Review:  THis game was short, boring, repetitive, and constantly gave me headaches.
  
  there was a small variety of guns and i could've done so much more with that free time.
  
  
 The only thing that i liked about this game is that it came with the free 360 panel 
  
  do not get this game you will sell this within 2-3 weeks like i did
  
  i feel that the average 
 score of 7 is an overrating and i cannot see how this game even got close to that score. 
  
  There is not much to like about this game, its only challenge is to see how long you can bear 
 this game before you get the feeling that you couldve used your money on a better game. The games 
 "challenges" only consist of shooting a weak beam which causes a magical bridge to cover for the 
 gap that is only 3 feet wide. Either a beam or a highly explosive barrel of fuel which creates 
 the same result

Review:  well i bought it about a week its great at first but all the matrix/jackie chan stuff gets old 
 quick... still fun... its a normal 3rdperson shooter except you have "tequila time" which lets you 
 slow down time and do cool tricks like jackie chan and chck norris like hanging out of chandallers... its 
 like max payne and the matrix.... the storys normal enough and has a bit more story than i taught 
 i would gave the graphics are nice enough with great destrucive enviorments... my only real problem 
 is that you feel like your doing alot of the same stuff again and again which ges repeditive but 
 in the end, stranglehold is a nice sinlge player game (horrible multiplayer)
  and is worth a rental or a cheap buy... i purchased mine for 18euro and felt i got enough play for 
 my money but its defintally not worth a $55
  purchase....

Review:  -------------------------------------------------------
  Gameplay: good
  Sound: good
  Entertaining: yes
  Format: third-person
  Genre: action, shooter
  Replay: moderate
  -------------------------------------------------------
 
  
  John Woo's Stranglehold was an excellent game, very action packed as well as brilliant. It is based 
 off the film by John Woo called Hard Boiled. Which I believe hearing the words "Hard Boiled Cop" 
 in one of the cinematics.
  
  In Stranglehold you play as a character named Teqila - a stubborn cop, that basically doesn't listen 
 to his high ranking officer. The first level of the game introduced some of the awesome controls. 
 You can do cool slow motion jumps into the air as you shoot your enemies. By hitting LT you can 
 jump toward or backward from your enemy, and by hitting RT while the "center-circle" is on the 
 enemy, you do a sweet move. Later in the game as you advance in level, there is this one special 
 move that lets you zoom in with a pistol, and slows down time. When you fire, the screen follows 
 the bullet and when on contact with the enemy it will show the enemies reaction. Like if you shoot 
 him in the "private parts" they will immediately groan and fall down. Shoot him in the eye, they 
 will immediately cover their eye in pain.
  
  Stranglehold is a pretty short game. There are seven levels, four out of the seven are very long 
 levels. Mostly because you have bosses to kill on most of them. Some of the boss battles are pretty 
 difficult, they try to make it hell for you. Which with some of those bosses, hell for them is 
 haven for Teqila. 
  
  The John Woo film was awesome! Make the game just like the movie, is pretty cool. The music is 
 awesome, it works well with the senses and sequences. The voice-acting on the other hand, some 
 voice-overs were good, some bad, and some simply annoying.
  
  The graphics in Stranglehold is awesome. It's not as good as Oblivion's, or Gears of War but the 
 graphics were next-gen. They worked really hard on detail. The work that they did on the expressions 
 were pretty surprising. Most games need work on the facial expressions and how the lips move. Like 
 Oblivion, Stranglehold did a pretty good job at that.
  
  There is a shop, not in-game, but when you are at the menu you have the options for "New Game, 
 Continue Game" and stuff like that. There was this one selection that was called "shop" or something 
 like that. It was where you could buy stuff - not with real money - but from the money you got 
 for doing some of the missions in the game. You have the option of buy art works, videos and multiplayer 
 packs. Which one of the videos which I believed was kind of funny was "Facial Expressions" where 
 they showed you the various expressions that are shown in the game.

Review:  This game is based on John Woo's Hard Boiled which is a movie i love. In
  this game you are Inspector Tequilla and embark on a amazing journey through the underworld of 
 gangs in many places around the world. The main aspect is gunplay which is done pretty well but 
 i feel that they through too many enemies at you in some parts. But what you can do in gunplay is 
 amazing. Running up walls, using carts to roll across they place. Also they add these power ups which 
 can be fun if used right. The story is impressive, and the multiplayer is not very fun, nobody is 
 playin and i have never had a full room on there. But this game is good must have for John Woo fans, I 
 personally think that the story is a masterpeice but can be cliched and boring in parts but they 
 add duels in the game to try and make it better. It sort of does, shooting people in the eye in slow 
 motion is always fun

Review:  I am 39 years old and they say I am slightly retarded. I also have the attention span of a flea. 
 I must say I really enjoyed this game. I probably have 15 games for the XBOX360. I usually buy 
 a game, play it for a while and then quickly lose interest. This is the first game that I stayed 
 with long enough to complete. I especially liked the "precision aim" feature and all kinds of firepower. 
 I would highly recommend this if you like nonstop action with a touch of Chinese shoot em up. I 
 am just adding these extra few words because it says that I need 100 words minimum. Now I am going 
 to write a few more words because it says that I only have 584 characters long. Now it is saying 
 that i have 679 words so I believe that I am getting closer. If this is still not long enough I 
 will probably have to add some more words one more time - so here it goes.

Review:  Licensed games suck right? Yes, indeed they do and have ever since E. T. The Extra Terrestrial for 
 the Atari 2600, but there have been licensed gems of games that come along that make the most of 
 their license by embracing their subject completely and using the uniqueness of an intellectual 
 property to make the game better than it otherwise would be. John Woo Presents Stranglehold is 
 such a game, perfectly suited to the third-person action shooter that it is.
  
  Though it would be natural to suspect that the game is based on a movie it is not. At least not 
 directly. Stranglehold was made under the close direction of John Woo, and as widely reported, 
 he considers the game to be the sequel to his film Hard Boiled. Actor Chow Yun Fat's image is used 
 (brilliantly) as that of the protagonist adding to the cinematic feel of the game's presentation. 
 Like the films it is based on, the visual impact (represented using the Unreal Engine) is greater 
 than that of the story which follows typical action film themes such as kidnapping, betrayal and 
 revenge. Even so the game succeeds in always motivating the player along to the next plot point. 
 The visuals in the game are strong, with gloriously destructive environments that traverse tropical 
 islands, metropolitan penthouses and slums. There is a strange visual glitch involving baskets 
 of fruit in the first level which was off-putting and a shame since every other aspect of the games 
 visuals were flawless, I mention it only so that upon seeing it you are not distressed for what 
 follows.
  
  The play itself is mostly unvaried involving clearing areas of enemies using one of the two guns 
 you are able to carry. While the levels themselves are linear they are wide, in that while you 
 are ultimately getting to the end of a level there are many different paths to follow within each 
 levels. At the end of each level you will face a boss-like challenge which are always impressive 
 in their visual impact and variety. The artificial intelligence of all enemies is above average 
 as are their various reactions to damage depending on where they are hit. 
  
  Play is made even more interesting by giving the player three shooting upgrades which are earned 
 over time by pulling off skillful kills. These upgrades start with a precision shot (rewarding 
 the played with bullet point-of-view and skippable impact cinematic) , "barrage" which enables you 
 a brief few moments of invincibility and extra lethality and a spin-attack in which you see Chow 
 Yun Fat firing while spinning, clearing the area of all enemies. With all of these gun-play gymnastics 
 Stranglehold has been compared to the Max Payne series of games. In reality though the Max Payne 
 series was built in large part on the directorial styling of John Woo who invented "bullet-time" 
 and many of the other visual effects that series uses.
  
  Fans of third-person shooting and action gaming will find no fault with Stranglehold, an enjoyable 
 game with delightfully diverse settings, compelling play and plenty of destructible eye-candy along 
 the way.

Review:  alrite so i bought stranglehold on saturday and played it for mabey 3 or 4 hours and beat it today 
 (monday) .. what a great game i must say (even though it was extremly short) 
  the gameplay was pretty fun (jumping around and shootin people, doin matrix kinda stuff) also every 
 now and then youd have a "standoff" against 5+ people and the enemys would circle you and you would 
 face them one at a time and youd shoot at each other in "slow mo" which was pretty cool until it 
 got alot faster and youd have to face alotttt of people : (
  
  a few of my complaints would have to be HOW COME THERES ONLY 7 DIFFERNT TYPES OF GUNS :|! .... 
 just sayin.. tha makers of this game couldve atleast put more of a variety of firearms or atleast 
 put in sum "hand to hand" weapons.. also how come some of tha bosses are so effin hard ? all tha 
 bosses had rocket launchers, heavy machine guns, snipers (which you dont get to use in tha game) 
 and a bunch of health...
  
  overall great game
  
  if u ever get this game rent it because its ridiculous to pay $60 for a game that only last mabey 
 5 or 6 hours the most

Review:  Stranglehold is a third-person shooter from Midway. And that's about it. There's just not much 
 to say about this simple, boring, mindless dump.
  
  First of all, the story is as clichd as an exploding barrel sitting next to your victim, apparently 
 willing to die. Which by the way is also included in this game.
  
  Second of all, the game's gimmick bullet time, in this game called "Tequila Time" is beyond unoriginal.
 
  
  The aiming is really slippery and feels unfinished, and the weapons all pretty much look alike. 
 The animations look pretty awful as well. Plus, the graphics are nothing like I expected it to 
 be, it looks like an Xbox game in many ways. Though the character models do look pretty nice.
 
  
  The game boasts heartpumping action and lots of Chow Yun-Fat, if you for some reason had fallen 
 in love with him and his mediocre action films. But the key to success is throwing lots and lots 
 of enemy waves on you for no reason at all other than something for you to shoot at. Or at least 
 that's what the developers thought.
  
  The level design is pretty bland and everything looks kinda dull. At a boss fight the Tequila Bombs 
 as they are called make things overly easy, you'll practically overkill him. Every boss fight is 
 simply another enemy with more health than the others.
  
  This is one of my shortest reviews yet, I'll maybe edit it in the following days, right now I'm 
 pretty tired and heading for bed in a few minutes. Ultimately, Stranglehold is a game that will 
 only appeal to serious TPS or Yun-Fat fans, for the rest of us there's nothing here to taste.

Review:  This game was alright the campaign is just right. The tequilla time is awesome for the first 2 
 or 3 levels then your just playing the game to beat it after that. it is soooooo repetitive all 
 you do is slow mo hed shot slow mo hed shot its the same. the multiplayer is also very weak its 
 hard to find a game and when you do its very laggy. I also found that when someone dives in slow 
 mo online they are actually slowly glidin through the air so tat gets pretty lame too. if you can 
 get this game cheap then i would but it has no replay value at all once you beat it it'll be on 
 our game shelf forever after i beat it i played it 3 or 4 times for 10 minutes each time.

Review:  well i bought it about a week its great at first but all the matrix/jackie chan stuff gets old 
 quick... still fun... its a normal 3rdperson shooter except you have "tequila time" which lets you 
 slow down time and do cool tricks like jackie chan and chck norris like hanging out of chandallers... its 
 like max payne and the matrix.... the storys normal enough and has a bit more story than i taught 
 i would gave the graphics are nice enough with great destrucive enviorments... my only real problem 
 is that you feel like your doing alot of the same stuff again and again which ges repeditive but 
 in the end stranglehold is a nice sinlge player game (horrible multiplayer)
  and is worth a rental or a cheap buy...

Review:  When I saw the john woo ,s name above Stranglehold Title for the first time 
  [quite friendly] I thought this is gonna be another *ucking Gamovie ( I creat this word by my own 
 !!!) . that ,s because most of the gamovies *ucks . but there is a difference between John woo 
 and the other director , He is ultra professional in creating fictional Action scenes and a game 
 is the best place to creating ultra fictional actions . the result of his work is a good game called 
 Stranglehold . maybe the game is not so good in the eyes of a critic but it looks so cool in the 
 mind of a normal gamer due to imitated action moments in the game. Well before going on there is 
 something I want to tell you . the game is somehow a new version of Max Payne [ Max payne game 
 is the most famous game in all the times . in some of the dictionaries you can look up this word 
 . _Max payne : a famous Action video game (Babylon pro dictionary) _ ]
  If you had enjoyed Max payne ( which I, m sure you did) this game is suitable for you . the game 
 ,s protagonist has lost his family and has nothing else to lose . so he starts to kill those *astards 
 who have disturbed him and his family . the story is so simple and also sufficient for a game focused 
 on intense action moments. The locations, the camera movements and rotations , foes figures , and 
 many many other things remind you of a HONG KONG movie . all The locations are full of enemies 
 who beg you to be killed by your bullets while you are jumping in slow motion state . if you kill 
 your enemies in an acrobatic manner then you will gain bonus and then you can active your special 
 actions which are extremely lethal and also cinematic . there is some 
  Stand off scenes in which you will surrounded by 5-6 persons then everything is like Matrix and 
 you know the rest . visually the game is really good thanks to
  Unreal 3 engine . almost every object in the game is interactive and you leave each location messed 
 up behind. The game has some minor bug issue but some of them are forgivable some are not , specially 
 if that bug forces you to reload your last check point.
  But regardless of anything that mentioned before this game worth your money .

Review:  I could really sum up this review with a few key words like "Max Payne", "Total Overdose ('Chili 
 Con Carnage') " or "Dead To Rights". I think you know where I'm going with this. This game is so 
 similar to those titles that I had no trouble picking it up and blasting my way through it in about 
 6-8 hours. I'm not saying that the length of the game is a bad thing because the levels feel huge, 
 but the bulk of the time spent is in the same room fighting wave after wave of the same enemies. 
 In fact, I thought I had finished one or two levels several times before I actually did. It helped 
 to extend the play time, but I began to think "can I just get to the end of the level already and 
 move on with the story?"
  
  The special moves are recognizable in that it steals a little from each of the previously mentioned 
 titles. Slow-motion dives, bullet-time dodging, even the ability to spin around like a deadly tornado 
 destroying everyone in the room. But what the game lacks in originality, it makes up for with a 
 decent John Woo story. The real downfall was the difficulty level. It didn't really feel like much 
 of a challenge (on the 'normal' difficulty) until you get to the final two levels. Health was plentiful, 
 as were bullets, but most areas had a run-and-gun, trial-and-error feel. If you couldn't just blast 
 your way through with special moves, you could slow down and concentrate on a few headshots and 
 work your way through in no time at all.
  
  The graphics are amazing but the characters are only a little better than decent. The environment 
 is quite destructable which makes for hiding out behind a concrete wall not as safe as you think 
 it would be. However, I did run into some issues with the framerate dropping out when things got 
 a little too heated. The best part, though, was the feeling of realism in each level. You actually 
 had to think about how you would reach the next platform or discover the safest place to take cover. 
 It actually looked like these places exist in the real world.
  
  Like the game, though, this review is going to be short and to the point... you've seen this all 
 before, but like each game before, it has it's own charm. If you like "Dead To Rights" and John 
 Woo/Chow Yun-Fat films, this will entertain you for a weekend, and you may consider adding it to 
 your collection. But unless you like to collect every last achievement, this won't be a title that 
 you'll play over and over again. Once was enough for me, but I'm glad I took the time to enjoy 
 the ride.

Review:  After blasting my way through a seemingly endless mass of gangsters and destroying everything in 
 my path, I've gotta say, this is pretty awesome. Sure, it isn't the best game of the year and what 
 not, but it does have fun points. The setup is clearly something John Woo had fun with. It is just 
 the classic action plot: hardcore cop fights drug-dealers to get his wife and daughter back. The 
 story is neither bad nor great, but that's intentional: the star is the action. The shoot 'em up, 
 let's blow it all to hell, explosive game play. 
  
  The action is just the classic 3rd person game. Nothing too new here. However, there are elements 
 that make combat feel great. First: you feel so like such a bad-a$$ through the entire game. No 
 matter what you're doing, you look so awesome it's undeniable how great it is. Second: Tequila 
 Time. It's like bullet time, but actually, for all intents and purposes, better. Oddly enough, 
 it makes the Matrix's Slow-mo look terrible. I really like it, and clearly added for the bad-a$$ 
 factor. Third: Tequila Bombs. Alright, so they're super powers, but oh well! They spice up the 
 game play, and really save it from being stale.
  A quick note: Voice acting from Chow Yun Fat is great. Music is also fitting.
  
  But it has 
 its faults. The gameplay does get stale fast, and that's caused by the simple fact that all levels 
 are set up with: go into room. Kill dudes. Go to next room. Sure, slow motion is awesome, but after 
 doing it 3,000 times, it isn't quite as awesome. Also, it's quite short. Like, wow, you'll beat 
 it in a blink of an eye. But it's a good blink.
  
  If you just want a good, shoot 'em up game, this is for you. Kudos to John Woo for making an interesting 
 forte into gaming, a thing few directors have done!

Review:  Action film director John Woo is renowned for his high flying, guns blazing explosive spectacles, 
 but how does he manage in creating a video game?. John Woo Presents Stranglehold is the result. 
 The game is a spiritual successor to John Woo's Hard Boiled, and attempts to emulate its sleek, 
 extravagant gunplay style. The idea of the game is simple, find yourself a gun and shoot anything 
 that moves. While this formula sounds shallow and repetitive Stranglehold still manages to keep 
 you interested.
  You play as inspector Tequila (Chow Yun Fat) , a rebel Hong Kong cop who is on a mission, and you 
 guess it, its personal. Inspector Tequila's old love interest and his daughter have been kidnapped 
 by the criminal underworld, and tequila has to get them back. Bullets will fly across the world 
 with settings from Hong Kong to Chicago.
  While a game like this sounds like its story will not carry and significance, it does actually 
 play a large part with cinematic cut scenes and satisfying action scenes.
  Occasionally there are also flashbacks which show events that happened between tequila and other 
 main characters in the past, such as run- ins with old gang bosses. The story is supported by dramatic 
 accurate voice dubbing's and has the a unique way of making you feel like your actually watching 
 a John Woo Motion picture, with very particular camera angles and face/body motion capture.
  One thing Stranglehold has to be given credit for is the graphics. Tequila looks great, and the 
 developers have modeled Chow Yun fat perfectly. The environments are too very detailed, with everything 
 from dinner roll carts to chandeliers available for the player to utilize. The destruction of the 
 environments is immense, with nearly everything carrying its own destructive properties and realistic 
 Physics. These destructive environments, as well as looking good serve a purpose, crushing your 
 enemies. For example you see a neon sign above an unsuspecting enemy, so you decide to shoot the 
 sign, it will come crushing down and give the enemy a nice painful death.
  As well as this destruction another cool way to take out your foes is with tequila bombs, These 
 are special moves which will help you get yourself out of a tight situation.
  For example precision aim, this slows down time and gives you a close up view, so you can pick 
 off a difficult to see enemies. The most effective feature of precision aim is the camera follows 
 the bullet, so the player is treated to a nice gory view of a bullet entering an enemy. A less 
 interesting but useful tequila bomb is a simple health boost. There is also barrage, which for 
 a short amount of time gives you infinite ammo with the gun you are using, invincibility and faster 
 reload, so you can plough your way through enemies like a hot knife through butter. The final one 
 is spin attack, which makes tequila to spin at a 360 degree angle and destroy any enemies around 
 him.
  As well as these Tequila bombs there is a feature called Tequila Time, which is Max Payne style 
 Slow motion. Luckily this is automatically activated during dives and jumps so you can pick off 
 enemies with style. It can however be activated manually if you need to get yourself out of trouble.
 
  To accompany these special abilities sometimes events occur, in which tequila has 3 or more enemies 
 pointing their guns at tequila, then in a cinematic John Woo style the play must dodge bullets, 
 shoot an enemy then spin around and shoot the next enemy. These events are placed at certain points 
 in the level.
  These duel events and special abilities certainly give the game a sense of pace.
  Other than 
 this mindless all guns blazing fun there are paper origami cranes to collect, which as well as 
 giving you points for tequila bombs give you a higher mission rating at the end.
  There is a decent variety of weapons, including shotguns, rocket launchers, grenades and all the 
 other weapons that you would expect to see from an action game . All of which are quite realistic 
 and have their own destructive capabilities.
  The only issue that i had with the weapons was that there was significant lack of melee weapons, 
 with Tequila's fists being about as far as it goes. It would have been nice to try out a few swords 
 or clubs on unsuspecting foes.
  At one point inspector Tequila takes to the skies, by shooting out of a chopper with a mini-gun, 
 which is a welcome addition.
  Fortunately this solid gameplay is backed up by a solid and easy to use control scheme. With the 
 analogue sticks being used to move and look, the d-pad to select tequila bombs and the Y, X, A and 
 B buttons used to reload, jump etc.
  One major flaw with stranglehold however is that it is quite short, and on easy can be beaten in 
 just over six hours. There is an online multiplayer option however unfortunately this lets the 
 game down, with awful bugs, loading times and lag issues, which almost makes it intolerable. Tequila 
 time is available in the multiplayer but it takes a while to build up, and has a strange affect 
 on other players when it is used. It seems to slow everyone else down too so it does not really 
 serve a purpose accept to cause annoyance.
  As a result most players tend to play stranglehold for its single player experience alone.
  One 
 smaller thing to note is that Stranglehold has great unlocks such as artwork, trailers and multiplayer 
 characters.
  All in all Stranglehold achieves at being an action film style epic, and is a solid game that will 
 appeal to action game fans, or somebody looking for another John Woo masterpiece. The graphics 
 are gleaming and the gameplay is fulfilling, so it's certainly worth a play, even if it is a little 
 short.
  My rating? 85%

Review:  I actually enjoyed this game a lot. When I found out this game will be using mechanics like in 
 Max Payne, I was like well forget it, I ain't picking this up. I said that because I never liked 
 Max Payne. But when the demo was released and I played, I loved it. The controls were very good 
 and well designed along with great voice acting and very cinematic gameplay. The games story on 
 easy will run you about 6 or 7 hours. Then I played it again on medium and it ran me about 8 to 
 9 hours because it was harder. This game though as many others have said is not worth $60 and I 
 agree. maybe $50, but not $60.

Review:  well this game is a cool innovative game that the first time you play it, but playing it for two 
 or three times, it gets tedious.
  
  Gameplay: 8 out of 10, because you play it ;ike some 6 hours and then, it gets boring.
  
  Graphics: 
 8 out of 10, graphics are cool, but there are better than those graphics and this game is not usin 
 the xbox power.
  
  Content: 8 out of 10, the mission are short and there are only 7 missions, the weapons are cool 
 but we could have a lot of more variety, online multiplayer game is boring.
  
  Anyways if u like shooter games, this is a good option, but first download the demo, or rent it 
 first.

Review:  Stranglehold is like renting a porno at your local video store. At first, its kind of exciting 
 and maybe even a bit nerve racking. Once you start watching it your like ok.. I might be able to 
 get into this; then half way through the movie your just tired and want it to end. Stranglehold 
 mimics this mentality exactly: the window of opportunity to enjoy this game is very small and begins 
 to fade quickly. Personally, after the first mission which is exactly the same as the downloadable 
 demo on live, I began to lose interest in the game. Here is stranglehold in one phrase: a Max Payne 
 rip off with a chinese theme. The only real difference between the two is the added tequila moves 
 and story.
  
  Story: The story in Stranglehold is classic cop verse gang of bad guys with his long lost family 
 in the middle of it. Basically, if you've every seen Hardboiled or any Die Hard or 80's action 
 movie you will find the premise quite similar. I'm a product of the 80s so I love a good action 
 movie with tons of bullets and no reloading. The story is pretty straight forward with your occasion 
 twist but like those action movies of our youth the story is just a means to kill a lot of baddies. 
 
  
  Gameplay: The gameplay here like the story isn't anything special or tremendously exciting. This 
 seems to be the running theme of Stranglehold, do everything that has been done before with a few 
 minor adjustments and call it a day. The biggest difference is the tequila powers which are pretty 
 cool but will probably get abused to the point of boredom. The special powers include, healing 
 yourself, precision aiming which allows tequila to zoom in an pick people off. This power is probably 
 the most entertaining of them all since enemies will react to specific body parts. For example, 
 shoot somebody in the crouch and they will cry out for mercy. The last two powers are just plain 
 ridiculous: barrage shot and spin attack. Barrage shot makes you invincible for a couple of seconds 
 and doesn't detract ammo from your weapons. Spin attack basically kills everyone in the area; its 
 kind of cheap and way to easy to get. Essentially every time tequila does his Max Payne dive he 
 will gain stars; the more stars you get the more your tequila powers will fill which allows the 
 user to pick from his abilities. Other than that main attraction the second biggest selling point 
 is destructible environments which aren't really destructible. Instead, like most games they are 
 scripted to a point; for example most columns wont completely come down instead they will reach 
 a point of damage and stop. Some scripted environments will be completely destroyed but those are 
 obvious like signs and different small structures. I know that technically you can't completely 
 destroy columns without the building coming down and killing everyone; yet I'm not the one saying 
 that this game has destructible environments, its midway. 
  
  Features: The features include: a single player campaign that depending on the difficulty can take 
 about 4-7 hours at best; a less than stellar multiplayer and some unlockable goodies. 
  
  Graphics: The graphics in Stranglehold aren't really that impressive though the models are somewhat 
 appealing the environments are just mediocre. The special effects and destruction effects are nice 
 but an inconsistent framerate ruins the actions. 
  
  Sound: There is basically no background music; and most sound effects seemed like they were pulled 
 out of a stereotypical chinese movie. 
  
  Conclusion: In the end, the enemy AI is a joke in any type of difficulty; the game gets extremely 
 repetitive quickly since all the special tequila powers are revealed so early in the game. The 
 environments are linear and just boring. The multiplayer just doesn't play that well and tequila 
 time is useless because while in tequila time the opponent is running in real time. This type of 
 game has been done before with greater level of detail and a way better story. I personally suggest 
 that if you like pure action games like this get Max Payne it's much better overall.

Review:  Stranglehold is a good game that has its immersive moments and it's painful drawbacks. let us start 
 by the good moments first, the game had amazing graphics especially when you skip the first level 
 which looks the least impressive of all levels. powered by Unreal Engine 3, stranglehold 
  sits well with other games that used the same engine and it honestly looks beautiful most of the 
 time.
  the game play is interesting too, basically stranglehold is a 100% action game that doesn't give 
 you a moment to breath. right from the start you're thrown into intense action with lots of shooting, 
 it never gets
  old to shoot dudes in the face and it is quite rewarding and fun. you can slow time and dispatch 
 your foes using the tequila bombs
  that you get to earn one by one as the game goes on and you unlock other abilities that do not 
 add much to the game's strategic progression, but it adds a lot to the game's fun. you get to use 
 different weapons like msgs, shotguns, duel pistols and eventually grenades by the last levels 
 of the game (which is weird) . The story is what you would come to expect from a john woo movie, 
 betrayal, rescuing chicks and other stuff of the like, but none of that wil be important after 
 you're thrown into action, right?. the sound system is decent enough to ensure satisfaction when 
 you shoot any weapon or you destroy the environment around you, and the environment is almost entirely 
 destructible, which is one of the strongest points of this game.
  
  The bad parts about this game are its short duration, especially that the multiplayer is kind of 
 lame. The game is also a bit off-limit in terms of
  how difficult it can get even in the normal setting, expect to die a lot towards the last levels 
 !! Also, the story is a bit shallow and doesn't conclude 
  with enough style to give a sense of accomplishment to the player. other than that, I think that 
 Stranglehold is a great game that has lots and lots of action into it and if you are into action 
 , this isn't going to let you down.

Review:  Stranglehold looks fantastic, it controls fantastic, the game though falls short of being fantastic. 
 Racking up large body counts and raining down massive destruction can only be fun for so long, 
 and theres is nothing that will keep you coming back for more once you beat the game, which won't 
 take very long it's about a six hours long game, which hurts my ability to recommend that you buy 
 it. 
  
  The story is exactly what you would expect from something with John Woo's name attached to it. 
 So, no matter what you think of John Woo you likely won't really care. As the story serves it purpose, 
 giving Tequila (that's you) a reason to run around all over the world and raining down death and 
 destruction. The story is told through scattered cuts scenes that don't bog down the fun you'll 
 have gaming, but while some of the cut scenes are amusing to watch, the story itself doesn't do 
 anything to really keep you wanting to play. 
  
  Which happens to be the biggest problem with the game, that being that there's no real reason to 
 play it, one you get past how slick it is. Coupled with its short length and repetitive game mechanics, 
 the score should probably be even lower. Stranglehold is kept up by some great moments that are 
 sheer greatness (the latter half of the game particularly had some great level designs.
  
  While I can't outright tell you to buy the game you need to play it

Review:  Graphics: 8/10. They aren't particularly the best graphics, but they are good enough. I particularity 
 liked the smoke effect (from the cigarette) and the rain effect (Tequila's hair was wet, and you 
 can tell, excellent) I also really liked the "precise aim" graphics. The blood splatter (where 
 ever you hit them) is amazing.
  
  Sound: 8/10. Th sound is okay. The sound of things crumbling is good, and also the sound of bullets 
 ricocheting. Seems like it's just enough to pass off as realistic.
  
  Gameplay: 8.5/10. It's pretty fun. Who doesn't like doing Tequila bombs? They all have their quirks. 
 Although the gameplay can get a bit hard or frustrating, it's still good because it's telling you, 
 you can't play this, as you would a FPS. (Yes, I know this is a Third person shooter.) 
  
  Story: 7/10 Haven't beaten the game yet, but I'm at the point where I feel I can comfortably review 
 this game. The story isn't big, and more often than not, you forget why you're killing all these 
 people. But when cutscenes happen, the story is good in my opinion.
  
  Fun factor: 9/10. This is a really fun game. Like I said, Tequila bombs are awesome. It's a pretty 
 good game. Although like I said, it can get frustrating with you keeping on dying, it's still pretty 
 fun.
  
  Overall, Stranglehold is a pretty great game. If you're looking for a different type of shooter 
 game, this is one of them. I definitely reccomend this game for a good rent.

Review:  John Woo's Stranglehold is an art that has not been portrayed in a game on the 360/PS3/PC. It is 
 completely unique compared to all your other shooters. Tequila Time is the definite selling point 
 of the game with so many fun ways to kill so many people. Chow Yun Fat fits the role of Inspector 
 Tequila perfectly and i believe that this is the best game that is based on a movie ever made. 
 The story is not amazing but it keeps you interested throughout the game with secrets of Tequila's 
 past and why he is so concerned about the kidnapped girls that the story is based around.
  
  The best part of the game is the precision aim feature that is unlocked after the first chapter. 
 You pick you spot on the guys body and bust a cap, then watch the fun.
  
  This game is definitly better than a 7.0 even with the 8-9 hour story. It's action packed and a 
 ton of fun a definite buy.

Review:  Stranglehold takes place over a decade after the events in John Woo's critically-acclaimed movie 
 'Hardboiled'. A cop is murdered by traids whilst Tequilas ex-wife and daughter are both kidnapped 
 by the Russian mafia. Now it's time for Inspector Tequila (played by Chow Yun-Fat) to dual-wield 
 his way through seven levels taking him through both Chicago and Hong Kong.
  
  GAMEPLAY:
  + Pick-up-and-Play controls are easy to get to grips with.
  + Tequila bombs are fun to use and 
 help add a little strategy in overwhelming situations.
  + Interactivity is almost spot-on.
  - Not much variety to the gameplay.
  - Some occassional camera issues.
  
  GRAPHICS:
  + 
 Great-looking enviornments that blow-up beautifully.
  + Chow Yun-Fat's character model looks like the real deal.
  + Some awesome death animations.
 
  - Some textures look either flat or washed-out.
  - Jerky animations will pop-up here and there.
  - Generic enemy models.
  
  SOUND:
  + Solid 
 voice acting throughout.
  + Hollywood-quality soundtrack alongside great sound effects.
  - Some dialogue sounds really cheesy.
  
  VALUE:
  + Achievements encourage lots of replay 
 value.
  + Unlockable Hard-Boiled difficulty is challenging, but very rewarding.
  + Decent multiplayer mode.
  + Some decent extras in the form of videos, artwork and additional 
 characters.
  - Single-player game will literally take 4-6 hours to complete.
  - Multiplayer is solid, but nothing new.
  - Collectors Edition DVD doesn't contain much new content 
 that hasn't already been seen on web trailers.
  
  REVIEWER'S TILT:
  It all boils down to this, if you're a die-hard John Woo fan, this game definitely deserves your 
 attention. If you like shooting games, give it a rental. But for others, you'll either like it, 
 or you won't. Granted, it has a few problems, and it really doesn't do anything new, but at least 
 it's a solid game that looks good, plays well and delivers a ton of excitement during it's single-player 
 mode (even if it is short) . The multiplayer is also decent, and still quite active even after Halo 
 3, but it's never going to set the world on fire. In the end it's just another shooter, but at 
 least it's really good fun and worthy of John Woo's name.

Review:  This is one of the games out there that is definately a renter. Like many have said, the single 
 player campaign is short, but it is an exciting game to play, with some outrageous levels where 
 it is simply a hail of gunfire from both sides. I can't vouch for this being worth purchasing, 
 due to the short single player and faulted multiplayer, but if you need a quick fix of shooting 
 action for the weekend, you could do a lot worse than this title.
  
  There is a sick kind of pleasure in cueing up the tequila precision aim and watching as some poor 
 unsuspecting sod reels back, clutching his neck as you snipe a bullet through him from 200 yards 
 away. Moments like that make this game a worthy try-out for the 360.

Review:  This is one of those games where its extremely fun and you want everyone you know to play it but 
 its not worth the money to buy beacuse theres not much to it after you beat it. The online is nothing 
 special and needs work leaving you a fun game thats broke.
  
  In SP you go around shooting things in basically "slo-mo". As you progress you unlock new powers 
 (they are called something else) . These gives you special moves like shooting everyone in a 360 
 awesome looking move to a cool move where you aim at ANY part on someone and it follows the bullet 
 to that spot. So if you shoot someone in the "special spot" he will grab himself there as blood 
 sprays out and fall to the ground dead.
  
  And I mention EVERYTHING is destructible? Ever want to be Neo in the Elevator sequence? This is 
 your chance! Pillars, chairs, ceilings, walls, cages.... everything destroys making this a game 
 full of debris! The game also adds a combo system so the more combos you get the more points you 
 get which you use to unlock stuff at the end of the game. Combo meaning you shoot things one after 
 another, but you have to do it stylish. Such as shooting a air conditioner and let it fall on someone, 
 then shoot a propane tank that blow up three guys, then jump on a rail slide on it and kill some 
 more guys. Thats a massive amount of combo style points!
  
  I really can't complain about single player. It was easy at times and then it was incredibly hard 
 at times. It has everything you want in a game that is just made to be fun and nothing else! No 
 silly realism, no fancy game play or story. Just fun action!
  
  The controls may be a little confusing at first but you should get use to them rather quickly.
 
  
  The music and sound is pretty good. Its nothing mind blowing but its good non the less. During 
 cut scenes the audio is actually diffrent each time!
  
  The graphics are pretty amazing I think. They have a weird style to them so don't expect realistic 
 the way you think. They are like John Woos own art style.
  
  The online is not that great. You can still do everything you do online that you do offline but 
 its mostly confusing and all about the guy that grabs the biggest gun first and abuses the powers.
 
  
  Overall its a great game to play and I had a major blast. Not worth buying but DEFINITELY worth 
 the rental if nothing else!

Review:  Midway and John Woo's Stranglehold is a videogame sequel to the classic Hong Kong action flick 
 Hard Boiled . Stranglehold effectively takes a number of original elements and gimmicks that give 
 the game a cinema flavor. It's much more fun than it looks.
  
  You play as Inspector Tequila who is modeled after Chow Yun Fat who portrayed the chracter in the 
 movie. Tequila's a rogue cop on the Hong Kong police force, and when a member of the force turns 
 up dead, Tequila steps up to deal with the situation. It's a decent story that feels very much 
 like a summer Hollywood film. While the game runs only about six or seven hours the action pretty 
 much never lets up. Enemies (Which there are A LOT of them) come flying out of every nook and cranny 
 of each stage, and always with guns blazing and that's fine because our hero has a slew of special 
 abilities to aid him in his battle against the Hong Kong gangs. "Tequila Time" is Strangleholds 
 name for the bullet-time effect used in the Max Payne games. For those unfamiliar with it this 
 ability it puts everything into slow motion helping you to dodge and aim much more. While this 
 is nothing new to this type of game the ability is very welcomed and still feels awesome when taking 
 down 5 or 6 bad guys in a row. "Tequila Time" isn't the only ability at you disposal either. As 
 stated Inspector Tequila can interact with practically every piece of scenery in a level! If you 
 run up to a table, you can choose to slide right over it, or kick it over and use it as a temporary 
 cover point. If you run up to a wall, you can dash up it and dive even further than usual. If there's 
 a rail nearby, you can run up or slide down it. See a little wheel cart sitting around? You can 
 jump onto it and roll around the area, blasting everyone in sight. Not only that, adding to the 
 excitement is that the environments are highly destructible and can be shot and destroyed limiting 
 your cover and leaving a giant mess in your wake. An example of the level of interactivity with 
 your environments is you can have an enemy is standing underneath a neon sign, shoot it and it 
 will then fall and crush your enemy. Pretty cool huh?
  Pulling off stylish moves throughout the game fills up a meter that lets you trigger one of four 
 different "Tequila bombs." These are special abilities that do everything from recharging your 
 health, to letting you spin around in a fury killing all the enemies that surround you. These special 
 abilities are all useful and come in handy many times during the course of the game. Can't seem 
 to hit that sniper way off in the distance? Use the accurate-shot ability (Which allows you to 
 aim in slo-mo and target any part of an enemy's body) and watch the bullet fly directly to its 
 target! Tequila will acquire four "Tequila Bomb" moves during the course of the game each one more 
 devastating then the last.
  One of the more interesting elements of the game is the standoff. These standoffs quickly snap 
 Tequila's focus around from one enemy to the next. Using both analog sticks on the controller, 
 you have to simultaneously dodge enemy gunfire while also trying to put in your shots to take the 
 enemy out. It's pretty fun and breaks the intense gun fights up a little bit even though you're 
 still REALLY shooting guns. Since the game is all about gunfights you know you're bound to come 
 across all sorts of weapons and Stranglehold has got a lot for you. Tequila starts off with his 
 "two friends" a pair of pistols, but along the way you'll be able to acquire assault rifles, submachine 
 guns, heavy machine guns, grenades, and even the occasional rocket launcher to play around with. 
 You can carry two types of guns at once, and normally you'll want the gun that will do the most 
 damage at all times like the shotgun or assault rifle.
  
  Stranglehold can sometimes become a challenging game. It's not really because the enemy AI is so 
 effective but more or less sheer numbers and precise aiming from your opposition and by the time 
 you hit the third or fourth level, you'll see a noticeable jump in difficulty, and you'll actually 
 have to use those different abilities in order to survive . Cover becomes vital but be mindful 
 since you can rarely stay in one place for very long, as the environment around you tends to get 
 destroyed very quickly. Apart from the single-player campaign, there are bonuses to buy, and a 
 multiplayer mode.
  Stranglehold has some of the best graphics I've seen in a multiplayer game yet and by far the most 
 impressive aspect of the game visually is the environments. You really get the feeling of being 
 an action cop in some seriously intense shootouts as you watch them get completely destroyed. Whether 
 you're in a gaudy Hong Kong casino, a lavish penthouse, or a cold, sterile-looking history museum, 
 it's great fun to destroy the scenery. It's really quite impressive how much of every environment 
 is destructible. Even the character models look great. While a bit too shiny they sport detailed 
 facial animations and pretty good lip sync work. The game itself runs smoothly for the most part, 
 save for occasional hiccup but never ruins the action all that much. The audio is also enjoyable 
 as Chow Yun-Fat joins the voice cast. The voice acting is quite solid overall and in general sells 
 the characters as well as the story. The soundtrack is a nice mix of orchestral pieces and Asian-flavored 
 string sections, and the game's sound effects are top-notch. The gunfire sounds right on and the 
 effects of bullets hitting each and every type of surface are fantastic. Stranglehold has enough 
 unique moments and overall challenge to warrant at the very least a rental. Sure, it gets repetitive 
 at times, but there's a lot of exciting action if you're looking for something to just have fun 
 with.

Review:  Stranglehold is a game that almost made it. The only thing is that it's been done before, ala max 
 payne. Just throw in some new moves and the ability to interact with the environments and poof, 
 you have stranglehold.
  The voices are pretty well done except for a few of the lines that seem to have been read off the 
 sheet. It's what you would expect from a title that has John Woo as the inspiration for it.
  The graphics are pretty good, not as good as Mass Effect or Gears of War, but they do the job. As 
 well do the cut-scenes in the game. The environments are done as usual games are.
  As for the problems in the game, well, there are a few. For starters the first few levels have you 
 blowing up the same drug table time after time after time. This just gets repetitive after the 1000th 
 time. Also the levels seem to be drawn out too long and many parts look the same as where you just 
 were. And some of the things you have to shoot are not easily had as they don't stand out and you 
 have to look for it. Its a short game too.
  All in all stranglehold is a game where you have to be a die-hard woo fan to get into. I love all 
 the HK gangster films and found this game to be fun but at the same time lacking in what could 
 have been. Rent this game and give it a shot and if you like it, well too bad, you will probably 
 beat it before you buy it. O yeah, wheres Danny Lee?

Review:  The Good: Good looking character models, good voice work, great sound effects and explosions, decent 
 variety of weapons, Tequila's abilities change the up the formula a little bit, decent amount to 
 unlock, the online multiplayer is good in theory.
  
  The Bad: Single player will last 4-6 hours, and after that there's not much left to do, online 
 multiplayer seems like a good thing, but is just above passable, not a very wide array of weapons, 
 formula hasn't changed much from games like Max Payne.
  
  There's been a fair share of clones for games of a Max Payne nature. A notable series, Dead to 
 Rights. But now Midway has come up with Stranglehold, a short, action oriented Max Payne "clone" 
 that has a few subtle and not so subtle changes to the original formula.
  
  If you've ever seen Hard Boiled, you'll know the kind of guy Inspector Tequila is. Tequila (played 
 as Chow Yun-Fat in both Stranglehold and Hard Boiled) is a tough as nails cop who does thing his 
 way and his way only. What's his way? Well it isn't exactly what you'd find in your standard Hong 
 Kong Standard Police Regulations book. To put it quite simply, Tequila kicks ass and takes names. 
 He damages a lot of stuff, blows up a lot of things, kills a lot of people, and looks pretty damn 
 cool doing it too.
  
  So in Stranglehold, you take the role as Inspector Tequila. Your daughter and wife have been kidnapped 
 and are involved in rival Hong Kong gangs fighting for them. In the midst of all this your taking 
 sides with gangs (and inevitably eliminating them) in hopes of seeing your daughter and wife alive. 
 But how's one guy supposed to get the job done? One guy at a time is how.
  
  The core gameplay for Stranglehold is your general Max Payne styled formula. In case you're pondering 
 what that might be, it's your standard 3rd person shooting. However to help you in slaughtering 
 hundreds of gang members, you have a little ability called Tequila Time. This comes into effect 
 most often when you pull the Left Trigger. Pulling the left trigger will result in two things, 
 Tequila will dive in the direction you are pointing the Left Stick, and time will slow down. How 
 could this benefit you? The main aspect of this is too let Tequila drift while you move your reticle 
 towards your enemies. A gimmick? Hardly. The 2 abilities are pretty well crucial to your survival. 
 Stranglehold is one of the many games where standing still will result in a game over. So you might 
 as well save your life, and look cool at the same time.
  
  Diving will also benefit you in another way of survival. Stranglehold has a, well, scoring system 
 of sorts. By diving and killing people, you will rack up something known as stylish points. By 
 looking cool and killing people, your style meter will start to increase. Each kill will give you 
 1-5 stars each. 1 star resulting in a standard kill, 5 stars usually being very badass; like running 
 up a wall and blowing up an enemy with a propane tank.
  By racking up stylish points, you'll fill a meter which contains 4 "Tequila bombs". Also crucial 
 to survival. In the order of when they appear, you have a Health boost, Precision Aim, Barrage, 
 and a Spin Attack.
  
  The Health Boost is pretty self explanatory; it will quite simply fill your health up by approx. 
 1/6. Precision aim will zoom in to a certain magnitude as well as slow down time. You then move 
 your reticle towards an enemy body part and fire. Surprisingly, the enemy will respond quite realistically 
 to where the bullet hits. Hitting them in the teeth, the eye, the forehead, chest, shoulder, forearm, 
 wrist, hand, firearm, knee, foot and "down there" if you catch my drift, are just to name a few. 
 Barrage is the most useful technique, second to that of Health Boost. Tequila goes insane. You 
 have infinite ammunition at the time and are free to run and blast enemies as you see fit. Finally 
 spin move, which you will probably use least often. Tequila will grab his weapon and start shooting 
 rapidly in a circular motion while laying waste to most enemies on screen. Also, doves will come 
 out of nowhere. A John Woo tradition. Using these abilities will take a portion off of your Tequila 
 Bomb meter. Health Boost will take 1/4th of the meter away, as will Precision shot. Barrage can 
 last just about as long as you want it too, as you can cancel the move any time you want too. The 
 Spin Move though, takes  of the meter away, and will only kill about 4 enemies usually.
  
  The controls for the game work pretty well. RT is for firing your weapon, LT is for Diving and 
 all interactions. LB will throw you into cover, A will switch weapons, and the left and right control 
 sticks do what they usually do, move the camera and move your character. The controls are made 
 simple and therefore make the game accessible, another pro for the game. Stranglehold also sports 
 a Standoff element. This pits you and a ton of other people in a shootout minigame. One at a time 
 Tequila will focus on one of the enemies. By moving the left stick, tequila will move left or right 
 as you see fit. Don't be moving about though, cause the bad guys will be shooting at you. Moving 
 the Right stick will move your reticle, and pulling the RT will fire your weapon. It's fun and 
 changes things up a little bit. It doesn't come up a whole lot so there's no need to complain about 
 it. So now that the good of the gameplay has been revealed, its now time to mention the bad of 
 it.
  
  Short and sweet probably depicts the game pretty well. The game is fun, but it really will only 
 last around 5 hours to complete. There are only 7 levels to complete. Some of which will take an 
 hour, some of which will only take half of that.
  
  Also, most will find that the gameplay is quite repetitive. You get all of your Tequila bombs pretty 
 close to the beginning. It's a blessing and a curse. Yes you will have a better chance of survival, 
 but it also doesn't let you stay excited for new things later on. The majority of the game you 
 will be diving and shooting. There are some other special things like jumping off a wall, and running 
 up banisters and such, but the majority of you'll be doing is diving. Finally, an annoying flaw 
 that comes up every now and then is when the game tries to be puzzle oriented. Certain parts of 
 levels will require you to shoot something or dive to a certain point in order to get across something. 
 Most notably in the second level, you'll come across a pile of wreckage. Metaphorically, it's a 
 needle in a haystack. There is one tiny little spot that you must shoot in order to proceed, which 
 can take a while to hit. It really slows down the fast paced action its supposed to have. Stranglehold 
 also sports online multiplayer. But its barely passable. You still get to jump off walls, run up 
 banisters, dive, and use your Tequila bombs, but Tequila Time doesn't work as well as many would 
 hope. It only works when somebody else is simultaneously doing it with you. That doesn't sound 
 so bad, but you really have to witness it first hand for it to get on your nerves. The Audio Visuals 
 department is lacking a whole lot. The graphics are up to par with the 360. Tequila looks great 
 as do the other characters. The facial features such as creases, wrinkles and facial gestures (such 
 as change of emotion) all look pretty good and flow pretty realistically. The voice synch connects 
 with the voice acting pretty well to boot.
  
  Everything else looks great too. Most notably, people dieing and explosions. Something that a lot 
 of games are doing nowadays is not making games as brutal as they should be. Stranglehold has a 
 combination of realism and fake awesomeness. When you headshot a guy, there is nothing neat and 
 tidy about it. There is a huge explosion of blood and a decent pitched scream involved. Shooting 
 explosive barrels and propane tanks also leaves a satisfying explosion. The best of the graphics 
 is probably seen in the Precision Aim cut scenes. Its just amazing to see the blood coming out 
 and how smooth the animations are as the enemy responds to the bullet in their body. Its just brutal 
 in every possible way. The game has with the graphics an equally impressive sound department. There 
 isn't a whole lot to say actually. The game minuses a soundtrack, but its not entirely necessary. 
 The sound effects make up a fair portion of the entire sound in the game. And it impresses as well. 
 The different guns sound unique and realistic. And the explosions sound fantastic as well. Next 
 to that are the enemy's voices. They are often recycled but its hard to tell without paying attention 
 to it. There's so much chaos and explosions going on that it really wont bother you. The only thing 
 better then the sound effects is the Voice Acting. Its just top notch. The voice actors really 
 sell and commit to the whole shebang. Chow Yun-Fat voices Tequila and he's probably the best of 
 the crew. Overall there's nothing to complain about here.
  
  Stranglehold has a standard price tag for 360 games, and its really up to the person for the decision 
 of purchasing it. If your looking for advice, rent it. The single player features a good load of 
 fun, brutality, graphics and sound, but only 4 hours or so of it, which really isn't long enough 
 for the asking price. At least when you rent it, your seeing all there is to see, and only for 
 a fraction of the price. Overall, Stranglehold is a fast paced, adrenaline packed, mind bending 
 action game that is impressive on all fronts. It features a decent story, with solid graphics, 
 sound effects and voice acting. Its definetly worth checking out for a small diversion, for fans 
 of Action games, fans of Max Payne or Dead To Rights, and any fans of Hard Boiled who always wanted 
 to be like Tequila, but due to its short story mode its hard to recommend for purchase.

Review:  The Good: High production values makes you feel like you're in a movie, superb voice acting, Tequila's 
 moves are awesome, blood galore!
  
  The Bad: Shorter than short, unbalanced difficulty makes things extremely frustrating at times, 
 boring and uninspired story, gets derivative about half way through
  
  Stranglehold has so much going for it but it falls flat on it's face due to the fact that it provides 
 so little. You really feel like you're in a high budget action movie full of 100% destructible 
 environments and tons of stylish moves. You can run up railings, slide down them, back flip off 
 walls, do Max Payne/Matrix dives, slow down time. You have a few cool abilities such as a sniper 
 shot where you can precisely shoot an area on the enemy and enjoy the awesome animations. You have 
 a Barrage power where you are invincible, can shoot 10 times faster, and have infinite ammo for 
 a few seconds, and a spin attack which kills everyone in the room. The graphics and audio is top 
 notch and looks great and there isn't any slow down even with hundreds of things flying around 
 the room. There are a bunch of interesting unlockables in here as well. The story is somewhat interesting 
 but is really confusing and feels incomplete. Tequila is trying to get his family back from two 
 rivaling gangs known as the Russian I-9s and the Chinese Dragon Claws. It's short, confusing, and 
 kind of boring really. While all this is good and all the game is extremely short where you can 
 finish it in less than 10 hours, and the game gets really repetitive after about half way through. 
 Sure there are turret sequences and all that but it doesn't mix things up enough. The game is a 
 blast while it lasts and is good for a fun rental but nothing more.

Review:  Stranglehold is essentially a sequel in video game format to a legendary film featuring Chow yung 
 fat called Hard-Boiled, although you certainly won't need to see the movie to understand the plot 
 . Basically you're Tequila, a tough inspector in china who finds a photograph of a killed cop and 
 investigates the on-goings blah blah blah....
  
  But if you rented/bought this game, you're probably not playing this game for plot, you're playing 
 for action-packed astounding gameplay. Well, does it deliver? Yes, and no. The graphics and gameplay 
 are somewhat like the Max Payne system - You're in the middle, it's third-person, you can slow 
 down time/special moves, but there's a twist, you'll be doing far more regarding the environment 
 which is really the more interesting part. You can slide down rails, ride carts belly first, and 
 plenty of other possibilities.
  
  However these fun parts aside, you'll find a lot of the meat of this game sort of goes the crackdown 
 method: Insane amounts of shooting at you at once, except in this case you can't just be cloned 
 again with a little less experience, you have to go back from a checkpoint, one that becomes increasingly 
 more annoying as the chapters progress. By the 6th level you'll be wanting to put the controller 
 down and just leave the game away for a little because how frustrating the combination of overkilling 
 enemies and lack of autosaving can be.
  
  Sound wise is spectacular, surprisingly enough. The music pumps you through just about every part 
 of the game, and the voice acting is actually top notch. The game itself only goes about 8 hours 
 realistically: maybe a ltitle extra for xbox live and the unlock shop, but not likely. Unless origami 
 videos really make you want to get out a piece of paper and have at it, it's not going to last. 
 If you're looking for action packed insanity, try gears of war first. If you're a die-hard fan 
 of the Chow or the Woo, go ahead and get it.

Review:  http://www. projectcoe. com/microsoft/games/stranglehold_360. html? var1=sc3
  
  Somehow in the midst of all the previews I've done in the past three weeks for COE, you would think 
 it to be amazing how I could find time to actually review a game eh? Well, even though it's way 
 later than we would've liked, here is your critique of John Woo's Stranglehold. I walked away from 
 all the crazy and chaotic gunfire with mixed reactions, but ended up liking more of the game than 
 I disliked. Read on to understand my feelings all-around.
  
  In the case that you aren't familiar with John Woo, he is a movie director [now with game production 
 experience] who's accredited by many for inventing the concept of bullet-time. That is exactly 
 what Stranglehold, the spiritual predecessor to the movie Hard Boiled, is all about, intense bullet 
 spraying action. Therefore, when you consider the reputation of the infamous Inspector Tequila 
 and Midway's extremely dynamic Massive D system, you're bound for a treat. The premise of the game 
 may be pretty simple in that Tequila takes on Russian and Hong Kong gangs after his ex-wife and 
 daughter are kidnapped, but killing people with guns has almost never been more enjoyable.
  
  Stranglehold emphasizes two things, taking out those aforementioned criminals with style, while 
 also turning the environment against them. The game's trademarked Massive D concept allows Tequila 
 [as you control him of course] to interact with his surroundings in ways we've never quite seen 
 before. During any of the game's seven missions, anything that you see glowing in a white light 
 nearby indicates that you can run along, dive onto, or swing from it. It's unfortunate that this 
 functionality doesn't always work smoothly, but that doesn't take away from how fun it is to do. 
 That glowing light also extends to anything in the environment, mostly above ground, that can be 
 shot at to bring about unconventional death. Any time you kill an enemy in extremely cool fashion, 
 the game awards you with prized style points, and there are numerous ways of being recognized for 
 such feats. Basic headshots always net you at least one star [the style points graphic] , but if 
 you kill while doing other nifty things like grinding down or scaling a stair rail, running along 
 tops of walls, swinging from chandeliers, or riding on top of a roll cart, you can string together 
 some insane combos and enjoy every second of it. My proudest moment was running up a banister, 
 killing enemies I engaged on the stairs, only to dive off the side before reaching the top, and 
 capping more in mid-air as I floated down to the floor in sick bullet-time fashion. The possibilities 
 here aren't exactly endless, but you'll as might as well think of it that way. What seriously impressed 
 me though is the fact that Midway's Massive D is the real deal. There wasn't a single object I 
 shot in that didn't react, even if it was just a minor GSW in a glass panel, kudos to the developers. 
 What the style points are really for is scoring the chance to use Tequila Bombs, the Inspector's 
 special combat moments. There are four in total: Health Regeneration, Precision Aim, Barrage and 
 Spin Attack; and each have wonderful uses. In the heat of battle, if you determine that no health 
 packs are in the local vicinity, Health Regeneration can save your ass from certain peril. It's 
 always wiser to make use of cover whenever possible [even though Massive D keeps it from lasting 
 forever] , since you'll find yourself having a bit of an easier time dealing with large enemy groups. 
 When you activate Precision Aim, your view automatically zooms in on your targeted enemy. It's 
 then up to you to shift your reticule to pick a damage location and watch your bullet fly in slow-mo 
 as you're treated to a sick death animation [since your foe immediately grabs wherever you hit 
 him] . Whenever that happens to be their eye or mouth, you simply can't feel more satisfied. Barrage 
 makes Tequila temporarily invincible and grants him unlimited ammo, as you gun down gang member 
 after gang member in one-shot kill fashion, extremely rewarding when you're stuck in a sticky situation. 
 Finally, if you're a John Woo fan, you can easily see how Spin Attack was inspired by him. When 
 used, the game shifts to a scripted cut sequence of Tequila using whatever weapons you currently 
 have, spinning with them, and eliminating any Chinamen or Russians in the area at the current time, 
 all while white doves encircle the likeness of Chow Yun-Fat. Seriously folks, this is the kind 
 of stuff that makes Stranglehold just a fun game to play. The last gameplay point to note is Standoffs. 
 At certain points in every mission, Tequila finds himself conveniently surrounded by three or more 
 gang members, and this is when the game shifts to a more over-the-shoulder perspective. Using one 
 stick to dodge left or right, the other to aim, and the right shoulder button to fire, Mr. Yun-Fat 
 takes advantage of bullet-time as you try to take out each assailant before the sequence ends. 
 Whether that occurs by plain gunfire or shooting at explosives is up to you. It's great that these 
 Standoffs serve as a pleasant distraction from the usual run 'n gun gameplay, as I always enjoyed 
 mentally pointing out, You missed me! There is one significant issue though, and it's that the 
 game does eventually become awfully repetitive, as you do pretty much the same damn thing in every 
 mission. That hardly makes the game bad, but it's very noticeable after the third mission. Sure 
 it's sweet to fill enemies with lead virtually every three seconds, but that causes the somewhat 
 one-dimensional core play to rear its ugly head. Nevertheless, it's time to move on to the rest 
 of Stranglehold's offerings.
  
  The presentation ranks pretty high on my best ever seen list. John Woo's Stranglehold proves to 
 be a wonderful hybrid of a game that executes like a movie, but is also enjoyable in most facets. 
 The overall design was better than I thought it would be, as the heavy hitting actor models are 
 top-notch in how they look, act and animate. The enemies could've been more diverse though, as 
 you tend to gun down what looks like the same dude for the majority of each mission. It's nothing 
 that hurts the experience though. Also worth praising is the voice work. Chow Yun-Fat doesn't just 
 lend his physical likeness to Tequila, he's also responsible for all his lines, many of which are 
 witty and humorous, but he also has a serious side, which helps retain his sense of humanity. Every 
 major character has a speaking role in fact, and the enemies do too, including the ones that really 
 sound like they have some mental issues as they charge at you with no reservation. The music is 
 mostly forgettable, even if it does the job it needed to, and the sound effects kick ass, as I 
 found myself never being able to hear the submachine guns or the pop of an enemy's head with your 
 trusty shotgun quite enough.
  
  In terms of longevity, this is easily Stranglehold weakest area, which is really disappointing 
 all-around. I was able to complete the game on Normal difficulty in less than a six hour sitting. 
 It only took that long because I had to repeat certain sections of a couple missions a few times 
 because I wasn't using cover like I should've [and keep that in mind for yourself if you ever play 
 too] . There is something positive to that in the light that I was addicted because I was having 
 a lot of fun, but it still feels way too short. Now granted when you finish the first time, you 
 can purchase locked items in the store owned by Mr. Woo himself [which includes multiplayer characters, 
 concept art and videos] , but that doesn't exactly do anything to offer extended value. Even the 
 multiplayer is more of an afterthought than anything else, as chances are you won't go into it 
 again after checking it out at least once. The real meat of Stranglehold is playing through the 
 fairly captivating plot, you just eat through it too quickly.
  
  That is why the game is very tough to judge in an overall sense. John Woo's interactive Hard Boiled 
 spiritual predecessor is one of the more fulfilling third-person shooters that I've had the good 
 fortune to experience recently, but I simply can't shake the disappointment from the game's brief 
 and somewhat monotonous nature. It's sad, because more could've been done to make Stranglehold 
 a bit more dynamic, but if Mr. Woo felt accomplished enough with what Midway did with his project, 
 then more power to him. At least it's a solid game all-around, even if it just barely misses the 
 mark of greatness. Hopefully in the future the inventor of cinematic bullet-time feels up to producing 
 another title similar to Stranglehold, as I could surely see myself being attracted to it.

Review:  bad joke i know, but really this game feels like Max Payne, the game play is good, is fun for a 
 while, is really short so you can finish it in 4 or 6 hours depending on your skills. but once 
 you get the hang of head shooting it becomes really easy.
  
  Tequila skills are awesome, he is a mean killing machine, perfect!!!
  but you get them in the 
 course of the game, why??? don't know, the story feels weak, but it comes out well in the end.
 
  
  Graphics feel old. the unreal engine was used to make the game but nothing special in the look 
 of the game. this is not a must buy, you can rent it and if you like it then buy it, used.
  the achievements are easily made, you have to replay some scenes a lot but is piece of cake. this 
 game may force old officer Payne to step up and do something new.

Review:  Sorry, but I cannot grasp how this game even managed to achieve a rating of 7 on gamespot. This 
 game is super lame. Some levels drag on so much that you just want to turn off your system. And 
 I experienced this on only the second level, where you constantly have to blow up the drugs and 
 plant tons of bombs. I went way past, but stopped at one point and decided that if I hated playing 
 it up to that point, it would not get better.
  
  First off, let me say it has some great ideas, but not very well implemented. For example, sliding 
 on a counter, maybe I would like it better if it seemed more real. If you walk up to a counter, 
 he automatically slides on it. How? Even when he has no momentum and then bumps into it, he can 
 slide a mile without even having to shift to gain more momentum. Another thing that is HORRIBLY 
 implemented into the game is cover. You can only press up against the wall on certain walls but 
 even if you can, it has to be on a corner, and you cannot slide down. So, while you're covering 
 , you can still be shot from enemies at an angle in the room, because your guys arm sticks out 
 a bit. What kind of idiot would just stand there?! There are also so many things in the game I 
 wanted to get cover from, but you can't. Why not? So many things could be used, but only SOME corners 
 of SOME walls - which is rediculous.
  
  Another thing that really set me off was the diving. Sure, cool, you can dive and shoot. Who can't? 
 But every time.. freaking slow motion. The slow motion in the game is so over-done that you want 
 to run laps around your room to feel back to normal. I gave up playing at the one boss where there 
 are trip laser mines all over the place and you have to chase him through and shoot him and others 
 while doing this. Why did I give up? Because it is STUPID. I had ranged weapons, and unloaded CLIPS 
 into him, but did NO damage. They take away health from him during the course of the chase, which 
 is ridiculous since he can shoot you from range but you can not do anything but run at him and 
 get nailed by the bullets - especially when trying to take cover but figuring out that you can't 
 cuz it isn't a corner of the wall, which leads to you getting filled with more bullets! Such a 
 stupid design. Everything in the game is attained so easily. All the special things this game has 
 to offer, like the totally unrealistic I'm gonna stuff my weapons with more bullets I grabbed out 
 of my ass and become immune to bullets . What the hell is that? You get out of that mode and you 
 have just as many bullets as before, but yet you can unload 8 clips without reloading while in 
 the mode. It is a cool feature, but come on...
  
  The storyline is alright, but it is also dumb. How come this one guy can be everywhere and finish 
 everything before any of the other cops can figure out where anything is? And the **** this guy 
 gets away with, you would think he would be some kind of god. His boss is always yelling at him 
 for disobeying the law, but then he just lets him go again and again, until the guy turns his badge 
 in himself and continues on his conquest. It just makes no sense that this guy can, without help 
 from anyone else, find out where all the bad guys are located, have the best/fastest transportation, 
 and finish it all before any other cop can get there. In conclusion, I have to say I am super disappointed. 
 From all the advertising (OMG JON WOOOOOOO) , and trailers, and commercials, I really thought they 
 would have gotten the game right. I am telling all my friends to stay away from this game, even 
 stopped one from buying this game. I am hoping to save a few more people from this rip-off. Don't 
 buy it unless you enjoy playing really bad games.

Review:  When talking of John Woo the first thing many have in mind is movies, hardcore action movies where 
 always the good guys deal with their business the good old fashion way - with guns. I'm sure a 
 lot of a lot haven't even heard of Chow Yun Fat before this game was announced, but if you have 
 then you should have noticed that this guy still rocks! This guys devotion to this project is just 
 amazing, and i'm sure if you have played this game you will notice that this guy gives it his all 
 when he's ''at work''. So on to the game part of this:
  
  First of all the graphics. The graphics are really pleasing and i'm sure that at least 95% of players 
 that have played this game will really admire the graf work done on the environment though it could 
 take some work on the enemy character models which are really almost all the same.
  
  Gameplay. The games best part of course is the single player mode with all the story and suff, 
 but you really can't bring down the multiplayer either, I mean if you get a bunch of people that 
 are really enjoying this game, I'm sure you won't be sorry of playing the multiplayer at any time.
 
  
  Sound. To describe the sound of the game you only need three words: Chow Yun Fat. Period.
  
 
  So after spending a bunch of time playing the game I really think this is one of those games that 
 kind of takes you in, where you really care what happens to the characters, though I have to admit 
 it leaves you wanting more which makes this game short and at some point is a dissapointment. I 
 think my position is clear - buy the game, play the game and of course, enjoy!

Review:  stranglehold you could say is the sum of all the last bullet time tons of bullets fast paced action 
 games. stranglehold takes all the good and improves it but brings the bad in too. now in strangle 
 hold you'll get 4 special moves that you get to use once you have filled a meter up to the correct 
 place to use. you can heal get an accurate shot that kills in 1 hit usually a rampage mode and 
 kill everyone in the area with a cool movie style spinning move. theres also bullet time which 
 done quite well. it is refilling constantly so you aren't getting pissed off as you get killed 
 in a barrage of bullets. this keeps the action going and allows for a better experience. the multiplayer 
 is like most games recently useless because it offers only online play. its also shallow. the games 
 boss fights/levels vary and are done really nice so thumbs up. there is a problem its really really 
 really short and theres no way in hell its worth 60 or 50 bucks. in other words buy it when its 
 cheap kids

Review:  Stranglehold is a great game. Its got the action and the graphics that anyone could ask for, it 
 just seems to come short in the gameplay department.
  
  Graphically the game is superb. Its got really nice textures everything explodes and destroys well. 
 Chows model looks superb and even looks like hes wounded when you take too much damage.
  
  The story is pretty straight forward. Cop goes after his love that has been kidnapped by a gang. 
 Nothing you've never really heard or seen before... but thats fine.
  
  The gameplay is what seems to be both fulfilling and lacking. Its solid and plays very very well. 
 But its just, solid. It doesnt really have the bang and sizzle that i thought it would have. In 
 fact halfway through the game it feels like you've seen everything and done everything. For the 
 most part you use the same slo-mo dive to blast enemies. And there is no normal jump button so 
 whenever you wish to get to a higher ledge you have to dive to it. Which just makes it kind of 
 silly. The game does try to mix it up with a use of specials like a barrage... where you basically 
 stuff your guns full of bullets and for about 20 seconds you are invincible and are in a shooting 
 frenzy. they also have a sniper shot, which is (besides bosses) a one hit kill. These are cool 
 at first, but you find yourself using them less and less as the game goes on... which is funny because 
 that is when you really need them. Instead you use that meter for health.
  
  The game goes from easy to breakneck at the most random times. And they like to send wave of wave 
 of men for you to slaughter. To the point where it gets crazy unreal. They send in waves of bad 
 guy swat teams that break in from the roofs like they are ninjas on a mission. It just gets silly 
 at times, but it does make the action feel really intense, and that is good.
  
  All in all strangle hold is a very solid game... but not revolutionary. Maybe next time.
  
  
 I give it a 8.0 out of 10

Review:  For some time my friends were saying that this was gonna be great quick pase game with a nice destructible 
 environment and online play they said that this could be better then.... sorry folks no my words..... 
 better then Gears of War. I never believed it. Well the game was out and on the first hour of game 
 play it already felt dried and boring and as I progressed into the game I couldn't bear all the 
 repetition in the game. You are constantly doing either the same thing over and over again or minor 
 variations of the same thing. well that aside the game is repetitive and dull at moments (most 
 moments) the AI lacks a brain some times and there is only a hand full of special moves. Tequila 
 time fews inconsistent as sometime it will last long times and other most in boss fights will be 
 over very fast. The game also lacks a few things that are minor but you can see that for yourself 
 I would only rent this game after trying the demo as it will give a feel of the game, but if you 
 don't mind doing repetitive tasks like a robot you may actually like this game. I know I don't.

Review:  Not sure why it was rated so low. I think the game is great. Explosive enviroment. Everything is 
 distructable. Graffics are above average and I like the bullet time when everything slows down. 
 The story is strong and the playability is there. Play it once on normal then play it again and 
 totally destroy everything the second time through. Was worth the price of admission. I highly 
 recommend it. Nice plot twists through the game too. The reason I rate it so high is the ability 
 to blow lots of stuff up. And the different shooting techniques and all the different guns you 
 get to shoot. Give this game a try!

Review:  The more you play this game the better you look at it. The story mode had a new turn at the end 
 of just about every level. You're never safe due to the fact that any piece of cover is destructable. Your 
 character (tequila) has the most moves i've seen in a while (wall jump, banister slide, dive, precision 
 shot, barrage, spin attack, etc.) . The story mode was rather short however. Online play is very fast 
 paced and solid but i felt let down at the amount of weapons there are in this game (7) . Also, something 
 i saw in this game that I dont usually see is some interesting unlockable content, specifically 
 videos. You MUST atleast try this game.

Review:  John Woo is all through this game. Very nice. However, most of the enemies will come up on you 
 from behind. Thing is terribly frustrating. Bad camera angles from a movie director shouldn't be 
 allowed. It hurts the action oriented pulse of the game. Another issue is the difficult levels. 
 Even on casual, the game gets tough. And on hard, you'll spend time blowing a whole clip into a 
 guy that won't go down. The nicest thing about this game is the Tequila Time. Being able to slow 
 down and blast guys is completely awesome. Then when you add in the special moves, like bullet 
 time and rampage, it just makes the game leap. Really saved a mediocre game.

Review:  Where do we start with a review of John Woo's stranglehold? Probably with obvious comparisons to 
 other games that have been made like this previously. The two that spring to mind instantly when 
 loading up the game are Max Payne and The Matrix, unfortunately this sits more comfortably with 
 the latter. I think I should say from the beginning that I think Max Payne is one of the best shoot 
 em' ups ever made for consoles and pc's. Now obviously this game is a rip-off of films like The 
 Matrix and many others made by John Woo, but it pulls it off with such style, and with a great 
 noir story, that it is completely forgivable. Anyway, back to stranglehold. Unfortunately this 
 game did not have the `cool' factor one would expect from John Woo. To be honest its like his films, 
 all style and no substance (although they are enjoyable) , and by the end of it your left feeling 
 a little cheated that you haven't seen anything thats new, and it wasn't as cool as you hoped it 
 would be. All in all it took me about 4-5 hours to complete it, which is surprisingly short for 
 a game that costs &pound;40. When you first load up the game it has to be said that it looks awesome, 
 some of the best graphics on next gen consoles so far. It has some great ideas that are implemented 
 quite well, there's the obvious tequila time (read: bullet time) , as well as tequila bombs which 
 allow you to top up your health, precision aim, which is similar to using the sniper rifle on Payne, 
 barrage which loads your clip with ultra powerful bullets and leaves you invulnerable for a short 
 period of time and finally a spin attack which takes out every enemy in the room (it looks cool 
 but removes a lot of skill from the player) . There are also the classic John Woo standoffs which 
 see you dodging bullets neo style and firing off a quick couple of rounds to incapacitate enemies. 
 Unfortunately, although some of these ideas are great, and they do look fantastic, the level design 
 can be a little clunky. It is true that the environments are completely destructible, and that 
 when you have laid waste to tons of armed thugs the end result is much like the end of the lobby 
 scene in The Matrix, unfortunately there is no progression within levels. For instance, on one 
 level you get a deal going down in a bar and they realise you're a cop so start firing at you. 
 From this point on you are left running around the bar shooting enemy after enemy for ages before 
 finally you are greeted by another cut scene and then start the whole process again, albeit it 
 in a different environment. Another problem is that the guns all feel pretty much the same, granted 
 the golden gun kills people with one shot, but aside from that it really doesn't matter what you 
 pick up as your just going to be holding down the trigger anyway going for simple run and gun tactics. 
 It is also true that you can slide across tables, down banisters, jump onto trolleys, etc, but 
 whenever you approach them you a greeted with a glowing white line showing you that you can in 
 fact jump onto it. The unfortunate thing with this is that it jar's against the realistic look 
 of the game, and you end feeling like your constantly playing the first tutorial level of an EA 
 game. One final criticism is how it doesn't quite pull off the combo/kill system as well as I had 
 hoped. I was lead to believe that you would be able to string your kills and acrobatic movements 
 together in an almost Tony Hawk style manner, but it doesn't quite succeed in this respect either. 
 All in all, Midway have delivered us a decent Shoot em up game, but doesn't live up to all the 
 Hype

Review:  Well with all the hype over this game i was expecting some revolutionary perhaps as revolutionary 
 as Soul Calibre was when it was released but instead all i got was another Max Paine clone.
  
  Sure, the graphics are good and for the first couple of hours its a lot of fun but soon it 
 turns into another game where you just go from place to place and shoot people. The only saving 
 grace is the Precision Shot where you can aim a shot to shoot any part of a person and watch it 
 all in slow motion, shoot a guy it the nuts and he cradles his groin but even that gets a little 
 old after a while.
  
  All in all, if you loved Max Paine on the PS2 then you will love Stranglehold but just dont expect 
 something which hasnt been done a hundred times already with just a new name and new graphics.

Review:  What an awesome game! Makes a nice refreshing change to see something a little different in the 
 action/shooting genre on the 360 other than FPS after FPS! Gears of War did it first (although 
 gears is far superior) but now we have a Max Payne style shooter for the 360 which is more than 
 welcome. It doesnt stray too much from the gameplay style of the Max Payne games but is that a 
 bad thing? No, in fact its great. Add in some additional highlights like sliding across tables 
 and smashing through giant watermelons ( youl know what I mean when you see it!) , racing across 
 a square laying on a shopping trolley, berettas in hand and the amusing pinpoint shots where you 
 can aim at a particular part of the enemies body and watch the bullet fly all the way to its target. 
 cool! Also a great feature is the standoff where you simultaneously dodge bullets in 'tequilla 
 time' while picking of a number of bad guys. If you liked Max Payne I dare say you will love this 
 and although it seems a little mindless at times and slightly repetitive, it can be easily forgiven 
 when your sliding down a handrail pumping out shotgun rounds at heavys on stairs or when you pick 
 off that neon sign that starts off a chain reaction ending up wiping out the oblivious bad guy. 
 Awesome!
  Buy it, you wont regret it!

Review:  This game should get boring, repetitive and old fast but it doesn't. 
  
  Its what i've always wanted in an action game: to actually feel like i'm playing the part of the 
 renegade cop in an action movie, and most important of all, to kick the bad gun-wielding guys asses. 
 
  
  You get to run up and push yourself backwards of walls in slow motion (tequila time) and shoot 
 with a gun in each hand. 
  You get to slide along tables and on trolleys all whilst blowing stuff up. 
  
  What more could 
 you want???
  
  Ok, so it is short and pretty difficult in some places, but it seriously kicks ass. 
  
  Its 
 all done to make you feel like your part of a cool John Woo film & how can that be a bad thing?
 
  
  You can complete it in a couple of days, but hey! most games are short on the 360. 
  
  Own it or rent it, just make sure you play it.

Review:  Stranglehold isn't innovative by many standards at all. Let's get that out of the way. It's a 3rd 
 person shooter 'bout a cop in Hong Kong takin out oodles and oodles of baddies. Original? Not so 
 much. It's certainly been done to death in the movies, and it's all been done before in video games. 
 However, much in the way that Watson and Crick did when they unlocked the final mysteries behind 
 DNA, Joh Woo and Midway have managed to stand on the shoulders of giants in innovation and have 
 built something that is neither movie nor videogame but a very entertaining hybrid of the two; 
 and it's own crazy, stylish way... is entirely new after all. To boot, it is an absolute joy to 
 play also! In short it is like living through a really good action movie.
  
  If you're unfamiliar, the gist of the game is based as a sequel to John Woo's classic action film: 
 Hardboiled with Chow Yun Fat as Inspector Tequila. He returns in this game to reprise his role 
 with stellar voice acting, and yes all the voice acting is great, but the plot isn't where the game 
 shines. I mean c'mon, how good can an action movie really be? No, the beauty of Stranglehold is 
 in it's simple yet refined sense of style. Jown Woo worked on the game as creative producer, and 
 the game was in a near 3yr development cycle and it shows. The graphics are typically gorgeous, 
 and every sensory enticement that one can imagine is executed with skill, care and love for the 
 games and movies. Character animations are of particular note: in many cases I could swear it -was- 
 a movie I was watching. Everyone looks and moves great.
  
  Now onto the technical jargin. Particle effects are amazing and more in line with a chaotic reaction 
 demanded of a game with so dynamic and engine. The game engine allows for freestyle expression 
 of carnage emphasized by Tequila's ability not only to interact with but use to his advantage everything 
 in his environment. See a chandelier, leap and swing from one balcont to the other. Let go, spin 
 around shoot the cor and drop the chandelier onto enemies below. See that drink cart? Dive onto 
 it and roll across the room shooting twelve enemies in slow mo. Friggin sweet. A constantly refilling 
 bullet-time meter allows you to rack up energy for what comes next, the T-bomb.
  
  Ahh, the glorious -tequila bomb gauge- No, no. It is neither a questionable beverage in Tiajuana, 
 nor is it a bad combo platter at the local taqueria. It's your characters special attack meter. 
 As you fill it you can pull off precision sniper slo mo shots that follow the bullet in flight 
 all the way to the bad guy who eats it. And yes they react dynamically depending on where you shoot 
 them. Get him in the hand and he freaks out dropping his gun and crying. Get him in the head and 
 typical head shot animation ensues. I was impressed when you hit him in the shoulder it spin him 
 around in the air, or if you should tag the family jewels he will grab for them, and collapse like 
 you would expect. It's awesome. There is also a barrage attack where you move a lot faster blasting 
 away at uber speed without using up your ammo, and a spin attack that I can only describe as being 
 very similar to the death blossom attack in the movie: The Last Starfighter. If you got that reference 
 you got 500 uber-geek points. The attack does what it says: spin around getting a single kill shot 
 on everyone in range. There's also a slo mo bullet dodging standoff mini-game and your typical 
 shoot em up action. Finally there are the environmental kills. Blast a sign above a baddie, it 
 falls and sends him back to hell. Pretty cool.
  
  The game controls are tight and relatively intuitive. Takes bout a half-hr to get acclimated, and 
 then your off to kill like Inspector Tequila himself. Oops, I mean to enforce the laws of Hong 
 Kong and Chicago.
  
  As I said before, Stranglehold really is like living an action film. Give this game two hours of 
 your time, and you'll be sold on it for the duration.

Review:  When it comes to shooters there are very few that stand out from the crowd but this does, although 
 it falls into the Max Payne style of game play it still has some very good features and a good 
 story to accompany. This John Woo inspired game, some what a continuation to the film Hard Boiled 
 is as action packed as they come and there is never a dull moment.
  
  From the minute you begin there is a constant stream of enemies coming at you from all angels, 
 with all sorts of weapons. As the player you are constantly diving, rolling and moving around to 
 avoid the enemies and eventually kill them. Obviously depending on the difficulty you choose then 
 the number and difficulty of the enemies change.
  
  There's a fairly wide range of weapons available Machine Guns, Shotguns, Pistols and SMG's. Some 
 of which can be dual wielded for extra punch. The shotgun is by the far the most effective gun 
 at close range and it supplies a great deal of satisfaction when your in tequila time and blast 
 some guy to bits. The machine guns and pistols are more suited to longer range targets.
  
  There are 3 special abilities to use during the game, these are:
  
  Precision Aim - Allows 
 you to zoom in and slows down time to pick the perfect place to shoot the enemy, this is generally 
 used for long range targets or on boss battles.
  
  Barrage - For a certain time you are invincible and fire non stop without needing to reload, great 
 for taking out large numbers of enemies or just taking the environment apart.
  
  Spin Attack - When surrounded with enemies activate this to perform a spin attack that will take 
 out any enemy in sight.
  
  Whilst adventuring through Stranglehold you will also encounter numerous Stand - Off's in which 
 you will be surrounded by enemies and you have to use both analogue sticks to dodge and their bullets 
 but also shoot them at the same time. These start off fairly easy but they get a lot harder and 
 faster as you go rough the game. It's a nice touch to break up the levels and slow the pace down 
 for a bit. The one draw back being the single player is extremely short.
  
  Multiplayer is where the game finds it's major flaw. It's awful. Frankly i can't even descrive 
 how poor it is. Nothing of which is in the single player carries over to multiplayer. When it comes 
 to destructible environments this game is second to none, pretty much anything in the environment 
 can be destroyed or damaged, it adds even more chaos to the already chaotic fights. It also provides 
 a very much realistic environment as glass shatters around you, and decorative items collapse into 
 pieces.
  
  Visibly Stranglehold looks great, with great attention to player models and environments. There 
 are a few ugly spots throughout the game but when it looks as good as it does you can allow for 
 that.
  
  Stranglehold also has some outstanding audio, the voice acting is superb, the environmental sounds 
 are excellent and even the guns sound pretty dam good.
  
  Although Stranglehold is an action packed Max Payne type of game it is still a very very solid 
 title, and any FPS fan who likes a chaotic action packed experience with definitely want to check 
 this out.

Review:  It was a wonderful attempt at making a game, but it is so terrible broken!! The graphics are very 
 out dated when in a cinamatic moment hes drinking and the graphics I saw we're some of the same 
 graps I saw many years ago. The campain gets old reeaaally fast you can also only hold two weapons 
 at a time and theres not a good selection of weps in the first place!, its the multi player! omg! 
 there is like no one on and it is horrid!! It would take a minute shooting someone point blank 
 in the face for them to do. Its just broken so my final word on it is.. Rent it first!

Review:  This game is fun. I enjoy Chow Yun Fat and the story is good, if a little too predictable. The 
 weapons are good but, not a lot of surprises. The graphics are not good for next gen consoles. 
 It's odd, sometimes they appear really good, but then you look again, and they're not. In fact, 
 while playing for too long, I start to feel nausious. Not good for a game, and not something I've 
 felt in a game since Hexen.
  
  This is an okay game that is best rented. It does fill time in between blockbuster games, and there 
 are some good things in it, but really not worth a buy.

Review:  The graphics are great. Stuff blowing up all around you. Slo-mo diving and jumping is cool. Of 
 course you just dive whenever you want to on just about anything. One thing I did not like is the 
 fact that you cant jump. What the heck? You got to be able to jump. But good game overall. I give 
 a 8! Could be better but I can deal with it. I liked it and all just didnt do much for me. I got 
 Halo3 also and I would much rather play Halo 3 all day than stranglehold. Just wasn't what I was 
 expecting.

Review:  To me, this game tries to redefine the slow motion shooting that other games have already used, 
 and used more successfully. Most people are used to hearing this called bullet time as made famous 
 by Max Payne. This game is pretty much based around this mechanic. Most of this game is very repetitive. 
 After you get passed the fist few stages, the uniqueness of this game wears thin.
  
  It's a shoot-em-up TPS that throws cluster after cluster of gangsters at you until you almost get 
 frustrated. These gangsters seem to come from every angle. It's like they all decided to hang out 
 in the apartments around you, twenty deep, just to come at you so you can shoot them.
  
  This game does try to do something unique by giving you more environmental kills, although by now 
 this is not a new concept. In my opinion, the game focuses too much on this aspect, giving you 
 more style points by killing a gangster in this means. From shooting signs and overhangs to sliding 
 down railings and diving on food carts, its just way to redundant.
  
  The story aspect of the game flows very nicely, however. The story is told very colorfully and 
 very descriptively as this is probably the only sign of anything to do with John Woo. Fans of John 
 Woo's movies will notice the stylistic qualities that have made his movies cult classics in that 
 genre.
  
  All in all, I think it is worth playing. I would not necessarily recommend buying it. There are 
 much more exciting shooters coming out in the next few months that will pretty much make anyone 
 forget about this game.

 extremly boring and a huge dissapointment. This game for me was a waste of 60 dollars for the 25

Review:  I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the money and try with this game, considering all the not so 
 good reviews ive seen on it, but I bought it anyway, and let me tell you I do NOT regret spending 
 that $35.00 (good deal) . This game has pretty good graphics especially on the explosions. The gameplay 
 is pretty fun because of multiple reasons. 1 being that you can slow down time which is called 
 Tequila Time, which is pretty cool. And second is that this game focuses on destructible environments, 
 and I think it works out well. You can break and knock over a lot of things to hurt your opponents 
 and if you cant find where something is to destroy, it will have a little twinkle indicating that 
 if you shoot it, something with it will happen, mainly fall. Another cool thing about this game 
 are the standoffs. They are pretty fun, catch you off guard sometimes, and do get hard later in 
 the game because of how fast it can go. The game really isnt long at all though which is a letdown 
 for me quite a bit. You can probably beat this game in somewhere between 6-10 hours which is pretty 
 short, and depending on your difficulty too. I dont know though why people really done like the 
 live for this game because I played it and loved it right away. The only bad thing I think about 
 the live is that the loading screens on live take a long time before they go away. But its pretty 
 fun fighting other people and some of the maps are actually pretty big. So I could pretty easily 
 recommend this game to any fan of shooter, mainly 3rd person. But I dont think its worth like $50.00, 
 but if you can find it for the price I got it, its worth it for sure.

Review:  
 
  
  Stranglehold promotes itself as a Next Gen action shooter, now... the thing about calling yourself 
 a next gen game is that you should be trying to take things up a notch or improving on the previous 
 mechanics and successes of your genre. Stranglehold however fails to reach its full potential and 
 only beats its predecessors with destructible enviroments and better graphics.
  
  Now its only obvious that I mention Max payne so I shall. Max Payne was a game that first incorporated 
 this kinda slow motion action gimmick that was kinda inspired by John Woo Films like Hard boiled 
 of which this game is based on.
  Then along came Dead to rights, a blatant rip off both Max Payne (and John Woo Films) however Dead 
 to rights 'improved' on the Max Payne concept and added john woo style disarm moves, the ability 
 to use enemy's as a human sheild etc...
  
 
  
  Then YEARS later , Stranglehold comes along and adds?? well nothing really, infact it doesnt even 
 recycle the Dead to Rights elements. What it does add is the ability to slide your ass on a table 
 or run along a banister and many other little things but they are totally useless within the games 
 design.
  
  Now you have to respect what Stranglehold was trying to do, its trying to be a game with great 
 dynamic ability's that the player can string along together on the fly, like running up a banister 
 then jumping off onto a wall and then landing on a wheel tray in one fluid motion whilst taking 
 out enemys along the way. Sounds good dont it?
  
  Well whilst this kinda thing IS somewhat possible in stranglehold its more trouble than its worth. 
 This is mainly because the game's level design is badly layed out and in many levels you will find 
 trying to do these moves completey pointless. Infact as the levels go on there is almost nowhere 
 to utilise such moves (unless its to reach an obvious 'use your abilitys to reach me' power up 
 placement) and it just becomes a broken bog standard basic third person shooter engine. It seems 
 that Midway tryed to do a good thing and didnt want an obvious PATH in the game's action sequences 
 and wanted to offer a player choice in how he approached the situation... so where do you put your 
 AI? Answer? EVERYWHERE.
  Stranglehold simply becomes a collection of 'Arena' battles in which the enemys with Spawn at you 
 from random angles. Aside from the bad layout with levels, the AI is what really ruins this game 
 and prevents you from pulling of the dynamic moves they spent time creating. The AI will Run to 
 you, get right up your ass and attack you from behind. As there is no clear path; there is no clear 
 path where the enemy will attack from and as they just seem to run at you like mad men, rarely 
 taking cover it prevents you from being able to decide on your own cover or do any moves.
  
  The one point 
 in which Stranglehold works well is in a later chapter set in a carpark and later in a penthouse. 
 The AI spawns from a far distance and takes cover, so your very rarley faced with its usual AI 
 issues. Later on in this chapter in the penthouse, there are portions which are blocked off by 
 Lazers, making your path really linear and the places the AI can go limited. The AI are forced 
 to take cover and you never feel like your thrown slap bang in the middle. Ironicly the most LINEAR 
 chapter is the only one that kinda works.
  Stranglehold had no excuse to be this bad, It had plenty of games like it before hand to learn 
 from and although a film tie in, there was no rush for a tie in release as Hard Boiled has been 
 out far ages so they had plenty of time to sort out its issues.
  
  Its Games like this which give a the 3rd person genre a bad name, and although the game offers 
 better graphics and extremely desctructible enviroments when compared to its predecessors you would 
 be much better off getting a second hand copy of Dead to rights. Choosing this game over Dead to 
 rights or even max payne 2 simply for some graphic updates is really Daft

Review:  When it comes to Asian action flicks, you can bet your ass that videogame geekboys make up the 
 vast majority of the genres Western fans; so in developing a game that picks up where John Woos 
 kinetic classic Hard Boiled left off, Midways Stranglehold is a stroke of genius and shoo-in for 
 chart-shattering success. But even though the games licence alone would be enough to shift copies, 
 Strangleholds take on the directors choreographed ultra-violence is credible, captivating and 
 exceptionally good fun.
  
  Developed in association with Woo - who was present at every stage of development, and was allegedly 
 a harsh taskmaster when it came to the approval process and getting things just so - Stranglehold 
 is billed as a genuine sequel to Hard Boiled. Moreover, actor Chow Yun-Fat came on board to reprise 
 his role as Hong Kong cop Inspector Tequila, providing the voice and motion-captured moves for 
 his spookily-convincing digital double. And with a bombastic soundtrack, slick visuals and dynamic 
 action that never lets up, Stranglehold comes closer than any cinematic spin-off in recent memory 
 to capturing the spirit of the movie that inspired it.
  
  Using Strangleholds gloriously simple controls, even the most ham-fisted player will look like 
 a gaming god within seconds; leaping through the air in slow motion, sliding down banisters with 
 twin guns blazing, and picking off scowling enemies with perfect headshots. To keep things interesting, 
 new moves become available as the twisted story unfolds, allowing Tequila to zoom-in on remote 
 targets and blow them away with a single shot, or become gripped by a maniacal gun-rage where he 
 unloads a maelstrom of bullets and cuts his rivals to ribbons. Earning new attacks and maximising 
 the periods you can spend in Tequila Time (read: Bullet Time) is also dependent on earning points 
 through stylish slaughter, encouraging players to use their imagination and rewarding those who 
 use the most daring combination of moves.
  
  Aside from its delirious gun-fu, explosive environments also help make Stranglehold a gripping 
 experience. Almost everything you see in the bustling levels can be destroyed, and during gun battles 
 the worlds become strewn with broken glass, crumbling masonry and other smoking detritus, adding 
 tremendous energy to even the smallest skirmish. Crucially, the interactive levels also play an 
 important role in completing the game, with players able to blast parts of the environment to trigger 
 avalanches and crush any enemies loitering below, or topple telegraph poles and make bridges to 
 previously out-of-reach rooftops.
  
  Fans of Woos work will also be enthralled by Stranglehold as its packed with familiar motifs 
 and set pieces from the directors pictures, including those celebrated dual pistols and incongruous 
 flocks of doves heralding the arrival of climatic shootouts. Woos love for Mexican standoffs is 
 also beautifully captured, with the action occasionally switching to a close-up view where players 
 use one control stick to target enemies and the other to dodge the bullets streaking towards them.
 
  
  If theres any criticism here its that Strangleholds combat is relentless and ferociously intense, 
 making the game a stressful experience that will alienate players who want a little more brain 
 stimulation and variety from their virtual escapades. But for kill-crazy gamers who get their kicks 
 from pumping the trigger, Stranglehold is an irresistible, digit-blistering thrill ride.

Review:  Stranglehold is a shoot 'em up that is somewhat a sequel to the classic John Woo film Hard Boiled. 
 The story isn't much, but the shooting action more than makes up for it, as is expected from a 
 John Woo production. Chow Yun-Fat reprises his role as Inspector Tequila and proceeds to shoot 
 every bad guy in his path using the signature Woo dual wielding pistol technique. Other features 
 include Tequila Bomb techniques such as Precision Aim and Barrage, and Tequila Time where time 
 is slowed down allowing players to shoot enemies more precisely and earn style points. A definite 
 recommendation, if you're looking to simply shoot enemies and blow things up, Stranglehold is for 
 you.

Review:  Being a HUGE fan of the HK based pre-Hollywood era Woo films I was keen to play this!!! the thought 
 of being inspector T jumping in slow mo blowing bad guys away was to good to be true. I'll be honest 
 and say that this project was always going to be a tough one to get right and that much is true. 
 The enjoyable elements as highlighted - amazingly accurately for once by Gamespot ; ) - are all 
 there! Slowing things down to jump thru the air or slow sliding over tables wasting hordes of 'orrible 
 stupid bad guys, and god they're cannon fodder! The additional aspects of going into a slow mo's 
 first person view to dodge bullets and take out the silly bad boys is also really enjoyable. The 
 power up aspect of your skills also introduces 100% accurate one bullet shot which is so satisfing!!! 
 Unfortunately once these and a few other cool functions are worked out the game itself is pretty 
 simple and one dimensional. Thats the biggest let down. The gameplay itself then becomes quite 
 boring a tedious as there's only so ways to keep the action entertaining. Graphical too its not 
 to sharp with all the bad guys looking exactly alike, well all 3 of them cloned to death!! The 
 scenary does look good mind as do the faces of Woo and Mr fat. If runing forward in straight lines 
 planting 14 bombs or blowing up 14 drugs factors one after another and generally destroying stuff 
 really gets you going? then this is for you. So all in all its a shortlived semi exciting taste 
 of being in a HK cat 3 film without actually getting shot or blown up!

Review:  I was really looking forward to Stanglehold. It had so much going for it. John Woo, Chow Yun Fat, 
 Hard Boiled, Midway, the Unreal Engine and so forth, but when it gets right down to it, it's an 
 average shooter that doesn't have much depth. The story is the same old cliche thing, your a bad 
 @$$ cop that decides to take matters into your own hands and take on the bad guys that have offed 
 a cop. Then, the bad guys kidnap your girl and your daughter and now it's personal. You shoot, 
 run, and explode through a couple of levels until you take on the head dude. Stranglehold is a 
 run and gun. You enter a room, you off the bad guys, more come in, rinse, wash, and repeat. The 
 manotanly is slowed down (no pun intended) by the Tequila time in which time it's self slows down. 
 It allows you do dodge bullets, leap in all direction and gun down the baddies, and allows from 
 some pretty cool cineams. But once that is all said and done it can get in the way and you kind 
 of forget about it. The graphics are fantasic in this game. No detail left uncovered, no animation 
 left a stray. The XB and the Unreal Engine take real advantage of each other's hard ware and it's 
 probably the best looking game on the 360 to date.
  
  The controls are responsive, they are easy to pick up and play, but have no real depth to them, 
 much like the game play itself. The music is simular to that of Hong Kong cinema and it's fairly 
 par for the course. You have the usual screams, yelling, explosive, and shooting sounds as you 
 wade through the bodies in this game. The difficulty level varies, there are some areas that are 
 annoying cause they swarm you and others where the AI is just plain dumb. It doesn't seem to curb 
 that as you change your difficulty level. There is small arsenal in the game, but nothing to write 
 home about, it's fairly basic. The game is very short, and you could play through it once in a 
 weekend. It's probably worth at least one more play through, but after that you will get kind of 
 bored. Stanglehold is what it is. It's a straight forward shooter, and if you aren't looking for 
 too much thought in your gaming, it's for you. If you're new to the 3rd person shooter this one 
 would also be good for you. But if your a Gears of War or Halo fan you might not be satisfied and 
 be looking for more. It's worth a rent.

Review:  This game definitely gets a Stranglehold on you. It tries to strangle the life right out of you. 
 I have not been this frustrated with a game in a long time. Stranglehold is one of those titles 
 that looks promising on paper: John Woo, Hard Boiled (this is a game sequel to a movie) , the Midway 
 Psi-Ops team. A good license, a decent team should make for a good titleunfortunately this time 
 it did not work out. This game falls to the American John Woo curse, which is basically any product 
 done for America is a bust, especially two syllable titles. Examples include: Face/Off, Paycheck, 
 Broken Arrow, Hard Target, need I go on?
  
  The problem with the game is not that it is John Woo, it is the game design. There are some impressive 
 things in Stranglehold. The unparalleled destruction, Massive-D, is impressive, however it does 
 not save the title. I am on what I am to guess the final boss fight, so I have played nearly the 
 entire game. And the biggest problem the game suffers from is level design. Level design is just 
 plain sickening. I read a review, I do not know where, he said by the end of the third level it 
 felt like I killed half the male population of China. I could not agree more. The game consists 
 of this primary element: Walk into a rectangular room with a balcony above you. Kill 10-30 bad 
 guys. Walk over a trigger point. Spawn another 10-30 bad guys. Kill them. Rinse, Lather, Repeat. 
 This is the formula and it gets old very quickly. A few levels have a more spacious flow to it, 
 but the use of the destructible components make the levels feel cramped and immovable.
  
  This brings me to problem number two, control. Control is amazingly bad. This character is supposed 
 to be a nimble bad-ass dolling out death and destruction, at least he deals out the later. He controls 
 like a shopping cart with one bad wheel. The system has two features that prove to be more annoying 
 then helpful. The world is auto-interactive in most cases. Come to a table or bar slide over it. 
 Some things you can interact with, like hide behind a pillar or kick up a table for protection, 
 or jump up onto a railing and run along it. This game offers bullet-time, tequilla time, slo-mo, 
 matrix time, what ever you wan to call it, and when you execute a slide or a run up a railing it 
 automatically enters you into this mode, even if only for a second. I found this highly annoying 
 and disruptive to the flow. This is the same foe the automatic interactivity, just as problematic, 
 if not more so. This just disrupts your targeting and flow. Aiming can be an issue too, sometime 
 bullets go straight other times they go off into oblivion. One thing that would have helped the 
 game is an experience system. So at the end of levels I can choose to upgrade accuracy, bullet-time, 
 ammo-clips, etc. This allows me to customize the game the way I find it fun. This is a new trend 
 in gaming, giving the player options to play the game with the character they partial designed. 
 The extensive world destruction adds a level of game play, but it doesnt do enough to create that 
 variety.
  
  There is a mini-game that is just as frustrating as the regular game, the Mexican stand-of. In 
 this mini-game, if you consider it one, you are forced to go one on one with many enemies, you 
 can dodge right or left with the right thumb sitck while you aim with the left. After you kill 
 or miss one guy you spin around to the next, so on and so fourth until they are dead, you die, 
 or they are mostly beaten. This sounds interesting, but it seems some bullets cannot be dodged 
 no matter what. Which is fine, it just makes it difficult.
  
  The game is full of problems, it looks great from a technology stand point on what you can do, 
 but this game was in development for a lone time and looks O. K. Control is fairly bad, or at least 
 take a while to get used to. I have not even played mulitplayer, from what I hear though it is 
 a joke. If you have to play the game rent it. If you know all of these downsides going in, you 
 might enjoy it more then I did. It just seemed like a exercise in frustration.
  
  On a side note, I hear the Blu-Ray Collectors edition with the Hard Boiled transfer looks just 
 as good, if not worse, then the Criterion DVD on a player that will up-res to 720p/1080i/1080p. 
 No one decided to spend the money to really make it a added bonus. Save your money if you already 
 own the DVD.

Review:  Stranglehold, a fast paced thirdperson shooter with bullet time, or also called tequila time or 
 something to that effect. Basically you get 4 power up style skills while you progress through 
 the game. You get to regen health, precision shoot (slows things down, and you get to zoom in for 
 a power shot) , Barraige (powers up weapon damage, and speed, temp invincibility) and some sort 
 of cycle shot, where you spin shooting everything. You are able to power up your skill power by 
 stlye points when killing. like sliding down a banaister, jumping, or swing from the lights. which 
 you actually get tired of after the 3rd level or so. The game gest extremely repetitive as you 
 can only slid so many banisters, and ride so many drink carts until your tired of the same ol' 
 styles. The online games are anything but good. They have lagg issues, the players are normally 
 putting the games for 1min runs, as they want the 50 ranked match achievement. So online turned 
 into a Achievement grind.... yay us. Other then that, i would call it a rental. its fun for the 
 rental time, but you arent crying when you return to say the least. give it a try, its worth the 
 rent.

Review:  Stranglehold is an action game through and through. If youre the sort of person who only likes 
 their games Clancy then you wont like this. The game itself is set as a sequel to Hard Boiled 
 but you never find yourself really caring about the plot as this game is about one thing. Blowing 
 **** up! Almost everything in Stranglehold can be destroyed or damaged in some way, its a really 
 neat idea and it actually helps the gameplay side of things. For example, if you want your enemies 
 to keep their heads down just shoot the wall next to them and they will cover their eyes from debris. 
 In most games when you take cover behind a wall, youre safe from bullets even rockets. Not here, 
 if you think your safe at ANY point in Stranglehold your wrong. You have to be always on the move 
 and always have your guns blazing. You will also need to master headshots very quickly! The Tequila 
 Bombs (which you earn by killing people in stylish ways) are fun, but there are only four of them. 
 You will need them come the boss fights thats for sure. This game is old school in almost every 
 way. One bad thing about Stranglehold is its difficulty level. Easy is too easy and normal is too 
 hard. The game throws an unbelievable amount of enemies at you from all sides. This is in keeping 
 with the Woo theme sure, but at times its too many enemies you will have to have the reactions 
 of a fighter pilot and a fair heap of luck if you are to survive the higher difficulty levels. 
 Also, with so many enemies you dont get time to appreciate just how cool all of the moves in stranglehold 
 are. You can swing from chandeliers, slide down/run up banister rails, and ride on trolleys. But 
 somehow none of this feels like it should to me. It just doesnt flow right, I dont know if 
 its the animation thats a bit off, just me or the fact that there are too many enemies shooting 
 at me to notice.
  
  Stranglehold isnt without the odd glitch or too either. They seem to have numbed down the auto 
 tequila time from the demo to make it more of a challenge. But its just hit and miss now if it 
 comes on at all. This means you have to activate it manually nothing that will ruin the game for 
 you, but it is annoying. You can also get stuck on railings sometimes, not good when youre being 
 turned into swish cheese. Also some of the boss fights are just too unfair to me.
  
  The Graphics in Stranglehold (most of the time) are a thing of beauty, sure some of the textures 
 look a bit wrong here and there but I wont hold this against it as the rest of the time it looks 
 stunning. The option to tell it what type of TV your running actually helped make the game look 
 better on my LCD HDTV too. So thats a plus! The game isnt very long, some levels are a really 
 nice size but others are over far too quickly. They are all well designed and different though. 
 The one near the end where its raining is cool. Ive played Stranglehold for around 8 hours or 
 so, completed it on easy yesterday and have started to get through normal. It does get a bit old 
 a bit quick to me. I couldnt sit and pump hours into it at a time, its more a I fancy an hour 
 blowing things up kinda game.
  
  LIVE has only two game types Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. Slow mo doesnt really work well over 
 LIVE and the game types arent varied enough.
  
  If all youre a fan of Woo, then add another point to my score. If however youre just a fan of 
 action games, then here it is!

Review:  You're Inspector Tequila - otherwise known to the real world as Chow Yun Fat - and you are to go 
 and find out who killed this one cop. From there, the story gets concoluted with other gangs double 
 crossing each other and somehow kidnap Tequila's daughter and ex-girlfrend. Obviously your going 
 to go and stop this.
  
  This game is a mix between Max Payne (X-Box) and Winback (PS2) . You run around, diving and doing 
 Tequila Time (also known as Bullet Time or Maxtrix Mode to others) all over the place to kill enemies. 
 From there, you duck behind cover, peer out and bust off a few caps before the threats destroy 
 your cover. Once all those targets are dead, more will emerge from a different route. You will 
 repeat this process for what seems like an eternity until no more enemies come and the door leading 
 to the next area is unlocked. John Woo described Tequila's fighting style as ballet because in 
 Stranglehold you can do outrageous things. For instance, you can run up a handrail without losing 
 your balance, or jump onto and then off of a wall shooting enemies as you fall down. You can go 
 so far as to even grab onto chandeliers and shoot while dangling. When you do all this, you can 
 earn style points that you can spend to unlock multiplayer characters, concept art, and more.
 
  
  You also get Tequila Bombs (funny name right.) Its a 4 way meter of sorts, and you can use them 
 to your advantage. These include regaining health, a barrage where you're invincible and just go 
 on a shooting rampage, a precision shot which is like a one shot sniper rifle, and a spin attack 
 that does exactly what it says. These are fun and pretty useful, but not all that necessary.
  
  What are the flaws of this title you ask? Well, for one the guns are weak as all hell. Secondly, 
 the enemies can destroy ANY cover you have so whats the point in even taking it? Thirdly, the boss 
 fights are just ridiculously hard - I mean you will literally go through all of your ammo and then 
 some just to take him down to half his health. Fourthly, the gameplay is just mind numbingly repetitive. 
 Fifth, the graphics aren't up to par to be honest, it looks a bit better then a normal X-Box game 
 but definitley not up to X-Box 360 standards. Finally, there are just way too many enemies to handle 
 at once.
  
  I understand that this game is a sequel to the movie Hard Boiled, and has to live up to the kill 
 count of over 300 that the movie had but come on. Its really hard taking on like 20 guys at one 
 time, all with machine guns, shooting while they destroy your cover (which is going to happen) , 
 forcing you out in the open to shoot at them.. but since the guns are weak, it'll take clip after 
 clip to kill one guy.
  
  I bought this game for the sheer action of it, but ultimately I had almost no fun with this title. 
 It's repetitivity, un-originality, weak story, and other flaws make it earn a 4.5

Review:  when i played the demo of this game i really got excited. i don't know if my anticipation killed 
 it for me or the game was just not enough. it seemed that the bad out weighed the good in this 
 game. the graphics and the sound were defiantly on point in this game. the special moves where 
 really cool but they could have given you a few more in my opinion. the destructible environments 
 were really cool and in my eyes, it was the backbone of stranglehold. slowing down time was fun 
 and very affective in defeating opponents. this game on on paper sounds like a winner but it truly 
 has no replay value (other than achievements) . the game is very fun but really short. they could 
 have gone without the side missions in the game, they were pointless and out of place. the multiplayer 
 was terrible. i'm more of a 8 vs 8 guy and this game only offers 6 in a room at once (that's if 
 the host isn't trying to get achievements and starts the game as soon as you get in a room for 
 a 1 vs 1 battle, yeah) . the boards are small but not too bad for 6 people. the guns are very ineffective, 
 everyone basically flies around trying to collect cranes so that they can get a special move that 
 will defiantly kill the opponent and there is nothing you can do about it. if you like shot em 
 up games this would be a great game to buy but there is know other reason to purchase this game.

Review:  Theres not much to say about this game, really.
  It's nothing especially new or special, but thats not to say it isn't fun - while it lasts anyway. 
 It won't take you too long to plow through.
  
  Levels basically consist of running and gunning your way through rooms full of armed foes, looking 
 to kill you right back - they also through in the occasional, simple enviromental puzzle that usually 
 involves shooting an object to remove an obstacle or create a path to proceed.
  
  Theres not much substance in the gunplay, but it surely oozes style.
  Of course you can dive 
 around, which triggers a bullet time effect.
  You can also run up and slide down rails, swing from chandeliers, shoot enemys as you roll around 
 on carts and probably a few more such things I'm missing. Won't make it game of the year, but it's 
 undeniably cool.
  
  Killing foes and picking up Origami Canes fills up a bar that lets you trigger different abilitys. 
 The first one you can use is a slight health refill, but theres usually enough first aid kits in 
 any given area that this shouldnt be necessary. The next is precision aim, which also triggers 
 a bulletime effect as well as a zoom, allowing you to get the perfect shot in. The effects on this 
 are pretty cool.
  
  Then theres barrage, which grants you unlimited ammo and immortality for a brief period allowing 
 you to just go nuts.
  
  And then theres the spin attack, which lets you kill pretty much everyone around you.
  
  Aside 
 from the health one, all of these abilitys are useful and fun to use.
  
  There are points in the game called stand offs, where you'll be surrounded by a few foes. It'll 
 go into bullet time and you'll stand there, dodging bullets with the left stick, aiming with the 
 right and as usual firing with the right trigger. It probably doesn't sound so great due to my 
 crud description but I aussure you it's a fun little activity, it's almost a mini-game. The games 
 graphically decent enough. Character models don't all look that great in my oppinion but the enviroments 
 are top notch and almost completely destructable, which makes them even better.
  Bullets will fly and the envrioment around you will reflect this as tables explode, columns give 
 way, tables flip and all sorts. Sounds also decent. Some of the voice acting is iffy but it's not 
 horribly bad.
  
  The multiplayer is rally barebones, allowing you death match and team death match. Could be just 
 me, but it can get pretty laggy. Shame, the multiplayer could've been the best part of the game.
 
  
  All in all though the game is at least worth a rental if the length of the game is off putting, 
 but I'm glad I bought it all the same.

Review:  Stranglehold is an action game for the 360, PS3, and PC. Its the 'sequel to John Woo's Shoot Em' 
 Up movie Hard Boiled. This game is just like the movie a lot of shooting and white doves! The game 
 puts you in the role of Inspector Tequila, the main Character from Hard Boiled. Your off to pretty 
 much Shoot every thing that you see. The game is an average game, but its major flaws is it only 
 takes a good 4-5 hours to beat it. It doesn't really have any replayability to it.
  
  Graphics: Actually they're pretty nice. but not Gears of war good. The Visuals on the characters 
 in the game are impressive. Th destructible enviroments look real nice when getting shot up. And 
 the blood on Inspector Tequila when he gets shot at is really good. Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty 
 average its pretty much use the left stick to move, Right Stick to aim, and right bumber to shoot. 
 There is also Tequila time which is pretty cool and also the Tequila Bombs are cool My favorite 
 would have to be precision aiming.
  
  Sound: All you pretty much will hear is a minute of talking in each cutscene and then the sound 
 of bullets. The Gun noises are pretty good. Value: Not too much value to it. Theres pretty much 
 the main story because the multiplayer sucks real bad. It's not fun at all. So this is a rental 
 for sure beat it and return it thats about it. Tilt: It's definately a rent or if you don't just 
 want shooting which is all you get then just skip it.

Review:  Stranglehold is about shooting people. Shooting people in slow motion as you dive through the air, 
 shooting people as you swing from a chandelier, shooting people as you glide around on a serving 
 cart... there's just a lot of shooting.
  
  But given that Stranglehold is the videogame sequel to John Woo's Hard Boiled, a ridiculous amount 
 of gunplay goes with the territory. Stranglehold sees Chow Yun Fat reprise his role as Inspector 
 Tequila, maverick cop and renowned firearm discharger, who finds himself embroiled in a plot packed 
 with Hong Kong gangs and Russian mobsters. The story twists and turns without being particularly 
 deep but it serves its purpose: throwing lots and lots of guys with guns your way.
  
  To help balance out the odds, Tequila has a couple of tricks up his sleeve. The most obvious is 
 'Tequila Time', which is Stranglehold's version of the ever popular bullet time. Target an enemy 
 while you're diving around and the world slows to a crawl, giving Tequila the chance to blast multiple 
 baddies in one dive. Obviously, a renegade cop who leaps around in slow motion isn't anything new 
 and it would be churlish to deny that Stranglehold owes a debt to Max Payne. But Max Payne itself 
 owes a large debt to John Woo's oeuvre, so it's less of a rip off and more borrowing what had already 
 been borrowed.
  
  Tequila Time may not be a particularly novel concept, but the way Tequila can interact with the 
 environments he's blasting through certainly is. Tables can be slid over, banisters ran up, Brachiosaurus 
 backbones skied down, serving trolleys ridden upon; if a piece of scenery glints it can used in 
 some over the top way, even if it's just dropping a neon sign on some poor saps head.
  
  Tequila's abilities are what makes Stranglehold fun. Sliding down a banister then leaping onto 
 the top of a serving cart while blasting away in slow motion is hilariously entertaining. Even 
 just diving around blasting in slow motion is a hoot. The game rewards stylish play; the more spectacular 
 the kills, the quicker the Tequila Bomb meter fills. Tequila bombs are nifty special moves ranging 
 from a small health boast to a screen clearing spin attack. The Tequila Bombs are rarely necessary 
 but have a suitably cinematic look to them. And they add some much needed complexity to the game.
 
  
  You see, Stranglehold is a remarkably old school game with a few modern trappings. Baddies spawn 
 and you shoot them. There are no squad tactics, no stealthy sneakery, no button pressing quick 
 time events, it's all point and shoot, point and shoot. From the first level to the last, the gameplay 
 doesn't change; Tequila enters an area, a ton of bad-uns appear and many bullets are fired. Stranglehold 
 basically boils down to intense fire fight after intense fire fight. Well, almost. Occasionally 
 Tequila will be surrounded by half a dozen or so goons and engage in a standoff. During the standoff, 
 the camera takes up an over the shoulder position with the left stick used to dodge the bullets 
 flying your way (in slow motion, naturally) and the right stick used for aiming. Taking a leaf 
 from the 80s martial arts film book, the baddies choose to attack one at a time, as if to give 
 Tequila a sporting chance. The standoffs are mildly diverting, but too infrequent to really help 
 break up the run 'n' gun sections.
  
  There's a bizarre enjoyment curve at work in Stranglehold. The game peaks early, with the sheer 
 joy of the gun play keeping the flaws in check for awhile. After an hour or so, the repetition 
 starts to grind, the incredibly unfair way that enemies spawn around you begins to irritate, and 
 the awkward camera that sits too close to Tequila making baddies tough to spot grates. But then, 
 something clicks. It may be sliding down the bones of a dinosaur in slow motion picking of baddies, 
 it may be swinging from a chandelier as you take down a helicopter or it may just be how satisfying 
 the gun play feels but at some point your brain switches off and you begin to enjoy Stranglehold 
 for what it is. Unfortunately, just as the game hits its stride, you're gunning down the last boss 
 and it's all over. While there's something to be said for not out staying a welcome, Stranglehold 
 is firmly on the short side.
  
  Aside from the single player mode, there's not all that much to Stranglehold. The multiplayer modes 
 are just too limited to offer any long term appeal. The only online modes are deathmatch and team 
 deathmatch, both of which recycle levels from the single player game. The levels feel too cramped 
 and claustrophobic to be any fun. The bullet time and environmental stunts had the potential to 
 fill the multiplayer with over the top gun fights but that potential is never realised. Most matches 
 boil down to the players diving around constantly, which combined with how long it takes to whittle 
 down an opponent's health makes the multiplayer fairly dreary.
  
  Regardless of which mode you're playing, Stranglehold looks phenomenal. The environments in particular 
 look incredibly and watching them be torn apart by gunfire is particularly impressive. None of 
 the locales are particularly original but they are nicely varied, ranging from a derelict slum 
 to glitzy casino. The character design doesn't quite match up, with the main characters looking 
 weirdly shiny and the regular grunt have a look of permanent confusion on their faces, but they're 
 minor blips. Aside from occasionally stilted delivery in the voice acting, Stranglehold's audio 
 is as bombastic as you'd hope.
  
  Stranglehold is short, repetitive, and occasionally infuriating. It's also an incredibly fun and 
 cinematic game filled with intense fire fights. Its appeal varies with how willing you are to turn 
 off your brain and enjoy one of the most straight forward, uncomplicated shooters of this generation. 
 Stranglehold undoubtedly suffers from a lack of depth but as an attempt to cram John Woo's style 
 of gun combat into a game it almost works.

Review:  I'm almost finished with the campaign on Normal difficulty and I'm having to make myself finish. 
 The only thing carrying me now is the achievements. Strangleholds strengths are in it's graphical 
 presentation, and tight game play. The story is decent, although cliche. The game will last around 
 7-8 hours on a difficult setting, but shorter on casual. Overall Stranglehold will be remembered 
 for sweet-looking destruction happy environments. Stranglehold is worth nothing more than a rental 
 and even then it's still lacking. The voice acting sucks, the game is short, and the game play, 
 while good, get's old VERY quickly.
  
  Just rent it.

Review:  Stranglehold is the spiritual stepchild of Psi-Ops, which is one reason I bought it. Another reason 
 is that after playing the demo a few times through, I thought it would have a Max Payne style feel 
 to the overall gameplay. While it dosen't have that Max Payne-ness I expected, it's still a pretty 
 good game.
  
  You play as Inspector Tequila, you are looking for the kidnappers that stole your girlfriend, your 
 daughter, and another Hong Kong cop you were friends with. Without giving away any spoilers, let 
 me say that the story is pretty well done, like your normal John Woo movie.
  
  The graphics are... decent. Sometimes you clip through other objects while diving, swinging, rolling, 
 etc... The animations are crap quite frankly. The sound is pretty decent, though during cutscenes 
 the VO work is really soft, you can barely hear it.
  
  The gameplay is rather solid, your standard shooter. The multiplayer is horrible, don't even bother 
 with it unless you NEED the achievements.
  
  7.5 of 10 for me, decent, par title.

Review:  Now lets get a couple things straight here, i rented the game and liked it. You know you get to 
 really cool specials like climbing up a railing and shooting some one. Yea you get all those which 
 makes it really exiting. The more special the moves are you get tequila points and you can signal 
 special kills or moves. But sadly the story line was very boring and i just was not in it at all. 
 When you see a skit you would want to skip it because they would talk for such a long time and 
 its so boring. While the gameplay was really cool it also gets boring after a while. Not to mention 
 i dont like how you cant jump in the game you only can diive and also you cant open doors it opens 
 it self. The game can be beat on 2-3 sittings. Taking maybe about 4-6 hours depending on how good 
 you are. So their is no point what so ever to buy the game since its so short. Its not like the 
 online is any good and theirs lots of people playing on it so you could forget about that..
  
  It comes down to this -- do you want a game that takes 5 hours to beat. And pay 60 bucks for 
 that? If so be my guess but rental is just FINE.

Review:  Stranglehold was supposed to be one of the big-hitters ont eh Xbox 360 ,but this is another title 
 that turned more of a meh..... than a Yeah... .Stranglehold takes good use of the Xbox Live feature 
 with fast gameplay and good graphics. All the weapons and features you use in the Single-Player 
 portion is avaliable in the Xbox Live portion.
  
  The game is short and good very welly be beaten within 2 days of non-stop gameplay. With 7 chapters, each 
 about 15 minutes long, you'll easily beat it in 1 hour and 45 minutes depending on how many times 
 you do each level over from dying definitly determine the extra time it'll take.
  
  Online can be very fat-paced and then very slow-paced. When the game feels like, thats how it seems 
 at least, the game will go into Tequila Time which is where the game goes into slow-mo and everything 
 become yellowish, but you can still see surroundings. The weapons aren't anything new and cool you've 
 seen in it all before. Shoutguns, Assault Rifles, and Sub-machine guns.
  
  Overall, John Woo shoudn't have chose to make a movie out of his movie. All of his movies are good 
 the way they are.... not games.
  
  That's why I give Stranglehold for the Xbox 360 7 wierd Japennese names out of 10.

Review:  Don't get me wrong -- I love shooting fools in the face in slow motion as much as the next guy, but 
 at the $60 price tag, Stranglehold just can't be recommended as a purchase.
  
  Yes, it gives you cool ways to interact with the environment (e. g. shooting while hanging off a 
 chandelier) , but they just don't work well enough to even make you want to use while playing. You're 
 probably better off just manually turning on the Tequila Time (bullet time) manually and clearing 
 the room. It makes for better aim, after all. Personally, I chose a spot in between, where I wasn't 
 using the environment that much, but I frequently used the dives -- which automatically turns on 
 the Tequila Time -- for a little added style.
  
  This is a pretty short game. I didn't time my play-through, but I'm pretty sure it took me just 
 under 10 hours to complete (this was in casual, mind you) . The length is an issue when looking 
 at the cost of the game, but if it was any longer, it could have hurt the game even more. The problem 
 is, even though some things never get old, the game generally gets pretty old by that time.
  
  Visually, it looks good enough. It's not a fantastic looking game, but I forgive it because 
 there's a lot going on here. All the stuff you can shoot into a million pieces require their own 
 physics -- which can be a lot of work. I didn't notice any frame rate dips even through the most 
 intense times, so I'd rather have Stranglehold how it is rather than look awesome, but have less 
 insanity. I didn't play much of the multiplayer, but from the few games I played, I wasn't impressed. 
 It generally felt pretty unbalanced and shallow, which lead to a mostly frustrating experience. 
 There are a lot of cool ideas that -- if done right -- could have given players some cool experiences, 
 but it just doesn't work right.
  
  Good times will be had if you play this game, no doubt about that, but it's so hard to recommend 
 at its current price point. Unless your a huge John Woo or Hong Kong action flick fan, then I say 
 play it safe and just give it a rent. You'll easily be able to finish it in a weekend.

Review:  A license done right, Stranglehold is the video game follow up to the massively popular bullet 
 ballet, 1982s Hard Boiled. Hard Boiled followed the adventures of a maverick cop, Tequila (played 
 by Chow Yun-Fat) as he proceeded to take on seemingly all of Hong Kongs underworld single-handedly. 
 If you think youve seen that movie but havent seen Hard Boiled, you probably have, as this is 
 one of the most influential movies from Hong Kong, single handedly creating the genre.
  
  As the official sequel to the movie, Stranglehold doesnt disappoint. Chow Yun-Fat reprises his 
 role as Tequila, as the action starts with the death of a cop. Being the only one willing to go 
 the distance, Tequila finds himself alone on the scene. But hes not without backup, as his weapons 
 are just as much a part of the action as he is. Twin pistols, SMGs, machine guns, shotties, rocket 
 launchers- theyre all here. But a John Woo flick isnt just about killing- its about killing 
 with style!
  
  The game pushes you to do things stylishly through its mechanics. First of all, theres bullet 
 time, straight from Max Payne. But even though you can trigger it manually, it normally kicks in 
 when you do something in a cool way- diving and lining up a head shot with the shotgun for example. 
 Not only does this kick in slow mo so you can aim/dodge more effectively, it also earns you a star- 
 Strangleholds way of rewarding you for killing with style. Sliding across a cart mowing down bad 
 guys? Even better more stars. Dropping a neon sign on a rickety shed, causing it to cave in an 
 kill a whole passel of shooters gets you 6 stars or more. Stop killing for a while and your star 
 count resets. What is all of this good for? Well, first of all, theres an unlock shop run by John 
 Woo himself that allows you to get some cool skins for multiplayer and some other goodies. But 
 the main use is to fill up your Tequila Bomb gauge to be able to perform outlandish maneuvers. 
 The first one you get is a little health boost. Thats followed quickly by precision shot- the 
 ability to snipe with pretty much any weapon! The screen goes into tequila time, and you can aim 
 at a body part- and get suitably gruesome and cool death animations. Barrage turns Tequila into 
 an unstoppable killing machine, making him invulnerable to most damage, and upping the firepower 
 of whatever weapon hes using. And then theres the spin attack, which basically clears the screen 
 of enemies stylishly, as Tequila spins taking them all out, and John Woos trademark doves flutter 
 up into the sky.
  
  And then theres the stand offs. At certain points, Tequila will come up against a group of opponents 
 that have the drop on him. You have to use the stick to dodge out of the way, while taking out 
 the opponents one at a time. Classic Woo!
  
  Sounds like a classic in the making, right? Add to that fully destructible environments and the 
 ability to take cover behind objects, and run up walls and dive backwards from pillars, and you 
 have a perfect game not quite.
  
  The left trigger triggers interaction with objects around you- sliding down rails, running up logs, 
 swinging from chandeliers, etc. But to do this, you have to line up *just so* with the object. 
 And not come to close- because Tequila will automagically slide across tables, etc. that he comes 
 across. It gets frustrating at times- especially during a hectic gun battle. The difficulty levels 
 are also pretty unimpressive- especially for a game as short as this is. Only on Hard or Hardboiled 
 (which is only unlocked after finishing the game) does the game truly shine. On any other difficulty, 
 pretty much diving and shooting will get you through any obstacle.
  
  But all of that said, Stranglehold is an enjoyable game, with killer graphics, excellent sound, 
 and a decent execution. I hope for a sequel, done even better. And its definitely above the curve 
 for a licensed game.

Review:  Stranglehold was one of the fall 2007 game realeases that i was eagerly awaiting. The game at first 
 was awsome, the slow motion action plus cool tequila bomb moves make for a awsome first impression. 
 However midway into the game the action gets a little repeitive because your facing the same kind 
 of grunts that you faced in the beginning. This can be overlooked because each level is varied 
 and extremley detailed. Almost everything in the enviroment can be destroyed realisticly. The game 
 has the most destructive enviorments of any game that i have seen up until this point. The game 
 is way too short however and it ends so suddenly. The end boss battle is very anticlimatic because 
 it is not very hard to defeat him. All and all even with strangleholds brevity and slight repetivity 
 it is still a pretty awsome game that any action fan should look into.

Review:  Stranglehold is fun for about an hour. Some of the interactive objects found in the game can be 
 neat to play with (sliding over tables, riding on carts) , which is good because this is about the 
 only thing that differentiates this game from Max Payne or Dead To Rights in the least. But often 
 times the game drops you in locations devoid of any objects to jump on or shoot, such as the ridiculously 
 empty parking garage, or throws bad guys at you from every direction, leaving you busy spinning 
 in circles instead of sliding down that rail in slow motion. This game also manages to cram in 
 one of my all-time video game pet peeves: super-human boss fights. Although the game never has 
 any reservations about being over-the-top as far as action goes (The first thing I would do if 
 ever caught in a gun fight would definitely NOT be running up the spine of a dinosaur skeleton) , 
 there is never any explanation given as to why any given crime boss has the ability to soak up 
 25 shotgun blasts to the head before finally biting the dust. Designers might have gotten away 
 with that a few years ago, but there's no excuse for such a lack of imagination concerning boss 
 fights today. Strangleholds graphics are pretty at times, but often pretty bland and character 
 animation is a little too cartoony for the context of the storyline or atmosphere. Its your call 
 as to whether its worth the rental price (after 6.99 at my local Blockbuster Im feeling a bit 
 remorseful) but certainly dont let you or any of your friends buy this one. Overall, Id say petitioning 
 for Max Payne 3 would be a better use of your time then this game.

Review:  In general, there are more good things to say about Stranglehold than bad things. Here's some highlights 
 for those wanting to know the general plus and minus points on this game.
  
  The good:
  
  Gameplay: this is a very solid action game and is just plain fun. Killing people does not get 
 old and there are many different ways of killing tons of enemies. Very nice pick up and play game 
 mechanics. The special moves are especially fun to play around with.
  
  Graphics: some people may not appreciate these graphics, but given that most of the environment 
 can be manipulated or destroyed, I think it's quite amazing to have such nice visuals while there 
 are that many moving objects getting blown apart onscreen.
  
  The Not so good:
  
  Story: well the story isn't terrible or anything, but I do think it is poorly presented with some 
 bad dialogue. The voice acting is fine, it's the dialogue that's not good. But really, with a game 
 this focussed on action, I don't think a bad story really is all that much of a bad thing. The 
 ugly:
  
  Value: The worst thing about this game is probably it's length. I though this was very short and 
 could have used another 50% more content in the single player mode. The game is only about 6 hours 
 long, which is REALLY short in my opinion, especially given the price of games these days. But, 
 on a plus side, the game is very replayable and there is some multiplayer to keep you company. 
 Still, the game's story is over very fast.
  
  Worth Buying? If money isn't really a concern or you are a very casual gamer who doesn't blast 
 through games, then ya, it's worth buying. It's a great action game and there's tons to kill and 
 blow up. If you're like me and a bit cautious with spending money, then I'd say this game is just 
 about the definition of a perfect rental. It's fun, lots of fun, even though it's over quickly, 
 it makes for a perfect rental on a rainy day.

Review:  When you hear the name John Woo, you immediately think of action movies. You know, the ones where 
 things blow up everwhere while doves fly away in the background. Many a gamer, after seeing his 
 movies, thought that the Master of Action should do a video game.
  
  Well, John Woo answered the call. Stranglehold, the spiritual sequel to Woo's 1992 motion picture 
 Hard Boiled, a gritty action-packed cop movie starring Chow Yun Fat as Inspector Tequila Yuen, 
 is what transpired. Hard Boiled is regarded as some of Woo's best work and is often mentioned when 
 people talk about action movies. The game picks up a couple of years after the movie left off, 
 as we find Tequila investigating the mysterious disappearance of a police officer. The investigation 
 runs deeper than that, as he'll find himself in the middle of a gang war between the Russian Mafia 
 and the Triad, with his daughter and estranged girlfriend as bait.
  
  We've already established that John Woo is synonymous with action. This game is chock full of it 
 from beginning to end. For example, Tequila has the ability to go into Tequila Time, a new term 
 for Bullet Time, where time slows down, allowing him to gain an advantage over his enemies. While 
 in this mode, he can perform several outlandish moves such as riding food carts while flat on his 
 stomach, running up or down stair ramps and swinging from chandeliers. When Tequila is able to 
 pull off these moves, amongst others, he gets performance points which fill up his Tequila Bomb 
 meter.
  
  You get 4 different types of bombs Tequila can use. Amongst them are Health, Aim, Barrage &amp; 
 Spin. Health is pretty self-explanatory. Aim allows you to shoot enemies from a good distance as 
 the camera follows the bullet to its ultimate destination. Barrage allows Tequila to plow through 
 his enemies without taking any damage for a short period of time. Spin resembles Barrage, except 
 that Tequila will stand still and spin around, shooting every visible enemy. The last 2 Bombs are 
 quite effective. I'd even go as far to say that they are too effective, as they take away some 
 of the challenge the game offers.
  
  If shooting people in the face isn't enough for you, know that Stranglehold's environments are 
 pretty much all destructible by gun fire. This adds a lot to the sheer violence and destruction 
 in the game. It's quite cool to go around and shoot everything you see to smithereens. You can 
 even use the environment to your advantage, as certain elements can be shot and dropped upon unsuspecting 
 enemies. This is a very fun aspect of the game which, sadly, isn't exploited to its fullest. I 
 also found it hard to spot where the environment can be shot, especially later on in the game.
 
  
  The graphics in the game are, without a shadow of a doubt, it's best attribute. The character models, 
 especially Chow Yun Fat &amp; John Woo, look extremely lifelike. The levels look great and are 
 very detailed, even though their configuration tends to become repetitious. Most of the levels 
 are pretty straightforward and linear, making it impossible to get lost. The cutscenes are very 
 cinematic, but I guess since John Woo is a movie director, there's no surprise here..
  
  The sound effects aren't anything out of the ordinary. The guns sound like they pack a good punch. 
 The voice work done by the actors is decent, although I did have some difficulty understanding 
 Chow at times. The dialogue is downright ridiculous and the delivery is even more ridiculous, but 
 I guess that's to be expected in this game where action takes center stage. Nonetheless, the story 
 is overly predictable and you'll find yourself laughing more often than not at the corniness of 
 it all.
  
  Although the gameplay is pretty solid all-around, the game itself doesn't help to push the third-person 
 shooter genre forward in any way. Instead, it relies on mechanics that are already in place and, 
 most of all, have been used and over-used throughout the years. Tequila Time is damn fun... for 
 the first 2 hours of gameplay. It just seems like Tequila is ALWAYS in this state and that the 
 simple run &amp; gun has been pushed aside a bit too much. It seems like every object Tequila comes 
 in contact with makes him go into Tequila Time. This can become quite annoying, especially when 
 you're trying to move around.
  
  The biggest problem with this game has to be the re-playability, or lack thereof. Stranglehold 
 clocks in at 6-7 hours, maximum. That's very short, even by today's standards. Once you finish 
 the game, there's no real reason to go back to it, except maybe to get a couple more achievements. 
 There are 4 difficulty levels ranging from Casual to Hard Boiled, but the game isn't all that difficult 
 to begin with, so playing it on Hard shouldn't be much of a challenge (Hard Boiled is locked until 
 you complete the game once) .
  
  There is an online mode in Stranglehold, but it is so broken that it would've been better off not 
 being there at all. Upon release, it was almost impossible to join a match as the connection would 
 simply drop upon loading the map. Things weren't that much better once this was fixed. The online 
 is a total snooze-fest and really feels like it was tacked on at the last minute.
  
  For so many reasons, it's hard for me to fully appreciate what Stranglehold brings to the table. 
 The game was clearly built to be an homage to Max Payne, which in turn was an hommage to Hard Boiled, 
 but it fails in it's task. The over-use of Bullet Time, the short single player campaign and the 
 total lack of a good online multi player are 3 strikes too many. This game could've been so much 
 more, especially coming from John Woo and Midway. I really wanted to enjoy this game, I wanted 
 to write this review and state that it was revolutionary and amazingly fun but, sadly, that's not 
 the case. I'm not saying the game is a total flop, it's quite enjoyable for a while. Regrettably, 
 that while doesn't last long enough.

Review:  For me when i saw the announcement of Stranglehold in '05, I knew from the day of its release it 
 was going to be a classic!
  
  Story: Well, Inspector Tequila is back and he is out for revenge!
  
  Graphics: Holy S**t, a 
 lot of destruction!!! And awesome character models.
  
  Gameplay; Feels smooth when using Tequila Bombs and the use of Slo-mo. Shooting People in the face 
 with a shotgun doesn't get old.
  
  Sound: Great work on voice-overs and destruction!!
  
  Multiplayer: Well, there isnt much to say about it. But, lets just say its mediocre.
  
 
  Replay Value: Great, every time you play the same level it doesnt feel the same because of how 
 amazing the destruction is in the game.
  
  The Good: Awesome Graphics, Sounds, GUNS, Tequila Bombs, and a Bad A$$ Cop.
  
  The Bad: Very 
 Short Story, Kind of Reparative, Mediocre Multiplayer
  
  The Verdict: Well, if youre looking for a solid shooting game to play until Halo 3 comes, well 
 this will give you something to do then.

Review:  Being a massive John woo and Chow yun-fat fan i have to say i'd be lying if i wasnt excited about 
 this one. Its Max Payne with a few extra tricks.
  
  Gameplay: The only thing you do in this game is shoot, most would say its a bad thing but i say 
 when the shooting is this fun you tend to forget about it. Nearly everything in the enviroment 
 is breakableyou can slide down banister's slide and shoot on trolleys and a host of other things 
 that set this aside from Max Payne you also get a host of what are called Taquila Bombs one is 
 healing yourself a spin attack killing all in the room one where you go insane for a moment and 
 get unlimted ammmo and health and a slo-mo bullet skill. All this makes it stand out from the bog 
 standard shooting games.
  
  Story: This is a set back for the game, I expected a strong story since the main man mr Woo was 
 involved in the game. But ended up being dissapointed. Taquilas ex-girlfriend gets kiddnapped and 
 its your job to save her. Thats it! you do alot of killing along the way and the game ends.
  
  Sound: Pretty good voice acting and the soundtrack is pretty cool. Gun effects a tops too.
 
  
  Graphics: Stunning i thing. Good lighting Character models and enviroment is pretty sweet too.
 
  
  **** The constant shooting can get on your nerves 3/4 into the game. And it can also get pretty 
 hard at some points in the game. Its also pretty hard to make out what your doing at times with 
 everything getting smashed up and bullets going everywhere. The game overall is pretty short too, 
 you could prob do it in a day solid if you tried.
  
  Overall: I really did enjoy this game, Its what every Woo fan wants and while it lasts its a real 
 treat. Havent played on the multiplayer so i dont knw about that. If your a really big fan of Woo 
 then splash out the &pound;40 getting this game. If your thinking about getting it i'd wait till 
 it hits &pound;30 maybe.

Review:  Just bought the game today, and i must say a word or two about it, let me just start with:
  
  - I wish they will make more titles of this games and more often.
  
  - I wish that they 
 could fix the online issues as i think that this title has great possibilites online.
  
  -I wish that they could have added some more of stealth tactics and some melee or kung fu stuff.
 
  
  All this three things will have make justice to a great game that somehow got underappreciated 
 and underrated, if i take on account the professional reviews, maybe i will never buy it; probably 
 i will have it rented or something else.
  
  John Woos's Stranglehold is a great game, no matter how short, less is simple, and simple the best 
 . They got all the ingredients that went right on previous games like:- Enter the Matrix, Max Payne, 
 Rise to Honor, etc to pull out something just fantastic, you got to tear appart in pieces everything 
 you see to understand exactly what i mean.
  
  You are Inspector Tequila and it's time to pop up some heads, or... /guts??!!
  
  /this game 
 offers you lots of packed-messy action, throwing at you many kinds of weapons and explosive environments 
 like never before, besides the traditional bullet killing, you can kill your foes withChinese neons, 
 with electrical posts, with random rumbling stones, with gasoline tanks, with their own chemical 
 drugs, etc, just think of everything.
  
  hundreds and hundreds of chinese mobsters to kill, with some quailos as well.
  
  Tons of cool 
 moves and specials, rolling on choping cart, throwing yourself from the wall, the traditional cover 
 and shoot, whatever; and besides that the awesome maxy bullet time (Tequila Time in this game) .
 
  
  The specials will make it up to you taking up the bad guys, like the barring, which is a special 
 shooting spree (not on Elle Magazine) that will be very useful and handy when outnumbered.
  
  The kinda Snipe-with a Pistol one, that is so cool, that you will gasp as the bullet reaches 
 its intended target, your enemie's throat or skull or other more intimate parts of the human anatomy, 
 it all depends on where you aim.
  
  And there's the classic Chinese-Spin move, that as the name indicates will have Chow Yun Fat (Inspector 
 Tequila) spinning-shotting their heads off.
  
  You will also have some refreshing missions where you will findyourself blowing out heads from 
 the sky, more specifically from a helicopter, yes, they even throw that out, some Ghost Recon stuff.
 
  
  The sound score is superb, combined with the suave acting voices and of Mr. Chow himself, that 
 added the thousands or reckling sounds and all the different weapons and explosions.
  
  The Graphics are pretty tight too, specially the environments, the characters are not really jawdropping 
 i must say, but the locations and the physics of the bullets are pretty neat. Can't miss that, 
 you'll have to watch for every detail.
  
  So what can be wrong with this game except that is a bit short, the Original movie Hard Boiled 
 is only and hour and a half and is a classic action movie of all times, there you are, be ready 
 for bullet time!!!
  
  One more thing, you get to play as Chow Yun Fat.

Review:  Seriously put... This game is hot... It takes you back to the good ole days of shooting and running 
 and diving around but adds a little more to the mix with supurb graphics and completely distructable 
 environments... The only problem with the game is the fact that a few things were missed that could 
 have made things a little more fun... for example: you can jump of walls and dive and shoot... 
 you can slide down railings and roll on carts... but you can't jump up over a short wall and pull 
 yourself up... You can shoot a bunch of enemy's and do some neat side games but you can't jump 
 into the water... you can blow up things and do all of that good stuff but the linear aspect of 
 the game won't allow you to go back and revisit the carnage... why not be able to go backwards 
 and know that you went there by the dead bodies laying around... The sliding across beams and stuff 
 are cool but it informs you of where its possible by lighting up the surface as your approach- 
 that kind of makes it feel linear and cheesy... If you are a fan of old school shooters with a 
 flair- you will like this game... but chances are,, you are probably nice at these kinds of games 
 and if you buy it outright, you will beat it within a day of playing... It will get repetitive 
 after a while but its a shoot em up bang bang type of game... You will be amazed for about 3 hours 
 and then get bored after a while... Being that you get your special moves so quickly, you kind 
 of get the gist of everything quickly... The one thing I will mention, the game is still fun to 
 play without the special moves and tequila time...

Review:  I was really looking forward to playing Stranglehold. As a fan of John Woo's movies and the initial 
 reactions by the press at E3 two years ago, I was really expecting a very solid continuation of 
 Hard Boiled. The game is not bad by any means, but I found myself disappointed by extremely short, 
 easy and relatively limited game play. As a fan of Max Payne I can appreciate and commend Midway 
 for reminding me how fun that can be. I also enjoyed the multi-gun showdowns, in true Woo fashion. 
 You literally cannot have enough doves fluttering during intense lead swapping scenes.
  
  But overall I just felt things could have been better. On the plus side, almost everything in the 
 environment was destructible. Its a blast taking down a Giant T-Rex or leveling interiors of HK 
 mansions. On the not so plus side I found the graphics, outside of the cut scenes, to be below 
 average, a lot of rough edges around Tequila. The game play had an unpredictability to it, similar 
 to pressing the grind button in Tony Hawks Pro Skater. Youre in a dicey situation you press 
 the left trigger and instead of jumping backwards and shooting the enemies youre sailing down 
 a handrail into a barrage of bullets. The unpredictability had me acing certain levels when I wasnt 
 trying and failing when I was.
  
  Total time to complete was also lacking. This game is beatable in a little over 6 hours. While 
 I complain about this, I am also not sure I would have wanted to go longer as the repetitive nature 
 of the game had me wondering what I am going to buy next.
  
  I tried multiplayer once and that was enough, plenty of other games that fit that bill.. All in 
 all I would say it is a game worth renting, especially when you consider a rental on Friday night 
 back Saturday afternoon.

Review:  The idea of making a game that's a direct sequel to a John Woo film sounds like a can't-lose formula 
 for sheer awesomeness. After all, the director's distinctive style has already served as the inspiration 
 for the hugely successful Max Payne games. But the end result is, perhaps, a bit underwhelming. 
 It's a solidly made action game that may hold your interest for the eight hours or so that it lasts, 
 but it won't blow you away like Hard-Boiled did the first time you saw it.
  
  Stranglehold is a sequel of sorts to Hard-Boiled, in that you play as Inspector Tequila, the character 
 played by Chow Yun-Fat in the film. When Tequila's ex-girlfriend and daughter get caught up in 
 an organized crime double-cross, he heads out to rescue them with both guns blazing. It's a totally 
 typical setup and isn't very interesting but definitely provides Tequila with a suitable excuse 
 to kill lots of dudes. Still, Hard-Boiled and John Woos other films typically have some moments 
 of overblown emotion to match all the overblown action, and in this regard Stranglehold falls short.
 
  
  Comparisons to the Max Payne games can't be avoided, and to anyone who has played those games, 
 Stranglehold will feel very familiar. What Max Payne referred to as Bullet Time is here called 
 Tequila Time, but it works the same way. When you activate it the action shifts into slow motion 
 but you still aim and fire in real time, giving you a big edge on the hundreds and hundreds of 
 expendable goons the game sends after you. This concept doesn't feel quite as fresh today as it 
 did when the Max Payne games were released, but it's still fun to see all the mayhem slow to a 
 crawl and to take that perfect shot as you're diving through the air. Through it all, youll have 
 a nice assortment of weapons at your disposal, including pistols (one in each hand, of course) , 
 submachine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, and the occasional rocket launcher or very powerful 
 golden pistol.
  
  Stranglehold also introduces a number of new elements to the formula. Most significant is the fact 
 that you can interact with the environment in a number of ways. Tequila can take cover behind things, 
 kick up tables, jump off of walls, run up or slide down railings, hang from chandeliers, jump on 
 rollcarts, shoot signs, light fixtures and other objects so that they collapse onto bad guys, and 
 so on. And as the bullets are flying, the environments are constantly falling apart. Concrete pillars 
 crumble to reveal the rebar underneath; plaster tiles shatter; wood splinters. The environmental 
 destruction in Stranglehold is pretty spectacular.
  
  Tequila also has a few special abilities, called Tequila bombs. One lets you refill a small amount 
 of your health. Another lets you take slow and precise aim at enemies near or far, and the camera 
 dramatically follows your bullet and provides a close-up of your target spewing blood after the 
 bullet strikes. The third lets you unleash a barrage of ammo on enemies without taking damage yourself 
 for a short time, while the fourth has you spinning around like the Tasmanian Devil, cutting down 
 any nearby enemies in a hail of gunfire while John Woos signature white doves inexplicably fly 
 out of your feet. To make use of these moves you need to fill up your Tequila bomb meter, which 
 you do in two ways. One way is by earning style points for your kills. You get at least one style 
 point for any kill, but you earn a lot more for killing people while jumping off of walls or sliding 
 down ziplines or doing other crazy stuff. The other way is by finding the paper cranes that are 
 scattered throughout each level. The moves are useful for getting out of the occasional tight spot 
 and help give the game a bit more over-the-top cinematic flair. Speaking of which, youll also 
 occasionally find yourself in what the game calls a standoff, where Tequila is surrounded by thugs 
 on all sides. In these situations the left stick is used to lean left or right to dodge incoming 
 fire while the right stick is used to aim, and you need to pick off the bad guys one by one. Like 
 the Tequila bomb moves, its pretty absurd, but its fun, and Hard-Boiled wasnt exactly a study 
 in realism.
  
  The games campaign is quite short, with seven stages that will probably take you roughly an hour 
 apiece. Its not necessarily a bad thing that the game doesnt last longer than that, as the gameplay 
 isnt really deep enough to stay interesting beyond that point. Players who enjoy the game will 
 probably get more out of replaying those stages on harder difficulty levels than they would out 
 of a longer game anyway. The game missteps a bit in the early levels with a few environmental puzzles 
 that slow down the pace of the action, but later on these elements disappear and Stranglehold becomes 
 a nonstop gunfest. On the default difficulty the game is relatively easy for the most part, as 
 the bad guys are pretty stupid and will obligingly stand in an ideal place to be shot or to be 
 crushed under some convenient overhanging object or blasted to kingdom come by a nearby explosive 
 barrel, though to be fair, theyre pretty stupid in the movies that inspired this game, too, and 
 exist pretty much only to be mowed down by the hero. The only threat they pose is in numbers, and 
 the game sends them after you by the hundreds. There are also a few boss battles, but these are 
 usually just a matter of figuring out the bosss weakness, or being told what it is by the games 
 hint system. The tougher difficulty levels definitely provide a significantly greater challenge, 
 though.
  
  Stranglehold also has a multiplayer online mode, but the games focus on stylish gunplay doesnt 
 carry over very well. Instead these modes often turn into a race for the paper cranes and the most 
 powerful weapons, and whatever player manages to fill up his Tequila bomb gauge and pull off a 
 barrage or spin move first is pretty much unstoppable. Its also worth noting that the online community 
 doesnt seem very robust at this point, and weve had trouble finding games at times. Ultimately, 
 the single-player mode is certainly the main attraction here.
  
  Stranglehold looks nice, and as mentioned earlier, the most impressive thing about the visuals 
 is how the environments fall apart. Throughout the game youll wreak destructive havoc in a Hong 
 Kong marketplace, a casino, a posh Chicago penthouse, a museum, and elsewhere, so theres no shortage 
 of things to blast to bits. Aside from that, your enemies often go down in bloody, spectacular 
 fashion. The character models look pretty good, with Chow Yun-Fat looking a little too shiny but 
 sporting his signature scowl and carrying some of the charisma of the man himself. Of course, Chow 
 provides Tequilas voice, and he and the rest of the cast do a fine job, though its too bad the 
 story itself isnt a bit more interesting. The rest of the games sound presentation also gets 
 the job done, with the music being a mix of typical action movie orchestrations and traditional 
 Asian sounds, and the noises accompanying all the destruction sounding like they should.
  
  Youve most likely played games that are a lot like Stranglehold before, and its certainly not 
 the most innovative game on the market. But it does what it sets out to do well enough that most 
 fans of over-the-top action will probably enjoy it. Theres not enough content here to justify 
 a purchase, but if the thought of blasting a bunch of mooks in slow motion sounds like fun, Stranglehold 
 will probably keep you entertained enough to justify a rental.

Review:  After this entire wait, it's quite a satisfying experience to know that John Woo's Stranglehold 
 didn't fall into the ranks of mediocrity. Though it seems like a typical shooter, it is anything 
 but. What makes Stranglehold unique is the ability to interact with the environment. Almost everything 
 you shoot can be destroyed, to some degree, and theres tons you can do with each destructible 
 environment. And you just don't shoot things, you use things. Whether your jumping through the 
 air shooting your guns, swinging from chandeliers, sliding over countertops, running up stair railings, 
 jumping on rolling carts, or jumping off the walls, there's one thing in common, and that this 
 is style. Style points are earned by killing enemies in the most creative way possible. Just shooting 
 an enemy dead will only score you one point. You earn more style points by doings things like shooting 
 enemies from cover, shooting enemies while jumping through the air, killing enemies by shooting 
 exploding barrels, or even shooting a heavy object that comes crashing down on an enemy's head. 
 Extra style points can be earned just by simply turning on the slow motion. At most, you can earn 
 five style points per kill. Slow motion is an important element in this game, as there's lots of 
 bad guys to shoot, not to mention it'd be rather difficult to aim while performing special moves 
 in normal runtime. As I just said, slow motion can be turned on manually, or it'll kick in automatically 
 when performing a special move. Though, it is limited, so relying on it too much will deplete it 
 quite quickly; however, the slow motion meter also replenishes with time, and doesn't take much 
 time at all to refill. It's important not to let the slow motion meter run low, as you might find 
 yourself in need of it when you're surrounded. In times when you need that extra little help, you 
 can use one of four tequila bombs for either regaining some health, sniping enemies with precision 
 aim, getting limited invulnerability and greater fire-power for a limited amount of time, or a 
 special tequila bomb that kills everyone in the immediate area. Using these tequila bombs takes 
 away from your tequila bomb meter. Your tequila bomb meter can be replenished by earning style 
 points; thus, in lies your motivation toward earning style points, as it is not just some unnecessary 
 thing you do. Earning style points is even more crucial on harder difficulties as style points 
 fill up your tequila bomb meter much slower; therefore, mastery of earning style points is necessary 
 in order to make the most out of this game. Also, some of the tequila bomb meter can be replenished 
 by finding origami paper cranes, some being slightly hidden but nothing that'd take you away from 
 the action in the slightest; however, playing in the harder difficulty, it's essential to know 
 where a good number of them are. Your most basic weapons are pistols (which you can dual wield) , 
 shotguns, assault rifles, and submachine gun (which you can also dual wield) . Other, rarer weapons 
 exist, which are the golden guns (pistols that can kill in one shot) , the heavy machine gun, and 
 the rocket launcher. Later in the game, even grenades become a common weapon, and theyre useful 
 in taking out clusters of enemies at once. One great feature about the weapons is you can abandon 
 any reservations about conserving your munitions. This game encourages that you just let loose 
 and unload. You're allowed to carry two weapons at once, plus grenades. You never have to reload 
 your weapon, and when you run out of ammo you automatically pick up the next weapon you come across. 
 If you run out of ammo, you'll drop your gun and switch the other. Though, running out of ammo 
 isn't a concern since you're usually able to replenish ammunition before you run out, and unlike 
 lots of other shooters, dead bodies leave behind a good deal of ammunition (and theres also lots 
 of dead bodies) . The typical combat is that of the most cliche 80s action film; enemies come out 
 from everywhere by the dozens. In a single level you could easily leave behind a couple hundred 
 bodies. The game does a great job of making you feel like you belong in the hyper-realistic action. 
 Though the main character is a bullet sponge, this isn't the kind of action that warrants realistic 
 criticism. If you're familiar with the phrase flesh wound (e. g. as was the phrase in Last Action 
 Hero) , then you can easily suspend your disbelief in order to become enthralled by the awesomeness 
 being served. The game's story is that of the typical cop drama action film; there's a one man 
 army cop on the edge with no regard for preserving the landscape, who doesn't listen to his superior 
 and has a personal vendetta against some very very bad men. Basically, the same superficial formula 
 that lets you justify getting straight to the action. Though, some would argue that this game takes 
 place in the Hard Boiled universe, but that's irrelevant; this game makes itself great by its own 
 merit. There's also online multiplayer, which I've been unsuccessful in engaging in as nobody plays 
 on the network. Though, like most games that have slow motion effects for single player, the multiplayer 
 suffers as you can't slow down the real-time action. Also, for achievement whores, there might 
 be some incentive to want to engage in the multiplayer action to get at the 400 or so achievement 
 points that come from hosting and completing online games, and also a few of those going to successfully 
 killing other XBL challengers. That in itself offers some minor replay value for some. Some other 
 replay value comes from purchasing everything from the games Unlock Shop, which you purchase extra 
 features from by spending the style points you earn in the game. Completion of this also gives 
 you a few achievement points; though, if you keep playing the game those achievements pretty much 
 come naturally. The true replay value comes from wishing to complete the game at a greater difficulty, 
 which really puts you to the test of mastering your skills, and makes learning the game well worth 
 it. Though the game is short, just several chapters that can be completed in maybe three hours 
 (on the easiest difficulty) , the replay value is quite moderate. You can even pick your favorite 
 levels to play at any time, from the main menu. Whether to purchase this game or not is not something 
 I can say; though, I did buy it and I have no regrets in the least. Though, at the very least it 
 is definitely worth a play. The game may not be that original, nobody could really argue that, 
 but the influences on this game are pretty obvious, and the liberties that are taken with the precedent 
 genre features have been refined to make this game stand out, and it is welcome.

Review:  This game is really exellent if you are looking for a game to keep you entertained for about a 
 week..... other than that, nothing. This game is really fun while it lasts but, thats the thing 
 It doesn't last. The single player is pretty much you being a superagent who can dodge or survie 
 pretty much every bullet that comes at you. That's fun but, whats not fun is the terrible AI and 
 the fact that every bullet that comes at you is easy to survive or health is extremly simple to 
 get to. The story is about as cool as the main charector (that is not good) but, overall the gameplay 
 is fun and has some pretty sweet featers but, is only challenging if you play on the hardest difficulty. 
 The Multiplayer I must say SUCKS. The maps are about the size of my bedroom, I could probly read 
 the Lord of the Rings in between loading screens and they really droped the ball on the slow-mo 
 effects. Even if you hate everything about this game you can alawys realy on simple achivments.

Review:  I think that the game was great! Had all the shoot-em-up elements that I love with some really 
 cool in-game effects. Unfortunately, the ending was so abrupt that I literally held the controller 
 in my hand and said to myself, What, thats it? Give me more! I would have liked to have seen more 
 Gears of War style AI but hey, different game, different genre. After a while though, the constant 
 onslaught of enemies was getting a little redundant and the fact that they attacked from all sides 
 at once was a little annoying. I kind of wish that they'd spent more time on the storyline.

Review:  I love this games action but it just gets too repetitive after a while. The multiplayer still has 
 me playing this game but after you but single player once the only other time it's worth playing 
 is when you're trying to get one of the achievements. Also the single player is short and very 
 easy. Killing the bosses and taking down crowds of enemies even on the higher difficulties of this 
 game was a breeze. The multiplayer is ok. It's pretty fun except for the fact that it takes a little 
 while to kill your enemies. I like how they let you use Tequilla time and all of the Tequilla bombs 
 online. I also like the big selection of characters online.

 AVAILABLE DURING GAME AND ONLINE PLAY. MORE MAPS FOR ONLINE WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE ALSO. MAYBE ITS

Review:  Stranglehold is the type of game where you keep moving and keep shooting. While fun at first, these 
 games always lead to repetitive  is no exception. Don't get me 
 wrong, the game to very well put together, and a lot of fun to play. Once you finish it a few times, there's 
 little reason to go back. The Massive D as Midway calls it is exceptional. Everything, and i mean 
 everything takes damage, and the use of Havok physics is immplemented here to best i've ever seen. Graphics 
 are good, but nothing groundbreaking. Gameplay is very, and i mean very similar to Max Payne.... including 
 the slow-mo gun play. Overall, the game is fun, but honestly, not worth the $50 price tag. Makes an 
 incredible rental, or wait for the price to drop!

Review:  Stranglehold is, from what I hear, A Max Payne rip off. Having never played that game, I can't 
 say for sure, so my review is taken from the perspective of someone who hasn't played a game quite 
 like this. That said, there's really nothing new here. Which isn't necesarily a bad thing, sometimes 
 if games arn't innovative in any way but improve existing content, they can still be great. Like 
 Bioshock, for example.
  
  Graphics: 9
  Everything has sort of a bland feel, and nothing will ever exactly LOOK spectacular and make you 
 say wow , but that's part of why they are so good. The game takes place in a real life scenario, 
 and every looks real-lifish. The amount of destruction is also impressive.
  
  Gameplay: 7
  Nothing really new. All the moves - which are fun at first - get pretty old eventually. 
 This is made up for by there being TONS of moves to do, which there is, and they are fun.. But 
 like I said, they do get old. Gunplay is really nothing new or great, nor is the bullettime. Fun, 
 but gets old. Another MAJOR complaint is the difficulty. I played on the hardest mode. Most of 
 the game was pretty easy, but there was a few rooms that were just frustrating as hell. Some rooms 
 in particular took me 5+ hours (on one room) to try and beat, many times getting pretty far just 
 to die because someone spawned behind you and insta-killed you with melee (happens a lot) . The 
 checkpoint system could have been improved in these areas. Bosses were fun and all fairly unique.
 
  
  Sound: 8
  everything sounds pretty good, all the voice actors are good as well.. The only voice actor that 
 wasn't up to par was the one who did Tequila (who you play) . Which is Ironic, considering he's 
 an actor and I'm assuming most others wern't.
  
  Story: 2
  Nothing here.. There wasn't much of a story, most cutscenes were pointless, and didn't explain 
 anything. The story that WAS there was your wife and daughter have been kidnapped .. nothing new. 
 Quite the opposite. Perhaps seeing the movie would have helped? Story will not effect my score 
 by much, however, seeing as this game wasn't about it's story.
  
  Total: 6.5 (not an average) .

Review:  Midways game Stranglehold is a one of a kind game that is extremely entertainning to play for a 
 lil while until it just becomes pretty pretentious. If you don't know the plot of the game its 
 a pretty simple set up. Your a cop sent to a slum to look for another cop that has gone missing. 
 On arrival you are greeted by a few thugs who very much want to fill you full of lead. As the game 
 progresses you find out that two crimelords are having a war with each other and your girlfriend 
 thats the crimelords daughter is now captured by the opposing crimelord. So your girlfriend's father 
 asks for your help and you are sent to the states to recues your girl and kick a lil backside while 
 doing it.
  
  Anyways midways attempt to try to bring a action gunplay movie to a video game was a pretty good 
 attempt. The plot that was thrown into the game was well thought out even through you got the feeling 
 of seeing this movie before and soo want to change the channel but can't. The gameplay mechanics 
 were pretty fun to behold for the first time. The gameplay isn't like most games where you run 
 in and blast your way through opposition. No instead you have the ability to jump into the air 
 and slow down time and blast your foes to bits. Every foe you kill you get graded on and that grade 
 goes to your ability's and recharges them. You have four abilitys that you will unlock in the game 
 they are health, pecison shot, barriage, and a whirlwind shot that kills everyone thats surrounding 
 you. The other big improvement about this game that many other fps don't have is the ablitity to 
 destroy your environment. Gosh I had tons of fun with this feature from blowing neon light signs 
 off of buildings on to people or just blowing walls apart with a automatic weapon. And the last 
 thing about the game mechanics is a standoff feature that shows you going up against multipal guys 
 and leaves you dodging bullets and blasting them. I didn't like this feature that much it just 
 took away from the gameplay whenever it happened not to mention it was arkward moving the crosshairs 
 onto the guy to shoot them.
  
  Even with all of these cool features after you complete a level or two everything starts to feel 
 the same and evening blowing stuff apart with your weaponary gets old. Other then the game mechancis 
 the voice acting was pretty good movie style all the way. Music was decent even through you didn't 
 hear much of it when your going through levels since the guns going off blocks out the music. The 
 only thing that put this game down a few notches was probably the graphics and charactor looks. 
 Graphicallly everything seems kinda xbox generation with a hint of next generation with lighting 
 and shadows and everything. To conclude, stranglehold isn't a bad game by no means. The game is 
 extremely entertainning as long as you don't try to play a marathon play you will whole heartedly 
 enyoy the experence.

Review:  Stranglehold is a game that is a indirect sequel to the movie named Hard-Boiled, which was a John 
 Woo film featuring Chow Yun-Fat. This film was a huge cult success, and has some really great action 
 sequences. But we aren't here to talk movies, were here to talk about the game Stranglehold. This 
 is, as you would expect coming from John Woo (how much he was a part of it doesn't matter here) , 
 action packed. If your looking for some quick fun and hectic combat, you should play this game.
 
  
  The gameplay itself is pretty solid. You go around from level to level shooting up the place, while 
 shooting at the guys. The aiming is a little oddly sensitive, but once you get used to it your 
 fine. Pretty much the whole environment is destructible, and you can use it to kill your enemies. 
 For example there is a lighted sign above an enemy, just shot the sign, and it will fall on the 
 enemy.
  
  Then of course all of the action comes together in Tequila time. This system is a lot like the 
 bullet time seen in Max Payne. Practically as Tequila, you flail around by diving and going in 
 to slo-mo and killing the enemies. You can also engage the mode by using the interactive environment. 
 Examples such as sliding down rails, or jumping on to rolling carts. These instances are really 
 cool, but getting them to work is sometimes a little buggy. Tequila also has some cool special 
 powers that he can use in combat. He can preform a cinematic spin move, have infinite ammo and 
 just pummel the enemy, or can snipe a guy with precision aim. These powers are fun to use, but 
 unfortunately most of them you don't really need to use. Since it is the same thing all the time, 
 you'll feel yourself getting better at normal combat anyways. Although the combat feels rewarding 
 at first, you'll find that for how linear the game is, it gets quite tedious and boring.
  
  The graphics in the game are really great. You can see the blood on Tequila when he gets shot quite 
 a bit. Although the graphics might gross you out the most once your start messing with precision 
 aim. It will follow the bullet right up to the guy your shooting, then you can watch him as he 
 bleeds out. This is absolutely ridiculous, and will probably gross you out a bit, but it can be 
 very rewarding. This is also comes with the specific animations the characters have. They don't 
 have many, but they have enough to distinguish where he got shot. For instance shooting him in 
 the arm, or the comedy of the crotch shot. Overall the animations are nothing way to special. The 
 frame will at some points hitch up a bit, mainly when when around some crashing environment and 
 explosions. Overall the graphics are pretty good.
  
  The voice acting is not very good, except when our man Tequila is around. With Chow Yun-Fat's voice 
 in the game, it's hard to say that the game has some terrible voice acting. But unfortunately the 
 voice acting just seems really corny. With the one bad guy who wears the glasses thinking he's 
 all that, it can be sometimes just ridiculous what he says. And some of the tough guy's voices 
 (like the guy making the deal in the bar at the end of the demo) just don't feel that way. It's 
 like a little boy trying to scream at you for attention, really it's not that engaging.
  
  While the game may feel the same all the way through, it's hard not to like the game at least a 
 little bit. It may be worth some people's time, but not exactly everyone. If your looking for absolute, 
 straight up action, and you don't really care about story, then this game is a good one to check 
 out. Otherwise, you may as well just rent it.

Review:  Of course technically Max Payne owes so much to Chow and Woo, but thats another story. This review 
 is simple. This game is a blast to play, no pun intended. As long as you know what you are getting 
 into, which is a good fun game where you blow crap up... you will not be disappointed. You mow 
 your way through about 8 bajillion dudes, and some helicopters. Stuff explodes all around you, 
 and each stage looks like swiss cheese by the time you are done. It is fun, and thats all you need 
 to know. Graphics: 9. I give the graphics a 9 simply for the crazy amount of crap that you can 
 blow up, wood splinters, stone breaks, sparks fly its great fun. The character models get over 
 used, and some look kinda lifeless. Sound. 8. Not bad, the bullet sounds are good. There are a 
 lot of effects for bullets hitting different material types which is a great thing. Game play: 
 Its just plain fun. Make a good custom soundtrack, sit back and shoot. Replay: Its a short game, 
 but with this type of game play, you really don't want something that drags on for 20 hours. So 
 the length of the game and the game play definitely make it re playable. Overall: It's just fun. 
 Don't take it too serious, or think that it will be game of the year.

Review:  Now this game is max Payne in almost every way but it still is great. Basically what makes this 
 game fun is the way that you slow down time has you do certain things such as slide on tables or 
 do a dive. When time slows down you basically can doge all bullets coming for you and be able to 
 shot some nice head shots back. The game is basically a follow up to John Woo's movie Hard boiled. 
 Now i had never seen it before but about a week before strangleholds release i decided t take a 
 look. And yes the game does feel very sequel to the movie. So if you like john Woo and his films 
 then i guess this game would be good for you. Now the environment in the game is really destructible. 
 As you shoot and a pillar the sides will slowly be chipped away until the person hiding behind 
 wont have any more cover which is sort of cool. Also you will find allot of the buildings in the 
 game will just be blown to nothing as you play through. Now although the gamepaly is decent and 
 the environment is nice and the graphics and story are both worth while the game is very short. 
 There aren't many levels at all and even though each level seems to take an hour to an hour and 
 30 minutes the game will probably only take you about 7-9 hours maybe 10-12 if you play Tequila 
 difficulty. Now you may think well there is multi player so that will add a lot more hours of fun. 
 Well the multi player isn't nearly as good as it could have been. You will find sometimes when 
 you try to slow down time it will work but allot of the time it will just fail. All in all: stranglehold 
 is a pretty good game. It was definitely worth the wait after it kept getting delayed so many times. 
 Its short yes but the action is intense. Nothing beats running up to an enemy with a shotgun and 
 watching as he gets the biggest head shot ever in slow mothin. The multi player isn't anything 
 special. This game is 100% worth a rent but it probably isn't worth a buy because after you beat 
 the game once in 10 hours you probably wont play it again.

Review:  This game is on of the best shooters I have ever played for the XBOX360. It has a very intriguing 
 and compelling story that will keep you wanting more. Their are many parts of this game that make 
 it a great game. The slow motion precision aim is very awesome along with the rest of the tequila 
 bombs. The best tequila bomb to use in a tight situation is the spin attack, Tequila goes into 
 a slow mo cutscene and starts to shoot in every direction and by doing so kills every enemy around. 
 The multiplayer in this game is great to say the least, my friend and I have been playing it and 
 we noticed how awesome it felt to have your enemy diving over you and then just at the right time 
 you use the Tequila time move, thus slowing down your enemy and allowing you to apply more damage 
 and gain an edge on your opponent. There are a few downsides to Stranglehold though. The story 
 mode is way to short and in my opinion is completely impossible to beat on Hard Boiled difficulty. 
 The only other problem I had with stranglehold was the stupid loading screens OMG!!! You spend 
 more time in the loading screens in multiplayer than playing the game it's rediculous!! 870/1000 
 Gamerscore in stranglehold if anyone knows who to beat story mode on hard boiled please contact 
 me I can help you with any other achievements!!!!

Review:  Let's just get it out of the way Stranglehold is Max Payne in every sense. From the slow motion 
 gameplay down to the crazy russion named Vlad. This is not a bad thing, though. The game captures 
 the slowmotion flow of Max Payne perfectly, and is fun to play. The graphics of the game are nicely 
 done. The charecter models are unbelievablel they look just like thier real life counterparts, 
 and although the enviroments arne't too flashy you wont be able to keep your eyes off of them. 
 The way things fall into dust is remarkable. This game does things that Black could only wish to 
 do, and it does a great job to keep the game fast paced, and add alot in the way of killing people 
 with the enviroment, which never ceases to be fun. Although this game is much like Max Payne it 
 stil has a few tweaks that are uniquely stranglehold. From being able to swing on things hanging 
 from the ceiling to being able to roll on carts, but the most obvious change is in the tequila 
 bombs. There are 3 different tequila bombs. The first is Precision aim, which allows you to zoom 
 in on your enemy . It's nice and allows you to see all of the cool death animations (go for the 
 balls) , but it doesnt work that well online, because of the shear speed that your enenmies are 
 moving at, but it evens this out by making it a one hit kill if you shoot the person. The second 
 is barrage, which is like rage mode in the punisher. The screen fades to blue and your charecter 
 becomes invincable, and your attacks are exteremely powerful. The last is spin attack, which is 
 basically a smart bomb that kills all enemies on the screen. It works differently online, by haviing 
 you spin in a circle in tequila time, and turning all of your shots inot one hit kills (you cant 
 kill people in barage though) . The problems with the game are few, but stil important. The first 
 and biggest one is that the game is quite short, but after Max Payne2 maybe you should have expected 
 that, but it will be hard to keep yourself from going back to play through again on the harder 
 difficulties and go for the acheivements. The other problem is small, but can still get annoying 
 at times. Like Gears of War they put just a little bit too much on the same button. The left trigger 
 is not only dive but interact so at times you may get a little annoyed by tequila jumping on a 
 rail when you want him to dive foreward. The other problems are in the online, but first I just 
 want to say that the online doesnt lagg, which is a huge step over several other games with online 
 componenets that came out earlyer this year (The Darkness Two Worlds) . The biggest problem is in 
 the use of the tequila time. I commend them for trying ot use it in the online, but it doesnt work 
 out to well. You can only use it when everybody else is able to use it, so usually you wont be 
 able to use it, and when it does come on it will most likely be when you just running around aimlessly. 
 This does work out okay in smaller rooms though. Speaking of smaller rooms, thats what you'll usually 
 be in, becuase the online has a lock out feature, which basically means that how many players the 
 game starts with is the number of players throughout the entire game, this mostely means that it 
 will be hard to find a game, and when you get into one the person hosting will probably start it 
 quickly, but if you can deal with these minor problems you will find a nice and fun expeirience.

Review:  It has been a while since we had a good old fashioned shoot em up game. We have game with a lot 
 of gun play but they are either strategy, open world with missions, or the ever so popular FPS. 
 Games have gotten so advanced today that we have forgot about just having a game where all you 
 have to do is shoot and survive. This simple formula was put to some good use in Stranglehold.
 
  
  The game play is very fast paced yet easy to master. You start off with some simple dual pistols 
 and your basic Tequila time (slow the world down around you) skills. As you progress through the 
 game you will unlock different special skills that are all very useful and a very descent variety 
 of weapons. One action button allows you to dive, walk on ledges, jump off of walls, slide down 
 ropes, and even grind on descending platforms. Your character also will automatically slide across 
 any waste high platforms as you run around the levels. Performing any of these actions while aiming 
 at an enemy will result in slow motion action that will allow you to gun down multiple enemies 
 with ease to earn points and keep your Tequila Bomb meter full. Your Tequila Bomb meter is what 
 allows you to Performa very useful special skills by pressing the corresponding button on the D-pad. 
 The first skill is a health boost which can help you replenish health one tiny bit at a time while 
 killing enemies in case no first aid kit is around. The second one you will receive is a precision 
 aim that allows an extreme close up of a target (enemy or object) one you find your mark you can 
 shoot and watch the animation of following the bullet to its destination. For example, if you aim 
 directly at the head of an enemy and fire the camera will follow behind the bullet and when it 
 hits you foe in the head you can watch closely as your enemy suffers from a critical gunshot wound. 
 Yes, this is as cool as it sounds, I have shot enemies in the neck, mouth, eyeball, and even where 
 the sun don't shine and they react exactly to where the bullet hits. Third, is the Barrage. This 
 starts off as an animated sequence which shows you loading what ever weapon it is you are holding 
 and then for a short period of time you can go on an invincible rampage unloading boxes of ammo 
 that do extra damage. Finally, you have your spin attack witch is a fully animated sequence when 
 you unload on all enemies around you. Any enemy that is currently present in the room will be killed 
 automatically unless they are a level boss. The best part about the Barrage and the Spin attack 
 is that they do not use any of your ammunition.
  The level design on this game is refreshing. Each level is unique from one to the next and almost 
 completely destructible. The characters also look great and along with the cool animation you can 
 tell that the developers took advantage of next-gen technology. Also, with surround sound speakers 
 the gunfire and explosions sound excellent.
  Although the story mode is a little short, the game itself is so fun and action packed you will 
 definitely want to play through it again to see if you can get the highest grade possible on each 
 level by putting all your skills to use.
  Although the multiplayer is not much of a bonus this game is still a high action packed shoot em 
 up that will make you feel like you just filmed a John Woo blockbuster.

Review:  stranglehold,
  
  gives you a action packed game experience, but leaves you in the wind
  
  with gun's, Slow motion, Diving, and more gun's
  the single player is surprisingly short for 
 how long the game has been devoliping, and after you beat the game you may only wanna go through 
 it just one more time before you become bored. The game does have good action yes. but not much else. the 
 story will lose you at time and well it just isnt that good, it's like weve seen it all before,
 
  
  Gameplay- fast action packed, taking cover is useless you will get hit anyway sliding over tables 
 happens almost to much as you dont mean to and you just kinda end up diving at everything and everyone, the 
 camara is clunky and annoying to turn. but the shoot outs are fun and will keep you entertained 
 for a while....
  
  Graphics- not so bad not as good as it should have been. from the early footage we had seen, some 
 things can really look ugly while others look nice almost to nice for the others
  
  sound- meh, nothing to memories good gun sounds at the most voice overs are impressive music is 
 just kinda there
  
  online- it's fun for the most part but something you really could live without
  
  overall- 
 stranglehold isnt a bad game but nether is it the best game ever it's a so so game that you will 
 either like alot. our give a hoot about
  
  Rent It First..

Review:  what i really like about this game is the way that all the environment blow apart, specially when 
 you kill a guy by shooting at some of the gas cans and the guy blows away exploiting himself to 
 the walls...... this is an amazing part of the game..... another thing that i really like is the 
 large variety of guns, they work great. i really recommend this game is you are a fan of slow motion 
 and guns, this two options combine create such a nice game. this game is based on the hard boiled 
 movie and it has the same kind of action,,,, this game is basically kill and destroy everything. 
 the game story is fantastic and it get your attention from the beginning making you play to the 
 end.

Review:  Stranglehold is the first game presented by John Woo, and is set in the universe of his 1992 movie 
 Hard Boiled, casting players as renegade Hong Kong cop Inspector Tequila.
  
  The gameplay in Stranglehold is, to be perfectly honest, nothing all that new. If you have ever 
 played the Max Payne series, this has much the same feel, just without all the depression. The 
 environments are well detailed, though the graphics aren't really pushing the limits of the system. 
 However, somewhat lacking environments are a small price to pay for the fact that ANYTHING will 
 be damaged by your shots. Is there a guy shooting at you? Drop a neon sign on him. Someone standing 
 on the roof of a shack? Bring it down. In the end of each mission, you are rated based on how many 
 $ worth of damage you did to the environment, with an achievement being available for amounts over 
 $75,000,000.
  
  The biggest place the graphics shine is in the character models. They all animate almost perfectly 
 and look absolutely fantastic, particularly Chow Yun Fat.
  
  The sound is also good, with powerful weapon effects and a decent soundtrack. The voice-acting, 
 though, is quite possibly the best part of the game and some of the best I've ever heard. Chow 
 Yun Fat resumes his role as Inspector Tequila, though in English rather than Cantonese this time. 
 The rest of the cast as well is excellent in their various cliched gangster movie roles; the ever-angry 
 police chief, the undercover mole, the old mob boss fighting a young upstart - it's all there.
 
  
  Unfortunately, this is a game that even I, a severely average gamer, can beat in around 6 hours. 
 Since it is so short, though, you don't mind playing it a second or third time, especially since 
 some of the achievements are so fun to get, i. e., 50 kills while hanging from a chandelier.
  
  In summary, Stranglehold is a fantastic, arcadey shooter with good graphics and an amazing 
 vocal cast, but ends up being hurt a little by it's length, or lack thereof. However, any fan of 
 John Woo or Chow Yun Fat is obliged to, at the very least, rent it.

Review:  Max Payne and Max Payne 2 were 2 of my favorite XBox shooters. I still enjoy so called Hard Boiled 
 private eye novels and films. Everyone this week was telling me to buy BioShock, I tried the BioShock 
 Demo, but for now, wanted something simpler and just fun. Stranglehold fits the fun bill just fine. 
 I purchased the Collectors Edition and also the game guide. One achievement in Stranglehold, you 
 find all the hidden orgamie birds, sorta like finding all the hidden birds in Condemmed. So I thought 
 I would get the game guide just to have maps of where all the birds are, in case I cannot find 
 some. I wanted the Collectors Edition for the Extras DVD, which features a nice feature on the 
 games music and sound. Stranglehold is a pure shooter. I still wish Frame CIty Killer had not been 
 cancelled, it looked like more than a shooter. Stranglehold is not trying to be anything more than 
 a few hours of John Woo style gun battles. If you are a big Woo and Chow fan, it is a good buy. 
 Not a game you would play in one setting. Maybe one Level a week is right. Some interesting achievements, 
 so if on the fence, read the achievement list and see if they appeal to you. Stranglehold is as 
 close as we can get to starring in a John Woo movie. If you never finish longer shooters or more 
 complicated ones, this is your shooter. Its a beautiful game to play, watch and hear.

Review:  The Good
  ========
  There is so many enemies to kill using your weapon skill and your special ability to slow down. 
 great sound effects to go with great guns. the environment comes in handy to get to get to the 
 other side shoot enemies and even kill them.
  
  The Bad =======
  The game is very repetitive but very short so it kind of makes up for that. Graphics kind of look 
 non 360 for some parts. Annoying finding wood and barrels to shoot to get you somewhere.
  
  Overall
  ======
  A good game for a fan of shooters and john woo but to short ans short of extras 
 to be worth 60 dollars but it still deserves a try.

Review:  I enjoyed this game... its not a gears of war or even a rainbow six game. On the back of the game... 
 it says it is up there with those games. I can not say I agree... The look of the game is nice... 
 it is a pretty game. The levels are nice looking and the layout of each level are pretty nice as 
 well. The controles can get annoying though... it is probably just me though. The sound is very 
 good... there is a level were it is raining... and the thunder is amazing. If you have a surround 
 sound system... crank it up. I must of jumped when i heard the CRASH of thunder in this game. It 
 has some of the best sound that I have heard in a game.
  
  Fun factor... it is fun... but It is a good thing that this game is short... cuz it would get old 
 fast.
  
  To me... it is not all about how it looks or sounds... but how is the story. I am a very story 
 driven player. The story is good... and it does feel like a good action movie. I just saw SHOOT'EM 
 UP and while I was watching the movie I thought about this game the entire time... then I cam home 
 and played more of it... The vocie acting is good... some voices though does not FIT. But you can 
 get over that... but overall... it is worth the $59.99 if your into a fun shoot'em up type of game...

Review:  The Good: Spiritual sequel to John Woo's Hard Boiled , fantastic over the top action and non stop 
 thrills, exciting alterations to Max Payne's bullet time consept, almost everything is destructable, 
 very nice graphics overall.
  
  The Bad: Somewhat ugly character models, can get repetitive after hours and hours of gameplay, 
 short game clocking in at around 7 hours, no regular jump button.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  
  Back when the Xbox 360 was unvailed, Midway announced their first next generation game would be 
 Stranglehold, an action game starring Chow Yun Fat and in collaboration with legendary action director 
 John Woo. The game was delayed for two years and finally has seen the light of day. The budget 
 for this game is supposively the most expensive game ever made. So, was it money well spent for 
 Midway. In most ways, absolutely. Stranglehold is actually a spiritual sequel to Woo's classic 
 Hong Kong style action flick, Hard Boiled starring Chow Yun Fat as Inspector Tequilla, a hard nosed 
 cop on the edge. At the begining of the game, a cop is killed by a Chinese mob and Tequilla steps 
 in to take out the trash. The plot is interesting, but what sets Stranglehold appart from the rest 
 of the typical action games out there is the over the top, crazy action sequences. Tequilla can 
 vault over tables and other objects in the environment, slide down or walk up railings, do backflips 
 off of walls and slide onto rolling carts for some really impressive action movie style moves. 
 The big thing here is Tequilla Time, which is basically Bullet Time from the Max Payne series. 
 Tequilla time allows you to preform these crazy moves in slow motion, meaning you can take out 
 hoards of enemies by using it over and over in combination with these moves. There are also special 
 moves known as Tequilla Bombs. These moves can be used by preforming stylish kills. There is a 
 style meter on the left side of the screen, and when you combine moves with Tequilla time and cool 
 kills, you gain style points on a 1 to 5 star scale. The more stylized your kills, the more the 
 Tequilla Bomb meter fills and the more Tequilla Bombs you can use during a firefight. You start 
 off with a basic healing special, but later advance to having a focus shot, where you watch as 
 a bullet zooms in slow motion at an enemy and hits them exactly where you wanted it to, with often 
 gruesome resaults. You also have barrage, where you go Rambo on a group of enemies with unlimited 
 ammo and no need to reload. You also have a spin attack for when you are surrounded by enemies.
 
  
  One cool inovention in this game is the ambush mini game. When Tequilla get's ambushed, you go 
 into a mini game where you dodge enemy bullets and shoot one enemy, then go zooming to the next. 
 Mastering this mini-game can help you get through a bunch of enemies without taking a scratch.
 
  
  Another thing that makes Stranglehold so cool is the fact that pretty much everything in the game 
 is destructable. You fight in a marketplace in one of the early levels, and can destroy the entire 
 place before you're done. You can blow up buildings by destroying explosive objects, sending all 
 surrounding enemies to their doom. The fact is, gamers who enjoy tons of crazy action will adore 
 Stranglehold. There are a few problems that hamper the experience, though. First, the game has 
 no jump button. You are able to jump at select points by pressing the left trigger, but only for 
 stylish kills and the like, not for basic jumping. Second, the character models aren't the best, 
 even though the explosions and gameplay in general looks fantastic. Third, the game apparently 
 clocks in at around 7 hours, so it's not exactly a long game. There is an online multiplayer game 
 that I haven't tried yet, but I will just to see how it is. Look for my updated impressions once 
 I beat the game and check out the multiplayer modes.
  
  Overall, Stranglehold is a brief, but super exciting thrill ride that action fans at least have 
 to check out, if not buy.
  
  Gameplay: Stylish kills, special moves and Tequilla Time make this an action game that is hard 
 to forget about.
  
  Graphics: Solid overall, but the character models aren''t the best.
  
  Sound: Excellent voice work by all the leading actors.
  
  Value: It's $60 (or $70 for the 
 Collector's Edition) and the game is only 7 hours or so long, so it might be best to rent the game 
 before desiding to buy it.
  
  Final Thoughts: I didn't, I brought my two friends...

Review:  Ok let me give you my opinion, its a good game but few things could have have made it better. like 
 for example the fact that there arent many weapons , I mean come on this is a john woo action game. 
 In my opinion the could added magnums, desert eagles, glocks, aks (since there are russians in 
 the game) , mps 5, granade launchers ( well maybe not this) , ect. I dont know but you get the point. 
 Moving on, the game plays well. things as they already said they blow up really nice which adds 
 to the intensity of the game. all the lvls arent repetive and there pretty nice looking as well 
 as some clear and awesome graphics.
  
  Another bad thing of the game is its too freakin short, I hated that. You probably gonna go through 
 it on 6 hours or less. I suggest you choose hard so you make the best of it. Hmm let see, one thing 
 it could have come in handy would have been the option of rolling , cause sometimes i felt the 
 need to roll instead of just jumping around like a monkey. but oh what the hell... Another thing 
 you might notice is the guy doesnt reload, which I kinda of didnt liked it. People will say you 
 know since its chow yun-fat and he doesnt reload on his movies. But I mean it could have added 
 to the intesity of the game, I dont know for me I wanted to reload.
  
  One of the things you will notice at the start of the game is the menu, which I found it was really 
 original , I like go through the whole menu and seeing every detail of it. And it felt like one 
 of the BEST menu I have ever seen.
  
  And last but not final , let talk about the multiplayer.
  
  The multiplayer is up 6 player, 
 it feels alright in my opinion for this kinda of game and its really enjoyable. Since you see people 
 flying over and slow mo time and the blowing up thier brains in mid-air making there bodies fly 
 over something and crashing. Its just satisfying!!!
  
  Overrall
  
  Its a Good action Game , but too short.
  I Say dont buy it , but rent it. Cause its definetly 
 worth Checking out.
  Two more things if your interested in: The Collectors Edition is a rip-off
  And the Achievements 
 are easy.

Review:  This is the first time I put in a review for the games I have played. The action are excellent 
 with so many movement combination you can try with. Once you mastered the controlled, you can put 
 on many movement you can think of for each level and this actually give you a very good replay 
 value.
  Some feels it is too short but actually it is a very good game that make you feel you don't have 
 enough of action and asking for more. Replaying with difficulty setting and you will have more 
 actions and ways to complete the game. Excellent game from John Woo. Looking forward another masterpiece 
 'The Red Cliff'

Review:  I think this game is not too bad and not too good. Its just at a right level. The fact that there 
 is bullet time, or shuold I say, Tequila Time !! haha But seriously, this game is fun to play.. not 
 the best but you'll be satisfied at the end. I like the style of Agent Tequla and the role he plays. 
 It almost feels as if the game was actually a movie. I like the way they anounce this game because 
 of Chow Yun Fat. The graphics on this game are pretty good, but could be better. The gameplay is 
 there.. but it gets repetatvie sometimes. Bullet Time is awsome! You can never go wron with just 
 a little bullet time. Also the way that the whole scenarios or envirements react to any of your 
 desicions are Maginficant!!! Well, thanx for reading guys. :)

Review:  After playing the demo on XBOX LIVE, I had to have this game, but when I read the review that not 
 only gamespot gave, but a host of other game sites giving it less than 8, I started to wonder if 
 this game would be worth my 60 bucks. Well, I got the game and I must say, it's been a friggin' 
 fragg fest of a good time. I've also come to the conclusion that, the gamer can't always trust 
 the opinion of others. One may say... oh, this is only worthy of a 6, and you may see it as an 
 8 or 9, such was the case with stranglehold. Gamespot gave it a 7 and said it was only worth a 
 rentle ( unless you're a diehard John Woo fan ) , but I gave it a 9.5 and I am not a diehard John 
 Woo fan. The graphics are great, gameplay is dead on, pacing is good, it's not to long (like Bioshock, 
 good game but took 4ever) sound is great... its all there... it's FUUUUUUUNNNNNNN!!!!!!!! Well, 
 at least I enjoy it.
  
  Slide down a railing, jump onto a food cart, roll up and shoot a guy in the face with a shottie 
 in slo-mo... yeah. Good times indeed!

Review:  I have been waiting awhile for Stranglehold to come out since I first heard about it. Although 
 I think the game could have been a little bit longer, it does offer some movie style action. For 
 some people the game play can be repetitive, but I think that's where the style points come in. 
 If you try to shoot or kill someone with a little more style you get points and also does not make 
 the game action so repetitive. Trying to shoot the environment to kill the baddies is just as fun 
 as poppin' a cap in their heads! Overall I think it is an entertaining game and a decent shooter, 
 but it also comes with a weak story line to piece the stages together. I doubt there would be a 
 sequel to this one, but if there was, there can be room for improvement.

Review:  Stanglehold, a sequel based on the John Woo movie Hard Boiled, brings you into the part of Inspector 
 Tequila, voiced by Chow-Yun Fat. You are put into scene as an insane cop who resorts to all out 
 destruction to bring justice and honor. This game has the most spectacular voice acting as well 
 as a stellar story. Mostly every enviroment is destructible, leading to your total balance of debt 
 due to the level. Weapons are very fun, but the slow-motion and Tequila Bombs are what makes the 
 game. Including Percision Aiming, a slowmotion single shot; barrage, all out invincibility and 
 fast bullets; and lastly Spin-Attack which is a cinematic shooting that kills everyone around you. 
 The multipalyer I have yet to play, but sounds a bit shacky. Graphics are very good and detailed 
 and the soundtrack is superb. The very few bad parts to this game, such as length and reperitvity, 
 can be put aside due to this games' great functions.

Review:  This game is awesome... Just plain awesome. The story mode is great, being able to go into Tequila 
 time anytime you want is cool because you get to attempt to pull off the coolest move ever. The 
 actualy story doesnt make total sense but it keeps you invloved and its a pretty good story. Tequila 
 is the main character and he is a total bad*** he changes his costume a couple times throughout 
 the game and each times looks cooler then the last. The multiplayer is alot of fun to just mess 
 around in with friends, and its still fun to have a serious game in. Overall this game is a great 
 game that everyone should atleast try.

Review:  I'll didn't know why Gamespot put 7.0 for this game, maybe they have their own reason but nevermind, 
 for me this game don't deserve 7.0, but 8.0 and above. I'll just played and finished the game, 
 and for me the game graphic is truely next gen graphic, gameplay is full packed of action direct 
 by John Woo himself and the games truely resembles Max Payne with more upgrade graphic and action. 
 Maybe the story is little short and weak but it still good because the gameplay is great. For multiplayer 
 section, i had report that many users had difficulties to kill each other by using action button 
 when shooting. They like to crouch when shooting then do action while shooting. Maybe that problems 
 make this game rating going down. But for users out there, i'll suggest you to buy this game if 
 you like shooter action games because the feel when you shooting at enemies is different than any 
 action shooters outhere. In conclusion, thank you Midway and John Woo because they make a good 
 games for Xbox 360. I'll hope i can see the next installment of Mortal Kombat soon with High Def 
 Graphic and gameplay from Midway.

Review:  the game gets off ot a good start, fun and exciting but after a while using the same moves over 
 and over again got a little tiering and boring which is prolly the fact why the game is so short 
 but i think tht if they added different little tircks here and there in every level once and a 
 while i wuld paly 100 levels of it itsk inda addicting then jus drops yu. i wuld recomend renting 
 it first jus the fact tht u shuld make sure u actually dont mind the moves over and over again. 
 ull prolly beat in 5 days to so there ya go unless u want ot paly live. i actually have nothing 
 to say about live only the reason because my dog ate my ethernet cable os i havent had live for

Review:  Well, this is my first review and i have to say this is a good game to start it on. Stranglehold 
 is one of the best shooters i've played in a while. It combines fast-pace action with a semi-destructible 
 environment. I mean basically any gamer's dream. Its better than Max Payne!!!! I can't believe 
 Gamespot gave it a 7? whts up with them and downrating everything. It's a great game you should 
 pick it up if you haven't already. This really does bring the next gen status bar up a bunch. The 
 Tequila Bomb is a interseting new style in a game. It really makes this game special.

Review:  John Woos Stranglehold was the next title on my list and like its action movie cousin; this game 
 is action packed, has a high body count and is very short. Stranglehold has a certain cinematic 
 flair thats usually not found in games but that only pushes this 5-6 hour game so far.
  
  Chow Yun Fat is easily recognizable reprising his role, Inspector Tequila, from the 1992 movie 
 Hardboiled and this instant recognition sets the stage of what looks like a pretty fantastic game 
 in motion. The character models are of a slightly lower quality than the environment but that really 
 doesnt matter seeing as the foes are only onscreen for 10 seconds before they are blown away.
 
  
  The environments on the other hand are fantastic looking, each filled to the brim with clutter 
 that can be knocked over or destroyed. Ive never seen a game with this much destruction going 
 on at once, so much so that even if you miss your intended target, youre bound to hit something 
 before the bullet lands. In fact, hitting things in the environment happens to be a good way to 
 get rid of enemies, whether its hitting an explosive barrel or a support beam holding up scaffolding. 
 You can use things in the environment to make your kills more fantastic in other ways too. Sliding 
 down railings, swinging from chandeliers, sliding along carts and everything cause the game to 
 go in slow motion while you have an enemy in your sights so that its easier to kill everyone you 
 come in contact with and to crank up the style.
  
  Each of these kills earns you style points that fill up the tequila gauge; the flashier the combo 
 the more stars you get for your gauge. The gauge ends up being more of a necessity than a side 
 thought as later in the game the various tequila bombs end up being essential for survival.
  
  Tequila bombs are the special abilities that Inspector Tequila has. They enable him to heal 
 a small amount of life, make precise and powerful shots, go berserk with ammo or spin around and 
 kill everyone possible in a situation with a bomb-like effect. At first these powers seem like 
 a nice little addition but later on the game it becomes almost impossible to deal with the amount 
 of foes thrown at you without them.
  
  Two other ways to fill up your meter in the game; you can collect origami swans that fill a portion 
 of the meter or get a nice boost from the duels that take place. In proper over-the-top fashion, 
 Tequila is often faced with five or so people aiming guns at his face. While your feet stay stationary 
 you can lean left and right to dodge shots in slow motion while you try to get rid off the enemies 
 with either direct shots or nice reactions from the environment.
  
  In the end, this is what happens through all 6 hours that the game lasts. Gun battle after gun 
 battle in beautiful locations with millions of dollars in damage and tons of dead enemies is what 
 this game is all about One can view Strangleholds length as a blessing or a curse; Stranglehold 
 is really too short to be nauseatingly repetitive but also too short and shallow to warrant a $60 
 purchase from most people.

Review:  Ok. We all know this is based on John Woo style movies and a sequal to Hard Boiled, but lets talk 
 about the game. Stranglehold is a non-stop action game. Theres not one time in the whole 6 or 7hours 
 of gameplay that you stop shooting. GRAPHICS:
  Stranglehold is probably known for its Massive-D, and It works. Everything shatters into beautiful 
 little peices and the world is aboyut 99%destructable, and it adds to the flair of the game. The 
 animation runs smooth, and Stranglehold has some of the best use of the Havok rag doll physics, 
 and really good death animations. The character model on Chow Yun Fat is amazing to look at, and 
 most of the main character are nicely done too. The graphics are no Gears of War, and there definatly 
 not Max Payne graphics (like some has said) . The graphics still look wonderful, and the textures 
 are detailed and smooth, and... well... destructable. 8.5/10
  
  SOUND:
  The voice acting is very good, some of the best in a game that I have seen, and it drives the story 
 very well. The soundtrack is not so great. It could have done better, but thank GOD there is custom 
 soundtrack, AC/DC Shoot To Thrill goes amazingly good with this game. The sound effects are very 
 ACTION MOVIE-esque, which is a good thing. Its loud, and it sounds good on surround sound. 9/10
 
  
  STORY: Now, this is not an amazing story, but its still good for what it is. It copies those John 
 Woo action movie stories very well, which this game was aiming for which makes it great. If it 
 was this very well, long story, and very deep, it just wouldnt fit into this game, and the John 
 Woo movies. This story belongs here, to this game, and its a very entertaining story. 9/10
  
  GAMEPLAY:
  For the whole 6/7hours of gameplay, you basically do the same thing, which isnt 
 bad at all. Its fun. It copies the style of John Woo brilliantly and its easy to get a hang of. 
 The controlls work. The Tequila bombs are fun to use, well 3 of them, the health one isnt anything 
 special. Percision Aim is fun, and offcourse, whats talked about most, shooting them in the nuts. 
 Barrage is a great use, when you have a shotgun, any other weapon, its not very effective. The 
 spin attack just destroys anyone in site and it helps when your in a tight situation. Sliding on 
 rails, and running up them, jumping on carts, and swinging on chandalers all work great to bring 
 this game to John Woo standards, as goes for Shooting stuff to fall on people's heads. The game 
 is short for a reason, that reason being is that its the same thing over and over again (with a 
 few exceptions) , which makes a quick run through so it never gets boring. It also makes it a really 
 good game to pick up and play again, and pick your favorite level to play. 9/10
  
  MULTIPLAYER;
  Everyone says it fells like its been tacked on for the hell of it. It might be, 
 but its still fun as hell. Not the greatest game online, but you can still have fun with it. I 
 usually play against my friend and thats it, but occasionally other people too, but they cry to 
 much because I always win. The tequila time works perfectly well, its a fair balance to the game. 
 The tequila bombs on the other hand, dont work well. Its to easy to get them and just kill everyone 
 with your spinning attack. For having so much destruction in a level, this game is lag free online. 
 Whats there to play online is fun, although I wish for more maps to play. 7/10
  
  OVERALL:
  Great, fun, addicting game, with a story that fits perfectly to the theme, and some 
 great graphics and destructability. This is the best playable action movie you can ever ask for. 
 9.0/10

Review:  The comparisons to Max Payne are inevitable and warranted but the John Woo style gives it just 
 enough seperation to prevent it from being a direct rip. Playing as Chow Yun-Fat's Inspector Tequila 
 with his voice talent included is alot of fun to be sure but there are alot of fun shooters out 
 there and Stranglehold doesn't do anything to really seperate itself from the pack. The action 
 is intense and the Tequila Time mechanics are effective but the levels can be somewhat repetitive. 
 The voice acting is spot on while the visuals are good but not breathtaking. The destructability 
 of the environments is one of the games best points and is used to solid effect during shootouts 
 to take out enemies. In short this is a fun shooter that is probably more of a rental for most.

Review:  I have been a John Woo fan since Hard Boiled and this game really showcases his tallents. The Character 
 animation is superb and the likeness of Chow Yung Fat is remarkable. Story is smooth and entertaining 
 and the actin is fast, intense and all around fun. The destructable environments is astonishing 
 and nearly everything is destructable. I havent played all the way through but so far it's great. 
 The features and moves that you can do make the action perfect. You can decide to kill your enimies 
 in many ways and the reaction to certain moves is hilarious. This is a game that is really fun 
 to play but the downside is that it is best in short periods. It is a great game but one that is 
 best to play in short periods because the action can get repetitive. Overall a great action game.

Review:  As you all know this game is based on the movie Hard Boiled that came out in 1992. This game is 
 the sequel to that movie. So the story takes place in Hong Kong. You're a detective name Tequila 
 who's played by the actor Chow Yun Fat and you're on a mission to find out who killed your friend 
 who was also a detective. On top of that two women get kidnapped one that happens to be your love 
 interest and you're later caught between two rival gangs that are setting up each other in a war 
 and it's up to you to get to the bottom of everything.
  
  If you've played the demo of the game than you've actually played the first entire level in the 
 retail version of game except you don't get to fight the boss. The game's graphics are powered 
 by Unreal Engine 3 so expect some great graphics in the game. You'll have different types of environments 
 in the game like restaurants, hotels, docks, factories, and also the streets of Hong Kong. The 
 game is a very colorful so there's a lot of eye candy in the game. Also one thing that I love about 
 the game is the destructible environments in the entire game. You can literally blow up and interactive 
 with many objects in the game. The voice acting in the game is not great but not bad. The action 
 in the game is fantastic but it does get a little repetitive and you also see the same enemies 
 over and over and over again.
  
  One of the cool features within the game is Tequila time. When you in tequila time mode youll 
 go into slow motion and shoot out as many enemies at once. Also as you progress in the game youll 
 unlock 4 different special items. The four are health boosts, precision aim, barrage attack, and 
 spin attack. Health boosts is self explanatorily, precision aiming is one of my favorite this is 
 one you go into slow motion and you aim at your enemy and take him out with one shot, barrage attack 
 is like going on a rampage mode killing everyone in sight, and spin attack is my favorite you spin 
 around and doves come flying all over the screen while eliminating everyone in sight. The game 
 has some multiplayer but it feels added on. The game has 3 different difficulty levels but I think 
 you might play it twice no more than that. If you beat it on the hardest level you unlock the hard 
 boiled level for the highest difficulty. If you're looking for the Next Max Payne game than look 
 no more that game is here and it's called Stranglehold. If you're looking for a 3rd person shooter 
 with a lot of action and not to sure about the purchase, give it a rent you might enjoy the massive 
 destruction in this game.

Review:  Stranglehold is a next-gen action-shooter on the Xbox360 console. First off, it's got John Woo, 
 the prequel to Stranglehold (Hard-Boiled, great movie btw) 's director and creative everything working 
 on the game, so you know the action is top notch if Mr. Woo has had his hands in it. 2nd off, if 
 you don't really care for graphic and other technical stuff and focus on fun factor, Stranglehold 
 is the premiere title for you. From the slo-mo Tequila Time to zooming in and taking someone out 
 in the crotch with precision aim, Stranglehold's gameplay is fun enough to have you playing for 
 hours on end. Not to mention the excellent and authentic (although not in Cantonese) voice acting.
 
  
  Multiplayer is a little more deservedly down played however. Although the character selection is 
 excellent, the overall multiplayer experience is a little too frustrating, in that one guy may 
 monopolize the most powerful weapon and rack up tequila bomb abilities, making him pretty much 
 unstoppable, as well as the extremely fast paced gameplay makes it very hard to make bullets accurately 
 hit while playing.
  
  All in all when you can get past the flaws, John Woo Presents: Stranglehold will give you the most 
 fun you've ever had in an action game in quite a while.

Review:  First let me start off by saying this game is great and it is indeed very fun. But it does have 
 its problems but nothing to bad at all. First the single player, it is truly impressive the AI 
 can be really good doing their best avoiding your fire and taking cover and get even tougher throughout 
 the game.
  
  The storyline was great but it was indeed to much of a short game and could have added a little 
 more into that but overall the single player is pretty solid with a lot of replay ability.
  
  Now the multi-player is where this gets a big let down in my opinion. It looked great in the 
 videos and when you get in your first match it is really fun fighting other people with guns shooting 
 in all directions but there is one little flaw that can really piss someone off.
  
  See the multi-player doesn't emphasize and gives you no reason to pull off any of the cool stunts 
 like you do in the single player, I mean sure you can slide down the rail and leap around the room 
 shooting the players but you're not going to kill jack **** I had an easier time killing people 
 by strafing left and right and randomly firing my gun then trying to pull off the famous John Woo 
 techniques on other players.
  
  Sadly that is all it has turned into on X-box live, you get in and grab guns and just move back 
 and forth like a robot having a seizure while standing firing your gun at them as they do the same 
 until you or him dies. Another problem I encountered with the multi-player is that you can literally 
 unload both guns you are currently carrying on people and still not kill each other.... AT ALL.
 
  
  I found myself and many other players in the matches I was in running out of ammo and running towards 
 each other desperately trying to kung fu punch each other. Overall the game is a great game and 
 the single player alone makes it a worth buy since of the replay ability. But the multi-player 
 which for its first release I can say is pretty decent but needs a lot of tweaking desperately 
 till the multi-player starts living up to the trailer videos for multiplayer we've been seeing 
 before the game has been released.

Review:  This game is really fun to play I had tons of fun playing this gameI luv going around and 
 destroying the environment.. Reminds me of Max Payne, but I think this game is much better tho.......... 
 Anyway the gameplay is the high light of this game, the graphics are also great. But the storyline 
 is a little. On the downside. I think they couldve done better on the storyline part. I also 
 didnt like how short the game is, and they way the handgun sounds. it sounds a little weird 
 anyway I would probably rent it first before Ill buy this game. I believe Im going to beat the 
 game a few times before I trade it in. all in all this is a good game.

Review:  Great story, pretty good multi-player. The story i thought was really fun. I guess it can get kind 
 of repetitive, but its always fun though. Also, its pretty short. It definitely couldve been longer. 
 But still awesome.
  The multi-player u guys said sucked. i actually thought it was very fun. You can still do almost 
 everything u can i story mode. very intense gun battles in the multi-player. it wouldve been even 
 better though if there was more players than just friggen SIX.... thats dumb. but STILL very fun. 
 great story, great multi-player.
  i wouldve gave it a better rating if there was more players in multi-player, and a longer story.

 well but this one works more then well this game is one of those games you pop in and just have 
 a ball with. I honestly didn't want to put the controller down i was just hooked automatically 
 and that is no bullsh*t. this game does lackin multiplayer but the multiplayer is still enjoyable 
 and fun if you get a room with you and 5 friends. so with all this being said this game is a must 
 have for any fan of the original movie or any fan of shoot em up style games.. so go and get it... what

Review:  The million dollar question here is. Is this game worth 60 bucks? Depends on your financial situation 
 I guess. The game is on the shortside 8-10, the multiplayer is not gonna blow you away. However 
 if it sounds like i'm down on the game i'm not. The production values are extreamly high. The gameplay 
 is mindless action cool. The graphics why not Gears Of War are very nice. This is a very well done 
 action game &amp; while there are not many of this type in the X-Box library this is a welcomed 
 addition. It's in the good but not great catagory &amp; the maybe a weekend retal catagory. Myself 
 i'm having a great time with it.

Review:   Gamespot gives this game a 7.0? Are you freaking kidding me? 
 Oh my god......... I really don't understand Gamespot's logic alot of times anyway this review is 
 about what I think......
  
  This is the funnest shooter I've played in quite a long time. This has everything that makes a 
 great shooter and more. It takes elements of the greatest shooters of all time....... Max Payne, 
 Matrix, etc...... but goes beyond these......... into the next generation to deliver a true next 
 gen experience. The Tequila Bomb moves add SO much to the game they can't be underestimated. And 
 they even play over into the multiplayer. This game has that cinematic effect that feels like an 
 action movie. It has a good story.... good characters..... cool weapons. The thing you need to ask 
 yourself is what could they do to make a better shooter than this? And the answer is........ I have 
 absolutely no idea. I don't know how you could want more out of a video game. It is THAT good. 
 If you're like me, and in your heart, Shooters are your first love......... then this is THE game 
 for you. I bought the collector's edition thinking it came with HARD-BOILED the movie but then 
 found out that is only with the PS3 version so just remember that.
  
  If you love a good solid action video game. Get this game. This is the next-generation in all its 
 glory!!! LOVE IT. Right now it's my favorite game.

Review:  Welcome back Max Payne... well at least thats what this game plays like to me. The game plays just 
 as well as Payne and maybe even better, but as much fun as flying through the air in slow-mo is 
 this game has one BIG down point. It gets old quickly. once you've done every move once or twice 
 the fun meter lowers. Although the game is ok, its a game where the demo is more then enough to 
 have. As far as multi-player goes I never got a chance to play it but playing a game where slow-mo 
 is what makes the game multi-player couldn't be that good

Review:  Stranglehold is a great example of a action adventure game that gives you what you want and doesn't 
 hold back in terms of action. the game is 8 to 10 hours long. the graphics are amazing and the 
 gameplay is sweet. if you want high andrenaline gun fights pick it up. if you want mass effect 
 story telling u may want to look somewhere else. either way this game is a buy. It's fun will bring 
 you back for many many more hours after it is beaten. multiplayer is fun but nothing that will 
 blow your mind. its just a reason to run around and shoot at your friends in slow-mo. which is 
 awesome. compare to max payne? why? max payne hasen't been around for years and maybe because of 
 the same faults that stranglehold falls into. Great gameplay, fun environments, classic character 
 but story. cmon. all in all. Fun Game. worth purchasing. kick'N game!

 but in the end falls flat The Gameplay- in strangle hold you will constently engaged in action

 realy fun when killing people. Now there are a few power well i should say abilitys you get one 
 isyou go into this presison aim thing and shoot a enime and it zooms in and looks realy fun. Also 
 in the game you will go into these little sequensis of dodging bullets and its not realy the funnist 
 thing ive done but you wont mind it too much but my biggest complant with the gameplay is it is 
 so repeditive and gets realy old Graphics-Are prety nice in strangle hold faces look good and so 
 does this game but not the greatest Fun-0 Meter strangle hold is a realy fun game and out of the 
 6 hours the story levels are its about a 8 + Nice action

Review:  Since it was announced in 2005, I eagerly waited for Stranglehold. To tell you the truth, that 
 is why I wanted a 360. Halo 3 was second on the list. After hearing about the Matrix-style slow 
 motion and near fully destructible environments, I was immediately hooked. Hearing that it was 
 a sequel to a movie that I haven't ever watched (I know I was crazy for not watching Hard Boiled 
 before hearing that announcement) After being delayed for its holiday 2005 release, it fell off 
 the map, and off most gamer's radar. It was then delayed quite a few times, but now it is here 
 and to stay as a landmark in this genre of shooters.
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  
  To start things off, I'll talk about the main thing that Midway promised from the beginning: fully 
 destructible environments. Did Midway succeed? Most definitely! Bullets pierce walls, chew threw 
 tables, and put massive dents into the gang members you are shooting at. On the second level, you 
 are given the task of shooting specific things ( and the results are a blast.... no pun intended) 
 The huts blow to pieces with surprising detail, and make you feel like you're in a movie with just 
 this aspect alone. The character models are all very detailed, and have a very large variety of 
 animations, Even the guns look detailed. This is what Black SHOULD'VE BEEN in terms of environmental 
 damage. Even the environment can and will be used as a weapon.
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  The sound in the game is amazing to say the least. Guns sound like guns and explosions sound like 
 explosions. The only thing I can gripe about in the sound department is that the voices can sometimes 
 be hard to hear.
  
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  
  The main thing that counts is that you ARE playing a John Woo game. Max Payne and the Matrix games 
 can't even come close to touching Stranglehold. There are so many things that this game adds to 
 the mix to set it apart as a game on its own. The main gripe is that the game is short. About 7 
 1/2 hours. But there's so much replay value tucked into the game. As for multiplayer, it is kind 
 of hard finding a match right now, but hopefully soon that will change. This one was well worth 
 the wait.

Review:  I've heard this is very similar to Max Payne but since i've never played it i cant tell you. The 
 game is pretty straightfoward, you are detective Tequila and you basically fight Hong Kong gangsters.
 
  What mainly hooked me to this game was the destructible environments, i havent played any game 
 that has come this close to the amount of things you can destroy, that ps2/xbox game Black doesnt 
 even come close. Also what impressed me was how Tequila interacted with the environments. For example 
 you can silde down banisters while shooting, you can swing on chandeliers while shooting, you can 
 even lie down on a trolly while it rolls along shooting your guns. You can run along walls, bounce 
 of walls, roll around on the floor all the while shooting. You can also use the environments to 
 kill your enemies, for example you can shoot neon lights above your enemy and let it drop on his 
 head, and old classic is shooting barrels that explode, in one level you can make small land slides 
 to kill your enemies. This is the closest you can come to living an action movie and i think i 
 even enjoyed this game more than Gears of War for solo play. All this is put together with style, 
 great graphics and non stop action.
  This game deserves a whole lot more than 7.0 i know that much.

Review:  This game is not all that graphically impressive, it doesn't have great sound effects. All it really 
 is, is fun. There is no doubt that the fighting in this game is probobly the most enjoyment that 
 I have gotten out of any game in a long long time. Unfortunatly many issues can destroy that fun, 
 and can really frustrate the player.
  
  This is your basic action game, there really is no pushing the genre forward And you can not really 
 say you expected Stranglehold to get in the 9s, cause pure enjoyment cant do that for a game. This 
 game, is a fighting game, and there is a lot of action and some boring puzzle elements but you 
 really are left wanting more.
  
  Stranglehold's flaws are mostly that its so basic and annoying that it makes this game only rent-worthy. 
 For one, it is very short, but not as short as you might thing. Each level can take about one hour 
 to two hours, which I thought was an awful idea since each level can become so repetitive to the 
 point of thoughts of hurling your controller at your tv. Pretty much, you go here, destroy these 
 tables or kill this or that or something like that. Then you move on, and do it again. And again... and 
 again... every time you think that after this the level will end. After this the level will end... wrong. 
 The levels go on too long for it's own good and is frustrating. Another issue, is the pure simplicity 
 of the game. Because they made the game so simple, they had to increase AI difficulty which can 
 make the game steep up in difficulty immediatly which can be annoying and lead to what players 
 think as cheap. The multiplayer has two game modes, which gives you the motive of only getting 
 achievements to even want this game. You will constantly see the frame rate dropping, you will 
 fall of environments unintentionally making you trek all the way back. You will get lost in the 
 environments, as you search and search for whatever the hell you want to do. Frustrating cheap 
 bosses, and annoying hiccups further make this game seem less enjoyable. Basic environmental destruction, 
 really not something that you would buy this game for. Environments are highlighted by a white 
 sparkle, really making the game seem a lot less player-created, which I thought could have been 
 real cool. Pretty much your doing the same thing over and over again, and it can be boring.
  
  Stranglehold gets the all natural meh because all it is a 7 or more. Its not groundbreaking 
 like Bioshock or Gears of War, its not different like Viva Pinata. Its an action game, and if all 
 you want is pure destrucability and nothing more... look no further.

Review:  I love this game its like playing an action pack steven seagul movie. The graphics are better than 
 most 360 titles to date. The environment damage arent the only thing good its also the damage you 
 see on the levels boss after loading rounds of buck shot in their chest cavity. I think the fact 
 that one of the level centers action in the mist of a band playing music and hearing the difference 
 in the music as each one of the band members are killed gives that next -gen edge of game play. I 
 think Gamespot fell asleep while reviewing this one maybe they need some of that promotional MD 
 Halo 3 soda. This shouldn't get a 7.0 score it should get a score of 9.0 for doing what I always 
 want to see in a 3rd person shooter tear sh** up. For any fan of any type of action flicks buy this 
 freaking game its sweet.

Review:  Stranglehold oh were to start. It was a damn blast playing the singleplayer.
  
  The good : The singleplayer is fun. The slow motion makes it so much fun. Its like an action movie 
 with explosions everywhere at points. The other slow motion powers like precision hit and barrage 
 are fun. And ofcourse spin attack is neat. There are a fair number of weapons. You can do some 
 super sweet things leaping form extereme heights. Or walking up walls a few feet. Slowing down 
 time while jumping can be fun. It has a cover system The bad: The single player is short 5-8 hours 
 long. The storyline isnt that great at times. The voices sometimes sounds like americans making 
 asian voices. The cover system doesent allow you to peak over things only to the sides. Multiplayer
 
  
  The good: Its kind of fun for a minute doing all those moves and crap.
  
  The bad: Once your done doing all your moves its pretty much hold the trigger down and hope your 
 lucky enough to hit someone while they are doing all these leaps and crap. It can be really fusterating 
 trying to get people. Cover is pointless in multiplayer. It gets really obnoxious with people slowing 
 time down constantly. Precision aiming becomes pointless since it slows you down but not them. 
 Pretty much who ever is alive for the first 2 minutes of the game is going to win the game since 
 they can use barrage and just pwn everyone. Its pretty lackluster and leaves a lot to be desired. 
 There is no skill involved just dumbluck.
  
  All in all the game leaves a lot to be desired at points. I wish the singleplayer was longer and 
 the multiplayer was better. It deserves a7 and no higher no less. Its fun while it lasts but it 
 just becomes boring after its beat. Better rent than buy. much better rent than buy. Feels almost 
 like a rip off for 60 bucks for such a short game.

Review:  Well right when you get into this game, you will have lots of fun hopefully if this is your type 
 of game. Personally, i thought at fist, ok this is a knock off of max payne and to some sort it 
 is kind of like it, but not as much. After all just because they use slow-motion doesn't make it 
 entirely the same thing as max payne or same game.
  
  This game is fun for the fact you pick up and go and blast away. The controls are easy to work 
 with, the action is fast, and the visuals (during tequila bombs especially) are fantastic.
  
  Almost everything is destructable. This is what i like about the game the most. The environment 
 is used a lot whether jumping, gliding, or blowing things up, it is just awesome. Well if you want 
 something different then FPS, i would go for this game cuz im glad i picked it up. It is short, 
 but it is fun to go back and try on harder difficulties to get all achievements. It is like a cinematic 
 experience!!!!

Review:  John Woo. Don't know him? Watch Hard Boiled or The Killer . John Woo is an amazing action film 
 director... - and also, the man behind Stranglehold - the videogame.
  
  The first impression you get is wow . Simply because Stranglehold is probably the most intense 
 game released ever. Even on the first level you can taste most of the greatness Stranglehold has 
 to offer.
  
  Destructable enviorment, amazing special skills, witty main character, brutal gunfights.
  
 
  In fact, if you have played through the first level, you've pretty much seen it all the game has 
 to offer.
  
  Is that a problem? Not really. Simply, because... it just doesn't get old. The game features 7 
 levels, each being at least a hour long. That means, the single player part of the game features 
 6 to 8 hours of gameplay. It might not seem alot... but it ends before it would get repeatative. 
 Plus, it must be noted that, the game feels really different on each difficulty, just like Gears 
 of War. So it has replay value!
  
  Before going into the multiplayer, some word on the presentation. The graphics are fair. Nothing 
 special, really. In fact, there are some really low textures and undetailed areas in the games, 
 but there are also some real nice effects. The framerate is stable, that is the most important. 
 What makes up for the average graphics is the destructable EVERYTHING. You can shoot, crash, kill, 
 wreck basically anything. The physics are - because of this - awesome. It's a blast killing an 
 enemy by shooting an object above him. The controls are good. Everything works... except for one 
 thing. You can't do a traditional jump, which sometimes ruins the moment. For example, you have 
 to progress from A platform to B . You COULD easily jump, but you CAN'T. Instead, you've to find 
 some kind of barrel to shoot that will release something that can be used as a bridge. The game 
 has a cover system, which, for my surprise, works perfectly. One thing I didn't talk about yet 
 is the special abilities. You can precision aim (you go in bullett time and FPS view. You can kill 
 any regular enemy with a single bullett) spin attack (basically, a classic action movie thing. Mr. 
 Tequilla shoots everyone in the room while spinning) and barrel attack, which makes you immortal 
 for a little time and makes your bulletts damage more.
  
  And there's the bullett time, which is absolutely the best part of the game. It works even better 
 than in Max Payne. With all the abilities, bullett time, destructable enviorment, the game features 
 the most intense firefights in the history of gaming. While not everyone will like it, for those 
 who enjoy Woo's and Chow Yun Fat's work, this is like a christmas present.
  
  The game's story is classic Hong Kong action movie-style. Nothing too shocking or outstanding, 
 but just enough to keep you interested and to keep the game going. What must be noted is the voice 
 acting. It's perfect.
  
  The multiplay is fair. The main arenas from the campaign are included, 6 players maximum. It's 
 a good way to relive frustration, but I doubt it'll be popular. However, it adds a few hours to 
 the overall gameplay, which is good.
  
  Bottomline is, the game rocks. It's not perfect, but it was never meant to be. The game ignores 
 realism. Instead, enter the world of John Woo, where you don't reload, where a man can bring down 
 1000 others.

Review:  My judgement is based on single player mode. I am not an online game player therefore I have no 
 say on this game.
  
  This game has the basic gameplay of Lost Planet , run and gun, and many many more features. It 
 deserves at least a score of 8.1 plus some more points. The additional point varies depend on different 
 players's liking. Why this game only get a score of only 7.0 from Gamespot. Its misleading score 
 could change people 's mind if they should buy this game. This error is caused by Gamespot not 
 the game maker. Same thing to Bioshock. I got this game from Best Buy on 09-02-07 and played some 
 part of it. I give this game a score of 9.1 because its game play deserve a score of 8.1 comparing 
 to Lost Planet. I give an additional 1.0 points for special effects like slow motion, special moves, 
 and story (Lost Planet has no story) .
  
  This is my opinion. I am not persuading people to buy this game. It is their choice due to the 
 fact that Halo 3, Unreal Tournament, GTA ... etc in line to come soon. But one thing for sure is 
 that this game is better than a score of 7.0 from Gamespot. Gamespot, please be fair to game makers 
 please.

Review:  Intense is one word for this game. It takes a John Woo film and takes it to a new level. You can 
 say it is a max payne rip off but it takes everything that inspired max payne and makes it all 
 that much more better. The one true flaw Ive found is the length of the game. Although, this flaw 
 is holding back much from the game due to the replay value. Each room can have its own set of tactics 
 which keeps things interesting and semi-fresh. Sure, at times it gets repetitive but ceases to 
 get old. If you are looking for a high action John Woo experience you have hit gold right here.

Review:  This is one of the most fun, action/third person shooters Ive ever played. The precision aim, which 
 allows the player to target a specific part of the enemy's body and shoot, is one AWSOME feature. 
 The death animations are unmatched by any other game to date, and the environment is almost fully 
 destructable. Signs fall down. Bannisters and catwalks collapse during gunfights, and the blood 
 looks incredible. And for the first time to my knowledge this game is the first one of its kind 
 to get the whole  routine right. This game is just 
 like playin in a violent action movie. This one is a must buy in my opinion. If you're looking 
 for an immediately gratifying run &amp; gun, fun fest, this game is the one to play.

Review:  You are a cop named Tequila. He enjoys traveling with his two best friends. They include a pistol 
 and another pistol in the other hand. This game is not a copy of max Payne but rather a masterpiece 
 created from similar inspiration. The idea of special Tequila bombs is insanely awesome. Getting 
 to shoot a gun and watch the bullet hit someone in the nut sack is something that isn't about to 
 get old. Anything that you see can take damage. Crates break, barrels break, and supporting beams 
 break. The graphics are really sharp and the Chow Yun-Fat is ridiculous. There aren't a ton of 
 guns too choose from but when you get down to it the average guns will have a strategic use for 
 each and it is interesting choosing to pick up a gun from a different gun. There are four different 
 Tequila bombs the first one is a health charge, 2 an aiming tool that shows bullet time but tracks 
 the bullet to a hit that is place varied, 3 b arrange is when you turn almost invincible and the 
 game slows down but you keep a normal speed, 4 the last one is the famous spin around completely 
 taking out anyone in your way.
