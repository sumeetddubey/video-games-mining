:::Review:::
As archaic and clumsy as it can be, Earth Defense Force 2017 succeeds because of what a ridiculous 
 bit of dumb fun it is. 

  Imagine a wholly simplistic shooter that lets you carry two weapons into battle, pilot clunky vehicles 
 to do extra damage, collect two-dimensional armor and weapon power-ups, and fight off hordes of 
 giant alien bugs, robots, and UFOs, while also blasting away the occasional comically massive boss 
 for good measure. Can you guess what decade this game could be from? The answer might surprise 
 you. D3 and developer Sandlot Games' Earth Defense Force 2017 is like a game out of time. If this 
 were 1987 instead of 2007, some company like Data East or Irem would have churned this baby out 
 on the NES or Sega Master System as a scrolling or top-down shooter with then-gigantic enemies 
 that blew apart to pixelated messes. Now, fast-forward 20 years, render that same concept in 3D, 
 scale all the creepy-crawly and mechanized enemies up by somewhere around 300-fold, and then don't 
 touch the gameplay mechanics a lick except to throw in an awkward dodge maneuver, and you've got 
 yourself Earth Defense Force 2017. Of course, the incredible scale of the bugs, buildings, and 
 bots you're blowing up helps alleviate somewhat the sensation that you have no business playing 
 a game that feels this ancient on the Xbox 360, but even with its overly old-school mechanics, 
 Earth Defense Force 2017 is a surprisingly good time -- especially for its cheaper-than-average price. 

          For those with extreme phobias of spiders, ants, UFOs, giant robots, copious amounts of 
 laser fire, or easily collapsible buildings, Earth Defense Force 2017 might be a nice bit of immersion 
 therapy.     

  The premise of Earth Defense Force 2017 is that in a decade from now, aliens decide to come to 
 Earth, and they're none too friendly. Earth had a bit of an early warning that these invaders from 
 above were on the way, so they formed a cadre of soldiers known as the Earth Defense Force to stave 
 off any attacks. Those attacks come in the form of ants and spiders the size of kitchens, mammoth 
 robots with gun-arms longer and wider than should be possible while still walking upright, and 
 massive UFOs that rain down even more enemies, as well as the occasional bout of laser fire. There's 
 not much story, save for some delightfully hammy "rah-rah" shouting from your fellow EDF soldiers 
 and a bit of radio dialogue between your commanding officers and other EDF members that frequently 
 get slaughtered ahead of you. But what's here goes nicely with the patently B-grade sci-fi theme 
 the game has wrapped itself up in. It's just too bad your character doesn't interact more with 
 others, or have more personality -- actually,  any  personality would have been a nice touch.  

 
  There are 53 missions in the game, and all of them involve exterminating one brand of foe or another. 
 You'll travel through cities, countrysides, and even some deep, dark caves to blow up these ugly 
 invaders, and you won't have to think much while you're doing it. EDF is nearly strategy-free gameplay. 
 Save for the decision of which weapons you want to take into battle (somewhere around 150 unlockable 
 weapons are in the game, some better for certain tasks than others) , there's really no need to 
 use your brain as you run around, laying waste to whatever ugly thing gets within sight of your 
 targeting reticle. If you're the sort of person that revels in the chance to just blow things up 
 wantonly and watch the bug guts and fireballs fly, then EDF should prove to be a riotous experience 
 for you. Not only do the robots and other enemies die horribly, but you can blow away pretty much 
 any piece of the scenery you please, as well. Buildings crumble like a cookie with a single rocket 
 blast, trees uproot at the slightest explosion, and parked cars like to go flying through the air. 

  The game's sense of scale is really impressive, as are some of the explosion and destruction effects. 
 Enemies are mammoth in size, especially some of the boss characters, which dwarf many of the taller 
 buildings in the game. However, as cool as the scale of it all is, the game does have a cheap look 
 to it overall. Environments are flat and blocky, and the game's insects don't blow up so much as 
 they just go stiff and start bouncing around the environment until they eventually flicker out. 
 And instead of crashing, enemy UFOs just give off a bunch of explosions and then slowly sink directly 
 into the ground. Even your character doesn't look all that good. He's just a generic grunt dressed 
 like all the other generic grunts, and he often looks like he's got some kind of cybernetic swiveling 
 hip bone as he contorts while trying to aim every which way. The frame rate is also quite erratic, 
 chunking up significantly whenever extreme amounts of action are going on. Still, the game's immense 
 scale and wonderfully cheesy art style do a good bit to make up for a number of the game's technical 
 deficiencies.  

          Co-op play is nice, but it would have been even better if it were online.     

  Howver, 
 not everyone is going to fall head over heels for what EDF does. As fun as the combat can be, it 
 is incredibly simple, and those that prefer a bit more variety in their third-person shooters will 
 probably balk at what the game offers up. Despite boasting 150 different weapons, a lot of them 
 are just slight firing variations on similar weapon models, and there are a significant number 
 that feel useless. But it'll still take you a while to figure out which rocket launchers, missile 
 launchers, shotguns, sniper rifles, assault rifles, grenade launchers, and other experimental bric-a-brac 
 work best, and, if the core action happens to grab you, you'll have a good time experimenting with 
 them.  

  Less enjoyable are the few vehicles included in the game. Some missions let you jump into a helicopter, 
 tank, giant mech suit, or weird hoverbike thing that looks like the speeder from  Return of the 
 Jedi . The controls for the vehicles are hopelessly off-kilter. Tanks never seem to aim quite right, 
 and the hoverbike is extremely awkward to steer. The mech suit aims the best but is incredibly 
 slow and impossible to turn, and the helicopter... well, it doesn't do anything right. Suffice it 
 to say, save for short bouts where you might want to use the mech suit to blow up something as 
 big and slow as you are, you're going to want to stick to ground combat.  

  Of course, the ground combat isn't perfect either. Aiming and shooting work just fine, but jumping 
 around the environment, occasionally trying to dodge enemy fire, and really anything else, is on 
 the clumsy side. When environments get good and busted up, it's often difficult to get around without 
 wandering into some chunk of the scenery, and jump and dodge happen to be mapped to the same button, 
 meaning sometimes you don't get the desired result. Also, the game has a real crazy habit of piling 
 on the chaos at some of the worst times. It's not hard to find yourself surrounded by tons and 
 tons of attacking ants, spiders, and robots all at once. When the action really heats up like this, 
 the camera tends to go all wonky, shaking around violently to signify that, yes, big explosions 
 are happening, and all the while huge bursts of enemy fire, friendly fire, and multicolored bug 
 guts are flying about everywhere, making it intensely difficult to get your bearings and, in some 
 cases, survive at all. There are some fight sequences in this game that pretty much define why 
 game companies put seizure warnings in instruction manuals. By the time you get to the final boss 
 and its onslaught of disco-tinted laser fire, you'll probably want to bite down on somebody's wallet 
 just to make sure you don't swallow your own tongue.  

          Don't try to overthink this game. Leave your brain at the door, and just go blow up some 
 creepy spiders.     

  The 53 missions will probably take you around 10 hours to complete on any of the lower two difficulty 
 settings, but there are five total, and many of the best weapons don't unlock until you beat some 
 of the tougher settings. Additionally, all of the game's achievements are tied into beating all 
 the missions on each difficulty and unlocking every weapon. It's kind of lame that there's only 
 six achievements total, and that some of them are so hard to get, as the later difficulties are 
 fully overwrought in terms of challenge. The good news is that you do have a cooperative play option, 
 so you can tag-team any of the game's missions with a friend in split-screen mode. Sadly, there's 
 no online mode, and the only competitive play mode is a lousy deathmatch option that is still for 
 only two players. But, hey, there's nothing quite like blowing up huge swarms of spiders with a 
 buddy at your side.  

  It's awkward, single-minded, gross, slightly ugly, somewhat stilted, fully cheesy, and dumb with 
 a capital D, U, and M, but Earth Defense Force 2017 somehow, some way manages to entertain. As 
 you sit, blowing up aliens for an hour or two at a time (any longer than that, and your brain will 
 start to rot) , you'll be asking yourself why you're enjoying this so much, when there's so many 
 clear-cut flaws all over the place. And though you'll never come up with a reconcilable answer, 
 after a while you have to give in to the game's earnestly brainless brand of action and accept 
 that it's just plain fun.

Review:  This game I bought when it first came out, I played for a bit, but just recently popped it back 
 in again. I was suprisingly entertained and will play it more in the next few days.
  
  This is one of those games that just goes waaay under the radar and is actually pretty fun. The 
 graphics may not be the very best, but they are better than original xbox or ps2. The gameplay 
 is a bit arcade-y like devil may cry or ninja gaiden (of course not as in depth as those two) Though 
 for a game like this the arcadey style works. 
  This game can get intense, I havent even tried it on the hardest mode, but I am looking forward 
 to it.
  
  Giant ants in your face, big enemies make for an epic battle at times. It can get frantic and because 
 of that, its quite fun. Its an excellent timewaster game that is nothing too serious. It also has 
 split screen co op for those that have buddies to play with. The weapons in this game are perfect, 
 with many different ones. I still havent unlocked all of them. Ammo is unlimited and it works for 
 this game. 
  
  For those that never saw this game, Id recommend to pick it up cause by now its probably 10 bucks 
 or less. What a great deal! Dont expect it to be comparable to those major blockbuster games though.

Review:  The good:
  -Explosions... lots and lots of awesome explosions
  -Gigantic oversized enemies, epic battles, some cool weapons
  -Action is mostly fast-paced
 
  -Very addicting
  
  The bad:
  -Technical issues include the occasional huge slowdown
  -Vehicles are not very good
  -Some stages have too much running and can feel repetitive
  
 
  All the advances and innovations that video games have made over the years haven't changed one 
 basic, fundamental truth -- shooting stuff and making it blow up is fun. 
  
  It's been that way ever since Space Invaders and Asteroids, two games that were all about "point-shoot-kill" 
 in its most basic form. Earth Defense Force 2017 goes back to that basic formula and throws in 
 some 21st century explosions and bosses to prove that the simple objective of destroying everything 
 in your path is just as fun as it ever was -- so much so that it can make you forgive gaping technical 
 flaws. 
  
  A budget game that arrived at the price of $39.99 and can now be found at $19.99 or cheaper, Earth 
 Defense Force 2017 is the latest in a series of Japanese games to carry on the same name. This 
 installment found its way outside of the Far East and can be found exclusively on XBox 360. 
  
  The plot of Earth Defense Force actually isn't unlike Space Invaders -- aliens have invaded 
 in overwhelming numbers, and you have to kill them. To do that, you choose from the somewhere around 
 170 unlockable weapons to blow them and everything around you to smithereens. There are 53 stages 
 that can be played alone or with a friend (no online co-op though) and five difficulty levels to 
 choose from, and each stage is completed when the last enemy is destroyed. Enemies drop weapons 
 and armor boosts that increase your stamina that are added to your arsenal upon stage completion, 
 along with health items. 
  
  And that's pretty much it. 
  
  The plot obviously sounds familiar, and the gameplay is somewhat like Gears of War without the 
 cover system. Weapons come in familiar classes -- assault rifle, rocket launcher, missile launcher, 
 shotgun, sniper rifle, and special weapons. There are also four vehicles you can choose from to 
 help you rid the world of the invaders, and sometimes a few friendly AI teammates will join you. 
 
  
  Doesn't this sound like something we've all seen before? Well, not exactly. So what's different? 
 
  
  For starters, Earth Defense Force 2017 takes destruction to epic heights. You don't just kill monsters 
 in this game -- you blast them to smithereens, sending them flying hundreds of feet in the air 
 and making goo flying all over your screen. You don't just cause stuff to blow up in this game 
 -- you create obnoxious megaton explosions that fill your entire screen with flame and make the 
 controller violently shake. And in what might be the best part, you don't just shoot rockets or 
 missiles into the air and watch them disappear in this game. Instead, they slam into skyscrapers 
 and send them crumbling to the ground. Everything in this game can and will get destroyed. 
  
  EDF 2017 also takes enemies to new heights, in more ways than one. The very first enemy you 
 see is about three times your size, and they attack by the dozens. Those are the smallest enemies 
 in the game; along the way, you'll come across robots taller than a skyscraper, and even a couple 
 that won't even fit on your television screen. The action is often fast and frenetic, and fighting 
 these enemies can sometimes feel like an epic experience. 
  
  The game also looks and feels like a B monster movie straight out of the Godzilla series. Giant 
 ants and spiders crawl all over buildings, dialogue is laughably corny, and the music sometimes 
 feels like it was lifted right from a monster matinee. A reviewer for another site put it best 
 when he said "If Earth Defense Force 2017 was a movie, it would be directed by Ed Wood. It would 
 star Bruce Campbell." 
  
  The game unfortunately sometimes feels like a B-movie in quality too. Quite a few times, EDF 2017 
 will experience massive slowdown due to all the aliens, explosions and goo that can be on the screen 
 at the same time. The vehicles aren't very good and have less durability than the main character. 
 Enemies sometimes shoot you right through walls, and your not-always-bright teammates will sometimes 
 stand there and shoot at the wall if there's an enemy on the other side (good thing there's no 
 ammo limit) . Some weapons don't seem like they have much of a use at all. 
  
  Things can get repetitive as you'll still be fighting huge swarms of bugs in the late stages as 
 you were in the early stages, and some stages are more fun than others as you will on occasion 
 have to go too far on foot. The game also has cheesy sound effects and the aforementioned hilariously 
 bad dialogue that your teammates somehow carry on even after they die, although oddly enough, those 
 things seem right at home in this game's B-movie atmosphere. 
  
  But Earth Defense Force 2017 is a game where you can create a huge list of flaws, look at them 
 and say "So what?" because you're having too much fun to notice. That's what this game is all about. 
 There's not much strategy here, nor is there much to show off the power of your next-gen console, 
 nor is there any Hollywood-level script or soundtrack, nor are there any fancy cutscenes. It's 
 all about throwing you into chaotic scenarios with obnoxious aliens and reminding you just how 
 much fun it is to blow up as many things as possible without having to think about it. 
  
  Earth Defense Force 2017 does what it does well enough to be considered a true diamond-in-the-rough 
 on the XBox 360 and is surely destined to be a cult classic, much like the B-movies it emulates. 
 However, not unlike those same movies, EDF 2017 is a love-it-or-hate-it type of game. Some players 
 will spend ten minutes with it and think it's garbage. Others will get swept up in the carnage 
 and want to try to make it through all five difficulty levels (which isn't easy) . It all depends 
 on your taste and what you expect out of video games. If you are looking for Gears of War from 
 a technical standpoint, you're probably better off sticking with that game. If you're looking for 
 big, brainless fun, then pick up a copy today.

Review:  Evil robots as tall as scyscrapers, an almost endless amount of weapons, and of course those gigantic 
 ants from some lame horror film from like 2002. Wow! This game has it all. 
  When I first saw this game at my local Blockbuster I have to admit, it looked like a joke. I mean, 
 anything with a title as random as Earth Defence Force 2017 couldn't be that great. But as you 
 can tell from the rating I gave this game I was incredibly wrong.
  Let's start off with the setting. You begin in this city that looks extremely similar to Japan, 
 which makes sense because the creators of the game are Japanese. But this is not where all the 
 action happens. Instead you spend a lot of the time going back and forth between random places 
 from a beach to some underground bug infested lair.
  You play as, well, the Earth Defence Force of course, and due to the game being set in the year 
 2017 you have all of these over-the-top high tech weapons. These range from normal weapons (machine 
 guns, sniper rifles, etc.) to more futuristic types (i. e. an awesome mech suit for blowin' up practically 
 anything you want) . As you progress and battle through hordes of the most random enemies you will 
 notice that you are able to unlock these weapons to use in future battles.
  Every level you beat has it's own difficulty setting, like many other games, that you can adjust 
 to your liking. You can start at easy and maybe if you're good enough work your way up to the !! 
 INFERNO !! level. And if you are a hardcore completionist you'll love this part. There are so many 
 levels and so many things to collect that just after beating the first twenty levels and collecting 
 over thirty items I was only 7% done. It's fun alone, buy even better with a partner.
  So hopefully after this review more people will try this hidden gem. Its a game that is definitly 
 worth a try, and deserves its time to shine.

Review:  If you're into destroying robots, slaying ants, and bringing plain out major destruction to an 
 in tire city then this is the game for you. It could possibly be the best 18 bucks you could ever 
 spend on a game. Oh and did i mention that there are five levels of difficulty? It offers: easy, 
 normal, hard, harder, and inferno if i'm not mistaken. So once you get the hang of the game try 
 inferno. I don't know of anyone to beat it on inferno though. I even lost a few times on normal. 
 So yeah. The only problem that i found with this game is that it's very hard to find. One of my 
 pals finally found it at a gamestop After searching everywhere for the game. I still haven't ran 
 across it. But as soon as i do it's going into my collection. So I definitely recommend this awesome 
 judgement day like game.

Review:  Technically, Earth Defense Force is not a good game. Everything from the bad graphics to the poor 
 sound design screams "Horrible game!" The game is horrible but so horribly addictive.
  
  OK, the game graphics are very disappointing, there not the worst graphics ever but there very 
 retro arcade like. and it looks nothing like a 360 game should.
  
  Everything in the game is destructible, you can blow up everything you want in a mercs 2 style, 
 buildings crumble, bugs fly 20-100ft back from a simple machine gun blast.
  
  The menu is very very annoying, there is this girl/narrator/commander who will tell you so called 
 "hints" about what weapons to take into battle and so on.
  
  The game has 5 difficulty modes. easy, normal, hard, hardest, and inferno. and 53 missions in total 
 (but you will do one mission to figure out in the end of that mission you have to retreat, only 
 to come back to that same place or do the same thing in another mission.) 
  
  The plot is very cheesy, aliens have invaded earth and you have to kill them, all  
 of them. (That's just my estimate) so its not a very good story but then agian, EDF:2017 is not 
 about story or graphics it's about having the time of your life.
  
  The sound design is not very good, particularly the menu music and sound, and the game can't hold 
 a good frame rate to save it's life. But the game is a blast, and that's all i care about.
  
  Should you get it? Well, i recommend it to fans of mercs 2 and to people who just want to kill 
 gigantic bugs, and blow stuff up. But if your looking for a game that has a good story, great graphics, 
 Etc. Don't get it.

Review:  This game seems like it would be pretty stupid, and it kind of is, but still it's an incredibly 
 fun time. And with something like 50 levels and a lot of difficulties it provides countless hours 
 of entertainment! And trust me, even the best of gamers could not play this game on hard mode (which 
 I believe is the middle difficulty) and survive the first wave... My friend and I tried...
  The game is pretty simply run and gun. Before each level you pick a 2 weapon to bring (my favorite 
 combo is an Assault Rifle or Sniper with a Rocket launcher) and start killing aliens, which include 
 2 forms of giant ants (as in 12 feet tall and 25 feet long) , giant jumping spiders, space ships 
 large and small, and 200 foot tall robots! Each level is "Aliens are attacking" or "we're striking 
 at their base!" and then go kill every alien you see. You don't really level up but you gain permanent 
 +Armor (HP) and new weapons from boxes dropped by enemies (You also get healing items) . The new 
 weapons, though are not that different, do make you feel like your progressing.
  This game's main entertainment is the ridiculousness of it. You have infinite ammo (but limited 
 clip size) and the weapons are unreal (such as a typical rocket launcher that fires 10 rockets 
 in 2 seconds) . Oh and you can turn your explosive weaponry on Earth's buildings if you don't feel 
 like running around them, which is actually quite enjoyable. As is it when you shoot at the giant 
 robots with a sniper rifle and they bend over like you'd expect a regular sized person to do.
 
  The game is fun single player, but it is way more fun with a friend playing split screen. Blowing 
 up buildings, robots, and aliens with a friend is just so fun and with the near lack of a story, 
 friends can just jump in and out and play a few levels/get a few new weapons.
  All in all this game is simple and the script is something you'd expect from a B sci-fi flick (a 
 lot like Starship Troopers) , yet you can easily find yourself playing for hours, and for costing 
 less than $20 (I bought mine for $16 from Gamestop about a year ago) it is a bargain for the number 
 of hours you'll play it!

Review:  If you enjoy playing 3rd person/1st person shooters and think giant alien ants and spiders are 
 awesome, then this is YOUR game! Fight everything from giant ants, to giant jumping spiders, to 
 flying robot things to gargantua Godzilla-like creatures to huge robots of destruction and little 
 Japanese people running around in American voices in Japan using everything from machine guns to 
 grenades to destroy everything including the huge skyscrapers next to you then mount up for EDF! 
 Say it with me! EDF! EDF! EDF! OMG! GIANT ALIENS! :P What makes the game the most likable perhaps 
 IS the cheesiness of the game. The game is extremely unrealistic but then again, its a game! :) 
 There is NO online play however. But this IS the game to take to parties and have fun! You can 
 beat the game fairly easily on *Shock* easy but with about 5-6 difficulties, there is much to unlock! 
 Don't expect to have a boring game!

Review:  EDF 2017 is all game. there's nothing to tie it down. no story, no characters, no multiplayer, 
 no online. just pure mindless gameplay.
  
  you fight as a raandom EDF soldier defending "earth" from invading aliens known as ravagers.
 
  
  levels vary, with 4 types. City, Beach, Underground, and actually i can't think of any other types 
 of levels. but i will update this if i can.
  
  there are 4-5 types of enemies, red ants, black ants, Spiders, godzilla monsters, and various robots. 
 other things you destroy range from alien dropships to motherships to nests.
  
  the reason i say this game is hard is because it is. i dare you, anyone, to try and beat every 
 single level in this game on the inferno, the highest difficulty. even when playing with a friend 
 it is quite a challenge, and after playing the game for more than 40 hours, i have not yet accomplished 
 this.
  
  overall, gameplay is simplistic, with no strategy required on lower difficulty levels. however, 
 if you decide you do want to do the harder difficulties, strategy and weapon selection is extremely 
 critical as most enemies are able to kill you through walls due to bad level design. also, i would 
 suggest playing with a friend for the hardest 3 difficulties, there's no way you can beat them 
 by yourself.
  
  multiplayer is virtually nonexistant, a 1 life deathmatch exists, but is virtually useless. online 
 is completely nonexistant.
  
  overall, if you want a game that measures up to today's standards, don't buy EDF 2017. but, if 
 you do like mindless fun, i would suggest this game over games like halo 3 and gears of war.

Review:  Created in Japan and Originaly in Japanese. EDF 2017 came to the US on the demand of fans and the 
 behest of its creators who new it would sell in todays market. 
  A very simple game. Run around and Shoot giant Acid Farting Ants and Web Slinging Jumper Spiders. 
 The Story is also a very simple yet enthroughling one. In 2015 the earth recieved a message from 
 space. What was in this message is still unknown. The Earth Decided to Form The Earth Defense Force 
 to combat the possible Extra-Terrestrial Threat. In 2017 they got thier answer... An Invasion! 
 Featuring loads of Differnt Gubn Classes and Models as well as the Handy Tank, A pretty Attack 
 Helicopter and a Crazy looking Mech-Suit thats Pownz All! You are a Special Agent of sorts for 
 the Force and its your job to lead the troops into battle. The Graphics of the game are not spectacular 
 but do hold up to the 360 Standards. The Most intresting part of its content to me is its 6 Achievements. 
 One for every Difficulty level. Easy, Normal, Hard, Hardest and a game Exclusive Inferno, Basically 
 what this war would really look like. The Final Achievemnt is foe collecting all the Weapons of 
 the game. Many Weapons appear as little Icons on the Mpa and are Accoumpanied by Health and Armor 
 Power-ups. It sounds a little cheezy but they make a good touch. The game is a Average Shooter 
 but a very fun and unique one to Play. So i would say Rent It, and if you like it like i do, Buy 
 It.

Review:  This game may not look even remotly nice, it looks in some respect like a Dreamcast game. 
  
  The sound may not be nice, expecially the confirm sound at the menus.
  
  There may be a 
 large number of levels to clear, but they all of there involve lots and LOTS of killing!
  
  You see with this game, it isint about brilliant graphics, its about brilliant game play, its genius 
 how you play this, cause this will put you in the mood no matter how you feel.
  
  Okay so maybe some levels are too the same, but its how you do this situation on the harder settings 
 that will suck you in.
  
  On easy this is way too easy, few hits to a kill, but on hard, your gonna need a full load for 
 them, and inferno, well lets put it this way, David vs about 200 Goliaths at once!
  and David doesnt always win!
  
  every three kills an enemy will drop either a health kit (to 
 replenish your health either 25% or 75%) , armour kit (will increase your armour by 1.25% each pickup) 
 or a weapon case (will randomly unlock a weapon, there are 175 of them alltogether!) .
  
  You start with about 125 for your health, i forget exact amount, but on inferno, each hit is like 
 300 at least, and thats if your lucky for a weak hit.
  
  My health is at about 5500 and im still gettin pawned by the swarms of literally hundred of bug/robots/flying 
 things.
  
  this is a great budget game, if a little annoying with the sounds, still....

Review:  I had this as a rental, and ended up keeping it about as long as I've kept any non-role-playing 
 game. I ended up playing through every map I was able to successfully complete without too much 
 replay, which was about 70% of the game, and I may even get it again to finish it up.
  
  The game is a basic shoot-em-up where it is man vs. invading alien insects. Kind of like Starship 
 Troopers except it is all on Earth, and the bugs are standard earth bugs, although giant versions. 
 Mostly ants and spiders, with some backup tech gadgets.
  
  You go through the game, kill things, try not to get swarmed, and pick up upgraded weaponry your 
 kills drop. Pretty simple. As you up the difficulty, there are a LOT more bugs, and they drop better 
 weaponry. Not a lot of thought was given to plot - and I thank them. Turn it on, kill bugs. Missions 
 are relatively short, supporting the non-investment type game that it is.
  
  The biggest problem with this game is that the graphics are sub-standard. Increasing the difficulty 
 seems to be a constant "add this % more bugs and make them this % harder to kill doing this % more 
 damage". It would have been better if thought was given on a per-map basis how to scale properly.

Review:  EDF 2017 is an amazing game. Imagine an open world game like GTA but with the buildings being destructible 
 and the with an arcady intense action packed feel, no freeroaming here. The city is over run by 
 huge alien ants/spiders/robots/UFO's/ godzillas and your job is to destroy them using and unlimited 
 supply of ammo. Sure you can't run around and do crazy tricks like in true open world games but 
 the game doesn't give you the opportunity to realise this because it bombards you with hundreds 
 upon hundreds of enemies to kill, all this in splitscreen coop, the best kind of coop imo. 
  This game is the 3rd installment in the classic chikyuu boeuigun series, and plays much like its 
 predecessors. EDF 2017 is basically an updated version of chikyuu boueigun1 but i have heard it 
 is not all that similiiar to edf2 which i have never played. I have played the first one (on ps2) 
 however and it plays just as well as that installment. It appears to be missing a jetpackin female 
 character from edf2. What this game does right is its great arcade action and its open world freedom, 
 a rare combination in the gaming industry. Much of the fun to be had comes from this freedom like 
 using a stair case to climb a building and snipe your coop partner from across the level or landing 
 your helicopter on top a tower just to have your buddy blow it up 2 seconds later. The games few 
 flaws include its rather departure from its original simple control system which forces players 
 to use the advanced control system which is much better but maybe too hard for some novices. In 
 addtion to this the game appears to be a tad rushed with some of the great special effects from 
 the first game thrown out (the sparks when shooting the huge robots) . The japanese version of this 
 game also lacks an english language translation which wouldn't have been a problem if the ntsc-u/c 
 version wasn't region locked.
  Overall though this is a great game and is tons of fun to play through.

Review:  With this run and gun third person shooter, you'll be entertained for a couple hours or so. Its 
 tons of fun when you go on one of the hard difficulties as you fight off hordes of insect-like 
 aliens and unlock new weapons. 
  There is a bit of excitement when you see a giant army of ant-like aliens rushing towards you and 
 your partner as you scrample for a good position to fire from.
  I still couldnt figure how to get into the vehicle which is another reason that this game isn't 
 the best. There is tons of levels that are a great challenge and good for achievements. Also, if 
 you figure out how to get into the vehicles, there is a descent variety of vehicles to choose from. 
 Theres a mech, tank, motorcycle, and a helicopter. 
  As for online multi-player, there is none. Its just one of those games that you rent just becuase 
 you're bored.
  
  Good rent, Bad buy. Theres really not much to say about this simple game.
  Just dont buy it.

Review:  Earth Defense Force 2017 takes mediocre graphics and combines it with mediocre gameplay, a nonessential 
 story, and some lame voice acting and music. Plus, it is an Xbox 360 exclusive that in no way takes 
 advantage of Xbox live. Basically this game falls short in every way, but somehow it manages to 
 still be a little fun.
  
  The game consists of 53 levels of alien killing. You start out with only a few weapons to take 
 on the hoards of bugs and robots invading earth. Over time you gain more weapons and more health 
 to take on more bugs and robots. That is the game in its entirety. 
  
  What makes it fun is that trying out new weapons can be pretty fun. Even within the categories 
 of assault rifle, sniper rifle, rockets, missiles, grenades, and special, there is a lot of variation. 
 For example on assault rifle might have a high rate of fire and less damage while one might have 
 the inverse. It allows for a good amount of customization, though certain weapons will always be 
 better on certain stages.
  
  The negative side of the game is the repetition. The game plays pretty much the same through all 
 of the levels. For a single play-through on the normal difficulty it will probably take a new player 
 about 12 hours. While this would be great if there was enough content to justify it, but most of 
 the levels are very similar. It is one of the few games that just seems to be a little too long. 
 Also to unlock the achievements for the different difficulties you have to play through the whole 
 game 5 times. I don't know that there are many people who wont get bored before investing the 60 
 hours in this game.
  
  The most redeeming aspect is the two player co-op. With a second human working with you the stages 
 move a bit more quickly. Of course this is local only and only for two people. It seems a glaring 
 omission to leave out online. You'll have quite a few computer team mates and it is difficult to 
 understand why there is no 16 player online.
  
  The game has a few other problems worth noting. The frame rate drops quite a bit in this game. 
 It is worse with two people. It is pretty easy to play through these instances and thankfully they 
 wont get you killed. There are vehicles in the game that you SHOULD be able to use to help you, 
 but you can't. All of them are so glitched you'll probably avoid them completely. Another issue 
 is there is no auto save. You must remember to save before quiting. Though it should be easy, the 
 one time you forget after playing through 20+ stages will be enough to make you quit for good.
 
  
  So what is comes down to is Earth Defense Force 2017 is a game that can easily burn up a rainy 
 Saturday with a friend, but it is hardly worth owning. However if someone would insist on beating 
 it all, the game plays better in short burst rather than trying to beat it in one marathon session. 
 Even then you'll probably want a friend to help you endure the whole thing. The harder modes can 
 be pretty hard. If you're up for endless hours fighting repetitive enemies then this game is for 
 you.

Review:  i have to say honestly i had more fun with this game then i had with any other game in a long time 
 the game is basically a Japanese b- rated movie transformed into a game aliens invaded earth and 
 you and your team must kill them all.. Gameplay:
  
  its basically a run and gun type of game with a ton of enemies to shoot at i don't think i have 
 seen so much enemies on a screen at once in a long time its like shooting into a wave that won't 
 stop also some missions you have over 30-35 team members so it really is a epic fight you have 
 infinity ammo and can carry only 2 weapons you can unlock more powerful weapons by doing harder 
 levels and enemies that you kill drop weapons, health, and armor that makes you have more health 
 and weapons for the next round (basically its sorta like a RPG in a way you collect fallen items 
 from dead enemies to make you more powerful) also there are over 52 solo missions and 2 player 
 CO-OP and everything you can see on the screen can be blown up trees, buildings, gates, bridges, 
 houses etc etc so it is fun Sound:
  basically i would say its so/so nothing really jumps out at you as wow that was awesome and your 
 team members sometimes chatter but some things they say are stupid Online:
  basically nothing much just an online score board so its not that much fun online CO-OP would be 
 a PERFECT fit for this game Enemies (fodder) :
  waves of them, fun, some are difficult, some go down in 1-2 hits, some are so huge it makes you 
 go **** that thing is amazing and awesome to bring down with heavy weapon fire CONS:
  
  your team mates suck (defensive wise offensive they are pretty dam good) as in you start out with 
 allot two seconds after a wave of enemies there are none less so you have like 60 aliens attacking 
 you and trust me no matter how much health you have with 60 aliens attacking you and 40 more waiting 
 around the corner its a pain in the ass using vehicles in the game are very difficult i failed 
 to mention it in gameplay because i feel that they bring the game down you last like 20 seconds 
 in a vehicle before the aliens knock it out
  
  the aliens are highly repetitive for example there are huge blacks ants one mission you find a 
 whole new alien and its now a red ant.... so ya
  
  even though the game has 52 missions it only takes place on 6-7 maps the maps are HUGE and destructive 
 but you play on the same ones over and over again but instead of starting in the same place you 
 start in a different section of the map very lame achievements there are only 6 and very stupid 
 basically its collect all weapons, beat the game on easy, beat the game on normal, beat the game 
 on hard, beat the game on extreme, beat the game on inferno,
  
  the player models of the soldiers are very weird looking and moving and will bother you when you 
 1st play it but you will get used to it
  
  Overall:
  the game is basically pure fun its a decent game if your bored play this game if you have a hour 
 or 2 to kill play it BUT if your looking for a heavy story interesting cast of characters and strategic 
 game play your out of luck if you want a fun, random shooting, anything can blow up game then buy 
 it i really loved and enjoyed this game

Review:  The Good: Does a good job being a bad game, completely destructible environments, tons of massive 
 enemies, two player mode is a blast
  
  The Bad: Down right laughable voice acting and story, gets extremely repetitive after the first 
 5 levels, no online play, lame achievements
  
  EDF is a bad game. Yet it's a very well done bad game. The game has bad graphics, cheesy voice 
 acting, a dumb story, repetitive action, lame achievements (only 5 for completing the game on each 
 difficulty) , but does it right. What makes the game enjoyable are the thousands of giant ants you 
 fight in each level, entirely destructible environments, and some strategy needed to play the game. 
 You go into each of the 56 missions with only two weapons, and this is where the strategy comes 
 in. If you have other EDFs with you you might want to take an assault rifle and a rocket launcher 
 so you don't kill them. If you have tons and tons of ants instead of just tons you can bring a 
 grenade launcher to do massive damage, and when I mean massive I mean MASSIVE. Everything in this 
 game is over exaggerated. You can shoot down sky scrapers with one rocket launcher and watch them 
 tumble, take out a whole UFO with just a few bullets. This makes the game both funny and enjoyable. 
 Thanks to many weapons in the game and the two player mode you'll have hours of non stop fun. The 
 game is a technical feat, though, with the thousands of massive enemies and smoke effects, and 
 ginormous UFOs without much slowdown. So if you want some mindless fun join the EDF and be happy.

Review:  Basically, I have tried em all. Mass Effect, Army of Two, Halo 3, Lost Planet, Gears of War... the 
 list goes on. This is the only game out of all of these that I keep returning to all the time and 
 that says a lot. It may have low production values but sure has the largest heart. Most games these 
 days seem to focus on cinematic visuals and audio, revolutionary gameplay, and stuff thats never 
 been done before them. Earth Defence Force achieves what all these new games fail to - plain and 
 simple, pure FUN.
  
  This is one of the most fun games I've ever gotten to play, co-op is amazing too.

Review:  If you are buying this game with any expectations of it being the next great shooter like Halo3 
 or COD 4 then your an idiot and won't like this game. This game is fun from the very first level. 
 With countless enemies to fight on screen, halarious voice acting, and awesome guns to usw. When 
 this game's peices are added together it can become addicting. The massive array of levels will 
 keep you playing for hours. Also, for more fun have a friend join you to play. Seriously it will 
 increase the fun and excitment ten fold. I have never got my monies worth for a game until this 
 one. its worth every penny!

Review:  Ok every single city level is the same as the other and im pretty freaking sure that a grenade 
 would not destroy a sky scraper!!!!!! vehicles are super hard to turn and are not that usefull 
 like the hellicopter its machine guns cant shot at them unless you go forward and try to do a strayfing 
 run but that dont work always and misiles have crap homing turning sucks also. Weapons look the 
 same always one maching gun will look like the other. sometimes the ants blood will will fill up 
 the hole screen because its so thick. and there is like 50 freaking boring lvls the games animation 
 gives you a head ach i did not bother beating the game. I got to like lvl 36 and forgot to save 
 to go play hockey. And so i just returned the game at rogers said it was broken and just rented 
 turok. JUST DONT BUY THIS PILE OF COW DUNG

Review:  Earth Defense Force 2017 is basically a Japanese arcarde game for the Xbox 360. The plot is terrible 
 so I'll leave it at that. The voice acting is pretty bad but I guess it fits in with the random 
 events that occur throughout the game. The bad voice acting is actually good for the game because 
 it makes a random situation more amusing and fun. I mean the ants can climb buildings just as fast 
 as they walk on the ground. It's somewhat unrealistic that they climb buildings REALLY fast. Saying 
 that, the ants create one of the best video game moments in the history of video games. In the 
 first level your screen will litterally fill up with over 80 massive ants swarming at you and screaming 
 in union. You will have a gamespot "Oh Snap" moment trust me. You can also destroy any building 
 in the city you want, just by firing one rocket at it. Any kind of rocket from any rocket launcher 
 will do the trick. It's fun at first but it gets a little annoying at times. For example you miss 
 and hit a building, then about 30 ants are now in your view and spew acid all over you. This game 
 is pretty fun to play with another person. Other then that the replay value is moderate due to 
 the lack of other things to accomplish besdies the achievements.

Review:  Game Play - You play as Storm and can use tanks, helicopters, hover bikes, even a mech suit and 
 ALOT of weapons to battle *Takes a huge breath* Giant ANTS and ROBOTS, Spiders, Space ships and 
 even Godzilla clones. There I said it... it is absolutely AWESOME!
  The game is really a run and gun, now don't expect some awesome story line or gameplay it really 
 is a guy holding infinite bullets and missiles and goes on a genocide to kill all monsters bigger 
 than him. The game is simple, you jump, dodge, and shoot. That's it really, but the amount of enemies 
 it throws at you and the explosions, you forget about it for a min and enjoy it. 
  
  Sounds - Music is annoying to listen to, I turn it off and the soldiers apparently have some sort 
 of death wish, They scream CHARGE!!! or COME AND GET SOME YOU BUGS!, before being ripped apart 
 by a spider....... Pretty generic in my opinion...
  
  Graphics - Great the robots and ant battles were really large in scope. Also pretty lights, oh 
 wait those are missiles.....
  
  Replay Value - COOP!!! But if any one of you die, that's it your out for the rest of the game till 
 your partner wins the mission. Also Royal mode, where you kill each other!
  
  Cons: Over 150 weapons, too similar to each other, no different models or such, repetitive and 
 gets boring after awhile, 53 levels I know but I don't think I will live to see it to the end!!!!
 
  
  Summary - Great COOP game if you need to kill some time or want some honest Ant or robot killing 
 rampage you sick person you...

Review:  A great game where you have to kill giant ants, spiders & robots with big, ridiculous weapons. 
 Thats all there is to this game. & you know what I boody loved it! 
  Right lets get the bad out of the way first. *takes deep breathe* This game has very poor graphics, 
 bad pop up, questionable vehicle control, dissapearig enemies & destroyed buildings, funny in a 
 bad way voiceacting, can get repetative in long bursts, a bit long, repetative scenery, horrible 
 slowdown, a couple of huge difficulty spikes & a lead character that runs like hes got diarrhoea 
 trickiling down his leg. Its probably the most budget, b-movies style game ive ever played. So 
 why have I given it 8/10? 
  
  A couple of reasons. First its got a fantastic sense of charm & character. Charm & character can 
 be a huge advantage to any piece of media. Its what makes you raise that game above the better 
 accomplished, but cold & cynical games out there. Like Portal hasnt got the best graphics or most 
 variety but look at the love it gets from gamers. This game also knows its a budget title & is 
 proud of it. Its pure, clean unadultarated, massive, brilliant fun!! 
  
  Its also full of brilliant drawdropping moments. This game contains the second biggest enemies 
 ive ever seen (after God of War) . Not only are they the biggest but they also come in huge numbers. 
 The whole screen can be filled with giant 10 story ants (yes you read that right) that shower the 
 city in blood when shot & when you look up they'll also be 10's of huge spaceships for you to blow 
 up. These then crash to earth & casue some of the biggest & best explosions ive ever seen. Its 
 completely OTT & all the better for it. It will have you grinning from ear to ear all the way through, 
 even laughing at the sheer pleasure of destruction as you fire 20 rockets in 2 seconds into the 
 distance, you see blood shoot everywhere & buildings crash to the floor in the horrizon. The fact 
 that your in a huge city/playground & every building can be reduced to rubble can cause a severe 
 case of happyness. When all this happens you no longer care about that long list of problems & 
 glitches. Your just having too much fun. 
  
  As long as you arent part of the Playstation generation where graphics are the be all & end all 
 of games then this will be the most fun youve had in a long time. Get it!

Review:  Earth Defense Force 2017 is a one player action game developed by D3 for the Xbox 360. EDF has 
 a history in Japan but this is the first time the series has been released over here. The basic 
 premise is that you play as a character named Storm 1 and you are part of the Earth Defense Force, 
 which defends the earth from the onslaught of the invading aliens known as the Ravagers. The aliens 
 consist of giant ants, giant spiders, giant robots, and massive flying spaceships. There are 53 
 missions in the game and you are tasked with different things in each one, but it all really comes 
 down to destroying all the aliens in the level. There are no escort missions or anything other 
 than just running into a horde of aliens and destroying them all. Your character can equip 2 weapons 
 to bring into the level and you have a selection of 150 or so to choose from. It can be a difficult 
 choice since some weapons are more effective against certain types of enemies, but ineffective 
 against others. It's really all trial and error but you'll eventually decide to stick with one 
 or two different types. There are shotguns, missle launchers, assault rifles, sniper rifles, grenades 
 and some other unusual one-of-a-kind type weapons such as mines, flamethrowers, turrents, etc. 
 While there are 150 weapons to collect in the game, although a lot of them are just variations 
 of previous ones you've obtained (you will eventually find guns with better firepower, ammo capacity, 
 firing speeds, reload times, etc.) . 
  
  There are also vehicles in the game, but they all suck. The controls for the tank, airbike, helicopter 
 and mech are so bad that you're better off running around on foot. The best vehicle is the mech 
 just because you can hop in it quick and take out a couple dozen enemies while you are just standing 
 there, until you run out of armor and the thing explodes. It moves slower then you do on foot so 
 its best just to use it as a turret.
  
  When you start a mission you'll notice your HUD consists of a targeting reticle, an icon displaying 
 what weapon you have equipped, how much ammo you have, a radar and a health bar. You get infinite 
 ammo but you have to reload after you've fired so many times. Reloading can be a problem because 
 some weapons take a very very long time to reload and others reload almost instantly. This can 
 be a deciding factor in what weapons you bring with you in a level. When you defeat enemies they 
 will drop first aid kits, as well as armor upgrades and new weapons. After you finish a level you 
 will get a rundown of how many upgrades you received and what new weapons you unlocked, if any.
 
  
  The level design in the game is one of its drawbacks. While there are 53 total missions, but there 
 are really only a few varieties. The city levels, the countryside levels and the underground levels. 
 The level design can get a bit boring and monotonous but the sheer size and numbers of the enemy 
 will keep you going. That is the one thing about this game that will keep you playing it, the humungous 
 scale of the enemies. Everything is massive, the ants are at least 10 times your size, the robots 
 are 20 times and the final boss is 100 times your size. You are looking up all the time at these 
 enemies almost as big as buildings. I felt like I was playing a video game version of the 1954 
 film Them! as well as War of the Worlds (take your pic of film versions or the novel works too) . 
 I also love the destructibility of the environments. Shoot a rocket at a building and it crumbles 
 in spectacular fashion. Sometimes its fun to just run around destroying the landscape.
  
  The main problems with this really comes down to level design and enemy variety. Besides the fact 
 that there are really only a few different types of levels you will also have problems running 
 into fences, curbs and other small obstacles that you'd think you could just step over but instead 
 you get stuck on them, then have to stop shooting whatever your shooting at, and line yourself 
 up with the obstacle and hit the jump button. This becomes a major issue when you're surrounded 
 by hordes of ants, spiders and giant walking robots (hate those things) . Your allied soldiers also 
 have very poor AI, sometimes you'll find yourself accidentally killing them because they get in 
 the way. The graphics aren't that great either, but if you consider this is a budget game and the 
 sheer size of the enemies you won't have a problem in the end. Finally it would have been nice 
 to have a bit more variety in the types of enemies you face. I was hoping for some more insects, 
 like scorpions or bees and maybe actually facing an alien trooper or two.
  
  Overall this is a very fun game that is worth checking out if you are a fan of action games, or 
 just sci-fi in general. Despite a few problems the game is a heck of a lot of fun. It does not 
 have online multiplayer, which is very unfortunate but it does have local split screen co-op.

Review:  I've seen this game in the stores for a while and with a price tag of $15, dismissed as a cheap-budget 
 game that's a waste of money. Well, i'm happy i gave it a chance.
  
  This is old-school shmup gaming with tons of aliens to destroy and little else. However, numerous 
 weapons and aliens, the game is just plain fun. The graphics and sound are average, but still better 
 than most low budget games. 
  
  The game for the money is a must have, with 53 missions, vehicles to drive and fly, tons of on-screen 
 enemies, the game is very addictive and with 5 difficulty settings, has a lot of replay value.

Review:  When I seen this I thought it looked awesome, but I knew it was a foreign title and that it looked 
 kinda silly. Now it is probably on my list of best games ever. It has no real story, it has no 
 really big game draw of fancy mechanics. Its pure smash em up action at its finest!
  
  So what exactly is it? Ever see/play Godzilla? War of the Monsters? Starship Troopers? Getting 
 the drift? Well this those games but in something so big its addicting!
  
  Even though theres barley a story there are "alien forces" invading earth and the EDF (games name) 
 have to stop them. Tada! STORY! Well you start by simply fighting a few swarms of giant ants.... 
 and I mean giant! The size of cars! Sound silly? Eventually without revealing to many of the cool 
 "enemies" you face creatures like "godzilla" type guys and mech like bugs!
  
  Tell me more you say? Well in these massive hundred city wide block maps (or beaches, caves or 
 whatevers) there can be tens of thousands of alien, ant.... things all over swarming you and the 
 other EDF soldiers! Its like playing a movie! Some come from ships (you can shoot at) . Some come 
 from tunnels. Some die easy, some don't some shoot acid.... etc. Heck some shoot missiles!
  
  Tell you even MORE? Well.... besides the fact the maps have tanks, aircraft and other vehicles 
 you unlock new weapons.... like hundreds of them! Yeah half of which are useless but they are so 
 varied you NEVER get bored! I don't even know where to start! From nades, flame throwers, nukes, 
 Tesla guns... etc. Best part is you can carry two weapons in a mission so no need to worry about 
 using just one!
  
  Oh wait THERES MORE! Did I mention everything is destructible? By the end of a mission you can 
 level cities! Oh it gets better. Theres COOP! Oh yeah! Have you and a friend tear through the game 
 together at any point! Just so you know though if you want better weapons you have to beat missions 
 on harder difficulties and I'll tell you right now.... THIS GAME IS NOT EASY if you play on harder 
 settings! You will get pummeled!
  
  Lastly the bigger enemies, that is the "boss like" enemies are massive. Forget Halo 3 or anything 
 like that. These guy squash them with their toe. Literally!
  
  It too me like 2 months to get EVERY level beaten on EVERY difficulty and to get EVERY GUN and 
 get everything I wanted complete. This ain't your little brothers game. This is a mans game!
  
  So what the negatives you might say?
  
  Well theres really nothing bad about the game unless 
 you don't like smash em ups. The graphics aren't the best ever. But the draw distance is amazing 
 and the on screen enemies at once is amazing! The AI is helpful but don't expect them to save you 
 butt.
  
  Well thats my review. If I haven't at least sparked your interest then this isn't the game for 
 you. If I have just buy it. Trust me the replay value is through the roof!

Review:  Amazingly fun on all difficulty settings.. Tons of weapons.. for fans of old school shooters! EXCELENT!!!
 
  
  Pros-
  Amazingly fun game for One or Two players. 
  Tons of replayability for those who love challenging games and the sci-fi genre
  Destructive 
 environments 
  Simple level design
  No problems with AI due to all mission goals just requiring you to kill the bugs (no escort missions)
 
  A few different vehicles to help mix things up
  More weapons than you really know what to do with 
  Fans of Godzilla, Starship Troopers, and 
 cheesy Sci-fi movies
  
  Cons-
  Some weapons are worthless
  Replaying levels to unlock some of the best weapons can be frustrating
  Some of the vehicles 
 serve zero purpose
  No online modes
  
  I feel this is a great game for one person of for two (and best of all lets you switch between 
 single and two player in the same campaign without making you redo any missions)
  
  I didn't mind Paying 40 dollars for it.. and I have seen places recently selling it for 20
  
 
  If you are a fan of old videogame shooters.. check it out! Its pretty much a next-gen Genesis 
 or Nintendo game! One of my favorite games for the 360

Review:  I really enjoyed playing this game. A lot of action. If you like shooting giant alien insects, 
 giant robots, spaceships this is the game. Its kinda like an old sci-fi movie. The controls are 
 simple. The two player part of the game is fun. I like the two player mode better than the one 
 player mode. The game environments are big. I think the graphics could of been a little better. 
 The story could of been written better. Some of the dialogue of the NPC's is silly. But if you 
 like non stop action and big explosions this is the game. I rate the graphics an 8. The game play 
 a 9. Some of the stages of the game are dark and hard to see what you're shooting at. Some of the 
 computer controlled NPCs will take you out from the blast of their weapons. Its kind of frustrating 
 when it happens. But it has only happened to me in only one stage so far.
  I hope they make an EDF 2017-2. I would buy it.

Review:  Coming across as a pretty cheesy sci-fi B movie, Earth Defense Force 2017 is probably one of the 
 most entertaining games I've had the chance to play. The story tells you how some huge ships are 
 dropping armies of aliens from the sky, destroying cities all over the world. You, as a brave soldier 
 you are, grab a couple of weapons and have to rid each stage of the invading creatures.
  
  Borrowing quite a bit from Starship Troopers, you will find yourself surrounded mostly by familiar 
 bugs: ants and spiders. How are ants and spiders scary? Giant jumping spiders and acid-spitting 
 ants are trying to annihilate the human race.
  
  But there are more impressive enemies, such as giant walking robots that shoot laser beams and 
 trample you, even bigger four-legged walkers that remind me of those in Star Wars, but these are 
 particularly annoying with their laser cannons and shields. There are also some robotic dinossaurs, 
 and obviously, the motherships (reminiscent of Entreprise) and their little fighter aircrafts.
 
  
  You are joined by a squad of soldiers, usually not the brightest men in the bunch. They love to 
 adjust their timing to run in front of you while you launch a rocket Stage by stage, you venture 
 into large cities, claustrophobic caves and tunnels, sunny beaches and grassy hills, killing whatever 
 moves, which sometimes includes your squad members. Especially when you want to pick up the power-ups 
 while only one spider or ant runs around after you.
  
  Enemies drop power-ups, which are represented by very lame 2D sprites. Pick up armor and you get 
 a health boost at the end of the stage. Pick up weapon icons to see what else can you fit in your 
 arsenal. Run over healing icons to recover some health.
  
  There are tons of weapons in the game, but the best and rarest you will only find in the higher 
 difficulty stages. There are rocket launchers, grenade launchers, missile launchers (I love launchers!) , 
 flamethrowers, beam rifles, assault rifles, shotguns and more. You can always carry two weapons 
 and switch between them when necessary, so always check for a better version of what you're using 
 after completing a stage.
  
  Some stages also offer vehicles you can control, like tanks, a hover bike that also reminds me 
 of Star Wars, helicopters and even a mech suit. They aren't all that easy to control, and most 
 times you're better off to just run around.
  
  That's where co-op comes into play, making it all a little easier, but doubling the chances of 
 screwing up. Co-op runs in a side-by-side split screen, and it's one of the coolest things to play 
 with a friend (or in my case, husband) . You can pick weapons that complement one another, cover 
 each other when needed and slow down rivers of incoming bugs from different sides. Either way, 
 a buddy is the best way to go to get through the game in all five difficulties.
  
  Graphically, EDF is a mixed bag. While the mothership design and bugs for aliens are fairly poor 
 ideas, the walkers and giant robots have some really good design. The textures on the buildings 
 aren't all that impressive and everything looks somewhat dull, but everything is destructible and 
 turns to rubble and ruins, drastically altering the landscape. Your character looks like a GI Joe 
 when strafing too, torso faces the front, everything below the waist turns to the side. It's like 
 the legs have a will of their own, and it's pretty hilarious. And I've already mentioned the 2D 
 icons that seem totally out of place and get really blurry when you come near. The frame rate also 
 gets its fair amount of hiccups when you're being swarmed.
  
  However, the draw distance in the game is amazing, and not many games actually do it this well. 
 I could stand there with my rocket launcher miles away from this huge tower, and actually see ants 
 crawling all over it. Shooting it would result in ants flying all over and the tower crumbling 
 down. But you can see it all happening clearly, even from that far away. The sound is quite amusing. 
 Who doesn't enjoy a good explosion and tons of gunshots when you're at war? Everything sounds as 
 it should, the music isn't bad and the random comments from your virtual squad members, although 
 a bit limited, reinforce the B movie feel. They will either chant EDF! EDF! or randomly say something 
 that has nothing to do with what they're doing. EDF is a really simple game, not too flashy, but 
 that gets you going, and going, and going, until the higher difficulty level starts taking the 
 fun away and giving place to frustration. It's easy to find yourself surrounded by tons of spitting 
 ants, spiders shooting webs or those annoying little ships that move so erratically that in the 
 highest difficulty it's almost impossible to take them down. With a bigger budget, this would have 
 been one hell of a game. Earth Defense Force 2017 has plenty of challenge and replayability with 
 53 levels and five difficulties to clear, and over 150 weapons to discover. It also makes you work 
 for those achievements. Sure it doesn't look spectacular and has its fair share of slowdowns, but 
 it's weird, silly and pretty cheesy, and you will enjoy it so much you won't even care. EDF owns!

Review:  Hmm... let's see. This game offers a cheap little impact of mindless, but eventful and fast paced 
 gameplay.
  It by far isn't up to this current gen's standards, but it has it's own bargain brand of fun in 
 the form of blasting giant bugs, UFO's and robots. There is not much of this game to explain, except 
 that you shouldn't expect a blockbuster of a game, but rather one of those titles that you would 
 borrow for some cheap fun, then give it back. Oh yeah, there is a lack of proper vehicles, as there 
 are four types to choose from. You have a Star Wars type of speeder bike which only has guns, a 
 tank, a mech suit that is very clunky to turn in, and a helicopter. All vehicles cannot take any 
 real type of damage, being that it doesn't take much to destroy them.
  One of the best things to do in this game though, is to launch an Air Tortoise at a giant robot.

Review:  On the surface, Earth Defense Force 2017 is, as many have already labeled it, a B-Movie transformed 
 into a video game. Depending on how you look at it, this can be a blessing or a curse. Another 
 way to look at is a poor man's Lost Planet. 
  
  In the game, you play a soldier, codenamed Storm 1. Your only duty is repel the forces of the Ravagers, 
 which take the form of giant insects and robots throughout most of the game. Armed with dozens 
 of interesting and powerful weapons, you spend the majority of the game running away from swarms 
 of colossal ants and robots, unleashing your impressive array of explosive armaments from a third 
 person perspective. You'll occasionally run across a vehicle in the form of a tank, a hover bike, 
 a helicopter, or a Lost Planet-esque battle armor.
  
  As far as game play is concerned, EDF 2017 controls well, so long as you aren't in a vehicle. We'll 
 get to that in a moment. Anyway, we must admit that firing high-explosive rockets into a swarm 
 of ants is blast. The game play stays so consistent that it might become boring for some. However, 
 we found that the different objectives and changing terrain of each of the missions was enough 
 to keep us playing for six hours straight, and then yearning for more the next day.
  
  The button configurations are fairly simple. Essentially, you only have to worry about four different 
 buttons, all of them triggers and shoulder-buttons by default. Your character can jump, fire his 
 weapon, change weapons, and execute a weapon-specific task such as trigger C4 or zoom in with your 
 sniper rifle. That's about it when it comes to controls. However, things tend to get a bit more 
 complicated when you enter one of the game's four vehicles.
  
  For some strange reason, you can invert the Y-Axis for your soldier, but the Y-Axis remains non-inverted 
 whenever you're in a vehicle. This makes for a confusing transition from running and gunning to 
 when you hop into a tank or chopper. Despite the strange Y-Axis problem, the tank is fairly simple 
 to operate, as is the hover bike. However, piloting the heli can be complicated and cumbersome, 
 as you have to continually tap the A button to keep the helicopter from plummeting downward. The 
 Battle Armor is extremely slow and if you're not careful, you'll get swarmed by monsters that will 
 destroy you and your armor faster then you can say They're bugs! Very huge bugs! 
  
  The insect-aliens look exactly like their real world counterparts, which is kind of cool and kind 
 of weak at the same time. We think the game would have benefited from a more creative approach 
 to what the bug aliens looked like. The giant walking machines, however, are very well designed 
 and extremely fun to combat. To the game's credit, there can be dozens of giant monsters on the 
 screen at one time, without any noticeable slow-downs in frame rate, even in two-player co-op. 
 Visually, the game isn't absolutely stunning, but there's certainly a level of quality there. The 
 textures of the game run the gamut from mediocre to very high quality, depending on what you're 
 looking at. Weather and atmosphere is done rather well, especially on a few of the missions that 
 take place on the beach at dawn. It's certainly an awesome scene to watch twelve enormous, iron-clad 
 robots march their way out of the ocean and onto the beach during the pale sunlight of the morning. 
 The majority of your weaponry comes in the explosive variety, and explosions look pretty damn good.
 
  
  Sound quality is a bit lacking. Voice-over acting is laughable, and some parts of the audio samples 
 are scratchy and low quality. The music is decent, but can become annoying after a while of playing. 
 Luckily, you can just mute it out completely.
  
  Buildings crumble nicely when you hit them with rockets, missiles, and grenades, but we feel they're 
 a bit too fragile. Even the smallest explosion will topple the towering sky scrapers that are scattered 
 about the immense landscapes. You can climb up most of the staircases outside of the buildings; 
 just be sure you don't accidentally hit any part of the building with your weapon, otherwise then 
 entire structure will fall apart right under your feet.
  
  By and far, the best element of the game is the cooperative option. With 53 lengthy missions, you 
 and a buddy can fight off the Ravagers together. Tactics and cooperation will definitely help see 
 you through to the end of the game, especially on higher difficulty settings, where the monsters 
 are more resilient, more ferocious, and more plentiful. A neat part of the difficulty settings 
 of the game is the fact that playing on a higher level of difficulty will allow you to pick up 
 more advanced and powerful weaponry. Earth Defense Force 2017 is definitely worth a rent. If you 
 like it, we recommend picking up a copy at GameStop or EB. Last we checked, you could get a new 
 copy for $40 and a used one for $35.

Review:  Earth Defense Force 2017 is besed on a group of aliens calles the Ravengers attacking Earth. Who 
 can save Earth? The EDF (Earth Defense Force) . You mainly play through the game as a soldier in 
 the EDF and your objesctive is to aid in the defense of Earth.
  
  This games has a pretty big variety of games. It has 7 classes (Assualt, Grenades, Missile, Sniper, 
 Shotgun, Rockets, and Special) and over 150 weapons in all. All are pretty good from heat seeking 
 missle launcher's to flamethrowers.
  
  Graphic wise they are not that great, but not bad. At some points, the graphics arent as great 
 as past 360 games, but when do graphics matter? Gameplay matters to me! Gameplay is so simple and 
 so fun. Weather it be blowing up aliens and robots, or destroying the environment, this game is 
 fun. And the co-op is also great, but could have used Xbox Live. Battle Royale mode is an O. K. 
 addition to the game, but not as interesting as the real gameplay.
  
  Difficulty level vary from Easy, Normal, Hard, Hardest, and Inferno. Acheivments arent that interesting 
 or hard to get. Overall, Earth Defense Force 2017 is game I recomend. 9.5/10

Review:  Upon looking at the box for EDF i laughed for a good minute and figured at the very worst i could 
 end up saying i got to play the worst game ever made. If you have that mentality before you decide 
 to play EDF it really makes it a lot better, bascially because EDF isn't a great game it's just 
 dumb fun. You kill bugs. Lots of bugs. 53 levels of bugs. 10+ hours of bugs your first time through. 
 The game is extremely corny, the limited voice acting, the story , the style of how everything 
 looks. If a movie was made in the 1950's that was supposed to take place in 1980 where we fought 
 a war against giant bugs, that movie would be called EDF. Anyways,
  
  this game is a mindless 3rd person shooter. You get to carry 2 weapons. As you play your health 
 and weapons grow. The graphics are plain but the draw distance and perspective are great. The sound 
 is simplistic but if you play with loud volume then the shooting and explosions are very satsifying. 
 If you get bored of games really fast then this isn't the game for you. If you liked playing phantasy 
 star online back when it was on gamecube and you didn't get bored after 20 hours then you'll love 
 this game. Rent it.

Review:  When I first bought EDF 2017 I honestly wasn't expecting that great of a game. When I picked up 
 the controller I was addicted! I myself think the game is fun because it doesn't focus on a great 
 story, amazing graphics, or hi-tech cut scenes, instead it focuses on what makes a game a game, 
 the fun. The game has a variety of different weapons and a variety of different weapons that make 
 the game even more fun. Thats not the main thing however. What really makes this game fun is the 
 extremely fast paced action. You'll be shooting down giant bugs left and right barely getting a 
 chance to set down the controller. Overall this is a great game if you are just looking for some 
 fun. If you are looking for a super hi-tech game, this game is not for you.

Review:  So basically, the world is going to be over-run with Bugs and Aliens in 2017, right? Just about 
 as believable as me saying this game is lots of fun, if you just watched the gameplay videos. But 
 if you grab a friend, and go in with an open mind, EDF is very amusing for a long time.
  
  GAMEPLAY (8.5/10)
  
  I haven't played a game that used so little buttons in a long time. There 
 is one for jump/roll, another for shoot, one for change weapons, and a 4th for zooming (which is 
 only used for a small amount of guns) . There are 50+ levels that range from 3 minutes to about 
 10. Basically, you run around, shooting powerful guns at Ants, Spiders, Shiny Robots and Spaceships, 
 while blowing up Japanese cities in the process.
  
  Each mission's goal is the same: Destroy all Hostiles. It's a 3rd person shooter, and the enemies 
 are huge and often easy to hit. But tons come at you at once, so it gets very, very hectic. On 
 higher difficulties, players have to experiment with weapons because each mission should be handled 
 a certain way.
  
  Through-out the levels you collect health-upgrades and weapons, with over 250 in the game. Most 
 are just deviants of previous weapons, with longer ranger or higher fire-power. Still, collecting 
 weapons is fun, and some are pretty amusing.
  
  There are five difficulties in EDF: Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Hardest and Inferno. That's 
 right, Inferno is harder than Hardest. Anyhow, each difficulty makes the aliens faster and harder 
 to kill, not smarter. On some of the higher difficulties the game bogs down from the sheer mass 
 of Bugs and their deadly goo.
  
  Overall, the gameplay is extremely simple and repetetive, yet somehow enjoyable, especially with 
 a friend. Getting more health and weapons, along with 5 difficulties, adds tons of length to this 
 game (about 30-35 to complete all of them) .
  
  GRAPHICS (6.5/10)
  
  Well, the graphics aren't amazing, but they work. Bugs are huge and menacing, yet everything has 
 a shiny look to it. Buildings look mediocre, and crumble in a cheesy yet satisfying way after one 
 rocket shot.
  
  Environments look last gen, and you'll see the same 10 or so in all 50+ levels. But, the graphics 
 work, and don't detract from the mindless destruction.
  
  SOUND (6/10)
  
  Not really any music, and the voice-acting is insanely cheesy... which is actually good for this 
 game. Your comrades will constantly be saying hilarious stuff, like Damn Aliens, digging holes 
 in my back yard! , and other things only bad translation could provide.
  
  The sound effects are decent, such as explosions, acid sprays, and spider webs.
  
  FUN FACTOR 
 (8/10)
  
  In conclusion, EDF is worth the buy if you don't mind repetition. You can find it for around $35 
 brand new, and it's a nice way to spend an afternoon relaxing with a friend. Don't be too critical 
 over the story, voice-acting, or graphics, and you'll find a nice game that many have over-looked.

Review:  Fun, is the only word to describe this game, not really fun, not booring, not particurally exciting 
 either. this is the game you show your friend and laugh about it for hours, untill you get bord 
 of it and put it to the side while you play a better game, but i do have to admit, sometimes it 
 takes till 3 in the morning before it bores me and it gets changed.
  
  The magic and downfall of the game is its simpleness. 2 guns, walk and shoot, kill all the hundreds 
 of enemies to win, pick up pixilated 2d sprites to upgrade weapons and health. The games scale 
 is amazing, but their is not much animation to the game, and it has some occasional slowdown in 
 the crazier parts, and in later levels, greater and greater amounts of enemies, such as giant robots, 
 hover crafts, giant ants, and giant spiders, just keep comeing.
  
  Their are lots of weapons and levels, but its still admitibly shallow and uninspiring. It will 
 be worth your money as a budget title, but i wouldnt suggets getting it if your expecting gears 
 of war quality.

Review:  This game may look like a cheapy but it is awsome! There are awsome weapons to chose from (like a 
 rocket launcher that shoots 10 rockets with one pull of the trigger) . The enemies in this game are 
 pretty cool if you enjoy killing giant ants and spiders. The ants arn't very bad but the spiders 
 are a damn hassle. They can shoot their web at you and inflict serious damage at the higher difficulty 
 levels. There are also giant robots that can pretty much kill you at any difficulty level.
  
  The story of the game is kind of lame but that isnt why this game is awsome........ It is all 
 the action involved. There is never a moment in this game to where you are just sitting there doing 
 nothing. You are either killing hordes of eemies or you are running around collecting weapons and 
 armor.
  
  This game is pretty good overall so if you like games with a LOT of action then buy this game.

Review:  A must buy for anyone. Fun looking, explosive graphics. Came out for $29 and worth it by all means.... 
 Massive scale Bugs and Robots. Sometime you shoot a missle at a robot in front of you and it takes 
 almost a minute to get there because of the massive sive of these sometimes relentless GIANT ROBOTS. 
 All bugs kinds do there own thing and act more realistic than alot of characters in other games. 
 The voice is cheezy and I shut the music off but had a lot of fun with this even sometimes addicting 
 game. Lots of weapons to choose from. The makers did spend some time with this game and mixed it 
 up well. The best part is the way you feel in scale to these enoumous creatures and ships. Go BUY 
 IT, you will always want to have to pop in when you feel like it and to show anyone who hasnt seen 
 it!! Thank You

Review:  Ok take any old B movie with giant ants or anything like that. Then make it futuristic with Japaneses 
 technology and alien technology too. And then throw in some cheesy talking amongst NPCs and you 
 pretty much got this game.
  
  At first glance I saw this and was like LOL this sucks , but after being forced to play it with 
 my room mate I soon realized, ZOMG this is epic . 100's of ants and you with a M16 look alike that 
 fires thousands of rounds a minute just mows them down in a big green explosion. It has never felt 
 so good.
  
  A personal favorite of mine so far is the Giant Robots. They are all a bit different from each 
 other and take a lot more fire to kill. Also when you shoot them they start to violent flail all 
 over the place. But the first time you see them they are coming out of the water and attacking 
 the city WWII Normandy style. with the sun setting behind them you get this marvelous orange glow 
 off the water and you see these large figures out there. It just is very epic. I also love when 
 you take one down they explode with a HUGE fireball, but if another one is behind it you see them 
 walking through that Terminator 2 style.
  
  Over all its a very arcade game that you sometimes need to play to get it out of your system. The 
 game is very fun in small amounts and with a friend doing Co-op. I can't play the game more then 
 a few hours, but when you wana play it, it doesn't let you down.

Review:  So what game one really say about earth defense 2017 other than a complete waste of time. Anyone 
 who is an achievement hound do not go for this game. After playing the first ten levels of this 
 game, i thought wow this game could maybe amount to something. so i finish off level 10 and look 
 at my percentage done, wait a second here 3% that cant be right. Now i am all for a game with lots 
 of hours of game play but not one this repetitive. These bugs just kept coming, wave after wave 
 after wave. So i get to this one level and i don't know if its just me or not, but after it i could 
 have sworn the narrator had said this was the last attack on the bugs, they are defeated. So im 
 all like oh snap!! but oh no, only to find that the next level they have built nests. so i play 
 on, to destroy these nests and their queens, but wait hold the phone these un-dying bugs have kept 
 reproducing, i don't know how with all of the kings/queens dead.
  
  so after this little rant i have just went though... my basic point there was this game is very 
 very repetitive with a storyline that is so far under par. the only people who i would recommend 
 this game to.. are those under the influence only because you can destroy these gianticsoarous buildings 
 with one shot of a rocket launcher. Before i rented this game, silly me forgot to check the achievement 
 list, was that ever a mistake, you have to complete, all 54 boring and repetitive missions to get 
 only 1 stinking achievement.
  
  The only good parts about this game are that there are a wide variety of weapons that you can choose 
 from and you can fly a helicopter (and somehow not get hurt if you fall out all the way in the 
 air) . Other than that i cant really find any other OUTSTANDING features this game has.
  
  so to sum it all up, this game sucks, don't buy it, don't even consider renting it either. just 
 you know what, don't even think about it. thats only my opinion though.

Review:  Earth Defense Force 2017 Review.
  
  Gameplay: This game is just plain fun. Who doesn't like games that you get to killl giant bugs 
 and what not.
  
  Graphics: For a $40, low budget game, the graphics in this game surpised me. Though there may be 
 a glitch here and there, they are still good
  
  Sound: The sound in this game is very clear. Unfortunately, the radio and your men yelping random 
 things is very annoying bu can be delt with.
  
  Value: Xbox 360 + $40 = Great deal no matter the game.
  
  Reveiwer's Tilt: Don't know what 
 it means.
  
  Overall this game is a bang for your buck. Great deal ($40) . aND ONE OF THE BEST SHOOTERS FOR THE 
 XBOX 360.

Review:  After playing it for three hours I had to put the controler down and ask why? 
  
  The game isn't bad but its not good, its kinda somewhere in the middle. The story is a bare minimum 
 earth invasion that reads out like a fifth grader level story, not much though was put behind it. 
 The next major flop is the badies, giant ants... and spiders?!? I hate to say this but if you were 
 an alien and you were invading wouldn't you create some vicoious alien-like criter to do your bidding, 
 rather than X1,000ing a bunch of earth bugs?
  
  The other big problem is in the form of the badies ability to take damage... almost none. Just 
 about every bug or gunship you fight will be a one hit kill, or very close to a one hit kill. The 
 giant robots stand to be more of a chalange, but not by much.
  
  The graphics could have been nicer, and the fact that you can blow every building up is neat, untill 
 you realise that all your doing is turning them into cookie cutter rubble piles (that don't represent 
 the ammount of matieral that the building started with) .
  
  In short this game could have been a very serious and interesting game, it just needed some more 
 story, graphics upgrades and a small pinch of reality in it. As it stands if you want the most 
 B Movie experiance you can get, than your headed in the right direction, if you were looking for 
 a serious alien invasion game... keep looking.

Review:  You play as Strom One ( I think) a member of the Japanese EDF, and you must save the world from 
 a alien threat. Aliens are never ever friendly or want to make peace, so when they start killing 
 people and trying to wipe out cities, it's time to send them home.
  
  Ever wonder what it would be like to be in a Godzilla or giant monster movie? EDF2017 puts you 
 right in the middle of that with huge ants, spiders, robots and dinosaur type dragons. Everything 
 you see can be destroyed, and you can do it yourself. So what if you blow up a building or take 
 out your own team, just as long as you wipe out those aliens, you'll advance. EDF2017 is just a 
 fun game, the only thing lacking is co op over Xbox LIVE! I can't imagine how fun this game would 
 of been if it had LIVE co op. Yet there is co op if you have a friend over. Great fun even with 
 a friend. There will be waves after waves of enemies, so even if it was on LIVE it would crazy 
 lag, so maybe thats why they didnt make it on LIVE. Even in single player, there will be few 
 times it will have slow down. Thats just because there is so much happening, explosions, gun fire, 
 enemies running you over, so of course there will be slow down.
  
  Nothing really bad about this game, there will be lots of weapons you can use, tons to find depending 
 on the skill level you pick. Vehicles are a hit and miss, some are useful but others control so 
 horrible, you'll just crash and fight on foot anyway. In other words, this game is just fun. it 
 doesn't try to grab you with a deep story or over the top graphics. EDF2017 is a game you pick 
 up and just play for fun, isn't that what games should be?

Review:  This game is tons of fun. With loads of weapons to choose from, from rockets to grenade launchers 
 to special alien tech. It's great, you run around various areas on Earth defending it from giant 
 bugs, to even bigger robots, and flying saucers. I can play this game for hours on end and there 
 are over 60 levels in the game, I have been playing for more than a few hours and I am less than 
 20% of the way through. I would definitely recommend going out and checking out this game. The 
 splitscreen multiplayer is loads of fun, just try not to kill your buddy with a grenade or a rocket.

Review:  Earth Defense Force 2017 is an example of gameplay over looks. While it has a good share of shortcomings, 
 one cannot overlook the simple, yet addictive gameplay of killing hordes of bugs, robots, and other 
 alien baddies that make you look and feel meek in comparison. EDF 2017 harkens back to when games 
 were simpler, when you can just pick up a gun and shoot anything that moves or looks alien for 
 that matter. Even more charming is the style of the game, which seemingly borrows from those wonderful 
 50s B-movie plotlines of giant invading critters wreaking havoc on the world. Even the visuals 
 ooze 1960s Japanese campiness, reminiscent of old episodes of Ultraman or Gamera movies. Like 
 most classic shooting games, EDF 2017 is more than just a little thin on storyline. The only facts 
 that are established are that youre a nameless, half-faceless soldier in the Earth Defense Force 
 code-named Storm 1. Apparently, years ago Earth received its first communication from an Alien 
 race which humans dubbed the Reavers. While subsequent attempts to contact them back had failed, 
 its only now (in the year 2017 that is) that the Reavers have decided to pay Earth a visit as 
 giant UFOs fill the skies. While your superiors insist you stand down at first to see if the aliens 
 are peaceful, you soon learn that theyre anything but. Maybe they took offense to the name humans 
 gave them. Either way, the giant bugs end up raining down on the world, and the only force that 
 can stop them is the force that defends Earth, namely the Earth Defense Force for redundancy sake.
 
  
  Nearly everything about EDF 2017 screams budget title from the get-go. Your main character is stiff 
 as a board above the hips (even while swimming) , textures are on the generic and unimpressive side, 
 and while youll see screaming citizens at the beginning of a level, cities remain unpopulated. 
 Thats not to say that any of this takes away from the fun of pointing huge guns at huge things 
 and killing them. Moreover, most of your attention will likely be geared towards the massive amount 
 of giant monsters that are gunning to take you and your EDF comrades down. Even more impressive 
 is the over-the-top carnage that ensues during the massive battles. Stray rockets cause entire 
 buildings to crumble, or better yet, cause giant, alien dispensing UFOs to crash to the ground. 
 Keeping with the spirit of the game, however, while these effects seem impressive from afar, youll 
 notice the obvious shortcuts that the developers took to bring them to you. While a crashing UFO 
 is cool, its not as cool when it sinks into the ground without killing anything below it. The 
 ability to add a bit of strategy to the gameplay would have been awesome here, being able to time 
 when to take an alien ship down at a point where itll crash on an oncoming horde of bugs would 
 have been nothing less than boss. Heres hoping for a better-produced sequel. While its easy to 
 draw the conclusion that EDF 2017 draws all of its roots from short, but sweet arcade games is 
 misconception. The main game spans 53 gib-filled levels that are playable on five different difficulty 
 levels and mission objectives never stray past kill everything in sight. While most of your fights 
 take place in downtown Tokyo, youll also venture to beaches, mountains, and even into the pits 
 of the aliens themselves. While each level gives the illusion of being large, theres little incentive 
 to exploration. Useful items only fall from dead aliens and annoying invisible walls will hamper 
 your progress, if not throw a monkey wrench into any escape plan you devise. Enough incentive is 
 offered to play through the game multiple times, even on the horribly unforgiving hardest and 
 inferno difficulties to collect the 150 available weapons in hopes of making things easier for 
 you in levels to come. Playing on harder difficulties awards you with more powerful weapons. Youll 
 start with standard assault rifles, but soon enough youll have an arsenal of rocket launchers, 
 missiles, grenades, and some questionable experimental weapons at your disposal. Some of the higher-powered 
 weapons are neat, like a grenade launcher that fires a volley of grenades that bounce all over 
 the place. Its great for crowd control, but youd better hope youre nowhere near it when they 
 all explode. There are also vehicles available to you as you get into the game. Youll be able 
 to pilot everything from a hover bike that looks like it came right out of Return of the Jedi to 
 a mech that looks like it came right out of Aliens. There is also a tank and a helicopter, but 
 really, the vehicles dont really help to make things easier for you and end up being clunky and 
 hard to control. Even more ridiculous is that the tank can be destroyed just as quickly as the 
 hover bike, so none of these really offer you any additional protection from the alien onslaught. 
 All of your work is better done on foot. Youll also collect armor power-ups that will increase 
 your overall health permanently. provided you live to see the end of a given stage. The bugs can 
 be relentless and will try their best to surround and overwhelm you with their numbers. If you 
 try to fight, its hard to know which way to turn with bodily fluids, explosions, and giant aliens 
 all around you. The best strategy always seems to continually run backwards, keep firing, and hope 
 nothing gets in your way.
  
  The single player game will let you team up with groups of AI controlled EDF soldiers in an attempt 
 to even the odds. While your teammates can take a few baddies down with them, theyre ultimately 
 cannon fodder to both the bugs and to you as they have a horrible tendency to get in your way just 
 as you take a shot from your rocket launcher. Thankfully, local two-player co-op is available out 
 of the box to offer a little more hope for the intense battles youll be fighting. Theres also 
 a battle mode, but its neither fun nor entertaining. There are only six achievements to gain as 
 well, one for beating the game on each difficulty and one for collecting all of the weapons. A 
 little more variety would have been nice. Earth Defense Force 2017 is a great game for those who 
 dont want to be bothered by annoying puzzles and just want to sit down and kill a ton of giant 
 aliens and serves as a somewhat pleasant escape. While the straightforward gameplay, bland visuals, 
 and even blander music and voice acting may get to some, you cant argue that this game is just 
 a lot of fun. The novelty of sending buildings and ships crashing to the ground with a well-placed 
 explosive and bathing yourself in the green goo flying out of dead aliens never seems to wear thin. 
 In addition, the whole game just oozes a War of the Worlds kind of feeling that brings to life 
 everything the infamous radio broadcast tried to do back in the 40s. If you dont know what Im 
 talking about, look it up. Despite its numerous drawbacks and bland production, EDF 2017 is an 
 experience that begs to be tried once. Whether or not youll come back to it is a different thing. buy 
 it have fun

Review:  Earth Defense Force 2017's plot is simple, giant alien bug creatures have invaded Earth and it's 
 up to you, a lone solider top stop the invasion.
  
  The gameplay is about as simple as it could get, you pick 2 weapons before you play a level. Once 
 you start playing that level, you basically shoot anything that moves; that's it. There's no variation 
 in the types of missions, the objective of every level is to kill all the aliens. While this may 
 seem boring, it actually proves to be fun because that feeling of blasting away at giant 20-ft 
 bugs makes it worth while. It's not just bugs you're up against, you'll be fighting spiders, giant 
 1950's-style robots, giant walking fortresses, UFO's that drop more enemies than you already need, 
 and spaceships that literally level entire cities. There are also over 160 weapons to collect in 
 the game throughout the difficulties and there is a good variety of them top; Ranging from Assualt 
 Rifles to Shotguns to Rocket Launchers to Acid Bombs and much more.
  
  You can level up by picking up upgrades that enemies drop; like armor that increases your overall 
 health, stronger weapons, and health packs. The types of weapons you acquire vary from difficulty 
 levels (Of which there are 5) .
  
  The graphics in this game are not going to impress anyone; while some of the textures are nice 
 and the enemies look decent, the overall graphical quality of this game is not to blow anyone away. 
 Still, there are worse looking games on the 360.
  
  On a side note, I want to point out the the number of enemies that appear on screen without a dip 
 in framerate is a pretty notable accomplishment, however once the lasers and acid start flying 
 that's when the frame-rate really dips.
  
  The sound effects and voice acting are I think the game's weakpoint, alot of the weapons feel extremely 
 under-powered and some even sound the same. The voice acting is also extremely atrocious, the soliders 
 you fight along side don't sound enthusiastic and just sound boring and bland. The sound made by 
 the bugs whenever you kill them sound the same and after killing maybe a few hundred of the bugs, 
 it will start to get really old. The voice acting by your commander and anaylst are OK, but not 
 great.
  
  The redeeming quality that gives this game value is the achievements, once you beat all the levels 
 on a certain difficulty, you'll want to play the next difficulty for even more points. A word of 
 caution to those looking for easy points, it'll take you a long time before you get all 1000. I 
 say this because for the first 2 difficulty settings it's pretty easy.
  
  However, once you go into hard mode the difficulty all of a sudden cranks up along with it too, 
 so be sure to collect plenty of new weapons and armor before you attempt it.
  
  If I had a choice, I would rename this game Earth Defense Farce 2017 , because this game doesn't 
 take itself too seriously and that's fine. The fact that it doesn't take itself seriously is what 
 i think sets it apart from the rest. If you ever get a chance to rent this game, I would recommend 
 you do so as it is well worth a rental.... or 2.

Review:  Earth Defense Force 2017 is a sub par game that squeezes past with mediocre graphics, a barely 
 passable frame rate, terrible controls, a rather useless camera, monotonous gameplay and a story 
 on a string. Yet somehow it succeeds at being a highly entertaining game.
  
  What makes this game so fun in spite of itself is it's B movie like atmosphere. Like all enjoyable 
 B movies the bad parts of the game are almost entertaining because they are expected. The premise 
 of EDF 2017 is a simple one. You take control of a nameless generic looking trooper in the Storm 
 1 squad of the Earth Defense Force. This global force was put together when alien ships were discovered 
 to be heading towards us, and on the off chance they weren't friendly, we stand prepared.
  
  So the game plays this out over 53 almost identical missions fighting in 3rd person accross 
 Tokyo city, the Japanese country side, and the occasional cave level. Throughout these missions 
 over 150 weapons are available for you to collect from your fallen foes to use in later battles. 
 Although many of these are mearly upgraded versions of your starting batch, without that much variety. 
 For each mission you can equip up to 2 of these weapons from your gathered collection, switching 
 on the fly while fighting. The categories vary from rocket launchers to flame throwers and assault 
 rifles, all of which are more suited for some enemies then others.
  
  Like all good B movie inspired entertainment, the aforementioned enemies are cheesy beyond compare. 
 Initially the UFO's will drop giant ants that crawl up buildings and spit bright orange acid at 
 you and your fellow EDF team mates. But as the game goes on the units vary to giant robots straight 
 from the 1950 toy market, as well as smaller space ships and 50 feet long spiders.
  
  Boss fights are some of the more interesting part of the game, with 4 legged fortress's and giant 
 mecha dinasaurs who seem like lost relatives of godzilla. The sense of scale with these skyscraper 
 tall monsters is hugely impressive, though it can create lag at times.
  
  To fight some of these more daunting opponents there are vehicles scattered around in which you 
 can leap into at your leisure. I would reccomend however that you don't. While the controls for 
 your character are clumsy but passable adding to the atmosphere. The vehicle controls are down 
 right near unusable, and for some reason the target sight gets taken away when you are in one. 
 so alot of guess work for aiming.
  
  The story of the game, what little there is, is told through radio trassmissions you here while 
 fighting the larger then life fancy dress costume monsters. Along side this you will also occasionally 
 here chatter from the EDF members fighting along side you, though it is limited and tends to repeat 
 itself.
  The music slams itself straight out of something like killer robots from Mars and has the eirie 
 UFO kind of impression throughout it, fitting the theme of the game. Though for most of it, it 
 is only that one track that seems to play and is easily forgettable
  
  Graphically this game, for a budget title is actually not all that bad. But they certainly won't 
 blow you away either. The areas you run around in are huge, and everything in the environment is 
 fully destructable, from buildings to trees and lamposts. If you blow it up, it will come crashing 
 down. Some of the metal and water effects are also quite nice, however there is no ripple when 
 running through the water and textures are not very detailed on well... anything.
  
  As for replay value? well aside from the length of time it takes to complete 53 missions, you have 
 to do it 5 times on all difficulties and collect all the weapons for the games 6 achievements. 
 And believe me this game gets hard the higher up in level you try. The only way to complete the 
 game on Inferno is to increase your character hit points alot from the armour icons that enemies 
 drop. And that can be time consuming....
  There is also a two player co-op mode, which aside from having a friend playing split screen with 
 you to cause bug blood havoc doesn't change the game at all. And there is no online mode to keep 
 that full view either.
  
  Overall EDF is a highly entertaining game with some great ideas that can be very challenging. Flawed 
 yes, reeking of cheese and tacky biscuits yes, but a blast all the same. Worth at least a rental.

Review:  D3 did a wonderful job making this game a absolutely fun to play. EDF 2017 brings you into a not 
 too distant future as an officer in the Earth Defense Force defending the world from aliens. The 
 aliens come in a few different shapes and sizes such as huge ants and spiders or giant robots and 
 alien gunships. The environments in the game are destructible letting you blast a building just 
 to take out a huge ant that is crawling on it. The variety of weapons you find during gameplay 
 is huge with choices ranging from assault rifles to missile launchers. The graphics and sound are 
 good, not spectacular, but good, but the gameplay is what really makes this game. With options 
 for single player play, two player co-op via split screen, or online with Xbox Live you can play 
 solo or share the fun with friends. Overall this is a great game, the price is still a bit high 
 but it will come down in time. I would highly recommend this game for anybody.

Review:  Earth Defense Force 2017 for the Xbox 360 is a strange game. You are an unnamed solider in the 
 Earth Defense Force, tasked with helping to fend off an alien invasion with it's thousands of giant 
 bugs the size of houses and skyscraper-size robots with laser cannons as big as the robot itself. 
 You play through a series of 50 levels, with several different areas.
  
  EDF 2017 plays like an old arcade game in the local pizzeria. All you really need to know is how 
 to use the two thumb sticks and the right trigger. As you play, you unload (literally) tons of 
 ammunition into legions of enemies that will completely fill up the screen and soon will be released 
 with gallons upon gallons of blood that would drown you if it where real. As for the vehicles, 
 they are garbage. You will do your best to stay out of them since they are ultra-difficult to control.
 
  
  The graphics of EDF are just like the B-Movies it's passed on. So surreal that it is actually pretty 
 funny. The buildings are bland, the soldiers are plain and the bugs are not extremely detailed. 
 You can also easily destroy entire skyscrapers with a single grenade. While the buildings do look 
 OK when they are falling, the residue does not stay and simply disappears after just a few seconds. 
 This does make sense though because, if all the corpses and buildings stayed in their resting place, 
 then it would be impossible to navigate the levels. But I do have to say that the robots are the 
 high point of the game, graphics wise. The look all shiny, the lasers they shoot look nice and 
 they have some great explosions which you see a lot.
  
  After playing Earth Defense Force 2017, I can say that this game is not going to be a mainstream 
 game. While the vehicles are trash, the on-foot areas are some of the most exhilarating and enjoyable 
 moments of a game I have played for a long time. I suggest you rent EDF, because it is a game that 
 you will most likely enjoy. It is perhaps one of the best budget games to come out in a long time.

Review:  I picked up a copy and inserted into my 360... I haven't stopped play it since. Running through 
 the city with machineguns, grenade &amp; rocket launchers blowing up giant ants and robots. It's 
 an absolute blast.
  
  As you progress through the game, you keep unlocking more weapons. There's a huge variety and some 
 weapons are great fun to use. The robot turrets are great to watch mow down mass flocks of ants. 
 Sniper rifles are great for taking down the bigger enemies like the Walking Arms.
  
  The number of enemy types is pretty small, as is the variety of environments. But each level still 
 brings its own unique situation to play through. The later levels are pretty crazy in how many 
 enemies and explosions are happening at once. It drags the 360 down trying to keep up with all 
 the action, but you don't care. It feels like playing Guerrilla War on the old NES.
  
  Taking out the walking robots and UFOs has to be one of the most pleasing experiences in the game. 
 When they go boom, then really go boom.
  
  The fact the entire city can be leveled is awesome. But I often find I'm responsible for more destruction 
 than the aliens themselves.
  
  The squad that follows you around isn't the smartest AI in the world. They have no problem keeping 
 up with you as you run through the world. But sometimes they have a habit of walking in front of 
 you which is a bad idea when you're firing rockets. The blast tends to take out the squaddie and 
 yourself. They also get too close to the enemy and are often caught in explosions when you start 
 lobbing grenades.
  
  However, the dialog is hilarious. There's definitely some engrish translation issues but it just 
 adds to the charm. E-D-F!!! YEEAAAHHH!!!

Review:  This game is not bad.... but its not good either. This games gameplay is rather simple and can 
 get borin awful fast. Its just runnin around and shootin random ants , spiders , and giant robots. 
 and its not very realistic either considering that u can blow up a buildin and then walk through 
 the rubble. Now the graphics in this game are a bit on the low side and they dont look that great. 
 The only thing that kinda looks cool are the giant insects. But even then when they die sumtimes 
 there dead body is just layin there and it looks like plastic. but once again as i say in all my 
 reviews the sound was good. especially exploding bugs. Now the only thing that i like about this 
 game is that its stupid and that makes it a bit fun.

Review:  There is nothing more fun to watch than a cheesy 50's monster movie. Not only is it enjoyable, 
 but it's also funny and timeless. Thats what EDF is; you have to take it with a grain of salt, 
 but it is truly Them turned into a game. The graphics are a little dated, but, honestly, you won't 
 really care. You'll want to play it over and over. the only downside is that the achievements are 
 kinda lame and some of the weapons are annoyingly hard to get. But, overall, at less than 40 dollars, 
 EDF:2017 is a great buy for sci-fi and Mystery Science Theater 3000 lovers alike.

Review:  Earth Defense Force 2017, developed by Sandlot and published by D3, is a clumsy, ugly, messy, and 
 in some ways disgraceful third person shooter for the Xbox 360, but despite all its flaws, it still 
 delivers on the most important principal in videogames: its really fun.
  EDFs graphics are downright horrendous. The game looks, on standard definition, no better than 
 an average PS2 or Xbox game. Textures, animations, and style all fall flat in this game, but somehow, 
 it doesnt cripple the fun too much. In fact, there are times when the garage-game style graphics 
 can be kind of charming; seeing a building not slowly crumble, but instantly shatter with the blast 
 of a rocket does deliver a certain satisfaction. The bugs die the same way. Doing enough damage 
 to them causes them to pop, like a balloon, and out flies the blood which is a ridiculous green 
 or brown color depending on the enemy. Who knows weather this was caused by low budget, or creative 
 choice (I would suspect the first theory) but either way, these ridiculous graphics end up being 
 laughably good. The game play is much the same. A typical few seconds in EDF might involve seeing 
 a building with giant ants crawling on it, blasting it with a rocket, seeing it shatter to pieces, 
 running through the destroyed buildings remnants (yes through, the collision detection on some 
 parts is literally non existent) and watching destroyed bugs err aliens pop right out of the screen. 
 This formula, with a few variables doesnt ever really get old, and its a wonder how, considering 
 how terrible the games controls are. EDF uses four shoulder buttons, two analog sticks, a pause 
 button, and the back button. Right trigger shoots, right bumper switches guns, left bumper acts 
 as a scope on select guns, and the left trigger is a jump/dive button. The controls, while clunky 
 get the job done. Shooting a gun usually feels pretty good, but the real problems come in when 
 using the left trigger. Mapping diving and jumping to the same button was a terrible idea, and 
 there is no way to customize this control otherwise. No explanation is really needed to see why 
 it doesnt work, but the reason the left trigger fails is because it is difficult to input when 
 to jump and when to dodge. Eventually, an instinct is developed when it is discovered that moving 
 up or down jumps in that direction, and moving left, right, or any other diagonal direction initiates 
 a dive. Obviously, this makes jumping left or right impossible, and relying on control of the sticks 
 becomes an important part of mastering the game.
  One of the best things EDF has going for it is its value, which is strange considering this, just 
 like every other aspect of the game seems cheap. While it doesnt offer versus multiplayer, unlockable 
 outfits, developer videos, and only marginal unlockable content, it does have 53 levels and 5 difficulties 
 ranging from easy to inferno. There is a very very light RPG element in the game as well (sorry 
 no character customization) . During the levels, enemies drop health, bigger health, armor and weapons. 
 The two health packs are used immediately, while the armor and weapons are added to the character 
 after the level is completed. This means that if a difficult level comes up, the player can go 
 back and build his character up to have an easier time with the level. Another added to the value 
 of the game is its price tag: only forty bucks. Not bad considering the number of levels, variable 
 difficulty, and the fact that there is a two player co-op option. While all this value is great, 
 one of the most disappointing things, especially for achievement junkies, is how poorly designed 
 the achievements are. There are 6 achievements, five for completing the game on a difficulty (one 
 for easy, one for normal, etc.) and one more for collecting all the weapons. Considering the game 
 takes a little more than ten hours to complete, these achievements are only going to go to the 
 most hardcore players. Getting even one of them is an accomplishment given the amount of time it 
 takes (again, a ten hour game) .
  Once again following EDFs pattern of pathetically conceived and executed, but somehow amiable 
 is the games generic story. Aliens, all coincidentally shaped like ants and spiders, have invaded 
 the earth. Armed with deadly robots, space ships, and cyber-dinosaurs they plan to kill everyone. 
 Why? Who knows, who cares? The way it is executed is very much in the same style as an old Godzilla 
 movie. It consists of screaming people running about, giant aliens, annoying teammates, and an 
 equally as annoying mystery woman barking commands over a walkie-talkie. In the end the story is 
 trivial and unimportant, but the brief cutscenes can be pretty funny.
  Earth Defense Force gets it right where it counts. The game is fun. It may not have the glossy 
 graphics, on the edge of your seat story, or spandex tight game play as some of its competition, 
 but then again, not as many games allow for as much enjoyment as EDF. The game is kind of like 
 the worlds ugliest dog. Yeah, its disgusting, but for some reason, you cant stop playing with 
 it.

Review:  Few games have invoked in me such awe and mirth such as this. Literally every one whom I have showed 
 this game to and/or played it with said it was the best game they have ever played. Why? Though 
 it differs greatly from the original the basic premise is still the same. You verses seemingly 
 insurmountable odds.
  Yes it has been done before but not like this. There is nothing like being in a fairly detailed 
 fully destructible city with a friend, both of you with your weapons of choice (150+ weapons in 
 game!!!) Looking down the street and seeing the sky go dark with hundreds of cool shiny space crafts, 
 or seeing giant spiders as far as the eye can see scurrying and leaping from building to building 
 and firing a huge guided missile, or grenade, or shotgun-etc into the mass of them. The is not 
 trying to be serious, it is just simply an arcade game, yet it is so much more. You play on foot 
 or in one of the many vehicles thrown in to a good many levels, the likes of which handle surprisingly 
 well for a game such is this (much better than the pathetic motorcycle in Call of Duty 3) . This 
 is all done in a third person view, but the controls and aiming in the game are as solid and easy 
 to manipulate as Call of Duty 2, if not easier. The graphics are arcade like too, not ultra realistic, (pretty 
 close though) but definitely next-gen material. For what it is you ca'nt be too critical because 
 it is not trying to be like any other mainstream, hyped up game like Halo, Gears of War, etc. It 
 is one of the few stand-alone titles out there that is extremely stupendous and sadly overlooked 
 by many.
  Earth Defense Force is like a phenomenal over the top Meteor shower. Only a select few are lucky 
 enough to witness the event, some may hear about it and dismiss it quickly, others may look at 
 it later and say huh, thats kind of cool , but those who were actually there will appreciate it 
 and remember it forever.

Review:  Earth Defense Force 2017 is an example of gameplay over looks. While it has a good share of shortcomings, 
 one cannot overlook the simple, yet addictive gameplay of killing hordes of bugs, robots, and other 
 alien baddies that make you look and feel meek in comparison. EDF 2017 harkens back to when games 
 were simpler, when you can just pick up a gun and shoot anything that moves or looks alien for 
 that matter. Even more charming is the style of the game, which seemingly borrows from those wonderful 
 50s B-movie plotlines of giant invading critters wreaking havoc on the world. Even the visuals 
 ooze 1960s Japanese campiness, reminiscent of old episodes of Ultraman or Gamera movies. Like 
 most classic shooting games, EDF 2017 is more than just a little thin on storyline. The only facts 
 that are established are that youre a nameless, half-faceless soldier in the Earth Defense Force 
 code-named Storm 1. Apparently, years ago Earth received its first communication from an Alien 
 race which humans dubbed the Reavers. While subsequent attempts to contact them back had failed, 
 its only now (in the year 2017 that is) that the Reavers have decided to pay Earth a visit as 
 giant UFOs fill the skies. While your superiors insist you stand down at first to see if the aliens 
 are peaceful, you soon learn that theyre anything but. Maybe they took offense to the name humans 
 gave them. Either way, the giant bugs end up raining down on the world, and the only force that 
 can stop them is the force that defends Earth, namely the Earth Defense Force for redundancy sake.
 
  
  Nearly everything about EDF 2017 screams budget title from the get-go. Your main character is stiff 
 as a board above the hips (even while swimming) , textures are on the generic and unimpressive side, 
 and while youll see screaming citizens at the beginning of a level, cities remain unpopulated. 
 Thats not to say that any of this takes away from the fun of pointing huge guns at huge things 
 and killing them. Moreover, most of your attention will likely be geared towards the massive amount 
 of giant monsters that are gunning to take you and your EDF comrades down. Even more impressive 
 is the over-the-top carnage that ensues during the massive battles. Stray rockets cause entire 
 buildings to crumble, or better yet, cause giant, alien dispensing UFOs to crash to the ground. 
 Keeping with the spirit of the game, however, while these effects seem impressive from afar, youll 
 notice the obvious shortcuts that the developers took to bring them to you. While a crashing UFO 
 is cool, its not as cool when it sinks into the ground without killing anything below it. The 
 ability to add a bit of strategy to the gameplay would have been awesome here, being able to time 
 when to take an alien ship down at a point where itll crash on an oncoming horde of bugs would 
 have been nothing less than boss. Heres hoping for a better-produced sequel. While its easy to 
 draw the conclusion that EDF 2017 draws all of its roots from short, but sweet arcade games is 
 misconception. The main game spans 53 gib-filled levels that are playable on five different difficulty 
 levels and mission objectives never stray past kill everything in sight. While most of your fights 
 take place in downtown Tokyo, youll also venture to beaches, mountains, and even into the pits 
 of the aliens themselves. While each level gives the illusion of being large, theres little incentive 
 to exploration. Useful items only fall from dead aliens and annoying invisible walls will hamper 
 your progress, if not throw a monkey wrench into any escape plan you devise. Enough incentive is 
 offered to play through the game multiple times, even on the horribly unforgiving hardest and 
 inferno difficulties to collect the 150 available weapons in hopes of making things easier for 
 you in levels to come. Playing on harder difficulties awards you with more powerful weapons. Youll 
 start with standard assault rifles, but soon enough youll have an arsenal of rocket launchers, 
 missiles, grenades, and some questionable experimental weapons at your disposal. Some of the higher-powered 
 weapons are neat, like a grenade launcher that fires a volley of grenades that bounce all over 
 the place. Its great for crowd control, but youd better hope youre nowhere near it when they 
 all explode. There are also vehicles available to you as you get into the game. Youll be able 
 to pilot everything from a hover bike that looks like it came right out of Return of the Jedi to 
 a mech that looks like it came right out of Aliens. There is also a tank and a helicopter, but 
 really, the vehicles dont really help to make things easier for you and end up being clunky and 
 hard to control. Even more ridiculous is that the tank can be destroyed just as quickly as the 
 hover bike, so none of these really offer you any additional protection from the alien onslaught. 
 All of your work is better done on foot. Youll also collect armor power-ups that will increase 
 your overall health permanently. provided you live to see the end of a given stage. The bugs can 
 be relentless and will try their best to surround and overwhelm you with their numbers. If you 
 try to fight, its hard to know which way to turn with bodily fluids, explosions, and giant aliens 
 all around you. The best strategy always seems to continually run backwards, keep firing, and hope 
 nothing gets in your way.
  
  The single player game will let you team up with groups of AI controlled EDF soldiers in an attempt 
 to even the odds. While your teammates can take a few baddies down with them, theyre ultimately 
 cannon fodder to both the bugs and to you as they have a horrible tendency to get in your way just 
 as you take a shot from your rocket launcher. Thankfully, local two-player co-op is available out 
 of the box to offer a little more hope for the intense battles youll be fighting. Theres also 
 a battle mode, but its neither fun nor entertaining. There are only six achievements to gain as 
 well, one for beating the game on each difficulty and one for collecting all of the weapons. A 
 little more variety would have been nice. Earth Defense Force 2017 is a great game for those who 
 dont want to be bothered by annoying puzzles and just want to sit down and kill a ton of giant 
 aliens and serves as a somewhat pleasant escape. While the straightforward gameplay, bland visuals, 
 and even blander music and voice acting may get to some, you cant argue that this game is just 
 a lot of fun. The novelty of sending buildings and ships crashing to the ground with a well-placed 
 explosive and bathing yourself in the green goo flying out of dead aliens never seems to wear thin. 
 In addition, the whole game just oozes a War of the Worlds kind of feeling that brings to life 
 everything the infamous radio broadcast tried to do back in the 40s. If you dont know what Im 
 talking about, look it up. Despite its numerous drawbacks and bland production, EDF 2017 is an 
 experience that begs to be tried once. Whether or not youll come back to it is a different thing.

Review:  This game is a blast to play, shoot the hell out of everything simple enough. Destroy the giant 
 ants, Robots, spaceships and the odd Dina-mech. This type of gameplay is good for zoning out, for 
 a couple of hours. The voice acting is very hoeky but somehow suits the game which is cheesey to 
 start with. In this instance all this stuff works well. one of those rare instance where something 
 is so awful that it is stangely fun. a great co op game to play on a rainy afternoon. An easy all-nighter. 
 This will never ever be a choice for game of the year. If you like Godzilla films then you'll like 
 this game.

Review:  Your an unnamed soldier in the newly created E. D. F - Earth Defense Force - and your mission to 
 stop the alien invasion that has been happening all around the world.
  
  Its a 3rd person shooter with about 53 missions tied into it's campaign. You'll find yourself running 
 around with a certain number of soldiers fighting unbelievable odds. Throughout the battles you 
 can collect these 2D power ups which will either give you more health for the next mission or different 
 weapons. The weapons are anything from assault rifles and shotguns to rocket launchers, grenades, 
 and special weapons . As a soldier, you are given the ability to not only run, but jump and roll 
 as well... Oh, and you can also drive tanks, helicopters, air bikes (blarf..) and these robotic 
 assault suits, although the controlling for all of these are horrendous. Additionally, you can 
 play Co-Op with a friend through out the entire game, but saldy there is no X-Box Live multiplayer. 
 How can you make a game nowadays and not have online multiplayer?
  
  Moving on, you'll fight hordes of enemies. The enemies include black &amp; red ants that shoot 
 either fire or acid at you, gigantic robots who fire plasma rockets, jumping spiders who shoot 
 poisionus webs, a gigantic Godzilla rip off, and many more. Each of these villans are atleast 50 
 feet high and are all pretty interesting to fight... except after about 15 missions you are going 
 to wish for some variety in it.
  
  The difficulty in this game is, at points, ridiculously hard to the point where its almost impossible.. 
 and I'm only talking on normal difficulty. Easy is just that, easy. Anything above normal is unbeatable, 
 and my hat is off to anyone who accomplishes that task. I mean, me and my buddy were playing co-op 
 on Inferno - the hardest difficulty - on the first stage and it took us 4 rockets from the strongest 
 launcher to kill ONE ant. Imagine fighting the robots.
  
  There are a lot of glitches and bugs in this game. For instance, sometimes you'll get stuck under 
 debris, or fall into a ditch and get stuck there. Or better yet, roll right into a building and 
 get stuck there.. its really frustrating but I mean the game is only something like $30 so what 
 do you really expect.
  
  Earth Defense Force's ending was atrocious. You beat the mother ship, and then are awarded with 
 a text box saying how the E. D. F. are killing off the rest of the aliens and then CONGRATULATIONS 
 ......... wow.
  
  The achievements aren't even good. Basically its just to collect every power up, and beat the game 
 on each difficulty. What the....
  
  The graphics are alright, they aren't really eye candy but they arent really an eye sore. The characters 
 all look the same, and the enemies look the same, but the environments are completley destructable 
 and the explosions are awesome.
  
  Moving on, we are up to the sound. The music is garbage, end of story. The voices are all unenthused 
 and the screams when your troops die are hilariously bad, such as ... Ahh. Too funny. However, once 
 again, the explosions sound really cool and the guns sound like their real life counterparts so 
 thats a good thing. Overall though, the cons outweigh the good.
  
  In conclusion, although Earth Defense Force achieves the arcade feel, it comes with an overally 
 lengthy game, unvaried &amp; linear missions, annoying glitches, and many more. I do recommend 
 that you play it with a friend for maybe an hour, but no more. 6.2 outta 10.

Review:  Plot: The year is 2017, and the EDF short for Earth Defense Force, is fighting to save the earth 
 from an alien force known as the Ravagers.
  
  Gameplay: EDF 2017 is an extremely basic shooter going back to the good old days of crappy sci-fi 
 shooters. It is a third person large environment wander-round. Most of the levels take place in 
 cities, mountainous areas, and or coast lines. The enemies of the antagonist force know as the 
 Ravagers vary. Most of their ground troops consist of Army ants and web launching tarantulas, these 
 guys reminded me of the old sci-fi movie Them , which was about giant ants attacking the surface 
 of earth, so this game was definitely reaching. As the game progresses the enemies become more 
 and more bothersome. The toughest being giant metallic men who are bristling with plasma mortars 
 and machine guns that have the ability to ruin yo shiznit . There are also aerial enemies, which 
 mostly consist of large gremlin looking gunships that fire wide spray lasers. I also forgot to 
 mention the large spaceships that will often drop more enemies from above. From time to time you 
 will also fight bosses, as in any game. However, these bosses look like something right from a 
 freaking godzilla movie, Toei is probably going to sue someone. The bosses varied to huge zilla 
 dinosaurs called, Vallak dino mechs to large queen ants that spit jets of molten lava. Finally 
 at the end of the game, you fight the large Death staresque mothership that has the ability to 
 turn cities into craters.
  
  Other stuff: To often overcome the hoards of enemies that break upon you like waves on rocks, you 
 are given vehicles. These vehicles include tanks, helicopters (blarf) , jet bikes (boo) , and heavily 
 armed exosuits. Most will come in handy, for the few seconds that you'll have them, because it 
 seems that most of the vehicles are covered in the extremely weak armour called Cardboardium . 
 Versatile indeed. What makes this game really fun is that most of the environments are destructible, 
 so instead of letting the enemies take our cities, my friends and I often turned them into smoking 
 rubble, most satisfying. I also forgot to mention that in this game you are actually leading squads 
 of EDF soliders. But, for your safety, it would be best to kill them immediately because they have 
 no sense of aim, and most of them time they often kill eachother. It is quite funny though, that 
 as their flaming bodies crumple to the ground, they still scream EDF, EDF! 
  
  Final points: If you want a game that just consits of shooting at lots of enemies with lots of 
 weapons, I would say get this game. But, if you want a game with an in depth plot, and lots of 
 character development, then...... look elsewhere.

Review:  2013: alien life is confirmed. 2015: after numerous failed attempts to contact this alien life, 
 the Earth Defence Force is formed in the event of a hostile invasion. 2017: waves of alien forces 
 invade Earth and threaten humanitys existence. The EDF is deployed. Earth Defence Force 2017 places 
 you in control of a nameless EDF soldier in humanitys attempt to exterminate the extraterrestrials. 
 The games setting is very reminiscent of the sci-fi action flick Starship Troopers as youll 
 be blasting your way through swarms of bugs and much, much more.
  
  Each of the fifty-plus levels tasks you with eliminating all of the aliens on the map, and youre 
 spoilt for choice when it comes to firepower. There are more than one-hundred and fifty weapons 
 to collect which are subdivided into various groups, such as rocket launchers, assault rifles, 
 and grenade launchers. Weapons are differentiated by power, clip capacity, and reload time to name 
 a few, which gives each gun its own distinct feel. You can only carry two weapons so you need to 
 choose the right ones to suit the mission, especially since you cant change them during the level.
 
  
  EDF is very simple to play, even if you arent familiar with third-person shooters. The simple 
 control scheme that requires only the analog sticks and shoulder buttons means anyone can jump 
 in and have fun, although you can customise the button layout more specifically if you want. Some 
 missions allow you to pilot vehicles like a helicopter or tank, but unfortunately these controls 
 are not on the same level as those of your soldier. Manoeuvring is tricky thanks to the clunky 
 controls and youre probably better off going at it on foot. The heads-up display consists of your 
 health bar, radar, and your currently equipped weapon. Your health bar can be increased by collecting 
 armour power-ups which are randomly dropped when you kill an alien. The radar displays enemy units, 
 allied units, and power-ups (armour, health, and new weapons) through colour-coded circles; it 
 does its job well as youll find yourself constantly referring to it. Finally, the weapon display 
 shows how much ammo your current clip has before you need to reload.
  
  The sense of scale in EDF is quite fantastic. The amount of aliens on-screen can be overwhelming 
 and it really does feel like the world is being invaded. These invaders take many different forms 
 that include oversized insects that spit burning acid, ruthless robots armed with rifles, and menacing 
 motherships that deploy legions of aliens. Its nice to see a great deal of variation in the enemy 
 design, but its a shame they dont take a bit more thought to dispatch. Its simply a case of 
 lining up the targeting reticule and hitting the fire button; this is even more prevalent because 
 you have unlimited ammo. Despite this, EDF is certainly a challenging game. There are five difficulty 
 levels to test yourself on, and things really get messy on the highest difficulty. Playing through 
 on a lower difficulty is almost required as the weapons and armour gained there will help you make 
 it through the hardest levels.
  
  The lack of Xbox Live support is disappointing, but the local co-op mode is well crafted. You can 
 load your single player game data and play co-op perfectly fine; there is no interference with 
 your single player campaign. Youll be playing split-screen which slightly hampers your range of 
 vision, but the difference is negligible. An extra gun is very helpful on the higher difficulties 
 when the swarms become more and more aggressive, so co-op is a welcome addition. If youre more 
 of a lone wolf, there is a split-screen battle mode that pits you against a friend. Its just like 
 a normal level except there are no aliens and you have to defeat a human opponent. Its a decent 
 edition, but it could have been fleshed out far more by giving the player more levels to choose 
 from and including four player split-screen support.
  
  From the audiovisual standpoint, EDF is fairly unremarkable, but that isnt surprising considering 
 this is a budget title. Most of the game is spent in a generic cityscape environment with a few 
 missions in other places, like giant ant tunnels. The textures and resolution arent very impressive, 
 and EDF certainly isnt pushing the Xbox 360 to its limit. You can destroy buildings with rocket 
 launchers and watch them crumble (although that isnt defending the Earth very well!) , but they 
 all destruct in the same way which is quite uninspiring. If there is one visually impressive feature 
 of EDF, it is without doubt the large enemies you are tasked with defeating. The giant robots and 
 motherships look quite impressive, and the visual effects of their plasma cannon weapons are very 
 flashy.
  
  The background music is very weak and not at all memorable, and the tinny sound effects arent 
 much better. Voice acting is present through your fellow EDF soldiers and the regular radio broad 
 casts that give you an update on the situation. Some of the lines are so ridiculous that its hilarious. 
 You cant help but laugh at some of the comments you hear in the heat of battle. As for the radio 
 broadcasts, they usually just state the obvious. Its kind of pointless to inform an EDF soldier 
 that the city is under attack while he is fighting off the threat!
  
  EDF may be a budget title, but dont think youll be able to make a quick one-thousand achievement 
 points. There are a grand total of six achievements; there is one awarded for completing the game 
 on each difficulty and an achievement for collecting every weapon. If youre up for the challenge, 
 you could easily spend more than sixty hours and still be hunting a couple of achievements.
  
  As a third-person shooter, Earth Defence Force 2017 isnt particularly impressive. The simple 
 point-and-shoot gameplay mechanics dont change throughout the game and there certainly isnt enough 
 here to say that the audiovisuals are up to standard. However, if you take EDF 2017 as it is, a 
 bundle of cheap thrills that will last for hours, you certainly cant call it a failure. There 
 is something simple and charming about blasting buildings and bugs to bits without the fear of 
 running out of ammunition, and the ability to double up the firepower in co-op doesnt hurt one 
 bit.

Review:  Before you read this review, I should probably tell you that this game was originally released 
 in Japan, so a lot of the game isnt going to make any sense, but thats ok. AnyhowAre you bored 
 of Lost Planet? Looking for another exciting Third Person Shooter for the 360? Then Earth Defense 
 Force: 2017 is probably your game. EDF is a very basic shooter. You go into combat, shoot every 
 last gigantic bug or robot in sight, end mission. There isnt much of a story here, except that 
 giant bug-like aliens have invaded earth. Are they are our friendsOr Foes? Well, the government 
 nicknamed the aliens Ravagers. Take a wild guess Like I said, the gameplay is as simple as it 
 can get. Before you start a mission, youll have to select two weapons to fight with. Pick carefully, 
 because even a tiny hand grenade counts as a weapon. No matter what weapon you pick (with a few 
 exceptions) , every weapon has unlimited ammo. Sound fun yet? It is. And thats where EDF shines, 
 its just plain fun. You can even play the campaign with a friend. My only complaint with the campaign 
 is that you cant play it online. I think it could be really cool if you could get nine friends 
 (squads in EDF consist of 10 soldiers) and just dominate the campaign online with voice chat and 
 stuff.
  
  So whats bad about the game, you ask? Well, a lot. Let me start off by saying that this game has 
 a lot of bugs. Yes, giant living room sized bugs that destroy cities, but also gameplay bugs. Once 
 in a while, you will come across a bug that will probably force you to restart a mission. One time, 
 I was in a tank blowing up huge spiders, when I was taking a lot of damage. I decided to get out, 
 because I didnt want the tank to blow up with me inside it. Well, when I exited the tank, I was 
 back as a soldier, but I was stuck inside the tank, and couldnt move. When I tried to kill myself, 
 my shots just flew through everything, forcing me to restart. Enough with the bugsso how about 
 graphics? Well, the graphics are VERY basic. Sure, the explosions are nice, but EDF looks like 
 a regular Xbox game. As for the sound, let me just say that EDF should win the award for worst 
 dialogue and possibly voice acting (Sonic the Hedgehog is definitely in that race) in any video 
 game, ever. The dialogue is so bad in EDF; half of it doesnt make sense at all! In one level, 
 a gargantuan four legged fortress of destruction with a 300 foot plasma cannon marched its way 
 toward Japan, blowing away everything in sight. One soldier from my Storm Team said, How can that 
 thing move so fast when its walking so slow? WTF??!?! What does that mean? A lot of the times, 
 your squad will cheer for random things. Once, a soldier said, Quit wasting ammo. and the rest 
 of the squad  like they were a bunch of war bound Spartans. 
 I also heard them scream uncontrollably like that when they were told to follow the captain. Even 
 with a lot of problems, EDF is still a really fun game. Its just awesome shooting up giant bugs 
 from outer space with over 150 weapons and stuff. Think of EDF as a buttery waffle. You wake up 
 one morning and decide to have a waffle. You know what to expect: its tasty, but youve had it 
 hundreds of times before. So you put it in the waffle iron and power on your DS and play Pokemon 
 Diamond (or Pearl, whatever) while you wait. After 10 minutes of taking on the Battle Tower Challenge, 
 you forgot you were cooking a waffle. You rush to the kitchen, open the waffle iron, and found 
 out youve burned your waffle a little. Sure, its still tasty and buttery; its just not as good 
 because its burnt. EDF is like a slightly burnt waffle: Its a fun TPS, you know what to expect 
 out of it, theres just a few too many problems with it.

Review:  When I dreamed of the next generation of games, I dreamed of two things. Firstly there was the 
 idea of truly open, involving games. Games that let you walk through any door, talk to any character, 
 go ape with a machine gun and feel guilty later. Games of exploration, involvement and genuine 
 excitement. Alas this sort of game has yet to really emerge. We're looking at Mass Effect for that 
 one...
  
  The second type of game I dreamed of was one where everything was cool and spectacular. EDF is 
 this sort of game.
  
  The game is big. It's special. It's fun! Never before has a feel of invasion been so perfectly 
 brought to the medium - not even Dead Rising gave this impression of a familiar world overrun with 
 the unfamiliar and the hostile. You can read the other reviews here for descriptions of just how 
 much fun this game is, and how cool it is sniping giant spiders off of skyscrapers.
  
  But my concern is with the games magazines that reviewed this poorly. They all seem to be singing 
 from the same sheet - as if one magazine said it wasn't very good and the others just jumped on 
 the bandwagon (lazy hacks...) .
  
  You get the feeling that they looked at the budget price and thought 'oh, that's not going to be 
 very good, then'. And that's how they wrote the review. God forbid they actually play the game 
 and let themselves enjoy it.
  
  Two points - 1) in spite of what you might read, this game had AMAZING graphics. Sure, they lack 
 the subtlety and detail of something like GOW, but there's spectacular lighting, great weapon effects, 
 creepy/impressive enemy design and above all an incredible sense of scale. The gigantic robots 
 really do feel bigger than a skyscraper - it's an amazing, awe-inspiring sight, especially on a 
 large HDTV.
  
  2) The game is brilliant fun! Relying on more tactics (especially with weapon load-out choices) 
 than most reviews will give it credit for, it still has an amazingly frantic pace that reminds 
 you of an R-Type style shooter except on land, with full 3D control.
  
  Sure, the vehicles really do suck, but you don't have to use them. And the masses of weapons to 
 be unlocked makes for a compulsion to keep playing that wees all over 'achievements' and the like.
 
  
  An excellent game that's every bit as next-gen as Lost Planet. Buy it - it's cheap!

Review:  Remember the B-grade sci-fi movies from the fifties? The giant bugs; the giant robots; the giant, 
 well, everything? Imagine if there were a game that took these movies and made them high-tech. 
 Better yet, pick up a copy of Earth Defense Force 2017.
  
  Earth Defense Force 2017 may be painfully simplistic in almost every aspect, but who ever said 
 a game had to be complex to be fun? After all, simplicity is where gaming's roots set in. EDF 2017 
 is, on the surface, a generic, third-person, sci-fi shooter, but it's actually more than that once 
 you pop it into your system. You are first given the choice of playing single player, co-op, or 
 battle. Single player and co-op, as to be expected, are the same thing, in essence, but you'll 
 have the most fun playing with a friend. As to the battle mode? Try it if you must, but don't get 
 your hopes up. Rather than describe the physics of the game, since you can find those on the other 
 reviews, I'll describe the experience: the game is fast-paced, frantic action. The marines you 
 fight with often talk to each other quite enthusiastically (in fact, they never seem to shut up) , 
 and it can be entertaining at times (especially if you have a friend to joke with as you both play) . 
 You'll often find yourself and your friend going out to previous levels, on a harder difficulties, 
 trying to unlock new weapons, and believe me when I say this: the weapons you can unlock are some 
 of the most satisfying weapon experiences in a video game that I (as well as my friends) have ever 
 had the privelege of having, and are well worth the effort it takes to unlock them. The varying 
 range of difficulty options are wonderful, as well, as they really are what their names imply.
 
  
  The downside, however, is that you WILL (it's unavoidable) notice some frame-rate issues, especially 
 when there are a large number of explosions going off. Generally, it isn't enough to matter, but 
 sometimes it will slow down to such a pathetic speed that it makes it overly irritating. It will 
 speed up quickly enough, however, that you'll soon forget it ever happened.
  
  Another downside to the game is the disappointing vehicular controls. The hoverbike steers just 
 like you'd expect it to if you've ever played a Star Wars game with speeder bikes (it's basically 
 the same thing -- it even looks similar) . The helicopter has some good firepower... if you can stand 
 the horribly unresponsive controls. It's almost impossible to get aimed at what you want while 
 piloting the chopper. The battlesuit, which reminds me of the SCV from the Starcraft series, is 
 great when it comes to firepower, as it has a flamethrower, a very powerful minigun, and a tank 
 shell. It's a good thing the aim turns from side to side, apart from the body (think Mech Warrior) , 
 because the suit turns horribly slow. It can be useful, though, if you can get used to using the 
 jump-flight to turn quickly. The tank is probably the most useful, responsive vehicle. Tank controls 
 on next-gen games have gotten more and more compex, but this manages to be somewhat simple, at 
 least. You rotate the barrel with the right stick, and move with the left. It can take a moment 
 to adjust to working this together, but once you do, it feels just fine.
  
  Not the greatest game out there, but definitely one of the most fast-paced and fun games you can 
 buy, especially for the price. It's a great value, and I would reccommend giving it a try to see 
 if you like it (renting it, in other words) before you buy, because it may not be for everyone, 
 but I'm sure it can be found somewhat enjoyable to any audience.

Review:  Earth Defense Force 2017 for the Xbox 360 is a simple shooter. You see an enemy, you shoot it. 
 This is a much different situation, however. In Earth Defense Force 2017, you play as a soldier 
 that is protecting the world from an alien invasion. You face giant ants and spiders, U. F. Os and 
 Giant Robots. Simple, right? but thats the genius behind 2017. the game supplies you with unlimited 
 ammo for all guns, so no need to worry about ammo. the game is no doubt a B-class game. you shoot 
 a rocket at a building, it crumbles to the ground. But the enemies are also a great challenge when 
 it comes to shear numbers. you have with you about 5-10 soldiers with you. but the enemys come 
 in large groups. The giant ants and spiders often come in groups of 20 to 30 at a time, adding 
 challenge. The robots create a scale similar to Shadow of the Colossus, in other words your basicly 
 and ant compared to them. one of the best things about 2017 is the co-op mode. you and a friend 
 can together experience the pleasure of shooting U. F. Os out of the sky. Overall, 2017 offers up 
 one of the most enjoyable times you can have on your 360.

Review:  Finally a fun game. also setting up your button controls is a cinch. This game is definitely worth 
 the money. To me this game is Independence day and serious sam combined to create a fun game experience. Giant 
 Ants, giant robots, space ships, what else could you ask for ? Just because it does not have any new 
 innovation, does not mean it's not a good game ! I put more trust in the Players who rate the game 
 ,not the magazine or web site people , but thank the web site for having the players rate the game 
 also. Any way ,It's a fun game with great options, and also CO-OP ,which is lacking from so many 
 games.
  THANKS, Wayne

Review:  With a sci-fi vibe hearkening back to the 50's with giant ants, spiders, huge robots, and a giant 
 mothership behind it all, the third person action of Earth Defense Force 2017 might seem out of 
 place in today's world of Half Life 2 and Halo. It may not be what players might expect to see 
 as a 'next gen' title, but saving the world from giant bugs and robots is still a lot of fun as 
 Sandlot brings this latest chapter in their long running series to invade Microsoft's console.
 
  
  We Get Signal
  
  The story that feels like a homage to the kaiju films of old complete with giant dinosaurs, colossal 
 ants, and alien spacecraft ready to crush humanity. Just as Godhand's campy humor and deliberate 
 cheese gave action fans a unique beat 'em up from Clover, Earth Defense Force 2017 from Sandlot 
 feels like it does the same thing. There's not much to the story, but it won't be something that 
 you'll be worried about while stepping in as Earth's ultimate Orkin man. The story starts out with 
 a signal detected in deep space, confirming that we're no longer alone in the universe although 
 we would soon wish we were. The Earth Defense Force is formed 'just in case' the aliens that we 
 know are coming turn out to be the bad kind. In 2017, they arrive, and they're not asking to be 
 taken to our leaders as they start dumping giant ants on the streets of Tokyo. As a nameless captain 
 in the EDF, you'll take to the streets, the hills, the beaches, and even head underground with 
 fellow EDF soldiers to send the aliens back into space in a game that can feel like a cross between 
 Konami's Contra and Sega's Alien Syndrome.
  
  Gear Up for Battle
  
  Over fifty plus missions tell the story of the fight against the aliens, dubbed the 'Ravagers', 
 as you try and do your part to save Earth from being overrun. Before starting any mission, you'll 
 get the chance to equip yourself with two weapons from what starts out as a pitiful arsenal of 
 destruction that will improve as you find more toys on the battlefield when they are dropped by 
 dead invaders. Machine guns, sniper rifles, missiles, flame throwers, and grenade launchers are 
 only a few of the tools that you'll be using to wipe out them out with more powerful ones appearing 
 at the higher difficulty levels. Some missions will also allow you to drive or fly a variety of 
 vehicles, although they leave a lot to be desired in the controls department. Fortunately, movement 
 is smoothly handled on foot and the camera gives you a good view of what is ahead of you as you 
 simply point and shoot. There's no need to worry about ammo, either, only reload times, as the 
 game gets the point across that you're there to save the Earth and not worry about something so 
 trivial as whether your uniform has enough pockets for your clips. EDF is all about all out warfare 
 against aliens that apparently have never watched Independence Day and takes its cue from old school 
 arcade shooters where the only thing you have to worry about is whether you can survive.
  
  When you've picked a mission to play and have your favorite weapons in tow, it's time to pick a 
 difficulty level. If you're no stranger to third person action titles, the normal difficulty won't 
 pose much of a challenge until the final few missions and easy is, well, extremely easy. At the 
 higher difficulties, though, the aliens are much tougher and hit even harder, but the rewards are 
 greater as some of the best weapons will only be dropped by the bad guys when they can laugh at 
 your attempts to stop them. The game boasts about 150 weapons in total with others rewarded at 
 each difficulty level that all of missions are completed at.
  
  Extra armor will also be dropped to help improve how much damage you can take in every battle and 
 with the ability to repeat any of the missions at any difficulty level, working on improving your 
 odds by collecting these spoils can easily become something that can be a lot of fun... even if 
 it is just to test how effective that new missile launcher can really be against a horde of giant 
 spiders. Even then, the game is pretty forgiving to the player, as you won't get killed if a building 
 falls on top of you or if an alien spaceship explodes in your face. The only damage that you'll 
 receive is if it coming from the enemy in the form of acid blobs, deadly webbing, or flying plasma 
 bolts just to name a few things that you'll need to actually avoid. Just don't forget to save your 
 progress whenever you finish a mission and want to keep any new toys that you had just earned.
 
  
  Don't Worry, They Can Rebuild It
  
  When you first start out on the streets of the city, the fact that you can demolish most everything 
 that you can see is what will probably be what you might worry about for a whole two seconds until 
 you realize that it doesn't matter if those grenades just took out a skyscraper. You're part of 
 the EDF. Property values aren't high on your list of priorities when the fate of humanity is in 
 jeopardy. If you can't get a shot at a cluster of giant ants crawling all over the buildings a 
 block away, level the block. The people have been evacuated. The city has no health bar.
  
  Before being turned into rubble, though, the city doesn't look half bad with plenty of storefronts, 
 apartments, office buildings, and plenty of street level detail right down to the blinking traffic 
 lights that you can shoot. Everything is destructible, although not everything blows up so don't 
 expect trees to splinter, signs to shatter into burning metal fragments, or cars to explode when 
 your bullets bounce them down the street. There's also the fact that huge, crashing alien starships, 
 will clip through the landscape, and you, as it falls from the sky or that a building falling on 
 top of you and your team won't kill anyone. But it all looks good, if a little strange, and that's 
 all that the game really cares about. But there's also a price to pay for all of the pyrotechnics 
 that are thrown around. In exceptionally busy scenes overflowing with fiery explosions and special 
 effects, the game can literally slow to a crawl which was surprising after seeing how smoothly 
 it handles swarms of insect invaders.
  
  There are also little details scattered here and there, such as stairs in some of the buildings 
 that you can use to climb up to the top or windows through which you can actually see shelves and 
 other objects. Unfortunately, you can't shoot through the windows to enter the store to look for 
 some needed health packs if the aliens haven't dropped any lately, but the amount of detail is 
 still impressive. The other areas, such as the hills and beaches, are also as vast as the city 
 with bridges and small homes scattered everywhere making much of the game feel like a destructible 
 Grand Theft Auto. Alien ants are only the first of many invaders that you'll face, and they'll 
 scurry around climbing over buildings and swarming you when you get their attention. Seeing your 
 in-game radar covered in red dots that suddenly start surging towards you can get the adrenaline 
 going, especially at the higher difficulty levels when you know that being surrounded usually means 
 that you won't be coming back alive. Huge spiders will also hop into the scene and giant, chrome 
 plated, walkers that have come to kill humanity's love for Robby the Robot will rain purple plasma 
 down on your parade. Throw in plenty of spacecraft, giant dinosaurs armed with alien technology, 
 and a mothership with its own theme music, and you've got a lot of targets to take out. And when 
 you think you've stopped one wave, another might just appear at the edge of your radar map.
  
  Fortunately, you're not alone. Along with the aliens, there are also fellow EDF soldiers that 
 you can hook up with in the field for added firepower. They'll follow you around as best they can 
 and will fight whatever you lead them to although you can't give them any orders. If you happen 
 to take one of your buddies out with friendly fire, though, don't worry. The others will avenge 
 his death by continuing to fight against the aliens, leaving you blameless. You might feel bad, 
 but the game won't. This can also kind of get silly as you can take command of a troop of soldiers 
 simply by taking out the commander that they start off with without worrying about the game court 
 martialling you.
  
  Plenty of campy dialog that feels as if it were pulled right out from the tongue-in-cheek sci-fi 
 that has apparently inspired it will filter through your speakers as you pick up radio transmissions 
 from HQ or from the soldiers around you. Troops that are with you will talk amongst each other 
 and enthusiastically yell out memorable lines such as Remember your training! or scream in terror 
 as they fight the invaders. There's also plenty of melodrama in between these snippets such as 
 when HQ utters Damn you, mothership! when it makes a break to get away.
  
  It... it's ACID!!!!
  
  EDF's thrifty take on sci-fi isn't for everyone, though, and might actually 
 be disappointing to those looking for something a little more serious. The dialog fits in with 
 the overall feel of the title as a 'budget' shooter and complements the chaotic action onscreen 
 even though the story isn't anything to write home about. Much like the simple fun of Space Invaders, 
 EDF doesn't do much more than to give the player a gun and the enemies to use it against which 
 some next-gen players may not expect outside the 360's Marketplace release of Contra.
  
  The variety of stuff that you can destroy in the game can be a lot of fun but some of the missions 
 and much of what you will be fighting can get really repetitive. Granted, some missions may only 
 take a few minutes to get through, but others can be long, tedious affairs that can test your patience 
 as you try to find and kill that last alien bug that might be stuck somewhere just to continue. 
 The action basically boils down to killing every red dot on your radar screen so don't expect too 
 much more in the way of objectives. Unfortunately, given the huge spaces that you will be doing 
 battle in, that can also mean a lot of running around to get to where you can take out that last 
 enemy. And if you don't have the right weapon for a particular mission, it might never end as a 
 flying fighter that refuses to come down and attack you remains out of range which is actually 
 what had happened to me forcing a reload with the right gear.
  
  It also doesn't help that your fellow soldiers are also as smart as a sack of rocks and will often 
 run blindly ahead into a mass of aliens and get slaughtered... if not by getting hit with acid, 
 then by getting blasted in the back by accident with one of your bullets when they run into your 
 line of fire. They're still handy to have, but on the higher difficulty levels, they're only useful 
 enough to distract the enemy while you plan your real attack. At least the aliens aren't much smarter.
 
  
  The camera which works pretty well, but often at the start of some missions, the game will take 
 control of it to dramatize something that it thinks you should pay attention to taking it out of 
 your hands when all you want to do is start shooting. This can be annoying, especially since you 
 can still move around and pretend to aim at things that you can't see. You also can't cancel out 
 of this view until the game is done with it and if you've been running around trying to shake it, 
 it can be disorienting when it finally returns to your control.
  
  There's also no multiplayer on Live!, such as co-op, which would have been great to have although 
 two players can still help each other out in split screen action with an extra controller to add 
 shelf life to the title. The game can last a little under eight or so hours on normal, which might 
 make it rental material to players hoping for more than just the run 'n gun action that it delivers, 
 and the number of achievements are as sparse as the gameplay with basic marks awarded for finishing 
 all of the missions at each of the difficulty levels and for collecting all of the weapons.
  
  For Great Justice
  
  It can be repetitive, you might get bored to tears you hunt for that 
 last bug, and the AI is as smart as the rubble you will be leaving in your wake, but the explosive 
 action and devastating firepower that can be liberally sprinkled on every fight in the game helps 
 to keep things oddly fun and exciting. It's Space Invaders for today's gamers masquerading as sci-fi 
 fanservice for those looking to save the world while leveling everything in their way to the mothership. 
 It's not for everyone, though, and its narrow appeal may make it a hard sell to players that may 
 not appreciate its simple approach to saving the world. But if you're the kind of gamer that is 
 looking to face hordes of alien insects and fondly remembers the days of Godzilla and the Thunderbirds, 
 then Earth Defense Force 2017 may be what your trigger finger is looking for.

Review:  The Good: Fun, fun and more fun; hours and hours of replay value, 53 missions, 5 difficulties and 
 tons of weapons to collect; spectacular explosions and effects; co-op play.
  
  The Bad: budget title restrictions, clipping issues and poor overall animations, battle mode is 
 worthless; lack of achievements 
 
  
  Fun has always been the quarter-stone of old-school shooters, not graphics or anything else you 
 will find in current day titles, just pure unprecedented fun, and thats exactly what you get in 
 Earth Defence Force 2017, huge enemies, huge explosions and huge amounts of fun, plain and simple. 
 Sometimes too simple for its own good however, EDF is something of an acquired taste, while it 
 does have a budget price (and budget restrictions for that matter) , the game still might not apply 
 to everyone, but to anyone who has enjoyed classic shooters back in the day, will most likely appreciate 
 EDF 2017.
  
  The whole premise of the game is that earth is being invaded by aliens (go figure) dubbed the ravagers 
 and its up to the Earth Defence Force to save humanity form the evil aliens, this is inherently 
 Japanese and since its a Japanese game, one can expect the most crazy Japanese sci-fi horror ever 
 seen in a video game. Surprisingly the story is enticing, and since you never know what to expect, 
 you eagerly want to know how this battle for mankind unfolds, and what a battle it is. You will 
 be fighting giant ants and spiders, huge walking robots and (you guessed it) Godzilla like monsters, 
 all in the comfort of Japan and a 3rd person perspective.
  
  The main goal of the 53 missions, is to eliminate all the enemies in the area, and while this seems 
 far too simple, the game does a good job of mixing up scenarios so you dont get bored, its basic 
 but it sure is a lot of fun for just shooting huge enemies in the mountains or in the city. You 
 wont be fighting these huge monsters alone, you are part of the EDF and the EDF fight together, 
 your AI team mates really add the sense that you are fighting for mankind, they talk to each other 
 during battle, and chant and cheer as they march on into the fray of destruction, in fact, they 
 are often hilarious when fighting. Not only do the EDF act great but they are also crucial to your 
 success in a battle, they provide a good distraction for you to kill the enemies without them noticing 
 and attacking you, you will surely want to have them around in the later difficulties because it 
 can get really hard.
  
  There are 5 difficulty settings, easy, medium, hard, hardest! And finally inferno. inferno mode 
 is simply insane and only the most skilled players who know the all the exploits and weapons down 
 to a tee will be able to complete it at this level, but as for the other levels of difficulty its 
 more accessible to more casual players, and players who want to play the game without suffering. 
 The difference between the difficulties is mainly the enemies, they will have more health and much 
 stronger attributes, so an ant in easy moves as slow as youd expect a giant bug to move, but in 
 inferno or hardest, it moves as fast as a real antfast!. Strategy is required, you are only allowed 
 to take 2 weapons into a battle, and as the menu voice will tell you over and over again, you need 
 to think hard about the weapons you are going to take into battle, there is a whopping 150 weapons 
 in the game ranging from assault rifles and shotguns to rocket launchers and missile launchers, 
 and while they sadly dont differ in looks, they all have unique stats and types of fire, the harder 
 the difficultly you play on, the better weapons youll most likely find, so searching for powerful 
 weapons is crucial for you to at least succeed on inferno. With all these difficulties, the game 
 becomes instantly re-playable and will take you a long time to beat the game on all.
  
  There are vehicles scattered around certain missions that are there to help you annihilate huge 
 swarms of enemies, or so they should. Only 1 of the 4 vehicles at your disposal are actually manoeuvrable, 
 the mech, helicopter and hoverbike are all hard to control, the tank is the only one that will 
 at least get you out of tight situations in a hurry, thats not to say the other vehicles arent 
 powerful, the mech specifically will take down the largest of enemies super easy with its chain 
 cannon, flamethrower and rocket launcher mercilessly hammering away at the enemy. In short the 
 game features a lot of simplicity but since when did that stop the likes of Smash TV from being 
 fun, its simple in terms of gameplay, and its also simple in terms of graphics, since its a budget 
 title, you cant expect the most astounding of graphics, but it does try its best.
  
  The animations are poor throughout the game, the way your character moves has a lot of comedic 
 value, and the bugs also dont animate in the most conventional of ways, they will often climb 
 walls and become jaunty in the process, when aircrafts hit the floor, they will clip right through 
 it. The environments are fully destructible, every building, tree and object will collapse, but 
 often just through the floor, with all these shortcuts the game still suffers from occasional slowdown 
 and framerate drops ,especially when there are a lot of explosions going on, but one cant help 
 look at them over and over again because they are awesome, when a robot gets destroyed it doesnt 
 just blow up once, it blows up, hits the floor and blows up again, the flames literally engulf 
 the screen with a glaring haze. The overal graphical quality is slightly medicore, but its easily 
 understood why.
  
  Things sound perfectly fine, everything sounds as it should, gunfire, explosions and the general 
 bug noise all sound reasonably well done and pitched perfectly on a sci-fi level, the games music 
 score is also something that brings the eerie sci-fi theme to life. The voice acting (as with any 
 other Japanese port) has comedic value from the start, however it does have its charm, and even 
 though the menu voice will get on your nerves from time to time, its still over the top stuff which 
 is always welcome in a game that features giant robots and bugs. One of the highlights if the voice 
 acting is Michael McConnohie who has done countless voiceovers for anime films and television programs 
 as well as games, his talent here is probably at its best, its captivating and enjoyable all the 
 while still being a little humorous.
  
  With its simple style of gameplay comes simple and disappointing achievements, there are only 6 
 total, and while they do add a considerable amount of replay value, it does seem that there is 
 a lot of missed opportunity with the achievements, completing the game on a certain difficulty 
 is the common achievement and the collecting all the weapons is the only unique achievement. The 
 game also has a battle mode between 2 players and its such a terrible mode its not even worth mentioning.
 
  
  Earth Defence Force 2017 is certainly simple, but its fun, and is always fun no matter how many 
 times you play it, its simplicity will alienate some people, but for old school shooter fans or 
 anyone who wants to blast away robots, bugs and a deathstar looking mothership, this game is a 
 must have.

Review:  Every so often out of nowhere comes a game that just downright gets you. No one else may like it, 
 or heard of it or want to play it but it hits you in the gut. For me EDF2017 is one of those games. 
 Years ago it was Shogo: Mobile Armor Division, Recoil and Doctor Mario. Today it's EDF.
  
  I can't say exactly what it is about this game that is so appealing, it's no graphics masterpiece. 
 It's third person (which I normally hate) , no storyline to speak of and the sound could use some 
 work.
  
  What I can say is that it's just plain addictive and fast paced fun. At first you think wow, what 
 a cool game . Then as you increase difficulty levels you realize it's a bit harder and you have 
 to play longer so you can get more health by picking up the health increases which don't do you 
 any good until and unless you finish a level which makes your stamina just a bit stronger. This 
 appeals to the hoarding side of me that wants more so I keep playing so I can become stronger and 
 stronger. You also get weapon cards of which there are about 170 different variations I think, 
 again these don't change gameplay for the current level unless you finish. You can only carry 2 
 weapons at once so you have to load out appropriately before you start a level. Sounds harder than 
 it is, just check out the mission beforehand and use common sense. Underground level would obviously 
 not be a good place for a long range homing missile. Assault rifle with rebounding rounds and a 
 flamethrower would do you more good.... common sense.
  
  Movement and control are simple, just a few buttons and a simple preference setup and you are ready 
 to get into action. Speaking of action, sort of like Serious Sam meets ... I don't know.... maybe 
 Freedom Fighters meets Hulk: Ultimate Destruction. Wave after wave giant ants, spiders, robots 
 and airborne fighters. Skyscrapers crashing down from your rockets, green ant blood flying around, 
 spiders bursting, health to collect. What's not to like?
  
  I have probably 60 hours or more already on the game in 2 weeks. Can't quit!
  
  The only downside 
 is this would be a great online multiplayer game in my opinion though I don't play much online 
 I might play this one if it were available but sadly it's not.
  
  Hope my little review gives joy to all the Earth Defense Force members out there. I may have to 
 break down and buy a PS2 (GASP!) just so I can play the prequel.

Review:  This game is the essence of old school, revived on the Xbox 360. This is a good thing, and not 
 so much a good thing at the same time. Forgive my cryptic words, just read on to get my opinion 
 of this game.
  
  The game itself is based on a simple and highly cliched premise. We contact extraterrestrials in 
 the near future, they become hostile, we deploy the Earth Defense Force (referred to as EDF from 
 here on in) . This sounds like a really bad B movie (actually Entertainment Weekly would call it 
 a C movie) and Ebert and Roeper would give it two thumbs down for production value, but like 4 
 alien tentacles up for fun. After a really cheap short introduction that is essentially copied 
 and pasted from the direction manual, you are put in charge of a generic EDF member and start by 
 looking up at a huge spherical metallic spaceship with red and orange flashing panels, seriously. 
 Imagine Star Trek, but in high def, and shinier with big flashing lights and glowing panels that 
 seem to serve no function. That is the appearance of the alien ships. Anyways, there is tons of 
 frequent banter and radio chat for new objectives and your EDF comrades shouting various one liners, 
 often in an overwhelming cacophony. As you look down you finally have control of the game, which 
 basically involves using the two analogue sticks to move and then aim. The R trigger shoots your 
 gun and the right shoulder button changes between your two weapons you can select from a whole 
 immense cache of weapons between stages. The left trigger jumps and dives depending on what way 
 you are moving. Don't worry, except for a few weapons your ammo is infinite and you reload automatically. 
 Certain weapons reload slower or have more ammo, and as you complete more levels and fight on harder 
 settings, you can pick up boosts to your stats such as life and new weaponry which is saved.
  
  Yes, that is literally the extent of the game, very simple arcade style controls, but don't 
 get me wrong, the game is fun. Unfortunately there is no tutorial on how to play, you just pick 
 up and go, but what I said explains the game clearly enough.
  
  Ok, so after that mental time out and realizing the Earth is under attack, you rush forward with 
 your team, and lo and behold, people come running from you guessed it... Giant Black ants straight 
 out of a 50s movie. The animation and models of your character and other civilians are of PS2 caliber, 
 as are your weapon pickups and items (in fact the closer you get, the more blurry and pixelated 
 they become, in arcade style) . Anyways, the ants are mostly black and reflective, and dwarf your 
 team, however somehow the developers got the idea how to make it look like you were put into the 
 shot afterward and that the scenes don't mesh, like a cheap movie. And when the ants climb over 
 buildings like a giant play ground, you really do get a sense of scale and an ominous infestation.
 
  
  Black ants are easy to kill until they start spitting acid on you, especially from above. One of 
 my favorite aspects of this game is that almost everything is destructible, from the most massive 
 skyscraper to the smalles fence (which doesn't actually decompose, but just knocks down) . This 
 is handy to make clear shots and get the enemies down from high up. Also it's just fun to blow 
 crap up.
  
  The objective of each round is only cryptically given in each set of briefings or radio transmissions, 
 however, it generally boils down to either wipe out all forces, or take down the mother ship so 
 it stops dropping off troops or just survive for x amount of minutes. As you go on further, enemies 
 become more difficult and advanced, such as giant robots, assault spider troops, flying ships and 
 a huge Halo type Scarab transport fortress. As this goes on, you should pick up more weapons from 
 killing enemies and grabbing more armor boosts. However, the game isn't much more complicated than 
 that. It's old school fun and basically is like one of those arcade games you would sink 5 bucks 
 of quarters into each time you went. Granted there are some problems with walking through falling 
 buildings and taking no damage, or a giant mother ship crashing on you, or just completely phasing 
 through car, but besides a few seemingly non solid objects, there are no problems with clipping 
 and targeting, that's spot on.
  Also, the enemies bleed in low res, and in buckets... or rather swimming pool quantities, but that 
 just adds to the cheesiness of the game, part of its charm. Don't expect lots of high res debris, 
 rather just lots of jaggy and linear debris with not very complex polygonal shapes. Don't expect 
 to shatter windows, but do expect to see glass particles come flying out of said shot windows.
 
  
  Inexplicably, explosions also stay around for quite a long time and you can walk through the fire 
 with no damage, and portable missle launchers travel REALLY slow when shot, but they pack a wallop. 
 However the city is expansive and looks reasonably nice for a generic city with no distinguishing 
 landmarks, also some of the textures are really nice, in contrast to a lot of other fudged graphical 
 features. Also, the robotic enemies are more believable and more polished literally, and figuratively 
 in terms of graphics. Also, it feels like a more worthy challenge to fight these enemies, like 
 a real invasion force, like in War of the Worlds.
  
  In later levels, vehicles come into play and pack quite a punch, but unfortunately they are rather 
 slow and you can't pick up weapons and bonuses in them, nor can they be repaired and are easily 
 overwhelmed due to their large size. Also the difficulty on easy is too easy, normal is pretty 
 good, and hard is about where the game should be in terms of what it would be like in reality of 
 the Earth was under attack from giant insects and robots. The fun thing though is multi-player 
 mode, which is right out of the box. This reminds me of going to the arcade with my brother and 
 friends and slapping in some quarters and just shooting up any badguy that comes along. It is fun 
 in the nostalgic old school arcade sense, don't look for anything new and innovative here, you 
 won't find it. In the end, there are 5 different settings, and you have you have to pleay each 
 setting, playing at a higher difficulty setting won't earn you the achievement for the lower levels, 
 however I recommend going from lower to higher in order to scale your powers and weapons accordingly. 
 Overall, the game does a great job making you feel overwhelmed and under heavy fire (the screen 
 shake and rumble REALLY does the job) . It felt like you were fighting for your life, with comrades 
 screaming and dying all around you. Oddly the graphics were PS2 level, but with more graphical 
 features than in GRAW such as destructible environments and actual civilians that are visible. 
 The sound and story in the game were pretty lame, but every transmission and news clip is right 
 out of a cheap sci fi horror movie.
  
  So in the end, if this game was more polished in the presentation department and the vehicles were 
 more fun to play with like in Halo, this game would easily be in the high 8s, it's really the graphics 
 and the sound and overall carelessness in the presentation (intentional to some degree, but unintentional 
 to some degree as well) that hurt the game's overall score. In the end though, what matters the 
 most is that this game is very fun and very old school and 39.99$ brand new, so it's a value too, 
 and with coop out of the box, you can't go wrong.

Review:  Though it has its faults, this game is all you would expect from an old-school sci-fi shooter
 
  It is immensely entertaining sitting with another player and splattering tons of giant bugs and 
 robots
  The weapon selection is awesome especially the rocket launchers
  The graphics might seem kinda archaic, but the comical tint they give the game is awesome, especially 
 when it comes to blowing up buildings
  The achievements could have been a little more creative, but they inspire you to replay the game 
 over and over
  Overall, this game serves its purpose and it is very fun and well made
  Especially playing the guys who fight Godzilla

Review:  What to say about Earth Defense Force? Its to the point, mental and a superb amount of fun. It 
 fits in with games like smash TV and Serious Sam in that its a mindless free for all with swarms 
 of enemies and ridiculous weaponry. The kind of game that you could easily lose a good few hours 
 to without even noticing, that is of course, if its your thing. If your a fan of character driven 
 games with compelling story lines and open ended game play, avoid EDF 2017 like the plague. If 
 however you can stomach a game that is totally based of blowing the stuffing out of everything 
 you can see and having a grin while your doing it. EDF is well worth a look. It doesn't look half 
 bad either, graphically the explosions are great and the weapon effects are pretty tight. The fact 
 that it doesnt take itself to seriously adds to the comedy factor of the game and only increases 
 the overall enjoyment. In short... Polished: Fairly
  Serious: NO
  Memorable characters and story line: NO
  Massive amount of fun: DEFINITELY

Review:  EDF has no story, no character development (you don't even learn your avatar's name) , it doesn't 
 try to revolutionize next-gen gaming, nor does it push the Xbox 360's horsepower. But this is what 
 it does do, it gives you a gun and a rocket launcher, puts you in the middle of a vast city being 
 invaded by gaint alien beasts and says shoot crap. If that doesn't sound awesome to you, then I 
 think gaming may not be your forte. The game does have problems though. first we must acknowledge 
 the fact that EDF is a low budget title by a relatively small developer and publisher (hence the 
 discounted MSRP of $40) . Because of this low budget the audio, graphics and pretty much every thing 
 that has to do with presentation suffers. Your teammates have horrible voice overs, sound effect 
 seem like they were made by toy guns from the Dollar mart, the frame rate takes a gigantic dive 
 once the swarms of killer enemies pack the screen (and they do so often) , and some areas of the 
 game look like they were ported from the PS2 GTA games. That said, I'm not completely knocking 
 the production values. the art style captures the 1940s/1950s science fiction and Japanese monster 
 movie vibe perfectly, EDF feels like the bastard child of Godzilla and War of the Worlds. Also, 
 at certain points in the game the visuals and sheer amount of enemies on screen do amaze. EDF has 
 five difficulty level that'll keep you coming back for more, but be advised that this game is best 
 played with a friend, REAL friends (Xbox Live is not supported) . The controls and basic gameplay 
 are simply and easy to learn, there are tons of weapons and the game is pretty long with 53 individual 
 missions. If you wanted to know what Super Smash TV would be like on a modern gaming system, I'd 
 consider giving EDF a go. A great game that's bogged down with lack of funds, I only hope people 
 buy enough copies to warrant an EDF sequel with bigger production values.

Review:  Ok, so mindless fun it might be if the lunky controls didn't get in the way. Sure it's a cheap 
 game but it's definitely just a one time rent it while you drink a few beers with your buddies 
 sorta game. Don't bother buying it - this game will be in bargain bins at blockbuster in a couple 
 of months and easily worth the wait. But this won't tide you over till Halo 3 - I'd suggest Lost 
 Planet for a more enjoyable FPS that's in the same genre, but quite a bit better. Worse, this game 
 might even sour you opinion of FPS in general as a game concept - granted, i didn't play this long, 
 and only at a friends place, drinking several beers.... even then I didn't like the game much.

Review:  Before you find yourself playing this game you have to know what to expect, the graphics for one 
 could be considered horrible even when compared to early generation xbox games. Voice acting is 
 more considered fluffying due to its unbelievable speech. But the good thing about this game is 
 that it has certain charms about it, killing lots of bugs and robots with some pretty cool weapons 
 somewhat saves this game as well as powering yourself up as you go. All in all, i would say rent 
 this game, beat it and put it in your memory. Its not worth owning but its worth a few good long 
 days of play.

Review:  EDF 2017 is a game that may not appeal to everyone, but it is an unrelenting action fest that everyone 
 should try. The game will pit you against giant ants, spiders, robots, flying saucers, and Godzilla-wannabes 
 over the course of its 53 missions.
  
  This game is incredibly easy to get into. For most of the game, you need only the left trigger 
 to jump, the right trigger to shoot, and the right bumper to switch weapons. Then you run off to 
 kill the enemy, which is pretty much your only objective for every mission. Along the way, you 
 can pick up armor that will up your total hit-points, and earn new weapons.
  
  The weapons come in several varieties, from assault rifles to shotguns and missiles and rocket 
 launchers. Some of the weapons are a blast to play with, and there are instances where some weapons 
 will be much more useful than others. However, you're probably going to find yourself never using 
 the majority of the game's weapons, which is a little dissappointing.
  
  The sound in the game is perfect to go along with the game's campy style. It's just as cheesy as 
 it should be. The weapons sound great, and so do the explosions. Visually, this isn't the best 
 thing you've seen on the 360, and the player looks like he's walking around with something shoved 
 up his butt, but the graphics are good enough, and most of the time you'll be too busy blasting 
 away hordes of enemies to really care.
  
  The game has 4 vehicles, but you're unlikely to want to use any of them. They are difficult to 
 steer, and slow, making them not nearly as effective as simply running around on foot.
  
  Other complaints include the game's 6 achievements, which are pretty uninspired. Something like 
 Kill 10 enemies with 1 rocket and other achievements like that would have been nice. Also, since 
 this game is set in Japan, it would have been nice if the game made the setting look more convinvingly 
 Japanese. I've been there. I know what Japan looks like. There are the appropriate mailboxes and 
 traffic signs, and some of the houses are Japanese-style, but I would have liked to see more. Some 
 more signs in Japanese would have been nice, and the roads were usually wider than they really 
 are in Japan. It would have been nice to have a mission in Kyoto or Nara to see the ants crawling 
 over some Japanese monuments. Maybe I'm being picky.
  
  Playing this game over 2-player co-op is a total blast, and I recommend it when you can. This easy 
 pick-up-and-play game sports intense and constant action. The action-per-minute level of this game 
 is insane, and for $40, this addictive game will, despite some imperfections, keep you entertained 
 for many hours.

Review:  It is hard to describe how I feel about this game truly the graphics aren't all they are cut out 
 to be. It has very fast game play with an enormous amount of action. Sound is what you would see 
 on an old Nintendo 64 or playstation game. AI's are dim witted yet fast. I would call this a hack 
 and slash with no hack and slash heh. Story line is like something you would see in a flash game. 
 Even with all these problems the game still amazes me with its flashy substance and explosive action. 
 If you live in a house with several other people who want to play your video game all the time 
 it is a very fun multi-player game. If you have 50 bucks burning a whole in your pocket then get 
 the game it is cheap and fun.

Review:  When i first heard about this game i thought, Great, another japaneese shooter. Yipee (unethusiastically) . 
 . But i got it just because of it's budget price and it's actually good. I'll break it up for you.
 
  
  Graphics- Basically, it isn't next-gen. Heck, it's hardly even PS2 worthy. There are some slow-downs 
 in the game, especially when there are multiple enemies on-screen. The graphics are one of the 
 reasons why this game is getting bad critisism.
  
  Sound- The sound is well done. You get that dramatic music while hearing your comrades dying and 
 going crazy. Overall, it's Xbox 360 sound.
  
  Gameplay- Now for the gameplay. It's smooth and a little bysst. The weapons are abundant and fluid 
 (even though the only weapon you'll ever need is a rocket launcher) . The only problems are the 
 vehicles. The controls sadly suck and are very clunky. Value- EDF 2017 is a good budget title (only 
 $40) . So if u need some killing but only have $40 get this game. Don't get this for a rental (trust 
 me) .
  
  Overall- Overall, this game is a great pick-me-up. Besides the lame graphics and no online play 
 it's actually a little good. It's challenging, long (if you try to beat it on all the difficulties) , 
 cheap, multiplayer-friendly and just......... great. I would definetely reccmmend it.

Review:  When I went to the game store the day this game came out and found out it was $40 on the day it 
 was released, I looked at the cover to see if it was any good. At first, Earth Defense Force 2017 
 seemed like the kind of game I liked, a sci-fi shooter sharing qualities with the 50's b-movie 
 genre. But, when I got home and started to play it, I busted out laughing hysterically when I saw 
 for myself its stupidity. In the first level, you have to fight giant ants with some stupid AIs 
 that deep shouting the same ridiculous lines. When I found out that you could distroy skyscrapers 
 (and everything else, for that matter) with a single blast from a rocket launcher, I couldn't help 
 laughing harshly again. In a more serious note, one should wait until this game goes down to 20 
 dollars or at least rent it before buying it.

Review:  Earth Defence Force is an 3rd person shooter game that came out not to long ago. It starts of as 
 you are a soldier fighting for you planet earth in order to get their freedom and defending earth 
 with its last standing hours it has. Gameplay- The gameplay in the game is extremely fun. Their 
 are 53 missions in the game with 5 levels of difficulties to keep you playing for a long time. 
 But the Achievements in the game take a long time to get, are very difficult, and actually kind 
 of get boring.
  
  Graphics- The Graphics are average, maybe under average like PS2 graphics. But what really set 
 out was the Mothership, UFO's, and those huge walking robots. They looked amazing in 1080i HD.
 
  
  Sound- I found the sound to be pretty poorly made. Thats all i really have to say about that.
 
  
  Value- I think the value is good for this game because it was only $39.99. Also if you have a friend 
 you can play co-op which is extremely fun. But i would of liked to see Xbox live co-op.
  
  I recommend this game to anyone.

 They packed a lot of juice into this box! There's more than 150 weapons! 53 not stop action levels 
 and the enemys are huge! The last level has so much going on that my eyes still have the imprints 
 of a billion lasers whizzing by my head. Once you beat it there's another 4 difficulties each with 
 achievements for beating them! Very addictive, though now that I've beatn2 dificulties I'm not 
 playing as much since the freshness has worn off a bit. Definently worth picking up! Don't underestimate 
 the power of simplicity!

Review:  What I like: Amazing and fun gameplay. Greatly detailed (AND lots of them on screen) enemies. Huge 
 scale of maps. 5 Difficulty settings, 50+ missions. 100+ weapons. Lots of replay value.
  
  What I didn't like: Human characters don't look so great. Uhmm... its addictive?
  
  Graphics: 
 Okay, I have to admit - EDF 2017 is not a great looking game. It is very average for an Xbox 360 
 game. The environments look good, with a reasonable draw distance but the enemies have mounds of 
 detail. The spiders look fantastic, however the human character models aren't very detailed. The 
 reason I gave it a 7 for graphics is because during a battle of 200 enemies, all heavily detailed 
 with buildings colapsing and rockets flying everywhere, the game STILL manages to hold a very consistant 
 framerate, with VERY little slowdown.
  
  Gameplay: What is more to say than.. Wow? This game's strongest point is it's crazily fun gameplay 
 that is so simple and over the top, yet amazing to play. Easily a 10/10.
  
  Sounds: As soon as you get into the game, you will notice the menus have a very irritating sound 
 to them which I tend to ignore. The monsters sound great and the music is very.. 'action packed'. 
 The only real bad point for the sound is the weapons; which sound very weak.
  
  Value: Well, with over 50 levels, over 100 weapons, 5 difficulty settins and a wide range of enemies 
 (AND co-op offline) this game is truely worth it's price tag. Also, because this game is a 'Spleeper 
 Hit' - Noone knows about this game and therefore it is very cheap (Around $40 or &pound;20!)

Review:  This is the first Bargin title that may be worth the price of admission. EDF is a fun game in small 
 doses. I enjoy the fact that you are playing against Gaint Robots and bugs. This will remind you 
 of your old days in the arcade when you had to pay a quarter every time you died or the time limited 
 expired. I don't want to hype this game up to be great BECAUSE it isn't; due to all of the game's 
 glitches and mind numbing gameplay. In EDF you will play a nameless plain looking solider with 
 a simple story. THE Aliens are Invading!!! You must protect the Earth, well Japan for its invaders. 
 There is a lot of action in this game especially on harder levels. In the later levels the fight 
 against the enemies become more fun than I was expecting. And I think this is what made this game 
 click with me. It has that ol' school appeal; 150 weapons and 53 levels; you just might enjoy yourself.
 
  *Note: Not a good game for achivements, they missed out on some really good ideas for them, all 
 you have to do it beat the game. And I don't think it is worth it trying to beat this game in one 
 or two seatings....

Review:  A long time ago somewhere in 2000 on a shelf, buried behind hundreds of other pointless discounted 
 games. I came across a game called Robot Alchemy Drive. It was low budget game where you controll 
 a giant robot from your own prospective.
  
  But now seven years later, D3 have risen from the ashes of Japan and created another low budget 
 game called Earth Defense Force 2017. And this game was better than the last one.
  
  Now you play a role as a line of defense against evil alien from space. Which aliens did came down 
 and invaded the planet with bugs, robots, Monsters, Bigger bugs, Bigger robots, and Ufos. And you 
 need to stop by any mean nessacery. Even if you have have destroy half of the city.
  
  The great thing about this game is the relative sizes of everything. Everything looks perfect. 
 Also the gamplay is excellent, There's endless combination of weapons that you can choose from. 
 Often I questioin why using a sniper Rifle against thousands of bugs??. Other weapons are pointless, 
 like the guided missiles.
  
  Even the computer characters that help you fight against alien are often usefull. I find them very 
 charming with their conversation. Sadly they die to quickly or get in front of you when your shooting.
 
  
  It was a shame this game couldn't go on Xbox live for multi play. But at least they cooperative 
 game play, which still it is fun. Accept for the Battle mode option, It is really pointless.
  
  Beside that i found the game to be very enjoyable for me to kill lots of time and bugs. Sure 
 it is cheesy like a B- Rated Sci-Fi japanese movie. But you can't say no this game. There is so 
 many related movies that was so good this game like Star Ship Troopers, Aliens, Team America and 
 Etc.,
  
  So people the never judge a book by its cover statement is so very true. Give this game a try

Review:  If you ever see screenshots or perhaps a video of this game, you will probably burst out laughing 
 at just how pathetic this game looks. I'll admit, I dismissed this game at first when I saw the 
 trailer at my friends house. But after actually experiencing the most important part (... gameplay... duh) , 
 I realized just how wrong I was.
  
  Okay, so the graphics are passable, though below average from what you've come to expect 360 games 
 to look like. They aren't terrible, but they're not great. Buildings collapse from a single rocket 
 though, which is a nice touch and a ton of fun. Bugs will just go stiff once you kill them, only 
 to disapear seconds later. The main character's animations are kinda funky, and he totally looks 
 like he dropped a deuce in his drawers. The UFOs and Walking Arms, on the other hand, actually 
 look really cool, and are a blast to blow up.
  
  Same story with the sound. The voice acting is alright, but what they actually SAY is hilarious. 
 What kind of aliens? It's... it's a bug! A very huge bug! You can tell that this game didn't spend 
 very much time in the translation phase of it's development. Also, on a completely unrelated note, 
 read the instruction booklet for some real fun. The Ravagers' Assault Spiders were engineered to 
 be high-flying, silk-spinning death machines 
  
  Now, the good part of the game: the gameplay. Blowing up crap has never been more fun. With just 
 over 170 weapons to choose from and 53 missions to beat, there is a ton of stuff to do in this 
 game. You will literally have to take breather from the action for a while. (For me, it was because 
 my eyes started hurting from all the lasers... :D) You will be fighting hundreds of bugs and robots 
 at a time, and it's just utter chaos, in a good way. The action comes at a price though, as there 
 is some slowdown. It usually goes away after a couple seconds, but it is still there from time 
 to time. There are also FIVE different difficulty setting to play on, so you should be playing 
 this game for a while.
  
  This game is only $40, but you may want to wait for a price drop (trust me, it can't be a long 
 ways off) or rent it to see if you personally like it. It's a shame this game's not getting some 
 more attention, because I think all 360 owners should at least try this game out.

Review:  What would be some of the things that players have come to expect out of good games? Smooth animation 
 and sharp visuals, perhaps? Solid character and plot development? How about gameplay depth and 
 variety? Earth Defense Force 2017 manages to strike out on all accounts. However, if you look past 
 all of the warts that the game has, you're quickly going to find yourself having a hell of a good 
 time.
  
  The story in Earth Defense Force is that Earth has been invaded by hostile aliens, called Ravagers, 
 and it is your job as an EDF soldier is to exterminate those pesky jerks. That's pretty much all 
 that is provided and all you really need to know. The gameplay is as cut-and-dry, where each of 
 the 53 missions ends when every last acid-spewing ant, thread-shooting spider or giant robot has 
 met their maker. There are also a couple of boss battles that provide some of the most intense, 
 fun action the game has to offer. However, there is absolutely no variety to the action outside 
 of four vehicles you can use, but they all control so horribly that you're better off staying on 
 foot when defending the Earth. Basically, you will be running around holding down the right trigger 
 throughout the roughly 10 hour campaign. You'd think that when the entire gameplay revolves around 
 how long your finger can stay on the trigger without cramping, you would quickly get tired of it. 
 Yet, for some reason, there is just something so engrossing and empowering about having the ability 
 to mow down throngs of giant bugs! You cannot help but to feel like a total badass while playing 
 this game. Despite pouring more than 20 hours into the game, I still want to beat the final three 
 difficulty levels.
  
  Speaking of difficulty levels, Earth Defense Force has five of them: Easy, Normal, Hard, Hardest 
 and Inferno. Difficulty is handled a bit differently in EDF than in other games. In a game like 
 Gears of War or Call of Duty, Insane or Veteran difficulty is definitely much harder than their 
 lower difficulty setting counterparts, yet they are manageable because of their checkpoint systems 
 and the fact that weapons are generally the same from beginning to end. In Earth Defense Force, 
 there are no checkpoints in the missions -- only success or failure. In addition, when you first 
 start playing you begin with only a handful of weak weapons and a small amount of hit points. As 
 you play missions, the enemies you kill will drop new and improved weapons, as well as extra hit 
 points, which then allow you to start tackling the higher difficulties. It is a pretty cool progression 
 system that is extremely rewarding for those who wish to go on multiple play-throughs.
  
  Earth Defense Force also has two different multiplayer components -- co-op and battle mode. Regrettably, 
 the battle mode isn't a whole lot of fun, while the co-op play is offline only. While it is definitely 
 nice that there is a cooperative component to the game, going online with your buddy and blasting 
 bugs would have been an incredible addition to EDF.
  
  Then again, next-generation visuals probably would be an incredible addition as well. While things 
 look generally crisp on a HD-set, there is an overall lack of polish throughout the game that detracts 
 from the presentation. For starters, the frame-rate in EDF can get downright atrocious when the 
 action picks up. Sure, there are hundreds of enemies on screen sometimes, but with buildings, environments 
 and enemies that lack much detail or graphical flare, you have to question why the frame-rate gets 
 as bad as it does. Another reason the presentation isn't up to snuff is a total lack of weight 
 to anything in the game. When shooting down UFO's, they literally sink into the ground, instead 
 of slamming to the earth and having various chunks of pavement, grass, mud and street signs going 
 everywhere. Similarly, mammoth skyscrapers will descend into the ground after one rocket or missile 
 shot. Animations are more of a mixed bag, ranging from great to horrendous. On the good side, when 
 squaring off against the massive robots in the game, shooting them in the chest makes them (and 
 as an extension, their arms) flail around. In addition to looking pretty damn cool, it also effects 
 where they are shooting because their weapons are attached to their arms. Outside of that, though, 
 the animations are complete garbage. Case in point: When running, it looks like your character 
 does not have a functioning hip. Next, when you kill a bug, they just tense up and then fall over. 
 Lame.
  
  On the audio side, EDF isn't much to write home about. There is little differentiation between 
 the various assault rifles, rockets, missiles, and so on -- they all sound basically the same. In 
 addition, there is only one track looping throughout all of the missions, so it is inevitable that 
 it will eventually grind on your nerves. However, there is one bright spot in the audio offering -- the 
 voice acting. The dialogue and delivery is so corny and so horrible, but that was the intent. Instead 
 of being a distraction to the game, it adds to the charm of all the little imperfections that the 
 game has.
  
  Despite it being a failure in almost every sense of the word, Earth Defense Force suceeds because 
 of the strength of its setting and enemies -- killing bugs in the near future is simply too cool. 
 If you are looking for a game that isn't too deep, high on fun and aren't a stickler on graphics, 
 there are worst ways to spend $40 and 10 hours of your life.

Review:  This game makes up in fun what it lacks in bells and whistles. The weapons are just awesome to 
 use and the levels definetly ramp up as you play on the harder levels. Worth the money for those 
 that love shooters. The enemy may be repetitive but fun to kill just the same. I like the fact 
 that you choose which 2 weapons you want to take in. Don't rely on the squad around you for support. 
 They do kill the enemy and help but just don't rely on them for support. Downing building with 
 just 1 rocket from the launcher is sick fun!!!!! Worth the 40.00 for a game that is just fun to 
 play.

Review:  Do you like obscure, outrageous sci-fi movies? Do you like to senselessly blow up and shoot things? 
 Does the concept of infinite ammo and destructible environments make your eyes light up? If you 
 answered yes to any of the following questions, then Earth Defense Force 2017 is the game for you!
 
  
  I had high hopes for this game when I first read reviews, mainly because of the concept. Giant 
 robots? Giant ants? UFOs? Rocket launchers? Sign me up. When it came out I rented it as soon as 
 Blockbuster got it in. I spent seven hours on it that night with a friend. The game is highly accessible, 
 utilizing basic third person shooter controls. If you've ever played any game involving a gun before, 
 you'll have no trouble picking up the controller and playing. The Y axis can be inverted if you 
 prefer, and the look sensitivity can be adjusted. The control scheme works fairly well, and suffers 
 only in the area of jumping and dodging - the moves are mapped to the same button, making it difficult 
 to jump on the go (I somersaulted and ran into things as opposed to jumping over them much of the 
 time) but both dodging and jumping work well when applied to appropriate circumstances. If you 
 like to shoot things - lots of things - EDF will appeal to you, as long as you're not looking for 
 any amount of depth. Beyond running around and blasting the living daylights out of everything 
 that moves, you won't be doing much, unless you decide to jump into one of the four available vehicles (after 
 which you continue to blast the living daylights out of everything that moves) . The vehicles themselves 
 are powerful, and definitely enhance your overall ability to decimate both the landscape (more on 
 that in a moment) and the enemy hordes (more on that, too) . One thing they can't do, however, is 
 navigate. The mech suit Vegalta probably aims the best, but walks about as fast as a tortoise who's 
 ingested Nyquil, and can't turn to save it's life (literally.) The air bike is fast, but blows up 
 easily, and has beans for firepower. The helicopter has both a powerful machine gun and a rocket 
 launcher capable of rapid fire, but takes forever to become airborne and is nearly impossible to 
 turn around with. The tank is probably the most manageable vehicle overall, but is difficult to 
 aim with and lacks range. The vehicles are optional though, and you can complete any mission without 
 using them. They're pretty much just there for kicks. Perhaps EDF's true value, however, lies in 
 it's nostalgia. The enemies range from Giant ants to UFOs to towering mechanical behemoths, and 
 even a few dinosaurian creatures that blow fire and destroy everything in their path. The enemy 
 roster and the plot of the game harkens back to the days of Godzilla: King of The Monsters, Them!, 
 Plan 9 from Outer Space, The Angry Red Planet, the Mysterians, and any other number of sci-fi classics 
 from the 50s, 60s and 70s. To fans of these films, EDF is a godsend. The plot is your basic, Aliens 
 are invading the planet , but that's about as far as most of the movies it pays homage to went, 
 and for this type of game, it works like a charm. Videogames rarely tread on this sort of ground, 
 and it's a pleasure to see one that does, and does so well. The environments are almost fully destructible 
 - only the ground is immune to your attacks. Everything else, from the buildings, cars, lamp posts, 
 even the trees, can be knocked over, destroyed, and blown up. It will make you nothing short of 
 giddy to hurl a barrage of rockets at an enemy mech, miss, and take down three consecutive skyscrapers 
 some miles away. The graphics are great, and while you will occasionally be terrorized by popup 
 as you progress through the world, everything around you looks brilliant. The enemies (especially 
 the robots) look just like you think they should, right down the to hairs on the giant tarantulas. 
 EDF is not without it's problems, however. The shallowness of the gameplay wears thin after awhile, 
 as does the repetitiveness of the missions. The difficulty of the Hardest and Inferno settings 
 can at times be ridiculous, as it does not so much challenge the player as it does overwhelm them 
 with ridiculous and unreasonable odds. Pretty much the only way to succeed at these higher difficulty 
 settings is to attain some of the game's more powerful 150 weapons which can only be done by, guess 
 what, completing levels at a higher difficulty. This paradox will cause you great frustration, 
 but it is hardly a game-killer. Overall, EDF is a game made for fans of shooters, and outrageous 
 retro sci-fi. If you're partial to either one, or like me, both of these things, then you'll find 
 a lot to love in this game.

Review:  If you would have told me a week ago, I would be writing a glowing review on Earth Defense Force 
 2017, I would have paused, laughed, asked for another Pepsi, and booted up Gears of War. The fact 
 is, E. D. F. 2017 is just such a unique, incrediblely addictive, refreshing, FUN game that should 
 not be missed by any gamer that likes to blow the crap out of giant bugs, robots, aliens and a 
 few other nasties. The amount of shooting you'll do in this game makes the Serious Sam series look 
 like Duck Hunt. But, for whatever reason, this really never gets old. It's VERY addictive, very 
 satisfying, unique and just plain old school fun. It has a 1950's B movie, Japanese influence groove 
 going on with it, which I believe this gives the game that unique charm I'm speaking of. You also 
 have cpu squad members running along side of you yelling the most wacky, army guy, macho, one liners 
 that are truly very funny. I couldn't even start with how many weapons you'll unlock... I'll just 
 say everything . Assault rifles to bazooka's. There are a ton. Oh, and the best part..... MECHS. 
 Tanks. Helicopters. When you find these vehicles, hop in, and it's D. O. T. (death on tap) . There 
 are 5 difficulty levels, randomness to when you load a new mission. I love that part. It will randomize 
 where you start out at. Graphics are very good. It's no Gears of War or GRAW 2, but they are very 
 nice. And the sound, as I touched on earlier, is awesome. The control is just perfect. Only thing 
 I would add is a sprint button to get a super boost out of harms way sometimes. You run by default, 
 but a sprint would be a welcome addition. And there is a little strategy involved. Such as how 
 to approach some enemies, having some height advantage on bridges, and what weapon load-out to 
 take with you. (Your only allowed 2 weapons on missions) . I think also, one thing that is very 
 cool is, you run through city streets hunting down the enemy. One minute you could be leveling 
 a big bridge, then in a park battling 50 foot robots. Again, the combat is very unique and refreshing. 
 In closing, I really hope E. D. F. 2017 does well enough to warrant a sequel. This could turn into 
 a great francise with endless content to come up with. If it doesn't, I believe this will be one 
 of those games, that the company didn't plan to produce alot of copies of, that may become rare 
 over time. IMO. I would most def put this game on my shelf with my Oblivion, GRAW 1 &amp; 2, Gears 
 of War, Rainbow 6 Vegas, Lord of the Rings /BFME 2 for games I would never part with. It's that 
 fun and unique. :)

Review:  This game sets out with some ambitious goals, and completes most of them. Considering the budget 
 this game probably had, they did exceptionally well. The good: 53 missions. 150 weapons. Over-the-top 
 alien killing antics. Very high amounts of fun. Achievements are actual achievements. When someone 
 looks and sees that you've beaten the game on Inferno: Instant respect.
  
  The bad: Vehicles are annoyingly wonky, especially the mech. No falling damage for you or the enemies 
 (what's the point of collapsing a 50 story builing if it isn't going to crush the ants scaling 
 it?) . Crap animations. OK graphics.
  
  My hope is that this game will be a proof of concept, and will allow D3 to give Sandlot more money 
 for a second iteration. I get goosebumps thinking of this game with Lost Planet graphics and Gears 
 of War detail, on Xbox Live Co-Op with 5 of your best buds. Put in some Halo-esque vehicle control, 
 and add some Crackdown explosion physics and that will be a game I'd pay $60 for.
  
  Here's hoping for Earth Defense Force 2019.

Review:  I was completely surprised with this. EDF is no Halo or Graw2 for sure but there is a certain amount 
 of entertainment.
  
  EDF does not pretend to be anything other then the fact you blow stuff up.
  
  EDF is hardly 
 cutting edge next gen gaming but it somehow pulls off a enjoyable afternoon with the wife on player 
 two just point and kill shooter this game reminds of Starship troops bugs! lots of the dam things.
 
  
  In the first ten levels or so youre killing ants, great big ones.
  
  EDF game style is like the games of the 80s point shoot, pick the pickups weapons health the standard 
 sort of thing. Game play is much the same each level but mech suits, tanks and helicopters to mess 
 around and a little battle mode for one on one action.
  
  Of course co-op mode (not live) but my wife and myself have just sat through the first 11 levels
 
  
  EDF is a laugh especially two of you playing. Now for &pound;25 (GBR) and if you buy on line you 
 could pick it up for under &pound;20 its a cheap way to waste a weekend or the school Easter holiday
 
  
  Theres not any long term play but with Easter coming up Parents could brighten up any gun tooting 
 kids boring school holiday with a little surprise gift.
  
  Of course EDF wont be setting any records and will be in the second hand bin before too long.
 
  
  And points 1000 points for not very much work everyones a winner

Review:  I'm a lover of Hectic third-person shooters, Hack'n'slash, Sandbox games, and/or anything with 
 extreme amounts of destruction and /or blood and gore. So I saw this game in blockbuster and said, 
 Hey it cant hurt to give it a try right? Well about one or so hours into it, I've probably blown 
 away or shot up dozens upon dozens of alien bugs and robots and friggin' buildings. It was weird, 
 I noticed tons of flaws and some glitches but I couldn't stop shooting or destroying. It was mindlessly 
 fun destruction and hectic-chaos! With weapon galore. Lemme break it down like this:
  
  Story: You can straight up read that s**t in the manual. It's not bad, We discover alien messages 
 and try to communicate, Few years later and still no response. We make an Earth Defense Force thingy 
 just in case, and then another few years later the bug-like and robot-like aliens attack earth 
 and of course, They call out the Earth Defense team yo. Easy to understand, Very simplistic. 53 
 missions aren't all going to be intelligent ,
  (Unless it's oblivion, Tee-hee.) So you choose two guns before starting, dropped off in a remote 
 area and destroy said aliens and whatnot in the proximity and Mission Cleared! Sometimes you might 
 get health upgrades or a new weapon, depends if you picked it up or not. But there's a solid amount, 
 With Machine guns, shotguns, rockets, grenades, and special weapons. All-in-all: Just kill, the 
 story wont bust a nut if you dont pay attention and kill aliens.
  
  Sound: Action-wise: Awesome. Even with the screen shaking with fighting the sounds play out the 
 way the should, Buildings hit the ground like carboard but thunder pretty well. Guns have their 
 own sounds and do their job. Now voice wise: SO FREAKING ANNOYING. Your squad of other commandos 
 repeadetly scream and yell or question things. And the Chick talking in your head is dumber then 
 Max from Bullet witch (Seriously, She is.) She points out the damn obvious. Aliens in front of 
 you! No crap, That's why we have a map you harlot! All-in-all: The good fighting neutrals out with 
 annoying chatter.
  
  Graphics: Well, It's 360 so I was pretty impressed. Somethings could have looked alot better. Like 
 when you shoot a car with a rocket, That s**t should explode you know? Not flip, still in one piece, 
 and land lightly on the ground.
  There was really not dust that would kick up from explosions hitting the ground, no craters either. 
 The only dust was from buildings falling. The only true destructible thing in the damn game. Sure 
 you can knock around things on the street but they never break up. The enemies were pretty varied 
 and unique, Nice designs but they would lock up when dying and move around like a box, not rag-dolly 
 and jiggly as if, of course, Oblivion or any game graced enough to have a Havok physics engine. 
 The skeetong blood from the aliens being ripped up with bullets was nice, but again it didn't spread 
 out or look too pretty really. All-In-All: Alright graphics, No revolutions here, Just decent graphics.
 
  
  Violence: My segment. Again, Skeeting blood to a T extent. It was aright, Box like dead bodies 
 could have change you know? More dead-like... Not box-like. But the hectic chaos of action and destruction 
 was good enough to keep me distracted. All-in-all: Ok violence.
  
  ALL-IN-ALL: RENT, JUST RENT. Maybe not even. Only if you like the game-types I said I liked. Then 
 you'll find some enjoyment like I did. Not alot but enough to keep me satisfied. Hecticness galore!

Review:  Earth Defence Force 2017 is not a great game. The Graphics could have been done much better for 
 the 360. The environment is pretty blend, eveything looks the same and it gets really boring to 
 look at it. The overall game play in this game is pretty simple. Giant ant things and robots invade 
 the city and it is your duty as a earth defencer is to clear the city and save the world. When 
 you kill the ants they drop items that increase your health and that gives you new weapons. When 
 you get into a vehicles the combat doesn't get any exciting. Also the game gets very very repetitive. 
 The music in this game sucks. because there barly is any. the sounds of the guns and the exploding 
 rockets isn't any better. Overall i can't such much about this game cuz it really sucked. if your 
 looking for a shooter for your 360 this is not the one you should pick up.

 loves it more power to you, but if you havent played it, dont, or at least dont pay to do it, borrow 
 it from someone else who was misfortunate enough to buy it.
  
  gameplay.
  
  aim, shoot. that's it!
  you can jump, but only forward, you cant strafe and jump you have to 
 turn to the direction to jump,
  
  graphics,
  
  they're in hd, but that doesnt make em good!
  
  there are about 900 or more buildings on the 
 map all of which blow up with just one rocket, sure it's fun to blow em up, but after about 100 
 the only thing keeping you going is that you want to see if there is some kind of achievement for 
 it....
  
  i gave this game a 1
  i dont know how it could possibly ever got over a 4....

Review:  I'm not gonna lie to you this game kicks ass. I only got it today and the only reason im not playing 
 it right now is because i had to let my dogs out. I've alredy killed about a billion giant ants, 
 blown up countless building decimated hordes of robots and brought down giant ships that were as 
 big as a city. and im only oy mission 12 of 53. The only let downs would have to be the graphics. 
 They are a bit on the last gen side. And the achivements kinda suck the only ones are for beating 
 the game on each different difficulty level. And getting all the weapons. But if with 5 different 
 difficulties, 150 weapons and split screen coop I'd say this game is well worth the $40 price tag

Review:  Well, the best way I can describe Earth Defense Force would be to say it is almost like Dynasty 
 Warriors with guns. This game is a very simple, easy to pick up but extremely fun game. First of 
 all the game is like a cheesy movie script with the whole alien invasion and its huge bugs, stuff 
 like that. With giant Ants, Spiders, Robots, and spaceships, this is one of the funnest games to 
 hit the Xbox 360 yet and at a very good price (39.99) . It's basically a budget game, but if you're 
 playing co-op there is a lot more strategy to it (especially on harder difficulties) . What weapons 
 to take? What points to attack from? But it doesn't go very deep which could be its downside. I, 
 however, am currently addicted to this game. I've played through the game once and I plan on playing 
 through every difficulty. I'd say if you want a fun game that really doesn't require too much thought 
 and you have a friend to play with pick this up for the budget price.

Review:  My review deck sums it up. Shooting the living hell out of thousands of bugs and watch them explode 
 in bright blasts of blood is a lot of fun ( I have no idea why the hell this is Teen rated....) 
 The plot? What plot? Compare this to Gears of War and Gears looks like Shakespear. The graphics? 
 Fair, the charcater models all look repetivie and there's a lack of good effects. The sound? Meh. 
 But what this all boils down to is: The gameplay? Oh yeah. Blasting around in this action/ RPGish 
 game is a ton of fun, and I thought that is was MUCH better than Lost Planet. The action is like 
 playing Starship Troopers, with elements of (I do not lie) Godzilla, Terminator, and any Japanese 
 B-movies. So, really, this game plays ridiciouslly, and I think that helps it. You can collect 
 weapons and health, and that is actually a great feature. It adds a little RPG to it, and everything 
 could use a little RPG in it. The co-op is just great! Really, if It is fun to play through with 
 one person, having a buddy help you is awesome. So far, I have made EDF 2017 sound like a retarded 
 cousin of Halo that is better than a 7.5. Well, it's not. A few things hinder it from being great. 
 First: The game is.... simple. Unless you are in a vehicle you don't even have to use A, B, X, 
 or Y. Disapointing, no? Also, the game plays like an acarde game trapped in the 360's body. The 
 over simplicity really hurts the game in my mind. But hey, it redeems itself. So, if you like dumb 
 B-movies like Them, or ridiciouls action, then I highlly recomend this, I think it's worth your 
 $40. If not, then rent, at least just to check it out.

Review:  I loved this game, the game had it flaws but every game does. i was really suprized at how fun 
 the game was, i had a blast playing it on easy and another beating it in co-op on hard. the game 
 is really hard on hard-inferno, you pretty much are going to need to play co-op to beat harder 
 levels. too bad there isn't any online co-op... sigh.. but this game really appealed to me because 
 i thougt it was awesome that the monster were freaking huge, it's pretty crazy also it was really 
 intense in time, like the last level, very intense, and hard. probally the most strait foward battle 
 but really instese cause there were ships everyware, plain awesome. if you have 40 bucks, and you 
 like arcade type games, buy this. plus 53 missions, 150 weapons, fun stuff, i have been playing 
 for 12 hours and i only have 57 weapons, some are plain crazy though.

Review:  We've all seen those stupid movies on the Sci Fi channel, you know HUGE bugs coming from outer 
 space to wreak havoc on earth. Yeah, we've all seen them and we all sit there saying to ourself 
 this is so dumb... why am I still watching it? And you sit there, asking yourself that question 
 but never stop watching. Thats the way Earth Defense Force 2017 is, its just a stupid game but 
 you can't help but play it. It by no means is a technical marvel, and most professional reviews 
 have noted that. But those reviews have also noted that EDF has got it where it counts, the gameplay. 
 It's just fun, and thats what games are meant to be. Gamespot put it best by saying it's dumb fun 
 There is something just so appealing about going around and shooting the crap out of giant bugs.
 
  
  The negatives are mostly just technical issues. When there are a lot of enemies (like the first 
 time the aliens air fighter fleet comes) there's some slowdown. The graphics and sound are your 
 standard affair. But at $40 USD, you can't go wrong with this game.
  
  EDF is most likely going to be a sleeper hit / cult classic, and hopefully it being well received 
 is another step closer to D3 bringing more dumb fun Japanese games to the US like Oneechanbara 
 Vortex

Review:  The Good: It's cheep, there are over 50 levels and over 100 different weapons, tons of giant things 
 to shoot, lot's of destruction, co-op on the same Xbox.
  
  The Bad: No online functionality whatsoever, graphics aren't so stellar, voice acting is pretty 
 bad.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  
  Earth Defence Force is another Japanese title that has been made a budget title for American Xbox 
 360s. This one is actually a remake of a Playstation 2 game, made exclusively for the 360. In the 
 game, you play as a soldier of the EDF or Earth Defence Force deployed only when there is an alien 
 attack. The first major extraterrestrial attack happens in the year 2017, where giant bugs and 
 robots are destroying cities and it's up to you to stop them.
  
  EDF is very over the top, and is intended to be. You can use around 130 different weapons to take 
 down wave after wave of oversized baddies. You can also destroy the city for fun, and fun it is. 
 It feels like a combination of Crackdown's setting with one of those cheesy 1950s monster movies. 
 EDF isn't a complicated game. You find giant enemies, kill them, pick up new guns, then kill some 
 more until you clear each stage. That's it. Luckily, there is over 50 stages, so you won't run 
 out of stages for at least 5 or so hours. The game has 5 different dificulty levels and each has 
 an achievement for beating the game on said difficulty, so you'll have to kill a lot of giant ants 
 to get all 1000 points. The last achievement is to collect all of the 100 plus weapons, which probably 
 won't be done in just one play through. The game also features a co-op mode where you and a buddy 
 can play through the game as a team. Unfortunately, it's not online, so you'll have to play on 
 the same Xbox. The graphics of EDF aren't that good, but the ability to destroy buildings with 
 heavy weapons is a nice touch, except for the fact that you take no damage at all if one should 
 crumble on top of you. The voice acting in the game is really cheesy and quite bad, but you can 
 get past that because the game is quite fun.
  
  Overall, as long as you don't expect that much out of Earth Defence Force, it's a solid budget 
 title that will give you hours of enjoyment. Now go kill some aliens!
  
  Gameplay: Over the top enemies, tons of weapons and arcade feel make EDF a very fun game to play.
 
  
  Graphics: Not so great, but the crumbling buildings is a nice touch.
  
  Sound: The voice acting is bad, but the rest of the sound effects work well.
  
  Value: It's 
 budget priced at $40 for an Xbox 360 game, but waiting until it's down to $30 or so isn't a bad 
 idea.
  
  Final Thoughts: We're going to need a lot of bug spray...

Review:  The graphics are simple but good, the game play is fast and easy to pick up and play , but just 
 expect to get what you pay for. The game is simple, Shoot everything on screen kill it go to the 
 next level ,
  all though fun at first it gets boring fast, the 2 player coop split screen is the best part of 
 the game, online play would have been a plus but there is none The game is what it is a $40 budget 
 title that should have been $20. at least That would have made it worth a purchase but as it is 
 i would wait on a price drop or give it a rent

Review:  It's not often that a game like this comes around. A game where bad voice acting, borderline stupid 
 story, dated graphics and completely over-imagined enemies... is actually what makes the game good. 
 EDF plays out exactly like a japanese B-movie, which right away means the game will not appeal 
 to everyone. Imagine Godzilla, Starship Troopers, Lost Planet and Independence Day (the movie) , 
 and you'll have something close to EDF.
  
  The story is basic, and really not at all interesting because it's been told a million times before. 
 Big space bugs come to earth, terrorize humans, threaten humanityblahblah, yeah, we know. And there 
 are the higher level bugs, some robots and the like to keep it varied. You are a hotshot in the 
 Earth Defense Force (EDF) and your job is to kill things for the sake of the earth.
  
  The gameplay is just simple, in a good way, all you will do is shoot things. Sometimes with a vehicle, 
 but usually with one of several weapons you will find. Some of these are interesting, but most 
 are just the standard shooter fare. They all come standard with unlimited ammo, so fire away.
 
  
  Really, one of the things that makes this game so humorous is the fact that it makes zero attempt 
 to explain itself in any way. In the future (10 years from now) one rocket will bring any building 
 down, bugs will invade using spaceships and the like, guns will all have unlimited ammo and still 
 require reloading, assault rifles will hold 150 rounds in a magazine smaller than that of an M16... I 
 could go on.
  
  Graphically, the game is so-so. The models and environments look OK, if a bit plain. The effects 
 are terrible aside from a few decent explosions. There are upgrades to collect, and they are all 
 2-D cardboard cuts. Remember every item in Doom? Thats seriously what they look like. The game 
 keeps a stable framerate until you start getting into explosions or harder difficulty levels, where 
 the enemy numbers grow.
  
  Sound really brings the term B-movie to mind, with horrible voice acting and generic gunshot and 
 boom boom noises. It's a riot in itself to hear your fellow soldiers yelling when they get hit, 
 or trying to shout macho man lingo right before they die. Remember the line 'Godzilllllaaaa!'? 
 Thats seriously what the voices sound like. The menus are easy to navigate, yet there is an annoying 
 woman who feels the need to read you what every little thing does, then explain it in great detail. 
 There is no way to shut this woman up, and its minor at best, because you'll spend very little 
 time in the menu.
  
  There are 50 something levels, all of which boil down to the same thing. Some can last a reasonable 
 amount of time (5-10 minutes) and some can be finished in extremely short times, one mission lasting 
 about 30 seconds on normal difficulty. When it comes down to it, EDF is a game with limited appeal, 
 fans of Japanese B-movies will love this game, as I did, for the sheer craziness and ridiculousness 
 of it all. Not to mention, this game was a b*tch to find in stores.

Review:  Good: You get to shoot giant ants; graphics are smooth, but not good; tons of weapons to use; the 
 god-awful voice acting; the plot is so unoriginal that its actually good; two player coop is restricted 
 to split-screen, no online, but its surprisingly fun.
  
  Bad: Extremely arcade-like game play; frame rate goes WAY down sometimes; no online coop; the enemies 
 consist of creatures from an alien film 20 years ago.
  
  Wow, theres so much to say about this game its hard to start. First off, the plot is pretty low, 
 in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this was actually based off of a 1970's alien movie. Aliens 
 have invaded earth by mother ships, and they are a group of passive-aggressive ants. Thats right, 
 in 2017, giant ants will have created giant floating space ships, and large mechanical robots. 
 If that doesn't make you laugh, the voice acting will.
  
  WARNING!!!
  (These are actual conversations between soldiers.)
  
  Soldier 1: Are you scared? 
  Soldier 
 2: Thats not True! 
  
  Soldier 1: I'm reloading! 
  Soldier 2: Alright, I will do that! 
  
  Soldier 1: Sir yes sir! 
  Soldier 2: Thats not true! 
 
  
  Wow, my guess is that random phrases are programmed to occur at random times. Soldiers act like 
 complete psychopaths and oftenly talk to themselves. This isn't a bad thing, it actually is very 
 funny just to hear what there saying. The script for the game is also laughable. In the intro the 
 announcer says That looks like something is from a comic book! This was obviously translated from 
 Japanese to English very sloppily. The game play feels solid and there are plenty of weapons. One 
 weapon is a big suitcase that launches out turret guns twice as big as the launcher. Another weapon 
 is a missile launcher that has the speed of a tortoise, its actually called the Tortoise and you 
 can walk faster than it, I'm not even kidding, you can literally walk faster than it. And nothing 
 is more precious than watching the missile follow an ant. They just keep walking and it will never 
 hit. Another great gun is the grenade launcher. It can destroy a 200 story building. In fact, every 
 single explosive, no matter the size can destroy any building. When the building falls it looks 
 great. But after it, it looks like a big pile of Lego pieces. There are like 50 missions, and it 
 takes some time to pass through them. The achievements are pretty lame but it should be easy to 
 measle out 300 or so. The music in the game is actually pretty good. Its generic, but it fits the 
 already cliche theme. You got to love the physics though, if you shoot a car with a sniper rifle, 
 it will be launched 600 feet in the air. Sky Scrapers can collapse from a grenade, and giant ants 
 dead corpses become stiff statues that rest on the ground. At least the coop is fun, its not online, 
 but if you got a bud, if you can convince him to play with you, its surprisingly fun, just don't 
 show him/her the box of the game, say its Gears of War in the Xbox, and act surprised when this 
 loads up.
  
  Overall, Earth Defense force is basically a big joke. Its pretty fun, can get repetitive, but no 
 where else can you get as great of voice acting and no other game provides as good as a script 
 as this. It can be a great challenge on harder modes, without a partner you'll most likely give 
 up after you get owned by the acid spraying from the ants asses. Graphics aren't anything to get 
 excited over, sound is alright, the value is great considering its only $40.00 and no other game 
 is like this. This is a one-of-a-kind, don't miss it, its pretty rare due to its low popularity.

Review:  This is a good game but it is hard to write a review.
  
  It's hard to explain exactly what this games about. The game is FUN to play and hours and hours 
 can be spent with a buddy blasting bugs and shouting out obscenities at giatn robots and motherships. 
 Even with this in mind though it's hard to give an accurate review on a technical basis. The game 
 is lacking in many departments on terms of visuals sound and controls. But don't go into this game 
 thinking or hoping for revolution.
  
  This game knows what it is and is fine with it. And that is a quirky simple japanese super action 
 random craziness game. Almost as if katamari had a rocket launcher.
  
  The game is fun as long as you don't go in expecting much more. It's a budget B title but if you 
 fo into it knowing this you'll LOVE the game. I've put about 15 hours today alone just trying to 
 get new weapons and get my lil' guy stronger so he can tackle the insanely tough higher difficulties.
 
  
  It's quirky it's stupid it makes no sense, but grab a buddy some dominos and a 2 liter of cola 
 and you'll have a blast (pun very much intended) .
