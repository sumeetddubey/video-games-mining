:::Review:::
NHL 2K8 is a generally fun hockey game, though its new control scheme is a step backward for the 
 series. 

  For years now, 2K Sports' NHL 2K series has been the gold standard for hockey games, both in gameplay 
 and depth of content. But over the last couple of installments, a trend has been developing. While 
 certain strides have been made to improve various aspects of the game in each installment, these 
 changes have become less and less significant. Last year, most of the work went into the presentation, 
 which left the fun yet aging gameplay engine much the same as it was in NHL 2K6. In NHL 2K8, the 
 gameplay has been reworked in some key areas, but many of these changes don't really improve the 
 gameplay so much as change it for the sake of changing it. There isn't the feeling that 2K8 has 
 really moved the series forward in any major capacity, and in some regards, it feels like a step 
 backward. This is a good game of hockey that's jam-packed with features, but it's nowhere near 
 the level of quality the series has previously set for itself.  

           2K hockey takes a step backward in NHL 2K8.      

  Most people's first reaction to 
 NHL 2K8 will probably be, "Wait, what the heck happened to the controls?" That's because the controls 
 in 2K8 have been completely reworked, and not necessarily for the better. For example, shooting 
 and passing have been mapped to the bumpers on the Xbox 360 controller, and to the R1 and L1 buttons 
 on the PlayStation 3 controller. On top of that, the L2/left trigger buttons now act as a modifier 
 for slap shots by default, so if you want to do one, you have to hold it down  and  press the shoot 
 button. While this does make things a bit more involved than the age-old methodology of hammering 
 on a shoot button until the puck goes in, it also makes the early hours of the game kind of a pain 
 as you try to figure out how to effectively shoot the puck. You will get used to it, but even once 
 you do, it never feels quite right.  

  The other big change to the game is the "pro-stick," otherwise known as 2K's attempt to rework 
 the right analog stick into something more than just a way to pull off a preset deke. Essentially, 
 you can now use the right analog stick to move the puck from side to side on offense, and to swipe 
 and poke check on defense. Unfortunately, it isn't actually that useful in most situations. On 
 the defensive side, the poke check feels very hit-or-miss, and it actually felt better last year 
 when the poke check was just a button press. On offense, you get a decent range of motion when 
 moving with the stick, but the responsiveness just isn't there. The stick isn't dynamic enough 
 to really let you move the puck quickly, and for the most part it simply feels stiff. Given that 
 EA pretty much set the hockey world on fire with its skill stick mechanic, it's understandable 
 that 2K would want to come back with its own right-analog-stick innovation. It's too bad that this 
 one feels more like a half-cocked knockoff than anything else. If you're going to try to match 
 someone else's gameplay innovation, go all the way with it. Don't deliver something that's only 
 half as useful.  

  The control goofiness doesn't end there. There are now two speed bursts in the game, one of which 
 is the standard, sustained speed burst, and the other is a real quick burst that's supposed to 
 push you past defenders for a breakaway. They don't really feel much different from one another, 
 save for the fact that one ends sooner; you just end up feeling that the second speed-burst button 
 could have been used for something more useful, like, say, icon passing. For some dopey reason, 
 icon passing has now been mapped to the select button on the PS3, and the back button on the 360. 
 Given that you can use this feature only when you're in the offensive zone and have control of 
 the puck, you have a very narrow window of time to turn on icon passing and set up a play. Fumbling 
 for the least accessible button on both controllers to engage icon passing is the opposite of fun, 
 and often leads you to lose the puck when you get checked out of your skates.  

  Which brings up another issue with NHL 2K8: checking. Checking is always fun, especially when you 
 knock a guy flat on his back, but the amount that you can check and the frequency of big hits in 
 2K8 is just crazy. Every check seems to knock a guy off his skates, regardless of size or strength. 
 On harder difficulty settings, it seems as if the artificial intelligence is a bit better about 
 avoiding your checks, but you can still lay out opponents in ridiculous fashion. Never, ever in 
 a million, billion years should the 5'9", 165 pound Steve Sullivan be able to lay out the 6'9", 
 260 pound Zdeno Chara on the ice, short of putting rockets on his skates and holding his stick 
 out like a lance in a jousting contest. But lo and behold, you can do it here. This is supposed 
 to be a realistic simulation of hockey, but at times, 2K8 feels as if it has more in common with 
 Midway's NHL Hitz series than the real-life sport.  

  Granted, that's a lot of negative talk for something that is, by and large, a good hockey game. 
 For what it's worth, there is good to be found here, though a great deal of it is due to holdover 
 mechanics from previous games. 2K8's method of goalie control is still the most enjoyable interpretation 
 of the position to be found in any game, and the game still uses the best default camera angle 
 in the business. Apart from the stiffness of the right-analog-stick controls, the rest of the controls 
 are quite responsive. Moving up and down the ice feels great. You also have the option of switching 
 to one of the older control schemes from previous years, though that essentially makes you feel 
 like you're playing last year's game, instead of a new iteration.  

           All the various control tweaks and added maneuvers eventually become workable, but the 
 learning curve to get there is pretty irritating, and the end result still doesn't feel remarkably 
 better than the old controls.      

  There are also a couple of new things in this year's game that definitely benefit the overall experience. 
 First are the superstar moves, which are a roster of maneuvers that only top-flight forwards are 
 capable of pulling out. By holding down the left trigger/L2 button and pressing a combination of 
 two of the controller's face buttons, your forward will go into some kind of ridiculous animation 
 before shooting the puck in ridiculous fashion. Whether it's faking a whiff, spinning like a top, 
 or pulling a Marek Malik-style through-the-legs shot, these moves are awesome. The only bummer 
 about them is that their usefulness is so limited. They're absolutely great during shootouts because 
 they let you get real fancy against opposing goalies. But in traffic, you're more likely to get 
 slammed to the ice than you are to pull off a 360-degree spin before shooting the puck. There are 
 also so many moves that it can be difficult to memorize all the different ones, meaning you might 
 occasionally pull out the wrong moves at the wrong times.  

  Another useful change is faceoffs. You use the right analog stick to set where you want your stick 
 to be prior to a faceoff, and release it the second the puck is dropped. If you and your opponent 
 end up hitting at the same time, it will result in a tie-up, and another player will have to skate 
 in and grab the puck. If you time it just right, you'll knock the puck back to one of your teammates. 
 It's a neat system that feels much more like real faceoffs, though you do seem to end up in a few 
 more tie-ups than is realistic.  

  Lastly, and perhaps most beneficial to the game overall, is scoring. Yes, the shooting controls 
 are a bit of a pain, but by some miracle, the actual scoring in 2K8 feels much, much better than 
 it has in previous years. This is specifically because the one-timer no longer feels like the only 
 way to score. You can actually hit big slap shots from the point and get them redirected by your 
 teammates into the net, or pull off quick wristers on the breakaway and actually have them go in 
 with proper consistency. It's a shame that most people might not even really notice this, given 
 the weird control scheme and silly amount of checking, but it is a big improvement.     

  2K hockey has always been about incredible depth when it comes to gameplay modes, and 2K8 isn't 
 a disappointment in this regard. Once again, the developer has delivered the deepest and most involved 
 franchise mode of any sports game on the market. The biggest change is to contract negotiations, 
 which have been totally overhauled into something more reminiscent of actual negotiations. Whenever 
 you want to re-sign a player, pick up a free agent, or sign a member of your draft class, you're 
 going to find yourself initially quite far apart in terms of money. A meter dictates where your 
 owner wants the contract to be versus where the player's agent wants to be. Your goal is to try 
 to get a player for as cheaply as possible while still giving some leeway to what the player wants. 
 It's a tug-of-war that actually feels really authentic, right down to how you or the player can 
 just up and walk away from the negotiating table when either side feels things aren't going right. 
 Knowing when to walk away is, in itself, a skill to be learned, considering that at times players 
 will simply cave and ultimately agree to your terms when you opt to walk away.  

           Keen negotiators will be able to sign guys on the cheap -- less keen negotiators will be 
 paying out the nose.      

  It goes even deeper than that. The collective-bargaining agreement between the league and the NHLPA 
 has been implemented here with such detail that casual players are likely to roll their eyes back 
 in their heads and pass out from trying to absorb all this information. For the most part, the 
 game does a good job of explaining what each feature does, though some are left a bit opaque. For 
 example, restricted free agents are kind of left on the fringe. The game never really makes clear 
 what happens when you propose qualifying offers that players don't sign, so you may be initially 
 confused as to why you have these guys you didn't sign still sitting around on your roster. It's 
 just a very complex system that requires some research and occasional bouts of fumbling around 
 with to finally grasp.  

  Most every other feature from previous years is on hand as well, including all the various management 
 and coaching duties (assigning practices, balancing line chemistry, and the like) . Rookie scouting 
 seems to have disappeared altogether, though it's been replaced with more generally accurate and 
 intuitive info about all the rookies in the draft class right from the get-go. There's also a whole 
 new player-development system in this year's game, though quite frankly it doesn't make a ton of 
 sense. After every game, players earn experience points that seemingly are there to build them 
 up and improve their stats. The problem is that you never really get a good sense of how the game 
 does that. You get these reports that show where players are in their development, but the whole 
 thing just looks like a big jumble of arrows and names. The 2K hockey games have always had issues 
 with menu and interface design, and this whole system seems like a big victim of that specific 
 issue.  

  Of course, this wouldn't be a 2K hockey game if the franchise mode didn't come encumbered with 
 a few bugs and quirks. One of the weirder features from previous years was the whole "opportunity 
 knocks" system, a feature in which the team owner can essentially call you, and as a result something 
 either good or bad can happen to your team. In this year's game, the amount of bad that comes from 
 this feature is so lopsided that it pretty much makes ignoring it a better option. On top of that, 
 sometimes it will actually cause bugs within the game. We had one situation where, while playing 
 as the Devils, we took an "opportunity knocks" call right at the end of the season and before the 
 playoffs. It was a bad one, and essentially sent Dainius Zubrus away from the team for seven days 
 due to a "death in the family." The trouble is that he wasn't gone for only seven days. He was 
 gone for the entire length of the playoffs. It's as if the game treats the playoffs as a single 
 week, and as a result, that player was lost for the duration.  

  There's also some weirdness with the waiver wire. The game includes a realistic waiver system in 
 which players with one-way contracts that are sent down to the minor leagues get put on waivers 
 first, and any other team can claim that player. You periodically get notifications in your e-mail 
 box about players that are put on waivers, but the game never actually tells you how you're supposed 
 to put in a waiver claim for that player. Other teams can snake your players (and often do) when 
 you send them down, but the game isn't up front about how you can take advantage of this same procedure. 
 There's also a bit of insanity when it comes to which players are put on waivers. Half the notifications 
 we got were for players rated 85 and up. You know something's busted when Jason Spezza, 2K8's cover 
 athlete, is getting put on waivers in the middle of the season.  

  Apart from franchise, the usual modes are on hand as well, such as season mode, tournaments, pond 
 hockey, minirink, and minigames. Most of these modes haven't been touched in any meaningful capacity. 
 In fact, the minigames haven't been touched at all, to the extent that they still use  last year's 
  control scheme. Online play is also largely the same. Tournaments and seasons are available to 
 play in the league option, and they're functionally identical to last year's game. The online games 
 we played were basically lag-free, though all online games evidently run at about half the frame 
 rate of the offline game, so you'll notice some significant and irritating choppiness when you 
 hop into the online arena. We also ran into some connection issues with the PS3 version of the 
 game.  

  NHL 2K8's graphics are a notable improvement over last year's game. Obviously, one of the bigger 
 improvements is animation, specifically those awesome-looking superstar moves. But there are other 
 animation upgrades spread throughout the game that are more subtle, yet more realistic-looking. 
 Goalie animations in particular look a boatload better this year, and you'll actually see goalies 
 come out to challenge for the puck, and drop into some pretty elaborate stances. The ice deforms 
 better than any prior year, and player models have gotten a nice boost in detail, especially in 
 the jerseys and equipment. Player faces still look a little bit funky in spots, but they aren't 
 awful-looking by any means. Incidentally, the cinemotion feature from last year is still on hand 
 this year, though it's turned off by default, and hasn't really seen any significant changes -- which 
 is odd, considering how highly touted a feature it was in last year's game.  

           Player models have seen a jump in overall quality, but this isn't the best looking NHL 
 game out there.      

  Audio is pretty much on par with last year's entry. Commentators Bob Cole and Harry Neale seem 
 to have a bit more to say this year, though again, their commentary largely turns into white noise 
 after a while because little of it has much substance beyond basic play-calling. The soundtrack 
 is another quality collection of pleasantly listenable indie rock and metal tracks (with Korn's 
 "Blind" tossed in there for some weird reason) . The on-ice effects are about on par with last year's 
 game, save for a few missing sounds during certain scenarios. (You hit the puck, so why didn't 
 it make a connecting sound?)  

  There's no arguing with the notion that NHL 2K8 is a good, solid hockey game, but in the wake of 
 strengthening competition, the franchise seems to be withering a bit. It's like the cagey old veteran 
 that has to put up with a number-one draft pick vying for his job. Eventually, that veteran is 
 going to lose a step, and that touted player is going to step in. That doesn't make the veteran 
 useless, given that he can clearly still contribute, but he's no longer the superstar of the team. 
 That's what happened this year. 2K8 lost a step when it made its bizarre control-scheme changes 
 and failed to really improve much of the rest of the game beyond the franchise mode. You'll have 
 some fun with NHL 2K8, especially if you're a franchise-mode fiend, but overall, it's just not 
 up to the standards this series has reached in the past.

Review:  Though certainly not the best hockey game ever made in it's time 2k8 nails most aspects you would 
 like to see done well, and does it pretty well. Puck handling is great, along with the checking. 
 However sometimes rather lacking AI in the game was a rather tiresome pain in the butt. Season 
 mode is also done well, along with the fantasy drafts, trading, stats, and all that extra fluff 
 outside of a actual hockey game. Best to play if your expecting to have some friends or family 
 to play with. Great game to pick up if your looking for a cheap buy, or even a less expensive rental. 
 So what are you waiting for, go play it, or a 2009 game lol.

Review:  There is no better hockey sim than 2k8. Everything is here and then some. What really makes this 
 game is its addictiveness and challenging characteristics. It draws you in with slick controls 
 and keeps you there with devastating checks. The way checks feel and look are my favorite part 
 of this game, and the one timer is almost as satisfying. Scoring is a little harder to do, which 
 is an improvement because in the last installment, i would win on the hardest difficulty by at 
 least 5 goals. This is the only sports game where you constantly feel the beat in ur chest. Its 
 because goals are so rare, and the action never stops that the game constantly makes ur heart race. 
 You will be screaming at the TV for all three periods whether ur winning or losing, guaranteed.

Review:  I've been reading the other reviews and see that people are complaining about the all new control 
 interface. It took me 2 quickgames to and training to get used to it. And even my friends picked 
 it up after a little bit. It can be frustrating at first, but stick to it, it's worth it.
  
  As I myself am a hockey player, this game is as closed to real hockey as it gets. (Until they 
 make virtual reality!) The new stick handling mode is amazing, and the faceoffs are actually fun 
 now. You don't just keep pressing the button untill that pesky ref drops the puck. Swipe your stick 
 to early and they will swap you out. I'm also amazed with the new goalie system, who are a lot 
 more intelligent. The CPU players are getting smarter as well, pushing you to the outside and setting 
 up some sweet plays.
  
  If you think this is going to be another easy hockey game, think again. I dare you to win the stanley 
 cup on hall of fame mode. As a matter of fact, i dare all of you big hockey fans to try this game 
 out for yourself.

Review:  http://www. projectcoe. com/microsoft/games/nhl_2k8_360. html? var1=sc3
  
  Regardless of how well you know me, I'd like to again point out that I'm one of few American staffers 
 here at COE that also happens to adore the world of hockey. While I don't necessarily live and 
 breathe it like I do gaming, it's been a significant part of my life since the Penguins' '91-'92 
 Cup years. I even played on the street for casual fun when I was in fifth grade, but that was short-lived 
 for reasons I don't feel the need to delve into. To replace that, I've been a staunch fan of playing 
 hockey in videogames, and it started with NHL '94, which most fellow hardcore NHL supporters associate 
 with quite well. After being used to the hit everything in sight arcade style for so long, I wondered 
 for a long time if a simulation would ever come about. Well, times have changed, and EA's NHL 08 
 managed to finally draw me in after three years of avoidance and left me mostly satisfied. Can 
 2K do the same with their often superior product?
  
  Well, NHL 2K8 is simply a mixed bag for me. The game executes a handful of concepts very well, 
 but doesn't in certain key areas. Let's start with the core presentation. The menus are laid out 
 in a way that mostly makes sense, utilizing a hierarchical structure to group necessary items together. 
 Even the team you select as your favorite has a nifty highlight filmstrip that scuttles along at 
 an angle towards the right-hand side. When it comes to the actual hockey games, the pre-opening 
 faceoff that serves as a hype booster is suitable, with the home team's logo lit up on the ice, 
 animating in different ways while the away team is booed, and the home players are announced to 
 the frozen sheet and cheered for. The models in their own right look good, as a surprising amount 
 do nicely to reflect their real-life counterparts; I just couldn't shake the feeling that they 
 come off as little plastic-like, especially in the facial department. The equipment looks awesome 
 though, as it's all official stuff, and can vary from player-to-player. The overall arena environment 
 has its ups and downs too. The ice looks great, with all the standard painting underneath and ads 
 littering the sideboards (and degradation that happens over time from the skating) , but what's 
 up with the crowd? Neither EA nor 2K could pull off a proper bunch of fans, as the ones in 2K8 
 just look silly when they animate, and some apparently managed to forget their tickets, because 
 there are one-too-many empty seats. At least this is made up somewhat in part with the player animations 
 and movements. While not perfect, it's so much better than last year, and the goalies operate in 
 extremely realistic fashion. My biggest gripe about the whole package is the Cinemotion, that was 
 so heavily promoted last year, seems to have been tossed to the wayside. Where are the locker room 
 cutscenes, where's the feeling like you're really witnessing the drive and determination of your 
 players as they band together and support each other on the ice? I didn't see any of that, and 
 simply wondered n disappointment.
  
  That brings us to what usually supplements the topics just covered when it comes to delivering 
 an exciting hockey game, the sound department. I'll just come right out and say it, I'm appalled 
 with how bad the commentary in 2K8 is. Harry Neale and Bob Cole either need better writers or just 
 a whole new recipe for motivation, because I've never heard a more monotonous and robotic broadcast 
 in my hockey gaming life. It's already bad enough that the two's exchanges sound so unnatural, 
 but the fact that they repeat every single line I can remember from 2K6 and 2K7 is both pitiful 
 and unacceptable. I realize that the duo is infamous in Canada, where everyone believes hockey 
 matters most, so that could just mean my American nature makes me biased against them, who knows. 
 But seriously, I couldn't stand them after three games, so off they went in the game's sound options. 
 Now to an extent, the handful of licensed songs (regardless of the bands' reputations) and in-game 
 sounds do the game some justice, but it's not enough to save what should be an emotional athletic 
 videogame from inane announcing and an almost total lack of on-ice player interaction. Although 
 2K Sports was on to something when they implemented the option for players to dedicate custom playlists 
 to specific aspects of the game. The concept isn't entirely original given that you can listen 
 to your transferred music whenever you wish on X360/PS3, but it's neat that you can allocate specific 
 songs for specific things in 2K8.
  
  For all intents and purposes, just as it is for any sports game that exists, the real meat of the 
 game cooks underneath the whole mess of menu selections. NHL 2K8 does a few things that I was mostly 
 impressed by gameplay-wise, but when it comes to core controls, they really need to go back to 
 the drawing board. One thing that stands out in this hockey title is the Face-Off system. No longer 
 are you simply pressing a button or pulling back on a stick to gain possession of the puck after 
 the drop. With this concept, you hold the right analog stick in the direction that your player 
 would in the actual game to place his stick properly, and then you wait for the guy in black and 
 white to drop the rubber disc, and hope you come away with it. It's not that simple though. If 
 you go for the swipe too early, the referee warns you for being preemptive, and then after a momentary 
 skate around, your center goes back to the face-off circle. Be guilty again, and you're waved out 
 completely, and one of your wingers comes in to take the job. Even more intriguing is how Joe Thornton 
 of the San Jose Sharks helped the developers in implementing the tie-up, meaning if both centers 
 engage the puck at the appropriate time but neither is quicker, they end up in a physical scuffle 
 in which you can then use your skates, stick or other teammates to win possession of the burnt 
 biscuit. That's not all. As your current line's center, you can even command one of your wingers 
 to cause a ruckus to annoy the referee, which can generate buzz from the fans. The only thing that 
 bothers me about the end result is that early swipe warning and tie-ups happen more often than 
 you would see in real-life, which somewhat hurts the authenticity. But still, a great idea, and 
 I look forward to seeing perfected execution of it.
  
  What isn't so great is the seemingly evolved Pro Stick, which is a noticeably blatant attempt on 
 2K's part to rip-off EA's Skill Stick. On the defensive end, it's fairly useful because you can 
 shift the position of your wooden puck handler in each of the cardinal directions, which allows 
 you to intuitively poke check the rubber disc off an opposing player's blade. On offense though, 
 it's as good as pointless because deking is mapped to a button, and trying to use it properly at 
 that rate just doesn't feel natural. Sure you use it to precisely pinpoint your shot's location, 
 but it's not even remotely as rewarding as EA's engine. That brings us to my biggest gripe about 
 NHL 2K8, and that's the control complexity. Let me establish something first. I don't necessarily 
 have a problem using button combos to do a hockey game's actions, because I've done that since 
 1994 and it's very familiar to me. However, with what EA managed to accomplish in requiring only 
 the triggers, bumpers and two sticks on the controller to deliver a simulation-driven experience, 
 going back to a 30+ combo system now feels archaic and cumbersome. I'm sorry, but when a mere slapshot 
 requires directing both sticks at the same time, whilst holding a trigger and then pressing another 
 top button, all I can think of is meh at that point. That isn't to say that playing 2K8 feels broken, 
 because that's certainly not the case, it just seems like a gargantuan step backward for not 2K 
 hockey, but the genre as a whole. The game is still pretty fun if you put your mind to it, but 
 that's a tough thing to ask for when there's competition that offers a more seamless experience. 
 Although, it simply can't go without being mentioned that if you love arcade-style hockey, you 
 know, being able to deck anyone on the opposing team to the ice regardless of your player's physical 
 stature, then 2K8 would definitely tickle your fancy. Even on the Simulation play style preset, 
 I noticed way too much illegal contact, but hey, if that's your favored way of playing hockey, 
 by all means check this out. Finally, the Superstar Moves is also an interesting idea, and its 
 implementation isn't too shabby. Whenever you feel it's appropriate, holding the left trigger and 
 inputting a two face button combo causes your skater (if they're skilled enough) to pull off an 
 slick looking trick that basically tries to score and embarrass the opposing goalie at the same 
 time. It's useful when you know what action you input (there are over ten of them, good grief...) , 
 but when you don't, you're bound to look like a complete idiot when you initiate a sick maneuver, 
 only to either miss the next by a longshot, or hit the side of it.
  
  The last major feature I'd like to point out manages to be a strong point for NHL 2K8, its Franchise 
 mode. Not only are all the minor league (AHL) affiliates present, but the system that the new CBA 
 (Collective Bargaining Agreement) employs is very much in effect here. You can manage player contracts, 
 trades, training and skill evolution as you see fit. When negotiating with free agents, the game 
 encourages you to control the deal for your prospective employee when it comes to financial and 
 yearly terms. If you don't have a backbone, your wallet suffers. If you know how to handle a superstar's 
 ego and stand your ground with his agent, you could score an all-star winger for half his original 
 bargaining price. You can also run a trade search, which basically allows you to enter information 
 regarding what you're looking for in a transaction, and the game notifies you if something that 
 closely suits your needs manages to pop up. The same goes for the waiver system. While it's weird 
 that the game doesn't tell you how to acquire minor league-bound NHLers, knowing that you have 
 access to other teams' trash so to speak is pretty cool. Then of course you can allocate practices 
 and training at your discretion and literally handle your team as you see fit. Just be prepared 
 to witness the good and bad, because management in any job market has its ups and downs.
  
  Ultimately NHL 2K8 is a victim of trying to bring a franchise into a new era, while failing to 
 leave old baggage behind. The Face-Off system is great, the Pro Stick certainly has potential and 
 the Franchise mode is better than ever. But when everything else either feels ill-contrived or 
 poorly executed, it rears a nagging feeling in the back of your mind. Even the online component 
 is fairly barebones, with only Quick Match and Ranked Match play offered, and leaderboards that 
 show just how unpopular the service is. No one's played more than 80 games on there yet, which 
 tells you something. Still, not all has been lost in what for many years had been the preferred 
 hockey game, but for the 2007-2008 season, competition finally showed up, and ended up taking home 
 the prize of overall quality. There's always next year, and here's to believing in a developer 
 that we know is capable of re-emphasizing what fans have come to love, while doing some new things 
 that would bring the package together just a little better.

Review:  Yes, there is a learning curve. A pretty big one...
  
  I've been a fan of the 2K series of hockey for a while now. The EA version is too arcade-like for 
 me. 2K has had just the right amount of everything to make it the best hockey game out there. I 
 was really excited to get my hands on this game. Right off the bat, you'll notice a huge change 
 to the controls. I was taken back by them. At first i was thinking ok sweet, more control, this 
 is gonna take some getting used to, but it'll be awesome . I became more and more frustrated as 
 time passed, and began to get the sinking feeling that my beloved 2K series (my rock, the one that 
 always pulls through) was going down the drain. I turned off the game.
  
  I pick it up again the next day. Same feeling. 60 bucks down the tubes. Then i happened to catch 
 a game on tv, like 4 or 5 days later, and it made me want to play. I had more time to spend with 
 it, being my day off. I went into practice mode, fiddled around, tried out the moves. ( It was 
 very hard, when you are so used to playing with the same controls forever, then have completely 
 new ones implemented) (i imagine it being like if madden had completely different buttons, from 
 what we've been conditioned to play with all these years)
  
  Anyway, i practiced. slowly.... over the course of a few days, i began to get my timing down, started 
 to get a better feel for what was going on. And slowly... it started to grow on me. After playing 
 it for a while now, I have no doubt in my mind that THIS game is by far the best in the series, 
 and best HOCKEY game, period. i still don't know all the moves, and slip up from time to time, 
 but i think that's great. Presents more of a challenge.
  
  It takes patience. It's not something you just pick up and play. (i always used to play 2k7 with 
 buddies. they haven't played 2k8 yet, and if they did, they would totally be lost)
  
  Basically if you've played the 2K series, you need to recondition yourself. Other than controls, 
 there are little improvements here and there. The player animations are much improved, offense 
 and defensive Ai is better, and the franchise seems a lot more streamlined. all in all, i think 
 this is a great game. In the end i'm glad i spent the 60 bucks. I'm a HAPPY camper !!!!

Review:  Well by now you've probably read a number of reviews on a bunch of websites (gamespot included) 
 that say that this game is not all that great and that you should go with NHL 08 this year. While 
 I cannot tell you whether NHL08 is better than NHL2k8 (I highly doubt that after playing the demo) 
 I sure can tell you that you cannot go wrong with NHL 2k8 if you like real hockey simulation.
 
  
  I think this game is perfect (or almost perfect) in almost every respect. The animations are smooth, 
 most of players look good, commentary is awesome, franchise mode is extremely deep, and most importantly 
 the gameplay is just exceptional this year. I can go on and on about how fun, entertaining and 
 realistic 2k8's gameplay is but I can just tell you that I and two of my friends were playing this 
 game non-stop until 4am last night and we had tons of fun.
  
  Of course there are a few things here and there that can be frustrating. First of all (and I think 
 this was the biggest concern for a lot of reviewers out there) is the difficulty of adjusting to 
 the new controls. Yes, it takes some time to get used to them, but after a few hours of play I'm 
 sure you'll feel right at home with the new controls and you will not want to go back to the old 
 ones. Also, if you learn how to use the Pro Stick, you will have tons of fun playing the game. 
 Another thing that I think disappointed me in this game is the music. It is not all that great. 
 BUT you have an option of playing your own music, so there is a solution. The last minor thing 
 that I did not like about the game is how the menus look. They are not really all that great, especially 
 if you compare them to NHL 08's, but I guess that's always been the case with 2k sports and nothing 
 new here.
  
  All in all this is a must-have game for a true hockey fan. I strongly recommend playing it and 
 enjoying the beautiful game of hockey! :)

Review:  Nhl 2k8, the newest edition 2k sports has to it's nhl series. It is definitely 2k's best game, 
 but it cannot compete with nhl 08. It's graphic's are great, but 08's are better. It's gameplay 
 is great, but 08's is better. It's a good game, but ea's 08 is just a step ahead of it . It's just 
 hard to compete against a highly touted company like ea. If you want, it's worth buying for the 
 mini games. And the Franchise mode is just no good. I'd but it when it cost like 15 bucks in a 
 year or so. If you really want, it is'n terrible, just there is nothing special about this game.

Review:  The major complaint from most people this year is the controls. Now it is very true that the controls 
 are a little on the complicated side at first, but the training mode offered by 2k this year really 
 does help, and after a few games, the controls really grow on you. I personally prefer these controls 
 to EA's game. I believe they offer a higher level of control. Instead of being confined to left 
 and right, your player has 360 degrees of movement with the puck. Another cool thing about the 
 controls that i think 2k pulled off better than EA is the impact of player attributes on stick 
 control. a player like, say, Pavel Datsyuk will have way more control with the puck than a guy 
 like Brian McGrattan. The truest accomplishment in this game is the Franchise mode. It is every 
 hockey nerds dream. every year they seem to add something to the franchise mode that just ups the 
 bar from the year before. This year, you have to provide prospective free agents with a tempting 
 and competitive team if they are to consider joining your squad. You will no longer see guys like 
 Patrick Elias or Simon Gagne signing with teams like St Louis or Florida simply because they throw 
 the most cash around. they also added UFA and RFA status to free agents. They caught all of the 
 nuances that all franchise modes should have. Another overlooked part of this game is the create 
 a player. Every piece of equipment the pros wear (Even Selanne's old Jofa helmet!) are there. The 
 gloves your players where are completely customizable, so they can be just as cool or ugly as you 
 want. create a team is also pretty cool, but i don't usually play around too much with that feature. 
 I personally recommend this game for hockey fans this year.

Review:  this year 2k8 let me down, now before you jump down my throat let me say that i've had every 2k 
 hockey game since 2k5, i jumped ship then for the money. it was only 19.99, but stayed for the 
 awesome controls. last year i played 2k7 into the ground, so much so that i actually tried 07, 
 which i thought was complete and utter garbage. so this year i couldn't wait for 2k8 to come out. 
 I bought it first and ran how with it only to be... confused. why are the controls so retarded, 
 oh i get it it wants to be like winning eleven, and i admit i was fustrated at first but i stuck 
 to it and learned the controls great but after that i was just unimpressed by the AI and unrealistic 
 play. the game plays like a midget roller hockey game, and the defensive controls are way too good. 
 i know that sounds funny, but i held a team to 3 shots, and scored 7. i really tried to love this 
 game. hopefully next year they can rebound and grab me back from EA otherwise i may have to hang 
 myself.
  -graphics-
  the graphics still lag behind EA, they are better but the goalies look like giant pillsbury snowmen, 
 and there animations are just god damned ugly. all the equipment was awesome though.
  -gameplay-
  the controls still are better than 08 for defense, but for offense 08 really shines. 
 the skill stick is too slow, and ripping a slapper takes way to long. i was able to score some 
 amazing goals though, and was left with a real sense of satisfaction, although i think it was because, 
 half of my game was against the AI, half against the control scheme
  -presentation-
  the commentators put me to sleep. it sounds like two canadian robots set to boring. EA was much 
 better.
  -features-
  the skill stick was a cheap rip off, i'm suprised that 2k, master of control couldn't improve on 
 EA's feel. Franchise is ridiculously deep. realistic CBA. and the camera is still the best ever.
 
  -conclusion-
  i tried to like it i did. if your into s&amp; m, and self torture buy this game. otherwise jump 
 ship for one year and hope that 2k gets it right. hmmm maybe EA will buy 2k, then they could use 
 EAs graphic engine and skating engine, which is the most realistic, but improve the controls.

Review:  NHL 2K8 is still a great NHL game and much more improved since last year in the sim department. 
 First off the controls: the pro-stick which allows you to basically move the puck from side to 
 side or front to back but it's not so fluid to make it perfect but it will get the job done and 
 makes goals much better ( especially 1-ON-1's or shootouts) . The pro-stick also doubles as your 
 poke check when your on defense you'll aim where you want to poke and it pokes thats better then 
 last year because this gives you more control, makes it more realistic. Your also able to lay your 
 stick down on the ice (just click in RS) to block a pass or shoot it's just adjusted but since 
 you don't have much time to press multiple buttons a mini improvement. The other main control changes 
 for those curios to know RB-shoot, LB-Pass, RT-turbo, A-sprint (faster then turbo) , B- fast deke, 
 X-intense contact, Y-block/dive. You can change your controls to classic or whatever past setting 
 you want. The Goalies have also changed better animation, smarter A. I. they will charge you on 
 a break-way or recognize who to watch on an odd man rush. With the new goalie system you'll have 
 to play a lot better defense you have to get to those rebounds quickly, never let an open man go, 
 in the past you might have left your goalie take a break to kill the oddman now the cpu will make 
 you pay and you can still score with one-timers but on a realistic scale the goalie will recognize 
 a one-timer opportunity. On the flip side you'll get a good chances to score with rebounds goalies 
 won't pop up after stacking the pads, your player don't delay to rebounds or if you see an opening 
 to get off a wicked wrister you'll have a realistic chance to beat the goalie.
  
  Checking this time is toned down the cpu won't be check first, puck second unless you get too close 
 to the goalie (of course) , if you don't have some momentum (unless your an enforcer) your not going 
 to do much and the animations are more realistic you'll look like your putting your shoulder into 
 someones chest. The Fighting is the same it just takes a little bit longer to lose (or in my case) 
 win a fight, the camera now shaky and is loose some like it some don't not a big thing. Franchise-mode 
 like always is improve you'll have restricted, non-restricted free agents, players on waivers, 
 two/one way contracts. Players models are much better most players will looks like their real life 
 counter part, you'll notice a lot of detail on the jerseys, equipment which you can edit and choose 
 from a variety when you edit or create a player There are other little things that you'll notice 
 now like all of your body parts will count from your chest to the tip of your blade in the past 
 only the cpu would seems to register. The puck will now acts more realistically last version you 
 would shoot a puck, it would bounce off the goalie then land a few feet in front of him or the 
 puck would hit off the post, it would shoot off to the side like clock work sometimes now the puck 
 will act way more realistically it will hit the tip of the goalie and stay in front of him or hit 
 the post but not shoot off depending how hard you hit it of course.
  Last thing the menu is way different you can either use the right stick to navigate the menu or 
 use the classic way (A button) . If i missed anything i will try to add it later.

Review:  I reviewed 2k7 last year and said it was way better then ea. This year both games are very good. 
 I buy them both every year and i see the trends change from year to year. Gamspot..... 7.0 is to 
 low. Even with all the great things you said about it you give it a 7? But lets talk about the 
 game. The by far best and biggest improvement are the goalies. Thank god. After playing all the 
 cheep people online who did the stupid back hand goal. IT was starting to piss me off. The goalies 
 come out, challenge you, make jaw dropping saves ( and it rare to it dose not get repetitive) . Another 
 thing people are complaining about is the controls. Wow stop you bi*ching and go to the menu and 
 change them, Damn. I use the pro classic controls. The deeking is very fluent and solid. I can 
 do some pretty sick stuff with that stick. But its hard when the ai is pretty good 2. The super 
 star moves are kinda a waste of time during regular action. But when it comes to the shoot out. 
 These moves are freaking cool. I feel the trigger button shooting is very cool. in pro classic, 
 x is just to do a hard wrist shot. which u weren't able to do before. The defensive controls are 
 also used with the prostick. That takes time to get used to. You have to sit back and wave you 
 stick around like a mad man to poke the puck away. But it works. Hitting and checking gets out 
 of control in default settings. I set the sliders down to 10 on the hitting and its soo much better. 
 No more flatting out players in the middle of the ice. The new face off system is the best out 
 of any hockey game. Another great thing about the game is one times are instant goals any more. 
 I miss the new more then I hit it. Plus the goalies are just that much better which of course makes 
 it harder. Why are people complaining about the announcers too? Jeeze what else are they going 
 to say. they added thew new player names in them and i hear a couple of new phrases now and then. 
 Also hockey night in canada guys grow on you after a while. At first there annoying but after a 
 while you start to like them. Every game is not perfect. There is a couple of things i do not like. 
 Such as 30 fps when you vs some one in a lobby or ranked game. however when you play some on in 
 a private game or league game it runs a lot smother. If you are having trouble with the controls 
 do the tutorials to get used to everything. Also make sure you mess with the sliders to adjust 
 the game to your settings. If you do not play online. theres hells a lot to do for single player. 
 Create a player is great, and so is create a team. 2k has always been the leader in hockey video 
 games. This year they have a strong competitor in EA. But give the game a chance, mess around with 
 the controls, play around with the sliders. This game has way to much to offer to let it go down. 
 Thanks for reading my review. The EA review soon to come.
  (p. s. damn stupid rating change system i wanna give it a 8.7 &gt;:-o)

Review:  the game started out with a funky new interface, and at first, mind blowing control scheme which 
 took many a training sessions to get down. but after that was completed everything fell back into 
 place. most the reviews, and even gamespot noted this, but this game deserves a MUCH better review 
 on the fact you can CHANGE back to the old controls, plus the new controls are overwelming with 
 many different options with the simplist being the puck handling to wrist shots and slap shots, 
 to even kicking the puck from foot to stick. of course, the gameplay remains as strong as ever 
 with the great defense and offensive ai to challenge with. now when you go in on a fastbreak you 
 have the options you NEVER had before in any hockey game ANY. 2k did try something different, and 
 die hard gamers with patience will enjoy this great game of hockey, all others will miss out and 
 shoot one wide.

Review:  The Good: Graphics are amazing - New controls are a pleasure to learn - Superstar moves add a whole 
 new level to the game - Training mode is very helpful and gives you everything you need - Franchise 
 mode is incredibly deep, and so much fun - Challenges to unlock new teams are difficult but rewarding 
 - Goalie AI is spectacular - Online leagues are the best in the business
  
  The Bad: Framerate slows down a tiny bit in online - Controls take a while to learn NHL 2K8 is, 
 contrary to popular belief, is a great hockey game. The controls are hard to get used to, but they're 
 definitely worth the effort. The franchise mode is pure bliss, and it has so many options that 
 you'll spend a lot of time just finding out what they are. The Pro Stick is very intuitive and 
 works well, and scoring a goal with it feels very rewarding. The online leagues are a lot of fun, 
 and once you get really involved with them, it's even better. The graphics are smooth and detailed, 
 and everything just looks great. The Verdict: If you like hockey, you should definitely buy this. 
 If you don't, rent it and I think you'll like it.

Review:  After playing for about 5 hours I'm still not completely used to the new controls but I can comment 
 on alot of the features of the game. I would like to add that I've played well over 200 games of 
 2k7, so I am no rookie to 2k hockey games.
  
  One thing i have noticed is that apparently someone forgot that when you shoot the puck, the impact 
 of your stick on the puck makes a sound. Because this sound is non existent. Also if your wondering 
 what hitting the post sounds like, well thats easy, it doesnt make a sound either. The framerate 
 online is horrible. It runs fine playing single player, but everyone ive played online the framerate 
 has been lackluster.
  
  Superstar moves - interesting concept, but little to no functionality. If you can actually get 
 your player to hit the net when you pull a move off thats an accomplishment in its own. But these 
 moves rarely fake out the goaltender so why even bother?
  
  This game just looks like there was no effort put into it. I was playing San Jose, and Joe Thornton's 
 player picture came up and it was STILL the picture he took when he was on Boston. How does something 
 like that make it into a game 2 years later? If you played alot of 2k7, then you probably noticed 
 there was a bug with last minute real time, and that injuries didnt work online. So did 2k solve 
 these issues this year? No, they just removed the features completely. Again, lack of effort.
 
  
  I will say that the controls take alot of effort to get used to, you basically have to play with 
 both index and middle fingers on the bumpers/triggers in order to be able to use everything. If 
 you can find a way to feel comfortable playing like that you will fit right in.
  
  I have been a fan of 2k hockey for a long time, but this game has really disappointed me and that 
 really had to require alot of effort.
  
  One positive aspect of the game is that the goalies are great! There are lots of new animations 
 and they are really intelligent. 2K8 has much improved AI and excellent player models, but really 
 falls short in the gameplay aspect which they are known to really deliver. What happened this year 
 2k?
