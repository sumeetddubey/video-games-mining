:::Review:::
Namco Museum is an impressive collection of classics that span the entire history of arcade gaming. 
 

  Although Namco Museum Virtual Arcade on the Xbox 360 may not blow value-conscious minds the way 
 The Orange Box did last year, this title includes some fantastic games for a modest entry fee. 
 The Xbox Live Arcade games are the central draw, but some of the classic games that round out the 
 collection are impressive enough in their own right.  

  There is a litany of Pac-Man inside, including  Pac-Man ,  Ms. Pac-Man , and a full version of 
 2007's addictive  Pac-Man Championship Edition . Pac&amp; Pal and Super Pac-Man join two 3D Pac-Man 
 games, Pac-Mania and Pac-Man Arrangement, in filling out the circle of the yellow protagonist's 
 games. Pac-Mania is still a not-so-impressive faux-3D entry from the late '80s, whereas Pac-Man 
 Arrangement is a fully 3D redux of the original Pac-Man game. Both games are novel for the first 
 level or so, but fail to amount to anything beyond more Pac-Man. Super Pac-Man is hands-down the 
 best of the retro Pac-games included in the Pac-section. You start with pellets walled off behind 
 closed doors. You must first eat keys to open gates and then devour the red pellets hiding inside. 
 The ghosts return to chase you around, but because you can grow in size it becomes more and more 
 difficult to evade your pursuers. This makes the whole experience more challenging and enjoyable. 
 Pac&amp; Pal is a less-than-novel return of the Super Pac-Man gameplay. It is differentiated by 
 the addition of a similarly nondescript green friend who wanders the levels and picks up items. 
 The gameplay is slower and the pal is not much of a helper.  

           Pac-Man Arrangement is just more Pac-Man with gussied-up graphics.      

  If you tire 
 of gobbling up pellets with the artist-formerly-known-as Puck-Man, the full Xbox Live Arcade versions 
 of  Galaga  and  Galaga Legions  are included. Anybody who has yet to face the waves of pattern-approaching 
 enemies is almost sure to enjoy tearing through Galaga Legions' five levels. Sure, it's punishing, 
 but within the portfolio of Galaga games on this one disc, you can see what an impressive evolution 
 the game series has undergone during its more than 20-year span. Galaga '88 added colorful new 
 enemies, vibrant backgrounds, and the opportunity to start the game with two ships instead of one. 
 This Galaga Arrangement is clearly the missing link between '88 and Legions. It has large bug bosses, 
 increasingly challenging waves of enemies, and is segmented into enjoyable, progressive levels. 

   Xevious  is part of the collection, as is the classic  Dig Dug . When played alongside the included 
 Rally X,  New Rally-X  shows how relatively indistinguishable the two are. Finally,  Mr. Driller 
 Online  returns with a functioning online mode. The games formerly released on Xbox Live are playable 
 only via the Xbox Live Arcade section of your dashboard (as long as the disc is inserted) . It isn't 
 much of an inconvenience, but it does become tiresome to navigate in and out of menus to work your 
 way around to the games you want to play. The versions included on this disc are fully compatible 
 online (where applicable) .  

  Of the classic arcade games included, two dominate the pack: Dragon Spirit and Rolling Thunder. 
 Dragon Spirit is a top-down shooter in which you play as a dragon breathing fire on flying foes 
 or bombing ground-based targets like in Xevious. You can grab power-ups to grow additional heads 
 or give your breath more heat. Rolling Thunder is a secret-agent side-scroller that pits you against 
 an unending host of hooded enemies and cackling aliens. You must jump between floors and duck into 
 doors to replenish ammo and discover new weapons so you can defeat the secret organization bent 
 on world domination. This game combines '80s action-movie sensibilities with a '70s-inspired soundtrack 
 that ensures this caper never gets old.  

  The rest of the games are more of uneven in terms of quality. Grobda, a top-down tank shooter, 
 is quick, vibrant, and feels like an exciting mix of Time Pilot and the tank minigame from Tron. 
 Other shooters such as Baraduke, Bosconian, Sky Kid, and Sky Kid Deluxe don't offer as much entertainment. 
 Pole Position and Pole Position II are brought out of the garage, but dated racing games aren't 
 very exciting, so it's unlikely that anybody will be compelled to take them out for a spin. Galaxian, 
 the Space Invaders-like cousin of Galaga, is also included. What is left is a few mediocre platformers 
 such as Mappy, Metro-Cross, and two modest fantasy RPGs, The Tower of Druaga and Dragon Buster. 
 Fans of the pin-battle minigame from The World Ends With You are likely to recognize Motos, but 
 unlikely to care about knocking bland shapes off of a tiled board. Finally, King &amp; Balloon, 
 Dig Dug II, and Dig Dug Arrangement complete the retro museum menu.  

           Dragon Spirit proves that two heads are better than one when facing legions of foes.  
     

  The price of Namco Museum Virtual Arcade is significantly less than the price of admission for 
 the component Live Arcade games. Although most players are likely to already have one or more of 
 the included games, many of the scores of other games are just as enjoyable now as they were back 
 in the day. Despite reduced resolutions of some back-catalogue games, there are some superb shooters 
 buried in this uneven collection that are likely to satiate even the most discriminating player. 
 It is those precious few that make this collection so valuable.
