:::Review:::
EA's latest NHL title creates one of the most legitimately exciting interpretations of the sport 
 you've ever played. 

  EA's NHL 07 redefined the hockey genre with one simple feature, the skill stick. Though the game 
 had few modes and several artificial intelligence issues, its star play mechanic worked brilliantly, 
 and created a great rebuilding point for the franchise. As you would expect from a follow-up, NHL 
 08 takes what 07 did and stacks a bunch of improvements on top of it. The AI has been thoroughly 
 reworked, so it now looks and feels much, much more like the real-life sport. Throw in some balance 
 improvements to the skill stick, a gaggle of new online modes, and an improved dynasty mode, and 
 you've got an all-around great hockey game.  

           EA-branded hockey takes a big leap forward in NHL 08.      

  For lack of a better 
 term, NHL 08 is just a smarter game of hockey than 07 was. Pop in 07 for a few minutes before starting 
 in on 08, and you'll see a night-and-day difference between how players behave in each version. 
 For one thing, 08 is a slower-paced game than 07 was, though not to the point of feeling sluggish. 
 Part of that is because the game has done away with speed burst mechanic, and part has to do with 
 skating, which has been redone from the ground up. The momentum of the skaters as they move up 
 and down the ice simply feels more natural and less overblown, and the pacing of the game is much 
 more realistic. On offense and defense, player behavior feels correct in most every situation. 
 Setting up power plays and other elaborate passing schemes is more natural than in any EA hockey 
 game to date. When you push your way into the offensive zone by yourself, the defense doesn't just 
 try to knock you silly every single time. Defenders will actually poke check, try to push you toward 
 the boards, and close the gap to the net. It's like watching real defenders, instead of the robotic 
 hitting machines from earlier EA hockey games. You'll occasionally see some dopey moments where 
 guys on your team skate right past the puck or stand still in front of the net even though they're 
 getting hammered left and right, but these aren't the norm.  

  Incidentally, it pays to vary up your offense as much as you possibly can this year, because the 
 defense will actually adapt to your plays. If you keep moving to the center of the ice and slapping 
 it in, the AI will react accordingly and start clogging up that area. If you're constantly trying 
 to set up elaborate one-timers, the defense will see it and attack accordingly. The reactions to 
 your repetitive play are almost uncanny. The one goofy thing about this adaptive AI system is that 
 it doesn't differentiate among players and teams; Johnny Oduya is just as capable of figuring out 
 your tendencies as Scott Niedermayer is. While it's better to have everyone be smart versus everyone 
 being an idiot, a bit more differentiation between skill sets would have been nice.  

  If you find yourself running into trouble, the game is quite good about letting you know what you're 
 doing wrong. Between periods, a screen will pop up telling you what you're doing well and what 
 you need to improve on. Specifically, it'll tell you things like your forechecking needs to improve, 
 or that you're doing a great job of getting shots on net. In another helpful feature, if you're 
 getting too predictable on offense, the commentators will actually point that out. It's subtle, 
 but if you're paying attention to what they're saying, you can get some sound advice.  

  As far as control goes, the skill stick feels even more refined this year. There aren't any major, 
 game-changing differences to the mechanic, but all told, it just feels smoother in its movements. 
 Goals scored are rarely alike, and it's a thrilling feeling to fake out the goalie and knock the 
 puck in with a few quick flicks of the stick. And though this seems like less a change to the stick 
 and more a change to the goalies, glitched and otherwise wonky-looking goals are much less frequent 
 this year. You'll still see some highly questionable ones on occasion, but there are very few of 
 those weird goals from 07 where the puck would bounce off every body part of the goalie before 
 eventually donking its way in. Now, if EA could just fix it so your stick wouldn't clip through 
 defenders' legs anymore  

  One specific new feature for offensive controls is loose puck deking. To pull one of these off, 
 you hold down the L1 button/left bumper, and press both analog sticks in the desired direction 
 of the deke. It's a tricky maneuver, as you're basically letting go of the puck and trying to push 
 your skater into exactly the right spot to pick the puck back up once he's past the defender. The 
 timing is tough, and if a defender happens to decide to check you right at the time you're trying 
 to pull this off, you're hosed. Once you get a good handle on the timing, however, the move becomes 
 incredibly effective -- maybe even a bit too effective. Fortunately, not every skater can pull these 
 moves off with a deft touch, but if you've got a one-on-one matchup against an opponent who has 
 the timing on these moves down and a good skater holding the puck, watch out.  

  Defensive controls haven't seen much change, though there are some balance tweaks. The poke check 
 feels a bit more effective this year, though it still looks weird and awkward, and the control 
 mechanic of holding the right bumper/R1 button and swinging with the right stick still feels cumbersome. 
 Checking with the right analog stick is much more understated this year, but that's not to say 
 it isn't effective. You can still wind up for a big hit and send a guy crashing into the boards, 
 provided you can actually time such a hit correctly. But by and large, most checks don't just knock 
 guys silly all the time -- and that's a good thing. You'll knock guys off the puck periodically, 
 and sometimes checking won't do anything. Most of all, checking feels balanced. The big grinder 
 types do a lot more damage than the little speed wingers, and that's how it should be. Lastly, 
 the game does feature slightly improved goalie controls that actually make a measure of sense and 
 let you challenge skaters effectively, though this control method still isn't as much fun as 2K's 
 goalie control.  

           Signing players in dynasty mode actually works correctly now.      

  One of the big 
 complaints about NHL 07 was that it was a barren wasteland for game modes. It didn't have much 
 of a dynasty mode, and online play was just laggy head-to-head play. Both areas of the game have 
 significantly improved this year. Dynasty mode finally features a realistic negotiation system 
 for signing players, as well as more helpful rookie info and better coaching and management options. 
 The negotiation system addition is a big one, since you can no longer just cherry-pick every free 
 agent player you want. Players will actually take into consideration any offers made by other teams, 
 and they'll take a few days on the calendar to come to a decision. You'll even get rejected for 
 more reasons than simple money issues. Players will actually say they don't think they'll get enough 
 playing time on your squad, which is pretty realistic in the current NHL landscape, where plenty 
 of quality role-players are heading overseas due to the lack of good job opportunities here.   
   

  All told, the mode is still nowhere near as deep as what 2K's game offers, but it's largely a step 
 up. The only stupid holdover issue of the mode is that any free agent you sign still automatically 
 gets dumped into the minor leagues, where they don't count against the salary cap. Last year you 
 could pretty much just sign any players you wanted and trade them for less expensive players you 
 could actually use. This year it's much more difficult to sign free agents, and the trade logic 
 is a bit tougher as well, so at least that's less of an exploit. It'd just be nice if you had all 
 your free agents automatically assigned to your NHL squad so that it was done away with altogether. 

           Creating plays and putting them into action on the ice is a blast.      

  Online modes have seen the most definitive improvement. Besides standard head-to-head play, you 
 can play in ranked shootouts, team matches for up to six different players on six different consoles, 
 and online leagues. Obviously, leagues and team play are the big additions. Leagues are simple 
 to set up and easy to use. You create a league for anywhere from two to 32 teams, including all 
 the AHL and international teams included in the game, and can even create some basic logos and 
 a winner's trophy for the end of the season. In the league lobby menu, you'll see which players 
 are online and who your opponents are, and you can simply jump into a game from there. There is 
 individual stat tracking for each time, though there aren't any individual player stats or trade 
 options available. In this regard, the mode is a little on the bare-bones side compared with what 
 2K has been offering for years now, but the leagues function as advertised, and getting to play 
 in leagues online at all is pretty awesome.  

  Team play is a great idea in theory, though it isn't quite working at the moment. Basically, up 
 to six players can take up to three spots on each team, and anyone in the game has the option to 
 lock to a certain position or switch freely between all players on the ice. While we'd love to 
 say this mode is as cool as it sounds, we frankly just don't know, because the mode doesn't really 
 work right now. On the Xbox 360, every team match we tried to play dropped the connection from 
 the moment the opening cinematic loaded. We tried this a dozen or so times with different players 
 in every match, and every time we got the same result. On the PS3, we were never able to find enough 
 people to play a team play game, so it may or may not suffer from the same issues. This seems like 
 the sort of thing EA could easily fix with a patch, but it's pretty irritating that this feature 
 doesn't work right out of the box.  

  Apart from that rather glaring issue, online performance seems OK. The bulk of the matches we played 
 were lag-free and worked properly. We ran into a couple of connection drops on both the PS3 and 
 360 here and there (one out of every dozen or so standard online games we played had that issue) , 
 and we also had a couple of game crashes while loading some of the online shootouts. But again, 
 the bulk of our online play experience worked fine, and without any of the dominant lag issues 
 from last year's game.  

  NHL 08 also includes a great practice mode that not only lets you practice strategies in a wide 
 variety of scenarios, but actually includes a play creator. It's a simple, intuitive mode that 
 records the movements of individual players via neon-colored arrows on the ice. You can basically 
 position each player individually and get them into the right position to score. It works nicely 
 within the context of the game, too, as the second you get the right player into the proper starting 
 position, all the other players on your team move to their proper starting positions and execute 
 the play you designed as best they can based on the defense's position. The one slight bummer about 
 the play creation mode is that you can't insert defenders into the play creator. When you're designing 
 the play, it's just your teammates and a goalie. You can take the move you designed into the standard 
 practice mode and try it out there, but it would have been nice to have a way right within the 
 play creator to see if you were designing something legitimately ingenious or just a way to get 
 the puck stolen very quickly.  

  The other big selling point about last year's game, besides the skill stick, was its graphics. 
 Hands-down, NHL 07 was the best-looking sports game on the market last year, and NHL 08 subtly 
 improves on an already fantastic graphics engine. The improved skating is probably the biggest 
 visual treat, though the still-amazing-looking player models and generally improved animations 
 are a nice touch as well. On the Xbox 360, NHL 08 runs a great deal better than it did last year 
 in terms of frame rate. You'll see occasional choppy bits here and there, but they're rare. The 
 PlayStation 3 version runs about as well as the Xbox 360 game did last year. It mostly sticks to 
 about 30 frames a second, though it occasionally chops up on the ice, and cutscenes seem to take 
 a big hit. It doesn't affect gameplay, so it's not a gigantic deal. It's just disappointing that 
 the PS3 version is inferior in this one regard.  

           It's not a huge visual leap from last year's game, but NHL 08 still looks phenomenal. 

  Audio is top-notch all around. Gary Thorne and Bill Clement continue their streak of being the 
 best commentating duo in all of sports gaming, displaying a natural-sounding chemistry that gives 
 a true-to-life feel. Their dialogue is also considerably better written and less repetitive this 
 year. The only knock against their commentary is that they don't address specific players very 
 often. In-game sound effects don't seem much better or worse than last year's, though the game 
 still sounds great on the ice. The soundtrack is yet another mixtape of indie and alternative rock 
 tracks that you may love or not even notice.  

  In pretty much every single regard, NHL 08 is a significant step up from the series' current-gen 
 debut last year. It's got more content, exciting gameplay, and legitimate smarts to its game. Some 
 issues certainly knock 08 back from being a truly superb effort, such as the online issues and 
 the few remaining control irritations. But by and large, this is a terrific game of hockey that's 
 both realistic and thrilling to play, a combo that's often difficult to achieve in sports games. 
 If you love hockey, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.

Review:  NHL 08 is the best hockey game to be released ... ever... It is extremly fun to play, whether you 
 are a newby or a veteran to the series... The stick controls gives a lot of depth... And it is 
 very balanced overall... 
  
  the outcomes of matches often depend on your ability to defend as well as notice and capitalize 
 on your oponnent's weaknesses..
  
  
  My issue is with how bad the game was programed for x360... They did not test it very well on all 
 x360 systems, and since Microsoft took the liberty of changing some hardware for the latest x360s, 
 you end up with a game that will run well on some systems, and that is NOT playable on others..
 
  
  This game froze, and froze and froze... it froze online.. it froze in career mode... it froze mondays.. 
 it froze on weekends...
  
  This game got me so frustrated with the x360 that I sold it and bought a PS3 ... First game for 
 my PS3: NHL 08... how many times did it freeze since ive had it on PS3? ZERO times... 
  
  Hope they fixed this for nhl09.. but still, shame on EA sports for not releasing a patch (If you 
 think mine is an isolated incident, you should check the x360 nhl 08 forums on EA)

Review:  THE GOOD:
  
  This game is a big step up from previous versions. The new skill stick enables you to pull off 
 amazing moves and various new plays. The create a player and create a team are also more improved 
 from NHL 08's precedors as it has many more customizing options. Practice modes are also a large 
 part about this game. You can pretty much practice any play down to a certain person doing a specific 
 part of it.
  
  THE BAD:
  
  This game can be very frustrating. As the dekeing and shooting are both controlled by the right 
 toggle, if you dont push straight forward with a certain speed (hoping to shoot) , then your player 
 will do a deke. For less experienced players it can be very challenging as they will see themselves 
 dekeing back and forth in front of the next and eventually being checked. Another factor that is 
 lacking in this game is the commentating. The commentators are very dry, and although they may 
 use hockey lingo here and there, they dont say much during the game.
  
  VERDICT:
  
  With a couple of online updates this game could be incredible. Showing up any other hockey game 
 ever made. Yet, due to certain flaws, I'm still not sure it's as great as portrayed. I have no 
 doubt that if you played this game ALOT then you could eventually become good enough to ignore 
 the skill stick flaw, but the road getting there is frustrating to many players.

Review:  NHL 08 brings a lot of new stuff to the table! The dynasty is fun as usual and the new training 
 system is pretty cool too but I wish they would add more modes to it! I heard in NHL 09 that you 
 can be a player and you can do everything a hockey player does like after a shift you can go to 
 the bench and wait until you can come back on which is really cool. But enough about the future, 
 lets talk about now! NHL 09 has something new called the skill stick which is really an awesome 
 feature which makes you have more control. If you're a hockey fan you definitely need this game!
 
  
  The Good:
  
  - Lots of new features - New skill stick feature.
  - Good graphics.
  - Fun online.
  - Many other fun stuff.
  
  The Bad:
  
  - Only one new mode - Practice.
 
  - Some glitches but they're kind of funny.
  
  All in all, NHL 08 is a great game and if you love hockey and don't own this game, shame on you!

Review:  EA Sports delivers one of the most complete games to date with NHL 08. Everything is there for 
 you to create a successful franchise or for the novice player to come in on the Play Now mode.
 
  
  The dynasty mode is very complete with works with the minor leagues well. If you don't understand 
 salary cap structures in professional sports, it may prove a bit difficult to consistently put 
 a solid NHL team on the ice year after year. Overall, NHL 08 has a great franchise mode that is 
 worth every one of the 82 game seasons.
  
  Just like its Madden counter-part, there are flaws that can be exposed over and over. The game 
 does lack in difficulty even on the highest levels because of these flaws, but that doesn't take 
 away from what EA Sports accomplished in this one.
  
  If you are a sports game lover, this is a can't miss with you.

Review:  Well I picked up NHL 08 much later then most. I buy an NHL game every year, and for the last few 
 I have picked up 2k. Last year when I owned NHL 2k7 I played several seasons so I decided to try 
 NHL 07, and I was not impressed with the game at all. I felt that the AI was just terrible, not 
 to mention the controls where very "glitchy".
  
  Now once again I played several seasons of NHL 2k8 and enjoy the game play a lot. With that said 
 NHL 2k8 has some serious GM logic flaws, so after reading up on NHL 08 I decided to give EA another 
 shot.
  
  Well I have played a season + now, and I am ready to write my review.
  
  Graphics: 10/10
  
  Excellent visuals from gameplay, animations, cut scenes, etc.
  
  This 
 game just looks good at all levels, reflections are amazing as well. Best looking hockey game on 
 the market.
  
  Sound: 8/10
  
  Great hockey sounds, from the crowd, to the players on the ice. Players talk to each other, which 
 is very helpful to set up plays. With that said I still think that the crowd could fit the mood 
 a little better sometimes. I also do not like the announcers, but that is more a personal preference.
 
  
  Gameplay: 8/10
  
  With some major improvements on both the skill stick, and the AI the gameplay is fantastic. The 
 AI learns with you so it makes your gameplan dynamic. If you always dump the puck in the Defense 
 will learn to stay back, if you always try to feed the slot they will block it, etc. Gives you 
 a great hockey experince.
  
  The skill stick has been refined and the movements are smooth, and it really gives you a great 
 feeling to pull off a great move.
  
  There are certain areas though where the gameplay suffers. In fact the only issue I have with the 
 game is "catch up logic" 
  
  Even though EA says that this is not part of the game, as far as I am concerned this is a blatant 
 lie.
  
  Catch up Logic is basically the computer scores when they want to , and there is almost nothing 
 you cna do about it, this usually happens near the end of the game.
  
  Alright I have had this happen 8 times durning the regular season wheter to tie me or beat me i 
 nthe final minute of play.
  
  I could have been controlling the game, playing excellent defense, and as soon as the computer 
 gets the puck they take a weak wrister whe nthey touch it from the blueline or farther. No screen, 
 No Deflection, it just goes in. Now the only time I have ever had this goal go in on me is during 
 the final minutes of play, and when it mattered.
  
  Now maybe they didn't mean to add catch up logic, perhaps they screwed up the good. Maybe they 
 just wanted the goalies to get shakey near the end of the game, or for star players to shine. Either 
 way we have a serious problem that should be addressed.
  
  By the way even if you try holding on the the puck, if they want to score they will get the puck, 
 you can't hit them, trip them or anything. In fact the ywill steal the puck from you even if they 
 arn't near you. I have watched this several times near the end of the game they try to poke check 
 they are not even close to me, and all of a sudden the puck goes flying off my stick to one of 
 there players and then they get that wrister from the point.
  
  So either they have mind control, or there is indeed catch up logic?
  
  Another major flaw 
 is the new Goalie system. You can play as a goalie from a close up 3rd person view. Now this is 
 fun, however there are major flaws. I tried starting a season only playing as a goalie, and after 
 about 15 games I decided it wasn't worth continuing.
  
  During this time I had 7 glitch goals scored against me, now this is back to AI catch up logic. 
 Like I said when they want to score they will. This is even worse whe nyour the goalie.
  
  I had 3 goals literrly go under my net, like from behind the net they just slide it in, not around 
 UNDER. Strangest thing I ever ever seen. also 4 that were really weak from point that just completly 
 missed my goalie, like I was in perfect position, and somehow they just go through him.
  
  Now even without hte AI catch up logic, playing as a goalie is no easy task. the second your out 
 of position the AI light goes off and they will shoot from anywhere past the half way zone and 
 place the puck perfectly.
  
  Hopefully these issues will be resolved for next year, other then that I would say
  
  -Great 
 Graphics
  -Good hockey experince besides catch up logic
  -Good audio
  -Passable GM logic (Fairly bad, but better then 2k8) 
  
  Final Word: If you are ready to have 
 an overall good hockey experince with a few games of total fruastration, this is the game for you. 
 If you have an anger issue, not recommended.

Review:  the last NHL game i fell this much n love with was NHL 04 which was near perfect back in its day. 
 This game comes secound of its revalutionary generation of the skill stick, and unlike 07 where 
 it was cool and OK, here its perfect the smoothes hockey game ive ever played. Its also been 10 
 years since i first played the NHL series, i started with the classic NHL 98 with forsberg on the 
 cover what a revalutionary game that what back in its day blowing all the other hockey games out 
 of the water, well this nhl is no different 10 years later EA woke up from about 4 years of sleep 
 and got this game perfect. and the AI FINALLY its difficult enough to challange u, and im only 
 on all star i cant imagin how playing superstar will be. Anyhow if u are looking for a fun addictive 
 game this is it, or if ur a hockey fan then this game IS A MUST for the 360. best hockey game ever. 
 one reason i dont give this a perfect is the circling around with the puck if feel in real life 
 a guy would get knocked out hard but sometimes i do, but not enough times.

Review:  Graphics: 9
  Gameplay: 6
  Sound: 9
  TILT: 8
  Value: 6
  
  The good: Deep dynasty mode, great use of the analog stick for puck control, beautiful graphics 
 that are technically proficient as well, fantastic play-by-play, more of the same NHL.
  
  The bad: AI is horrendous, riddled with the same glitches and system stoppers as all NHL games, 
 fighting system is laughable, getting into online games can be a pain, more of the same NHL.
  
  The most obvious thing about NHL 08 is that the game looks great, and runs at a good frame 
 at most all times. It also sounds fantastic with great crowd noise, and fantastic play-by-play. 
 The create a player is pretty good but could use an overhaul since it's been the same idea for 
 years now. The season and franchise modes are great, and offer lots of game play. You can get as 
 deep into being a manager as you probably want to, and take your team to the cup. Nothing really 
 new was added this year, not that it's surprising, but it'd be nice to get something new by now. 
 It has online play, but it's about as little fun as humanly possible which we'll get into later. 
 You can do ranked or social play for regular games, or even play in shootout only matches in ranked 
 or social play as well. Using the analog stick to control shots is actually really fun, but they 
 took a step back in the shootout department from NHL 07 by making the stick far too sensitive.
 
  
  To put it gently, the AI is hideous, plain and simple. You can forget about the most simple of 
 passes along the boards because they will skate back towards the puck and miss it entirely 90% 
 of the time. The same logic applies for passing it along the boards to get the puck behind the 
 net which is an essential pass in hockey, period. The computer AI for your defence also seems to 
 have a fear of the puck, and a lack of awareness as to what's going on as they will skate away 
 from the puck when they could easily beat the opponent to the puck and get it out of your zone, 
 and when standing 2 inches from the opponent will allow passes to go right across them. This also 
 basically makes the create-a-play feature, which could have been really cool, almost entirely useless 
 as the AI wiill do a horrible job of executing them.
  
  Playing defence yourself is also a bit of a chore as it's hit or miss as to whether or not you'll 
 hit who you want. A huge majority of the time, your player will stick there elbow or ass out like 
 they're going to hit someone but will just skate along side them or do something even more annoying 
 which is skate right around the player and hit the one behind them, subsequently getting an interference 
 penalty. Speaking of interference calls, they are the most over-used call in the game easily accounting 
 for 90% of the calls made. Boarding and holding are basically at random, and tripping comes in 
 a strong second thanks to some seriously off poke-checking. Poke checking also seems random as 
 sometimes it will go right over the puck, sometimes it will go through the players legs, and sometimes 
 it will actually knock the puck off the player but more than half the time the player will get 
 the puck back anyway. Also, although it doesn't happen much online, when playing against a computer 
 opponent, the puck will seemingly warp from your stick to theirs if skating close enough to them. 
 
  
  Fighting has taken such enormous steps backward from 2007 that it will blow your mind. It's almost 
 comical to watch and many of you will laugh out loud when you first see it. Revereting back to 
 some sort of N64 version of fighting, the players simply hold on to eachother as you use two different 
 punches and have a dodge button. The sound effects sound like they came straight out of the 8bit 
 era, and the animation is mind blowingly bad. I really don't know why they did this when the fighting 
 in 07 was so well done.
  
  Online play is a huge staple to the longevity of the game, and though it's there, it's really a 
 joke. They claim that there is no more cheap shots to be found in their game, and though this might 
 be true, the game is still riddled with hideous goals. If you've played the game as much as I have, 
 you start to see a repeating patern -- the game rewards crappy play. Basically the crappier the 
 shots you take, the more goals you will most likely score. The goalies will do all sorts of weird 
 and ridiculous spastic moves in a futile attempt to stop the puck but will usually just push the 
 puck in the net themselves. If you actually enjoy playing the game of hockey, you can forget winning 
 often since setting up plays and taking good shots from good angles will just see you get robbed. 
 It seems like EA prepared the goalies for super good playing levels and hard shots, but toss a 
 puck at them backhand from the blue line, and you can get past the best goalies in the game.
  
  Of course, all of this is only possible after actually getting into a game. For some reason, 
 every time you go to play your first session online, you have to download the rosters -- regardless 
 if you already have the newest set. This usually happens when you choose quick ranked match after 
 you get into a lobby with someone. Downloading the rosters and then saving them for no reaosn takes 
 about a minute or two, and by then your opponent has usually left (like you could blame them) . 
 One would then assume that to avoid doing this so much, that you would just download the rosters 
 for now reason before hand -- but that doesn't work. Download the rosters before you try and find 
 a game and you will still have to download and save the same rosters for the millionth time before 
 you can play.
  
  Basically, when it comes down to it, NHL 08 is a barely upgraded version of NHL 07. You won't be 
 seeing a whole bunch of different things that shouldn't have already been there the first time 
 around. It's also completely riddled with the same glitches and system crashing goodness that every 
 EA NHL game has and still hasn't lost. The actually idea of playing with the analog stick works 
 really well and makes you feel like you're controlling the stick. Unfortunately the gameplay is 
 made a chore thanks to a lot of annoyances with the AI and general play. The odds are that if you're 
 a hockey fan, you will over look a lot of the bad and really enjoy the core game for a long time.
 
  
  Overall: 7.0

Review:  Awesome game play, Awesome graphics, Awesome game period. The only problem i found in this game 
 was playing as a goalie can be somewhat hard but i mean goalie in real life is hard anyways!!! 
 The trading and signing is awesome it would be really cool if the resigning contracts could have 
 the extenstion option and if they sign for alittle cheaper cause shoot after Ovechkins contract 
 went out i had to pay him almost 11 million. Scouting has got alot better in this game to i look 
 forward to the draft in a vidoe game for once!!! Created plays in this edition is sort of differant 
 and if your playing as the goalie and your team hits one of the spots on the ice where the created 
 play is supposed to start the rarely follow it the way there supposed to. shoot they really dont 
 do plays at all if you are the goalie they tend to carry it into the offensive zone get close to 
 the net and shoot. but thats about all i would change about this one.

Review:  ok . i had this game since it came out i was just to lazy to do the review. so i played this game 
 alot. the multyplayer is awsome but yet angerin. because of xbox live laging. the new online modes 
 (big team play, shoot-outs, quick match) arevey good any you'll never want to stop playing. the 
 controls are pretty hard if its the first time your on an xbox. but u can use classic controls 
 if needed. but new controls are way better gameplay. playing shoot outs with somone if highly addictive 
 and very good. the graphics are stunning. very good game. hope the habs win the cup this year hehe.. 
 and hope nhl 09 will be also god., aparently to finish this review i have to ad words. well here 
 we go , i love hockey and habs . i hate the leafs they suck and wont make the play-offs again oh 
 and go huet go even tho your now with washington your doing awsome! :P

Review:  The previous NHL 0? games have been lack luster. The graphics are really good, the game play is 
 easy to follow, and is addicting. Finally EA Sports brings back create a team, but only this time. 
 You can go crazy with jersey customizations. The first time you play it. You will be impressed 
 in how much the game has improved over the previous years. 
  
  Time to start with the bad news first. The superstar difficulty level is on steroids. With Easy 
 being too easy, pro being just as easy, and of course superstar being next to impossible. Its great 
 to have a computer challenge, but come on here. At least All Madden you have a better chance of 
 winning. Even on easy the computer scores way too many easy goals. I created many 99 overall goalies 
 to put the game to the test. Still they score way too many goals on you. You'd think with 99 speed 
 for a goalie the gap would be covered faster. Player to AI passing could be irritating at times.
 
  
  Good news is the in-depth game play options it gives you. You can substitute any league team into 
 Dynasty Mode. You can put any NHL team into the World Tournament. Create a player is fun and easy 
 to do. If you want a 6'4" 275 lb. goalie. You can have that. If you want a 6'9" 275 lb. skater. 
 No problem. If you are cheap like me and want to play smash mouth hockey. One timers are a bit 
 tricky. When you are dead on, the rewards are greater. Body checks and cheap shots on defenseless 
 skaters adds to the excitement. When you finally nail that sucker for scoring a goal against you. 
 Life couldn't be any sweeter. The game is worth the money. Grab 3 of your friends and join up against 
 the computer or play some 2 on 2.

Review:  Pros:
  -great technical graphics (player movments are very realistic)
  -a lot of fun new features (shootout, skills practice... etc)
  -franchise mode is very detailed 
 with many different options 
  -a lot of different online modes and leagues to choose from
  -achievements are a lot of fun to get
  -a great control setup (the skill stick is a lot of fun 
 once mastered)
  
  Cons:
  -a lot of glitches in online mode
  
  Overall Nhl 08 is an amazing game and is as close to perfect as any sports game I've played. The 
 only thing keeping it from being perfect is the fact that the online mode contains a lot of glitches, 
 one of which is the faceoff loop glitch where evertime a player touches the puck the game is reset 
 to the most recent faceoff and continues until one player quits. Aside from that, the graphics 
 are great, the game modes are plentiful and the controls are amazing. If your a fan of ea sports 
 NHL games, this is an absolute must have!

Review:  Lets face it - EA sports games are under heavy scrutiny these days. Quite a few people want EA 
 to give up all licenses for sports. My question is - WHY?!
  
  While I like the 2k series, EA sports is the most realistic sport simulation to date in my opinion. 
 And when it comes to NHL '08, you can't get better than this with hockey. The gameplay is smooth, 
 animations are great, sounds are awesome.
  
  I would have given this game a 10, except it falls short in the fighting and checking. The fighting 
 doesn't occur as often as I'd like to see and the checking with the stick takes some getting used 
 to. If you are not a fan of Hockey though, this game pulls you into instant addiction.
  
  And in comparison to NHL 2k8, there is none. I tried NHL NK8 and I was sorely dissapointed. Going 
 from 2K8 to NHL '08 is like switching from a Honda Civic to a Mustang.

Review:  Story: Shoot the puck into the net.
  
  Missions: To win lord stanley's cup.
  
  Controls: Near perfect. Skill stick really shines along with 1 on 1 special moves.
  
  Features: 
 Create a Team/Player/Goalie, In-Depth Dynasty, Skill Stick, Create your own plays, Play as any 
 player on the ice including a full fledged goalie mode.
  
  A. I.: Very smart. Adapt as the game progresses to exploit your weaknesses and defend against your 
 strengths/tendancies.
  
  Loading Times: One per game, 10-20 seconds in length.
  
  Graphics: Lighter and smoother than NHL 07. Improved, as with animations.
  
  Audio: Nothing 
 like hearing the crisp of skates cutting across the ice.
  
  Multiplayer: Decent but XBL could be a bit less laggy.
  
  Requirements: N/A.
  
  The Good: 
 Everything.
  
  The Bad: Still some goaltender problems (dribbles) and glitches (continuous hit...)
  
  The 
 Ugly: Nothing. This game is fresh.
  
  Replay Ability: High to Very High.
  
  The Bottom Line: If you like hockey you must buy this game.

Review:  this game i just picked up and it is great . the fighting controls are goofed up a bit because 
 you have to use the right analog stick. im not complaning that much but hey, its got to be the 
 best game from ea sports to date! the gameplay is awesome the break away system is amazimg because 
 you can deke out the goalie using the right analog stick and timing is crusial to pull off the 
 move. the free agents actually sign properly now that they can chose different teams based on how 
 much playing time they will get or the money and amount of years. the only problem in this game 
 is that winning face-offs are harder than it looks because you have to time your A button and your 
 right analog stick at the same time. the best part is the deking ability and how you can deke out 
 an entire team by using the analog stick

Review:  Rented it and fell in love so now I own it. Has to be the best hockey game to date. EA has definately 
 mastered the control scheme and player movements. I don't think it can get any more realistic than 
 this. The deke system gives you the oppotunity to make your opponent look silly. The sounds are 
 amazing, really makes you feel like you're in the game. For instance the shots that smack the post 
 make a wonderful "ding" sound. The graphics detail are pretty amazing too, the players actually 
 look like players. Also, the AI is pretty good. Superstar NHL players actually perform like Superstars 
 in the games. E. G. Kovalchuk and Crosby can really dance around you when you play against them. 
 The fighting looks pretty corny and the goalie mode is pretty hard to play with. Oh, and the online 
 connections can be a bit sketchy at times as is mentioned in the review. Other than those factors, 
 this game is definately recommended to all hockey fans!

Review:  Overall, NHL 08 is one of the best games that i have played in awhile. I have no idea why people 
 say there is stuff wrong with the game. Even though there are some minor things that need to be 
 fixed, the game has way more pros than cons to say its a very bad, disappointing game.
  
  There are a lot to Pros to talk about. 
  ***Lets start with the Dynasty.
  -Many teams to start 
 choose to make a dynasty, including your favorite AHL team.
  -Most of the rosters are up to date.
  -Being able to create a skater/goalie and make your way 
 to an NHL star in the big leagues.
  -Being able to trade is such a big step. (e. g. NBA 08 is the hardest game to trade on so i was 
 happy that i could actually trade people)
  -Players actually send you emails to apologize for non-excusable playing time or people asking 
 for a trade because they feel they need more playing time.
  -The dynasty is a great way to start playing NHL 08.
  
  ***Game play/Graphics
  -In the dynasty, 
 there is an option where you can practice shooting skills, skating skills, offensive skills, and 
 goalie skills. What makes it even better is that you can also choose the scenario. 1on1, 1on0, 
 5on0, etc. 
  -You can create and prefectplays in the practice part of the coaching options.
  -Graphics compared 
 to 2k8 and any other sport game in a while can not compare with NHL 08.
  -Having the option to go old school and play on classic control or choosing the new controls with 
 the default controls.
  -The right stick gives you so many options on how you can deke, pass, menuver, shoot, etc. You 
 can't go wrong with the right stick.
  -Goalie mode is nice because you can control the goalie in a real game and make diving saves to 
 win a tight 3rd period win.
  -When creating a player, options like skate length and stick curves, make your player better at 
 different type of playmaker. Like being a sniper, or playmaker, or speedy gonzalez that dekes his 
 way to victory.
  
  ***Online
  -Shootout mode has really caught my eye. Its always been fun going one on one with the goalie to 
 try to deke him out. 
  -Team versus mode has really come along in the nhl games. Hook up to 6 players at once for ultimate 
 gaming experience.
  -Ranking up in a ranked game modes are especially good to show what you've got.
  
  Now, there 
 are things EA should have a little more time with when NHL was in the makings.
  ***Cons
  -Glitchy goals. Sticks or pucks will go through the goalies pads/ net. 
  -Somtimes when people 
 shoot, the angle in which the stick is going doesn't always show where the puck is going. For instance, 
 the player looks like he's shooting towards the left boards becuase the direction of his body motion 
 and stick motion, but in reality the puck is going to the goalie 20 degrees to the right.
  -No breaking the Plexi glass...: [ I was personally sad because I always liked how fast skaters 
 could shoot, sometimes the glass would break.
  -Online has a lot of bugs. EA servers disconnect a lot more than they should.
  -You have to download 
 the rosters every time you log into the EA servers. That takes way too long when you want to play 
 a "quick" match. Most of the time, downloading the rosters while trying to enter the screen where 
 you pick a team is cancelled because your opponent doesnt want to wait for you to download the 
 rosters and then saving it becuase it takes too long.
  
  All in all, the cons don't add up to the pros. Which means that it is a good game to buy even though 
 there are minor things to be dealt with in the next NHL game. It's a good buy to anyone who is 
 a big hockey fan with a big appetite for a good challenge and lots of fun!
  ENJOY!!!

Review:  Hey guys, this is Asswarrior here to review NHL 08, lets get started!
  
  The Good parts of the game... damn... there are alot of good parts, but I'll try to name the major 
 ones. First, the gameplay is simply fantastic. The opponent's AI is amazing and actually learns 
 from your actions (if you keep attacking the same way, the AI will notice and clamp down on that 
 part of their Defence) . Also, if you played last year's game... it just wasn't fluid or realistic. 
 It was nearly impossible to get set up, but in 08 it is very smooth, a much better frame rate, 
 and it is the most realistic hockey game ever made... bar none. The skating is so fluid its like 
 your watching a real game, and setting up plays is very easy, and also looks like a real game. 
 The commentary is excellent and improved alot from last year. They sometimes comment on how you 
 need to move into the slot more and its really amazing. Some new features that were added were 
 goalie mode, which is awsome. You can be your own goalie and get a 3rd person view of the goalie 
 via behind the net. This is a great feature because now instead of being the one who scores, you 
 can try and hold the fort and maybe come out with a shut out! Another great feature is the addition 
 of the AHL to not only play now games, but Dynasty mode. Now, when you pick your NHL team in Dynasty, 
 you can play any minor league game you want. This is an awsome feature because its a great way 
 of seeing the young kids in the minors that you might consider calling up. The graphics in 08 are 
 also off the charts, with player models and textures all looking like their real life counter parts. 
 
  
  Now I'll move on to the bad parts, well... the only dissapointing part of the game in my opinion 
 is the forcheck. It is nearly impossible to cause a turnover of the puck on the forcheck, EA should 
 try and fix this as soon as possible, hopefully by the next game. Also, your teammates AI is improved 
 from last year, but still has room for improvement. 
  
  Overall, NHL 08 is the best hockey game ever made, it has great gameplay, great graphics, and great 
 presentation! If you are looking for a great Hockey game that is worth your money (NOT crappy NHL 
 2K8) then NHL 08 is clearly the game for you.

Review:  The overall gaming experience on this is terrible. 
  
  AI: 9/10
  Graphics: 8/10
  Sound: 9/10
  Gameplay: 10/10
  Multiplayer: 1/10
  Longevity and Replaybility: 0/10
  
  
 Is this the best sports game I've ever played? Yes. The AI is fantastic and the Gamplay is superb.
 
  
  However, it's hard to play a game when you can't actually play it. The "Disc Read" error is tiresome. 
 Everytime you play a game, you're praying that you'll actually be able to finish it.
  
  After about a month, I sent it back for another game (this was back in October) . I felt like writing 
 the review now as it still bothers me. Finally, after years and years of sticking by EA, an NHL 
 game is released that rivals NHL 94.
  
  I hate to say it, because NHL 08 is literally "the" best sports game I've ever played; but unfortunately 
 you can't really play it for that long anyway.
  
  In order for a game to get a score at all, you have to be able to play it, regardless of how good 
 it may be.
  
  0/10

Review:  This is easily the best hockey ever made. EA continues to kick 2K's butt when it comes to sports 
 games. Year after year with last years hockey bring in the joy sticks for stick handling and shooting 
 the puck. Great hockey game through and through.
  
  I will have fun with this game up till the stanley cup is over.
  
  I give this game a 9 outta 
 10
  
  The commentary is easily one of the best i've ever heard not only in hockey but in all sports. 
 The visuals are outstanding great looking hockey game the arenas look real the players like real 
 the crowd looks pretty neat. This is one of the tougher hockey games ive ever played as well. usually 
 after this long im wiinnning every game by at least 4 goals but in this game the teams are tough
 
  
  Downside is the online lags a little but most people dont buy a hockey game to play online anyway. 
 it might be something that you do when your bored.... but Franchise mode is where its at year after 
 year

Review:  Hockey is the greatest game on earth, so its good to see people talking about a hockey video game, 
 but this game just isn't nearly as good as it is said to be. In this review i will mostly point 
 out faults because i think the game has a lot to work on for next year. The product is nowhere 
 near perfect, and i will try not to mention the obvious good things that most people already know 
 about. 
  
  Gameplay - Pretty good. Scoring is fun and so is hitting, but that doesn't make it realistic. There 
 are very few plays to set up and its too hard to switch plays. Creating plays is a waste of time. 
 The speed of the players is severely flawed. Example: Can Chris Pronger really skate backwards 
 faster than Marion Gaborik can skate forwards? Not even when Gabby has a torn groin! Some things 
 about the game just upset me, though overall it can be fun in smaller amounts. 7.5/10
  
  Graphics - Graphics are good but not amazing. They are choppy in the cut scenes and the player 
 models look like little kids compared to the real life games that i watch. 8.5/10
  
  Sound - The announcers are alright but anybody who has played a few games realizes that they just 
 keep saying the same, one-off comments over and over again. Weird sayings are rare, calling a players 
 name is just as common as telling the same back story of Peter Forsberg again. Also i think I've 
 heard "wheel wheel wheel!" enough times in my life now. 8/10
  
  Online - There is a shortage of players right now. At any given moment you will find about 50 players 
 in the lobbies, but they rarely will play you, and quick game opponents usually quit when they 
 aren't the home team, which is sad. The online league's make little sense and do not pay off. They 
 are also not populated. Online shootouts, however, are fun and easy to get into. 7/10

Review:  Its nice to see that EA sports is now producing the better sports games again. This is a really 
 good game. I never want to give a sports game above a 8.5 and probably never a 9.0, so this game 
 has to be good if im gibin it a 8.5. Very fun. typical franchise mode and all that stuff. Worth 
 buying HAve fun with it HOCKEY 
 
  ! I never want to give a sports game above a 8.5 and probably never a 9.0, so this game has to 
 be good if im gibin it a 8.5. Very fun.
  
  
  the new added pass into space is good, and the goalie mode is okay. better online play compared 
 to last year also.

Review:  NHL 08 is the greatest hockey game ever created... period. Even with all the titles that have been 
 released since the beginning of Fall, I've managed to find tons of time for NHL and my season (currently 
 in playoffs) . All the upgrades from NHL 07 are tremendous, from the skating to the puck handling 
 to the shooting, to the visuals.... NHL 08 is here to impress and stay for a very long time. The 
 online portion works well.... I havent tried a league yet, but the single games work well. Even 
 the character customization is VERY deep and fun to play around with. Definitely my perfect sports 
 game.

Review:  NHL 08 is a vast improvement over previous versions of the series. The greatest improvement by 
 far is the enhanced A. I. opponents, and teammates. The ability to actually cycle the puck intelligently, 
 generate opportunities in the slot, and the play creation feature adds to the offensive arsenal 
 quite nicely. The graphics are sharp, and the player models look spot on to the real life players. 
 The sound design is impressive as well, bodies crunch and the sound of the boards shaking on impact 
 is as extremely accurate. The controls are as tight as ever, dekeing, wrist shots, slap shots, 
 and back hands can be pulled off with ease with just a few flicks of the skill stick. Goalie controls 
 left a little to be desired but do not factor in to much to the overall scheme of the game. The 
 few minor qualms I have with the game is the checking controls can seem spotty at times missing 
 checks or not responding, and stopping an offensive rush on defense can be rather tough. But all 
 in all this is a supremely improved product and I strongly recommend it to hockey, or casual sports 
 fans alike.

Review:  To quote Stompin Tom Connors, The good old hockey game, is the best game you can name. I think 
 that Mr. Connors is as right as you can get, with a great mix of speed, hitting, precision and 
 play styles, hockey is the greatest game that you can name. The question here is, whether or not 
 this classic sport has been properly presented in EAs latest entry to the hockey genre, in NHL 
 08.
  
  From 2004 to 08, EA has achieved a level that feels like real hockey. In this game they have removed 
 the face-buttons entirely from the game-play which gives the game a smoothness that hasnt been 
 in previous games. Using the trigger to pass and the analog to control the stick, the new format 
 gives a lot of freedom and speed to the game play, and makes creativity a breeze by not making 
 the player have awkward hand positions to pull off plays. The aim in the game is a little odd, 
 simply because you are trying to skate one direction and then use the same stick to aim, but if 
 you get into a flow with play patterns, you can get some fancy goals with excellent precision.
 
  
  Artificial Intelligence has really advanced through the EA series, most radically so is with the 
 goal tending. The goalies in this game have grown oh so much since recent years, with the ability 
 to move with the play, come out and challenge skaters, and their new animations make it more of 
 a challenge to create genuine scoring opportunities. The goalies arent the only players to be 
 given new AI and animations though; the others have gotten their fair share too. With the advanced 
 deking in the game, also comes new animations for shots and passes as skaters take stances that 
 relate to what shot, pass or hit they are attempting. Defenders will not be so easily fooled by 
 simple passing, and by using certain defensive plays they will force you to the outside or to shoot 
 the puck in the zone, or even just take you right out of the play with a beautiful hit. On the 
 offence computer players can be quite the threat as well, with strategic passing and movement that 
 relate to the position of your players that will make you think about your defensive positions.
 
  
  In addition to the new control scheme, and new AI performance, the game also looks GREAT! This 
 game has stunning visuals, both in cut-scenes and in-engine. The one thing that grabbed me by surprise 
 was that I was able to recognize all of the skaters on the ice, just from the faces. EA has really 
 gone the distance to make this game look very close to the real thing. The presentation in the 
 game is better than it was, but it is in no way flawless. One of the first things that I noticed 
 starting up the game was the menus, with an easy analog navigation to them it makes moving through 
 menus a breeze, and with small load times, getting into a game doesnt take long. However, once 
 you get into a game that is when the presentation begins to drop off. The announcing in this game 
 is the best Ive seen in a hockey game, but if you play more games with different teams youll 
 find, just like previous games, it can become repetitive with some cut-and-paste commentary. The 
 replays arent broadcast level either, as the game cant tell the difference in the game flow. 
 If you were putting up lots of pressure getting lots of shots then the other team runs down and 
 fires a terrible shot off on your net, the replay will show that one lousy shot, rather than even 
 one of the magnificent shots at the other end. The presentation in the game is bearable, but it 
 would be nice if the next game was closer to broadcast level.
  
  NHL 08 does have some flaws to it, but they are overshadowed by its accomplishments with its stunning 
 graphics, brilliant AI, and easy to learn functionality. EA has always been slowly getting closer 
 to real hockey, and this year they took a big leap in the right direction and I will be enjoying 
 this game for many months to come.

Review:  I love everything about this game, well except for one huge glaring problem. It randomly locks 
 up and gives me a dirty disk error. Not one other game, new or old in my collection does this. 
 It has done this since day one and it seems many others are having the same problem. The game also 
 seems to have ramped up the difficulty level. Its way easy on easy, and pretty tough on pro. The 
 other team also seems to always have a knack for Cheap goals. Sometimes they will score 5-7 on 
 5-7 shots. But all that aside the graphics and gameplay are pretty good. Its still not perfect, 
 but would be very close if it wasn't for the lockups!

Review:  Basically i grabbed the demo for 08 and saw the skill stick for the first time. I didn't have a 
 360 when 07 first came out so i never took notice of it. Anyways I loved how the skill stick worked. 
 Reminded me of Fight Night in some ways giving you the option to really add some interesting elements.
 
  
  Now when i bought the game i was getting a bit worried. I am not great at these games but the rookie 
 setting was to easy and the pro was far to hard for me. But after practice I learned just rushing 
 the net does not work at all. I learned how to actually take shots. Just watch some hockey and 
 it will show you. Take slap shots from the point, the odd 1 timer near the net, a cross through 
 the slot with a backhand. It has to be mixed up and scoring will start to work. This creates a 
 far more realistic game of hockey.
  
  One issue i have with the game is the lack of penalties. Especially when i look at the season stats 
 through the dynasty. Some teams are looking at 100 power-play minutes where i have 8 and maybe 
 6 pk minutes. Where my other stats are all basically in line with the rest of the season. This 
 is a small grip though.
  
  I am having a great time with this game and its even making me have more interest in Hockey again.

Review:  Ea has disappointed me many times, with lack of new ideas and stupid arcady game play. This year 
 is a dramatic change as they go from arcade to realistic hockey sim. Pros: The skills stick is 
 a lot of fun, When it comes to deaking against defenders or making a goalie's head boggle during 
 a shootout. Scoring a goal with you thumb never get old. For me, the skill stick shines when you 
 are on the power play or just setting up in the offensive zone. I would take a shot off a one timer 
 with the stick pulled back and push froward from the point to deflect of a player and go past the 
 goalie. Besides the skill stick the A. I will actually stop you this time. When one is to enter 
 into the offensive zone, the defenders try to stop them entering zone. Also where the defensive 
 game shine is when you are trying to set up and all the players are in front of the net blocking 
 your shots. In the harder difficulties you really have to cycle the puck to get a goal. The create 
 a play feature will help you with this as well. Creating plays takes time and patience but once 
 you get use to the mechanic of it it is really cool. Cons: Defensivly the AI is great. However 
 they don't clog up the neutral zone like they do in 2k. I am able to do a 2 line pass on the hardest 
 difficulty very easily with out it get intercepted. Also the poke checking system is very week, 
 Unlike to 2ks waving stick, Ea is just a button that pokes forward. You can push the right bumber 
 to wave it up still it doesn't do any thing. Also the checking is good with the momentum . But 
 i feel like it seeks on the player you are checking. I shouldn't feel like a missile checking a 
 player, it should be free flowing and having the ability to miss. With the great offensive game 
 play. It deserves to be picked up for that. But lack of good defensive controls and not much of 
 an upgrade to franchise mode this game still has work. It is a work in progress but if ea can change 
 these thing in 09 It would be a lot better. 2k has the d down, but ea has more fun O game. So buy 
 both if ur a tru hockey fan. :-p
  
  Thanks for reading. And lets enjoy the hockey season for all the fans out there.

Review:  NHL 08 is the newly released hockey simulation game by EA Sports. EA has released quite a few great 
 games this month, including skate. and NBA Live 08. This game is definitely in that group of games. 
 Have playing both 2008 hockey games, NHL 08 has proved to me how great a hocke sim to be. THe game 
 has spectacular character designs, partially due to the games' amazing graphics. NHL 08 has finally 
 presented a hockey with great defensive and offensive control, as well. The game is also worth 
 the $60, with various modes from its' great Dynasty Mode and Practice Mode, where you can learn 
 plays (Both Offensive and Defensive) to help you out in real games. NHL 08 has raised the bar for 
 hockey and sports games in general.

Review:  I never play sports games if i can help it. But i had to make a vicious exception with NHL 08. 
 The graphics were immense, the gameplay is smooth, goalie mode kinda works, extremely challenging, 
 and it does appeal slightly to me, except....
  
  Disagree with me here but i personally this the EA Sports developed games like FIFA have quite 
 hard controls. This shooting in NHL is Right Thumbstick Down And Up. Why can't it be RT or something 
 more sensible. But maybe everyone is used to these type of controls. Another is Career Mode, which 
 is replaced by Play Now. Its alright except you feel enclined to have practised first, especially 
 for newbies...
  
  GOOD POINTS -ICE SKATING NOW OFFICIALY RULES
  -ICE HOCKEY ALSO RULES

Review:  Seems that Madden got up to spec, and NHL is following and almost there.
  First of all, the interface for the new sport games is really good. it is easy to get from one 
 end to the next and find all you need.
  
  The graphics are like Madden above board and puckslapping good. the ice, the players and all other 
 aspects (except the audience) is up to the level i require it to be. Sound is ok, however the commentary 
 is a little shallow as i remember the old saying 'and he slamsit to the back of the net level of 
 response for the umptienth time. Still that part is decently done. So where does this falter?
 
  
  First of all, i am a caps fan, hence i want to set this to Capitals. Madden has it, but NHL does 
 not. the overall settings are good, but could have been thought through a little better. The icing 
 and 2nd line rules are excellent to break for the starters, so people can focus on game....
  Here is the one flaw. The game is way better then before, but the practice part should have explored 
 this better for the non-hockey player. Even i needed time for this. I was faster in the arena, 
 then on my 360. Shocking! But the overall handling is absolutely better (once you get the hang 
 of it) . Overall realism is 200% better then before and the face-off seems to have improved as well. 
 camera's are well balanced, but passing an switching players are dodgy, when done (or try to do) 
 too fast. almost like a time-out. Which can truly become a problem. The slap/pass and push possibilities 
 in the match are so much better, that i will forgive EA for now. The added part of adding Scandinavian 
 teams, so in Sweden this game can start a new war between Brynas and Djurgarden (hihihihihi) .
 
  
  I think that apart the favourite team settings and better practice guidance, this has become one 
 perfect game. YAY NHL!

Review:  I found NHL 08 to be damn near the best hockey game anybody could ask for with the new practice 
 mode, team play, create a team and beautiful looking graphics! This year the game runs and just 
 generally feels way better then nhl 07. The goalie mode in this game is pretty hard to play but 
 if you practice enough with it you probably can get good at it.
  
  The 1vs1 and shoot out online play modes feel almost the same as single player but the team play 
 runs a little less smoother and has some bugs that need to be worked out. The new AHL and European 
 teams make a nice addition to the game but at the same time it gets you wondering why there are 
 no classic teams. Quebec Nordics anybody? Winnipeg jets? How about letting us play as Wayne Gretzky? 
 Overall NHL 08 will make a nice addition to your collection and is definitely a must have for any 
 sports fan that wants some hardcore hockey action!

Review:  http://www. projectcoe. com/microsoft/games/nhl08_360. html? var1=sc3
  
  Project COE is proud to announce that it has two brand new Xbox 360 owners, yours truly, and our 
 Staff Coordinator Charles. Why did we pick up the system? Well, we think it's rather obvious. There's 
 a lot of great software available for it, and without the console, the games can't be played. Now 
 of course there had to be something I really wanted for the 360, or else I wouldn't have bought 
 it right? It's Halo 3, as if there was any doubt. Or you might be surprised I'm lying, because 
 it was all about NHL 08 for me.
  
  I've had an interesting relationship with EA, NHL's publisher. We've gotten along for the most 
 part in the past, but during the previous console generation, my feelings for them turned sour. 
 After a bunch of mediocrity that I experienced like Agent Under Fire, Nightfire, and especially 
 NHL 2004, I grew a strong distaste America's largest publisher for their lack of legitimate effort. 
 Well, those feelings have changed for now, thanks to my love for hockey, as NHL 08 is undoubtedly 
 the closest sim of the fall sport that I've had my pleasure to dig my skates into.
  
  I'm not going to beat around the bush here, so I'll explain what makes EA's latest hockey offering 
 so special. Everything they did with the product as a whole is a step in the right direction, and 
 I can only hope that they continue evolving what they've accomplished. The Skill Stick is one-of-a-kind, 
 deking is pretty sick, Dynasty Mode is a nice experience, the AI is extremely impressive, Create 
 A Play is kickin', and the online modes are abundant and enjoyable, when they aren't malfunctioning.
 
  
  I'll actually start off with NHL 08's AI, simply because it's what initially jumped out at me the 
 most. With the powerful technology EA has been able to toy around with, they've managed to develop 
 a system of players that generally play like intelligent hockey players, and react to your strategies 
 accordingly. When it comes to me and hockey videogames, I've been absolutely starving for a title 
 that would closely emulate the sport, and since NHL 08 is the closest I've ever encountered, I 
 give major props to EA. The heavily toned down aggression allows you to set up real team-driven 
 structure in both zones, whether it's currently even strength or not. You no longer have to worry 
 about avoiding every player on the opposing team because they're about to deck your current puck 
 holder or intended pass receiver. Unfortunately the system isn't perfect. In the case of the All-Star 
 and Superstar difficulties, NHL 08 shifts to a more arcade-style hockey game. The aggression isn't 
 nearly as bad as you may have seen in the past, but it's not very fun to witness your foes playing 
 way too perfectly. It's as if no matter what you do, as soon as you're near someone that isn't 
 on your team, the puck is on their sticks in the blink of an eye. This can be somewhat remedied 
 with clever tweaks to the gameplay settings, but anything you do doesn't seem to have a whole lot 
 of bearing.
  
  It's all good though, because EA definitely has the right idea now, so I can't say I'm not happy 
 with what their efforts, especially since I hardly expected it. There is one AI element I strongly 
 question though, the lack of calling blatant penalties. There's no delay of game, I've yet to see 
 a roughing call, and interference isn't punished enough. Even hooking, which is extremely common 
 in the NHL, is somehow dominated by tripping as sentence to the sin bin.
  
  Alright, moving on to the Skill Stick, which was introduced in NHL 2005, but has since evolved. 
 Unfortunately, even for hardcore hockey gamers, NHL 08's default gameplay may initially overwhelm 
 to a discouraging degree. Having never touched any of EA's recent hockey titles, the whole Skill 
 Stick thing is completely new to me. Thankfully after some intense practicing, I started understanding 
 the inner workings of the mechanic, and now I'm thoroughly enjoying my Penguins dynasty. The right 
 stick is basically your player's stick. To perform a snap shot, jerking the stick in the desired 
 shooting direction makes the puck fly. A slapshot is performed by holding the stick back [as if 
 you were winding up a real hockey stick] , and then pushing forward to let loose. Wrist shots, on 
 the other hand, can be annoying. It's easy to use them when you want to, as you only need to slide 
 the stick out to the left or right in straight horizontal fashion, and then drag it forward, but 
 the function tends to get in the way when you want to do either other shot option. It doesn't happen 
 too often, but in such a fast action, high energy game, it can mean the difference between a goal 
 or losing the puck/missing the net completely.
  
  The new one-on-one deking engine goes hand-in-hand with the Skill Stick. It's discouraging that 
 it can be very tough to utilize when you don't have good timing, but it feels so damn satisfying 
 when you pull it off. It's also the most complex feature in NHL 08. With puck on stick and pressing 
 the left bumper, you can move the rubber disc in one direction with the Skill Stick, and direct 
 your player elsewhere with the left stick. This allows you to avoid oncoming defensemen who are 
 about to get physical with you, so you can make them look bad by poking the puck past them on the 
 left and skating around them on the right. If there're no other opponents in the vicinity, you 
 can pick the puck back up and do what you will. Again, it's not easy at all to do, but one-on-one 
 deking can be a godsend when it works out.
  
  I also love the revamped skating. Shoulder button speed bursts are now non-existent, which was 
 wholly unrealistic to begin with, as moving your players is completely analog as well. The left 
 stick functions as your skates, pretty damn simple. The beauty of the new engine is that it allows 
 you to more naturally take advantage of your players' maneuverability. You can be a speedster like 
 Evgeni Malkin, a dynamic play maker that swerves in and out of traffic like Sidney Crosby, or a 
 slow wannabe defensemen like Derian Hatcher. What's so interesting though about this entirely analog 
 function is how you manipulate the stick. If you push forward just slightly, your player skates 
 in a gliding, casual fashion. The further the stick is pushed to its limit, the faster your skater 
 moves. However, you can also make clever use of rotating the device to perform sharp turns, stop 
 suddenly, or do loops around pressing opponents.
  
  All that I've explained thus far doesn't take the little things into account either. Holding the 
 left trigger keeps whomever you're controlling square to opposing players and/or the goal you're 
 attacking. Poke checking is extremely effective, whenever your stick isn't passing through an opposing 
 puck handler's stick and skates. That's why I'm responsible for tripping penalties as often as 
 I am. Anyway, holding the right bumper has you hold your stick out to help with blocking the puck, 
 and the skill stick allows you to command where you maintain it along the ice. Pressing the left 
 bumper makes you kneel down as real NHL players do to smother passing lanes. If you know a shot 
 is coming though, pressing each bumper simultaneously has you lie down on the ice completely, in 
 hopes that the puck hits anything but your face.
  
  NHL 08 plays seamlessly for the most part, and the Create A Play feature helps make every competition 
 unique. It's unfortunate that your masterpieces aren't compatible online in addition to the lack 
 of opposing players when trying to test your plays, but it's still a move in the right direction. 
 How it works is actually not complicated, which is a wonderful thing. You control one player at 
 a time, and when you press record with the desired player, you skate to wherever you wish and however 
 you wish, and stop recording. Cycle to the next teammate, and have him do the same in accordance 
 to the previously recorded player, which actually runs in real-time, so you don't have to play 
 guessing games. Do this for every player, and test it by controlling the player designated to initiate 
 the play [in real-time] on the ice, and watch as what you designed executes. If you manage to beat 
 your backup goaltender, the poor sap in net for this mode, then you can take it into Dynasty to 
 see if it manages to accomplish your end objective, which is increasing your status on the scoreboard.
 
  
  Dynasty in of itself is a nice way to experience the real 2007-2008 NHL season. It may not be as 
 deep as what you see in NHL 2K8, but it offers enough to satisfy the market NHL 08 is meant for. 
 The regular season schedule is there, and you can play every NHL and AHL game, including the Easter/Western 
 All-Star competition. That's right, each AHL affiliate [such as Wilkes-Barre Scranton Baby Penguins 
 for Pittsburgh] is present and accounted for, in addition to the Elite international teams. The 
 Elite franchises are only playable through Quick Play and World Tournament, but it's cool to have 
 them here regardless. Keep in mind this is Dynasty though, which means you have your share of managerial 
 duties, which includes free agent signings, placing players on waivers, handling contracts and 
 maintaining the development of your team as a whole. It's nothing you have to think really hard 
 about if you know a thing or two about hockey, so if what's in NHL 2K8 intimidates you, then 08 
 is the perfect alternative.
  
  You're not limited to playing the AI that EA designed for your opponents either. Go online, and 
 play actual people from all around the world. Ranked and unranked matches are available for the 
 various modes, such as Versus, Team Versus, Shootout and others. If who you're playing is using 
 a headset, and you have one as well, you can enjoy some civilized talks. Of course it's inevitable 
 to run into the occasional jerkoff that takes online gaming way too seriously, but that's why we 
 dont play with those people. On the technical end, games are quite the entertainment, when there 
 isn't any lag or disconnections. I've experienced both, and they suck, but thankfully it's usually 
 not a recurring problem.
  
  Ok, now for the somewhat less important aspects, at least in my eyes, but I'm sure someone out 
 there cares. NHL 08 is a good looking hockey title. The player models are a bit of a mixed bag. 
 Some of them like Malkin, Crosby and Recchi reflect their real-life counterparts well. Others, 
 well, not so much. I don't know if EA scored actual face scans of the NHL's athletes or if they 
 built them from scratch, but it's about a half-and-half split between plausible models and who 
 the hell is that?! models. The arenas have seen decent improvement, especially with the lighting 
 effects that cause players to cast shadows on the ice. There's no noticeable ice degradation from 
 all the skating that's done, which is disappointing, but it's forgivable considering what you're 
 mostly concentrating on. The crowd is also a bit livelier this year, as they respond to exciting 
 action and various happenings such as penalty calls and whatnot. It's just unfortunate that they 
 animate like crap, and for some reason the fans lag when they do the wave. At least the framerate 
 holds up well in the 360 title though, so there's never any slowdown during actual play. It's a 
 shame the same can't be said about the PS3 game. Even if it doesn't destroy the experience, it's 
 still something to point out. The awesome animations lie within the players when they're deking, 
 when the goalies flash their skills with glove and pads, or in the physicality altogether.
  
  Finally, and what most people generally shrug off after a while, is NHL 08's audio content, 
 courtesy of EA's typical licensed tracks and in-game atmosphere. EA's hockey titles have often 
 featured a handful of rock and emo bands. The songs in this year's game are actually decent, but 
 once you've heard them a few times [because they play in the menu and during actual games] , you 
 just get sick of them. That's when you take advantage of the system's multimedia features and play 
 your own music. Now granted you'll you miss out on Gary Thorne and Bill Clement's fairly impressive 
 play-by-play and color commentary, but it's not a huge loss. Although it is neat how EA implemented 
 their dialogue to supplement the gameplay, rather than just being voices to listen to, because 
 when your opponents finally find a way to counter your offense, they will let you know in a subtle 
 manner. During play, you can hear your teammates communicate with each other, albeit on a minimal 
 level, and hear shouts from your coach on the bench. The effects are fine as usual, with puck meeting 
 stick, body meeting body [or glass] , and the posts sounding as metallic as ever. I just wish that 
 the goal sirens were consistent with the NHL teams' horns, because Pittsburgh's is their old one 
 and I prefer the one they have now.
  
  Well then, looks like I can finally bring this sucker to a close. I truly thank EA for finally 
 taking the time to listen to what the fans want for a change, like with what they've done for Need 
 For Speed ProStreet, and delivering their first simulation-driven NHL videogame in years. It's 
 really been way too long, but better late than never in this case. With such an eye-opening AI 
 system, along with all the wonderful gameplay upgrades, everything else just complements NHL 08 
 as being the definitive hockey title to date. If you're a big fan of the sport like I am, then 
 methinks you would find similar joy in playing EA Canada's latest delivery.

Review:  If you have or still playing hockey, you will find this game to be a dream come true. EA has done 
 an excellent job in re-making the entire feel of the game. The skating, the checking, the shooting, 
 and the AI have all been revamped. The game plays a lot smoother, meaning the animations are cleaner 
 and much more well done. The additions of choosing your own equipment and then being able to test 
 them out is amazing. Additionally, the graphics are superb with sharp images on both HD and regular 
 TVs. The creation zone, where you can create a play, a player/goalie, and a team are fantastic. 
 I love testing my own plays with different situations. Overall a great game, but a few problems 
 I have notices are quite minimal but should be known. First, when down low and trying to setup 
 an offensive play I find that the frame rate gets really choppy which is a real annoyance when 
 you're looking for an open man. Also the goalies still do not play very smart. They have very few 
 save selections and STILL do not know how to play a wrap around or walk outs. They're equipment 
 is very authentic, EXCEPT for their helmets. I wish EA would have taken the time to at least get 
 some goalie's helmets paint jobs done correctly like Martain Brodeur or Curtis Joseph. Lastly, 
 the create a play could have used more situations to use it, like off a faceoff or when you have 
 a breakout. However these are all very slight problems and only separate the game from being great 
 to amazing. Overall, NHL 08 is THE best hockey game out there right now for next generation consoles. 
 You need to know how to play hockey if you want to do well in this game and will find the All Star 
 and Super Star levels very challenging. There is plenty of options in this game to keep you busy 
 and will find that NHL 08 is worth the 60 bucks. For once, EA has made a game that owes up the 
 hype and price.

Review:  Positives:
  1. Graphics are amazing.
  2. AI is really as good as it gets. Im a hockey player from Canada and this is the real deal. It 
 actually plays like a real game.
  3. Analog stick is much easier to use and a million times better then last year.
  4. Create a 
 team and player is awesome. The guy actually says my last name every time I score or get the puck.
 
  5. Just a super good fun game.
  
  Negatives:
  1. Live is a little messed up right now, but Im sure they'll fix it.
  2. Controlling your goalie 
 is kinda poopy. Its all about positioning not actually about saving. Should be both.
  3. Dynasty is still the same, alittle different. Gotta dig deeper into the NHL world. Why not Enhance 
 the stadium? Hire better doctors? Customize a mascot? They should get high lite reels on a professional 
 sports T. V. thing after a big game. That would be cool.
  
  Conclusion:
  The game is still awesome. Keep the gameplay the same, but go alittle deeper next year for Dynasty 
 mode.

Review:  I love hockey, and yes Im Canadian. I've been playing hockey and playing hockey videogames for 
 as long as I can remember, and I can say that this is the best hockey game ever made. This is what 
 Ive always wanted in a hockey game. Everything just feels so right, from the skating to the hitting 
 to the crowd. The graphics are amazing with crazy amounts of detail and the most life-like faces 
 ever in a hockey game. But its in the gameplay that NHL 08 shows why its the best ever. Everything 
 feels just right about the physics in the game. From the big hits to the way players skate. The 
 animations look great making it look and play like a hockey game should.
  
  One of my favorite new features has to be the defender decks. When done right you can make the 
 defender look silly and put yourself into a highlight real breakaway, if done wrong you'll be on 
 the ice seeing stars. Its a great new feature and really makes you earn your chances. With the 
 tough AI that actually learn as the game goes on and the amazing goaltenders you'll need all the 
 help you can get.
  
  The AI is amazing blocking pucks, running plays, and crashing the net. You can even make custom 
 plays to try in games. But the defense is smart, learning from what you do and then trying to stop 
 you. You'll have to mix things up or the defense will stop you all night. Penalties seem fair and 
 mostly any you get will be because of you and not your AI teammates. The fighting also great this 
 year, theres nothing better then a fight to fire your team up.
  
  And best of all this game has great replay value letting you play in the NHL, AHL, two Russian 
 super leagues, and international. Not to mention the much improved online with team games, shoot 
 outs, and leagues. If youre a hockey fan then you have to pick up this game!

Review:  This game was a major let down for me. For the last 2 or 3 weeks i read about how great this game 
 was and that there was no reason to even consider any other hockey game. When i brought it home, 
 i started playing on pro, and it was a fun experience, but it gets very easy very fast. The AI 
 falls for the same moves over and over even if you turn the AI learning up. So I decided it was 
 time to make the jump to All-Star. man, talk about cheapo AI. The opposing AI has been totally 
 revamped this year, but playing defense is still a joke. the opponents cycle the puck for up to 
 2 minutes while you just sit and watch. poke checks are ineffective, checking only pushes the guy 
 further up ice, and laying your stick down never works. It seems like moving up in difficulty in 
 EA sports games simply means they tilt the game in your opponents direction. They don't do anything 
 to make them smarter, they just ramp up their stats. I really wanted to like this game, but it 
 just wasn't going to happen. I traded it back in for NHL 2k8 and I personally think 2k made the 
 better game this year. This game does so much right, but it screws so many other things up. the 
 Create-A-Play, while fun, is completely useless, the create a player is almost the same as last 
 year, except you can kind of choose your equipment. There is no face molder, just 9 pre-created 
 faces. Franchise mode SUCKS. It's completely hollow, just like last year, and, AGAIN, players ask 
 for way to much money after the first year, so keeping your roster full and competitive is overly 
 difficult. In the end, this is a game that could have been really good, but EA found their way 
 to screw it up.

Review:  The Good: Takes NHL 07 and makes it better in nearly every way
  
  The Bad: Glitches
  
  This game is amazing. NHL 07 was by far my favorite NHL game ever. My complaint was the lack of 
 options you had in the game, probably because of the whole redesign of the controls scheme. This 
 game takes the principles of NHL 07 and makes it into a really great game. The new online modes 
 have kept me busy since I bought the game and I am extremely excited about the League Play and 
 shootout options. The Dynasty mode is about the same and hasn't changed much other than signing 
 players isn't quite as random. The game play itself is absolutely great. The new learning AI makes 
 it challenging and makes you strategize instead of doing the same thing over and over again. The 
 graphics are a little better than 07. Some aspects of detail are better and the skating motions 
 are awesome as promised. So far the bad thing is still in the online department. I have dropped 
 out of some of the shootouts online for no reason at all. Also the team game online, which I am 
 dying to play, drops every time I try to get in a game. If EA can just tweak their online play 
 to work a little better 09 will be getting a 10.

Review:  Each year, hockey seasons come and go, leaving hockey fans with memories of exhilarating, heart-pounding 
 on-ice action. Hockey video games follow the same path as their real-life counterparts as new renditions 
 are released annually and, just like our favorite hockey team, sometimes they don't live up to 
 our expectations.
  
  Last year, EA Sports gave us it's first hockey game on current-generation consoles in NHL 07. Aside 
 from outstanding graphics and sound, it introduced us to the Skill Stick, where your right thumb-stick 
 becomes your hockey stick, used to take shots and deke your opponents. This new innovation was 
 a breath of fresh air in a stale EA franchise that needed it badly. But it still didn't feel like 
 a real hockey game. The goalies still gave up easy goals, the AI was still brain-dead and, after 
 you mastered the Skill Stick, the game didn't offer any challenge at all.
  
  What a difference a year makes. EA took their already solid product, tweaked and refined what already 
 worked well and added some new gameplay features that fans of the series have been clamoring for 
 to create the very best hockey video game ever in NHL 08.
  
  The biggest change made to this year's game is the AI. In past NHL games, after you'd played a 
 couple of matches and figured out how the game handled itself, it was very easy to destroy computer-controlled 
 teams, even on the hardest difficulty setting. This time around, the AI has been perfected so, 
 when you try the same offensive or defensive play a couple of times, they'll quickly adjust on 
 the fly and break up your plays. The goalie AI has also been tweaked so now, the masked men will 
 rarely let shots from the blue line get through. Also, gone are the ridiculous bouncing puck goals, 
 where the puck would bounce off of the goalie and find it's way behind him.
  
  These changes are more than welcome, and one has to wonder why they weren't implemented a long 
 time ago. It now feels like you're playing a real game of hockey instead of an arcade version of 
 it. AI players are much more intelligent now and won't just try to check you all the time. They'll 
 get in front of you, force you along the boards, block any chance for you to pass the puck and 
 fore-check a lot more. All of this makes the game much harder than last year's, but nobody will 
 complain about that, since it'll make it last a lot longer in single player modes.
  
  Speaking of game modes, another long-awaited feature makes it's appearance in this year's game. 
 Fans have been demanding online leagues for a very long time and, finally this year, EA has answered 
 the call. Up to 32 people can now participate in an online league and, although it's not quite 
 what I expected it to be, it's still a huge step in the right direction. Another new addition this 
 year are shootouts, where you go 1-on-1 against another person online and compete against them. 
 You'll even have the opportunity to control your goalie with the new Goalie Vision. You'll get 
 a first-person view of the action as you try to block your opponents' shots. These bouts can be 
 extremely fun and add tremendously to the overall online experience in NHL 08.
  
  The game's offline also gets some new stuff this year. Gameplay wise, the omnipresent Skill Stick 
 has been refined to include 1-on-1 dekes this time around. You now have more maneuverability when 
 coming face to face against a defensemen. Once you master this new move, getting past defensemen 
 will become easy... too easy in fact. You'll be able to deke your way to glory almost every time 
 and the defense doesn't seem to be able to adjust to that. Thankfully, not every player can deke 
 successfully. Only the talented skaters get it right most of the time.
  
  Create-A-Play is also another new feature this year. As the name clearly suggests, you'll be able 
 to create a play for every situation your team will find itself in, whether it be offense or defense. 
 Creating a play is as simple as pie. You press the B button to start recording, move your player 
 along the ice, and press B again to stop. Repeat for every player on the ice. You can then run 
 your play to see how it works out. Awesome stuff, especially since your created plays can be carried 
 onto your Dynasty and other single player modes as well. It's a shame that they don't work online 
 though, that would've been sweet. But, who knows, maybe a patch is in the works for that.
  
  If your creative genius is still alive and kicking after that, you'll be thrilled to know that 
 you can create your own player, goalie and team also. The create-a-player and create-a-goalie pretty 
 much speak for themselves. You can fully customize your player and goalie from the way he looks 
 right down to his skates. Once you're done with that, you'll be able to move on to creating your 
 own team. This is a new addition to this year's game and I, for one, have been waiting for something 
 like this for a long time. You'll get to fully customize your team's name, the city they'll play 
 in and their uniforms, both at home and on the road. Then, you'll get to choose 23 players and 
 draft them to your team, while observing the salary cap, of course. This new feature is incredibly 
 fleshed out and quite fun to experience with. If there is one bad thing about it, it's that you 
 can't choose what your arena will look like. Aside from that, everything is peachy keen.
  
  Dynasty mode returns once again, but this time around, it's been refined and reworked almost to 
 perfection. First thing you'll notice is the new, manageable layout, which includes Conference 
 standings, scoring leaders and a weekly calendar. In Dynasty mode this year, you'll not only be 
 able to play all of your NHL team's 82 games, managing everything from ticket sales to your lineup, 
 you'll also be able to play all of your AHL team's games. This adds a whole new spin on the way 
 you manage your NHL team, since you'll be able to adequately evaluate your affiliate's players 
 before calling them up. I adore this new spin on the Dynasty mode since it adds more depth and 
 finally resembles how a real NHL team functions. Remember how easy it was to sign free agents last 
 year? Things have changed a bit in NHL 08. You'll still offer a contract to a free agent, but now 
 he'll actually take time to think about your offer and get back to you with his final answer. When 
 he finally does, he won't just accept or decline, he'll give you a reason behind his decision. 
 This is now closer to reality and goes along with the direction EA wanted to take with NHL 08.
 
  
  Once again, the graphics steal the show. This has got to be the best looking sports game on the 
 XBox 360. The player models are unbelievably realistic and their moves and motions on the ice are 
 incredibly detailed. Sadly, there are still some hiccups in the goalie's movements, especially 
 when he has to go from one side to the other. The animation seems to skip a bit when he does that. 
 There's a little bit of clipping in some instances, but it's barely noticeable. If there is one 
 thing EA needs to work on in future games, besides the goalie animations, its the crowd. Seems 
 to me like it's the same crowd animations since 2002 and it kind of hinders the rest of it's spectacular 
 visual presentation.
  
  The sounds are exactly what you'd expect from a hockey game. You'll hear the players scream out 
 orders to each other while the fans cheer or boo in the background. You'll now hear the home team's 
 National Anthem at the beginning of every match, which is a very nice touch. The best damn duo 
 in sport commentating, Gary Thorne &amp; Bill Clement, return once again this year. These guys 
 are absolutely perfect together and make you feel like you're actually watching a game on television. 
 Their delivery is absolutely flawless. The soundtrack to NHL 08 is relatively unknown, but still 
 the songs are quite catchy.
  
  Whether you're a hardcore fan looking for a deep, detailed game or a casual fan just wanting to 
 play a good game of hockey, NHL 08 is exactly what the doctor ordered. This new entry in the series 
 shows that EA can still pull rabbits out of their hats and produce magic. The incredible detail 
 of realism transpires and shines through brightly, whether it's in the player models, an NHL team's 
 management or the on-ice action. There is no doubt in my mind that this is the very best hockey 
 video game ever made and that EA will have to work very hard to top it.

Review:  Finally, a hockey game that plays like a hockey game; feels like a hockey game, moves like a hockey 
 game. A fine return to form for EA and the impressions left upon us gamers over the last ten years. 
 The criticisms, it seems, were heard and taken to heart, fixed and improved this year over last; 
 and it's formed an awe-inspiring package. Everyone I know who owns or has played '08 is thoroughly 
 impressed, $60 well spent indeed. Even my girl is impressed with it!! and that's the greatest endorsement 
 any title can receive. Anyone who says '08 is sub-par or lame , worse than nhl 2k8, and unplayable 
 is blind, dumb, and ignorant. There is no competition for EA, and if they stay on track year after 
 year; there never will be again. period.

Review:  This years product is definately taking steps in the right direction. The fluid skating; starting, 
 stopping, accelerating... it's all very responsive and feels great. Yeah, there are some bugs still. 
 For example, it drives me crazy when I aim my shots at the top corner and they go blistering way 
 wide of the net and slam into the glass, but still... the on ice product is definately moving in 
 the right direction. Not that I'm looking for them, but I am not finding consistent ways to score 
 to cheapen the experience. Every goal is different, and that makes every one much more exciting 
 to score, which is how it should be. And as much as I hate losing, I do almost like that I'm not 
 dominating every game, you know, just looking to pad my stats. Although it is making it tough to 
 keep up with the league leaders. Speaking of which, I am still not enjoying moving through some 
 of the menus, but they are getting better. Hopefully by next year I can check the leagues player 
 stats without spending 2 minutes cycling through the rest of the teams in the league. Either that, 
 or I'll decide to play as Anaheim or Washington. And creating a team is a bit of a headache without 
 being able to sort the players on their teams by anything other than their names. Trying to find 
 people within a certain skill level or position or age or whatever is very time consuming. But 
 these are minor issues, and every game has those, so overall I still think things are looking up 
 for hockey fans. I look forward to taking the game online and seeing what that has to offer.

Review:  When NHL 08 and 2K8 were announced, I was wondering which one would get my money. I liked NHL 07, 
 but 2K7 had a last-gen feel.
  
  This year, NHL08 got their demo out of the gate before the release, so I was able to give it a 
 try. WOW! That was my reaction when I saw the new skating engine. It looked and felt so natural, 
 I went out and got it.
  
  First I want to say that I have played it since it was released and have come to the conclusion 
 that I finally have found that skating down the right side passing it for a one-timer. The AI is 
 too smart. To add to this, I am able to do more in the offensive zone. It's easier to cycle the 
 puck, pass it to the points, and generate multiple scoring opportunities that I was in 07. I feel 
 as though I can create offensive opportunities from any part of the ice. When setting up a scoring 
 opportunity I get the sense I am in complete control and goals I get are from plays I creat, and 
 not the computer.
  
  Not only is the feel natural, when watching the action, I get the sense that I am watching a real 
 game. In NHL07, it looked like a video game, but now, I marvel at the smooth frame rates and animations. 
 And at 60FPS, it's the best performing hockey game to date.
  
  Of course a video game isn't complete without play-by-play and this year, the combination of Gary 
 Thorne and Bill Clement is the best of any series. Their call of the game is the most complete 
 I have heard. Sure you noticed repetitive comments game in and game out, but usually what is happening 
 on the ice is translated in real time by their comments. Shoot a wrister, and they comment on the 
 quick wrister, lay on a huge check and they highlight it. Very well done.
  
  As far as sounds, everything that is heard sounds real, from pucks hitting the back boards, pipes, 
 in ice voices, music, hits on the boards all sound great. The only thing I still am not liking 
 is the horns. Sure, some sound pretty good, but others do not. As a Red Wing fan, I do not think 
 the horn is very accurate for the 'Joe.' EA, please update your sounds for the horns in a ll the 
 arenas. I think you nailed some, but not all.
  
  That is the only real beef I have with this game. I am sure I will be gaining more experience with 
 it and it should give me a full years of enjoyment. Thanks, EA: Canada for making an outstanding 
 product this year, Can't wait to see what you come up with next!

Review:  this has to be the cheapest nhl game i have ever played. first your goalie is terrible (but every 
 ea game your goalies sucks so no change there) second its impossible to play defence. they tried 
 to make it realastic. but its impossible to play D. you players just stand around watching the 
 puck go by them. just image madden but your o line just lets everyone run by them. thats how d 
 is in this game. and third its freaking impossible to take the puck off the oppssing team. and 
 if you dont score first you lose every game.
  
  this game had so much potenial but ea screwed it agian cause no one actually understands the games 
 they make. like ask any coach in the nhl. and they will agree. when your team is on d forwards 
 have to help out not just stand looking pretty. and everyone that says this game is good is only 
 playing on the easiest game mode or is just playing online. cause this game does not derserve an 
 8.5.

Review:  I've been playing hockey games since BLADES of STEEL on NES, which by the way still has the best 
 fighting, and NHL 08 has to be one of the best ever. It's right up there with 04, and 96. I made 
 the mistake of buying 2k8 first, and traded it in within a few days, for 08. Here's why.
  -gameplay- 10.0
  it feels like your watching a real game. from the way the players take the zone, 
 and set up the offense. to the way that goals are scored. not since nhl 04 have i actually felt 
 like i'm playing real hockey. and seeing how the rules have changed since then, this game is an 
 accurate representation of post lock out hockey. the goalies are vastly improved from last year, 
 not as many dumb goals. and the defensive controls are a vast improvement. 2k8 does actually have 
 a advantage here, but the controls are so damn complicated it's hard to use them. Online play is 
 highly addictive
  -controls-9.0
  offensive and defensive controls are simple and effective, the goalie controls are a bit off, but 
 goalie such a complex position to play that it'll be hard to duplicate that in a video game. i 
 just wish poke checking was a little tighter
  -graphics-9.5
  best graphics out there, some minor clipping issues and jerky animations. but overall it looks 
 real, way to real
  -features-8.5
  2k8 actually does have a better franchise mode. but 08 is still fun. online shoot outs are the 
 bomb. editing goalie pads is a wet dream for me, but i wish they had more cutom helmet options. 
 the creation suite is awesome as well
  -sound- 9.0
  much better than 2k8, the sound and commentary really draw you into the game. and the play by play 
 quality is in a diffrent league than 2k
  -replay, fun factor-10.0
  this may be the first hockey game that i actually finish all 15 years of franchise. i just wish 
 i had gotten this first. EA definatley stepped it up this year and made the better game. 2k has 
 to impove it's skating, and controls otherwise EA is going to leave them in the dust.

Review:  Just what hockey fan needs! An absolute respect to hockey game.
  noe we can talk of great plays and goaltending. It ain't an arcade games, sure you can score ten 
 goals if you want but you will have to work hard for it. The only thing is that the dynasty mode 
 is not quite deep enough for the franchise. Sure you can had signature bonuses and promises but 
 if you could create an arena, check all the prices inluding hot dogs and beers. But nonetheless, 
 it's the gameplay that gets it all. Smooth play and great AI will make you scream for more.

Review:  Not just because I am a fan of the game either! THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST CONSOLE GAMES EVER 
 MADE!!
  Aside from the incredible lifelike graphics and player movements, EA nailed it with all the extra 
 activities that you may get involved in!
  Practice mode rules here!
  Create a play is a little difficult at first, but then gets more natural.
  The new features to 
 the already exciting SKILL STICK make this years version TOP NOTCH, BEST IN SERIES!!
  In fact, the ONLY thing I found wrong with this game (has NOTHING to do with hockey or gameplay) 
 is the horrendous soundtrack! Usually, EA Sports soundtracks are somewhat enjoyable, but not this 
 time!
  If this game only gets better as I play, Man, It will be the first game OFF THE CHARTS (yes, GOW... even 
 over you) !!
  Get this game! Go get it NOW!!
  
  WOW!

Review:  Ok what ever that random 2k fan said giving it a 6.5 is wrong. This game gives you lets you control 
 every out come of the game... the create a play.. the only problem there is is when u want someone 
 to deflect a shot (what ryan smyth does) he doesnt do it everytime.. but other than that the game 
 is amazing. the coolest things is create a play and signing free agents is soo much different.
 
  Graphics: 9.5/10
  Gameplay: 8.9/10
  Sound: 8.9/10 Get this game if your a hockey fan because seriously, 2k8 sucks it got a 7... thats 
 horrible... this game rulezzz.. Dynasty mode is AWESOME!

Review:  I have wrote a review before when this game first came out. I gave it a 9.5 at first, but I believe 
 I made a mistake in giving it that rating.
  Here is where EA went right with this game. AI learning was a good concept. The opponents AI knows 
 how to play defense, with the exception of their Centre who does nothing but stand at the point 
 waiting to intercept a pass or pokecheck. The AI does pick up on where you are going to set up 
 on offense later on in the game and will force you to change your strategy. If you have problems 
 with the AI, adjust it so that either they learn nothing at all or learn everything you are doing. 
 Create a play was a good concept as well, but that was all. Some of the bad goals (bounces of the 
 goalie several times before going on) that were scored last year don't happen anywhere near as 
 often this year. The fighting system this year is ok, and it is hit and miss for those who played 
 the last few versions of EA NHL.
  Where EA went wrong.
  1. Your own team's AI is absolutely stupid. Instead of playing defence, the AI will let the other 
 team skate into the slot and shoot the puck top shelf. More than 50% of these shots go in. The 
 AI will not do much on the offensive end, just get in the way a couple times instead of going where 
 they are supposed to go.
  2. No system link, and no 8-10 player capability You get 3 on 3. While it is an improvement over 
 last year, simply having 6 people max. per game is not that great either.
  3. Poke checking is useless. You can't do poke check when you need to.
  4. Recycled Dynasty mode. 
 Enough said
  5. The harder the difficulty, the more impossible it is to win games. The AI on the other team 
 just dominates too easily.
  
  While still fun to play and still a good game, NHL 08 is still a bit of a letdown. 7.4 is my rating. 
 This time I mean it.

Review:  I've been buying every hockey video game since the first NHL game on the Sega Genesis back in 1990, 
 so I consider myself quite the expert when it comes to the sport on the small screen. Over the 
 past 6 years it's been a back and forth battle between the EA and 2K sports franchises. Not including 
 this year, I would have to say that 2K sports has taken the title 5 of those 6 years. I can say 
 this completely without bias because I love this sport so much that I actually bought both versions 
 of the game for each of those 6 years! Last year, EA took some major risks with the changes they 
 made, and for the most part, they were effective. The right control stick for shooting was revolutionary. 
 The graphics were hyper detailed and real. There were a few minor issues with computer AI and the 
 skating engine, but otherwise the game was near golden. All except for one HUGE problem. FRAMERATE!!! 
 NHL 2007 ran like a pig. For the life of me, I couldn't see how soo many people could look past 
 the horrid framerate in the game. Some people I spoke with in the forums didn't even notice it??!! 
 I mean the game looked like someone was turning the lights on and off real fast, that's how bad 
 it was. So last year, it was easy for me to go with 2K7. Yeah, the graphics didn't look as good 
 standing still, but man it ran as smooth as silk. For me, video hockey is as simple as this: 40% 
 great framerate, 40% great default camera, 20% details (Graphics, AI, Controls, etc.) . Because 
 without those first two things, the rest isn't even worth looking into. Well I am happy to say 
 that this year, EA Sports NHL 2008 has nailed the formula perfectly! First the framerate... man, 
 what happened! This sucker is running at 60 frames without a hitch! The default camera is PERFECT. 
 Add in the improved AI, skating, passing and improved online play, you have one heck of a game 
 here.
  
  I am not going to go into the ins and outs of the game here, Gamespot's review does that and you've 
 already read that. I am just here to say that NHL 2008 is THE hockey game to get this year. 2K 
 sports NHL 2K8 is a modified version of 2K7 with a try at EA's right shooting stick, but it's essentially 
 the same otherwise. I would say this to all my fellow 2K sports lovers: Give NHL 2008 a shot this 
 year. EA finally got it right! NHL 2008 is without a doubt the finest Hockey game ever made since 
 hockey went 3D. And those are strong words coming from someone like me.
  
  SPECIAL NOTE: For the life of me I cannot understand how Gamespot and some other review sites dismiss 
 the framerate improvement in this year's game as something minor. It is a huge, huge, HUGE deal. 
 And not to dig on the PS3, but I saw NHL 2008 running on the PS3 at Target and the framerate was 
 perhaps even WORSE than NHL 2007 on the 360! How can you possibly give the 360 version and the 
 PS3 version the same score?? To me, the PS3 version is nearly unplayable, just as last years 360 
 version was. With the stuttering framerate, you have to kind of guess when to shoot and pass, inticipating 
 where your player will be when the next frame appears. It's that bad. Seriously. I am sure the 
 PS3 version will be fine next year, but to call these games equal is an outright lie!

Review:  EA innove again with his hockey game. First of all, they improve the Control Skill Stick system. 
 That system has been implanted in NHL 07 on the 360, and they upgrade it a little bit.
  
  Now you control your stick in either way you wanna. You can do skills tricks:
  
  - Pass the 
 puck between the legs of your opponent.
  - You can thwart your opponent by left, right , or either turn on yourself
  
  Well you have 
 other tricks but I'm not gonna tell you all of it.
  
  Well graphics are always still awsome, as we expected from EA like always.
  
  The Creating 
 Zone take a upgrade to. You can now choose the brand of your skates, stick, gloves .. etc. Can choose 
 the model, and for the stick you can choose the curve in the pallet! You can coose the angle of 
 your blade! All of that have a impact on your playing style, awsome!
  
  Dysnasty mode.... Well I expected a more complete Dynasty Mode.... this year is a little poor .... 
 Yes now you can play your AHL matchs, that's cool ... but can no longuer upgrade your team. So 
 you earn cash.... and? Well and when you create a skater .... in dynasty mode it's a little bit 
 too high salaries. That's impossible that a skater with an overall of 86 demand ... a contrack 
 of 7 millions !!!!! Well , it's just good!
  
  Control your goalie is a little bit tricky , but can be learn with time. New cotnrols can be hard 
 for some but with time you gonna play like a pro!
  
  I highly recommand this game !

Review:  Realy, what is EA problem with keeping rosters up to date? Best lineup option also creates unbelivible 
 player combinations... this is only bad thing about this game so far. I have not played so called 
 dinasy mode, but i hope it is much better than before. Gameplay is realy impoved and scoring on 
 a breakaway is not so easy anymore... defense could be better, but anyway... lots of new stuff 
 make this one best in series so far. I also noticed some bad things with player salaries - some 
 of them are more or less result of random number combinations and realy take feeling of reality 
 away.

Review:  15 years of video gaming and this version of NHL beats all the baseball, hockey, football, soccer 
 and racing games I have ever played.
  
  Overall polish and quality is outstanding. I won't comment on the online since I don't care for 
 it.
  
  Commentary is by far the best I have ever heard. I am sure the phrases will repeat over time but 
 wow what a first impression. The announcers are friggin perfect in their presentation. Pace and 
 variety is on the money and the best I have ever heard. Graphics are top notch and sim features 
 are terrific. And here I thought quality EA titles were a thing of the past. Nice job EA hockey 
 team... you guys rock!!!

 breaking, and the comitary (don't really know how to spell it) . the comitary should talk about players 
 achievment throughtout a season such as how many goals they have or if they have a good +/-. or 
 if they lead the league in points. When u score a goal and ur face and whoever assists it show 
 up, it should also tell me how many goals they now have in a season or even in their whole career 
 if they are getting close to a significant amount such as 600 or 800 goals ect.

Review:  That guy Jim who gave it a 1.0 is an idiot! Someone shoot that jerk! I'd give it a 8.5 - 9.0, but 
 to try and even out that fools 1.0, I've listed it as a 10.0
  Also, I just want to state that I enjoy 2k's hockey game too, and I'll be picking up 2k8, but it's 
 the skill stick that keeps me hooked on EA's offering. It funny how 2k now has the Prostick ... who's 
 copying who now. PS: Nothing would please me more than to see the Ducks choke when the playoffs 
 come. That Cup win was a fluke, and I hope we never see them win it again.

Review:  Every aspect is near perfection. I don't see how the controls could get any better, and the graphics 
 and small details are tremendous. The face detail is incredible and the game play is so smooth. 
 This is a better hockey game than the new madden is a football game.
  
  In my opinion 2k games have always been overhyped. They have bad graphics and, though smooth, the 
 gameplay is unrealistic. Players really can't and don't move in the ways the game shows. NHL 07 
 and now 08 are FAR more realistic and every way! If you have ANYONE to play against, the multiplay 
 is a freakin blast to play in your dorm room or otherwise. Online is always fun, and I have had 
 no problems with lag or fram rate.

Review:  first of all, I have played hockey games since ice hockey for atari ya most of you haven't heard 
 of it i'm sure but i have played probably 95% of hockey games that were ever made, I love the game 
 of hockey and i also love the videogames, anyways one thing that also always bothered me about 
 EA hockey is that you never had that ultimate control over your team it's like you just played 
 a role out there its true that they have always been reasonably fun some more then others, an this 
 is what 2k games have over EA they may not have them in graphical prowess or fancy presentation 
 or smooth framerate but 2k has always given you the ability to really control the outcome of games 
 offensively and defensivly, even though i have yet to play 2k8 this year the past titles have given 
 you this feeling, thats why i am a 2k fan. but this is an EA game so i will give the 08 review.
 
  
  Graphics: 9.5
  framerate:9
  controls:6.5
  gameplay:5.5
  depth:6.5
  presentation:8.5 this game is a very ambitious solid game but still is missing that ultimate control 
 that 2k gives you especially on defence where it feels like your just pointlessly roaming around 
 at times with an ineffective wave of the stick and when the opposition scores it feels like its 
 computer decided its not because you made a foolish mistake on defense it just feels like the tempo 
 is controlled. And as far as the skill stick which i think is a great inovation needs the shot 
 to be changed somehow because frequently when i am stickhandling i accidently shoot which is annoying, 
 so overall a solid game that just needs a little more then good looks!!
  
  p. s: why is there no fantasy draft again? this makes no sense!!

Review:  This is a 'first impressions' review after having sat and played for 4 hours straight.
  
  I've only picked up the game from EB Games earlier today and after the first impressions, I've 
 got to say that this is a VERY solid release. It builds on what made NHL 07 such a great game, 
 and takes it further. The addition of AHL, Eliteserien and SM-Liiga teams to the mix of NHL and 
 International squads means an incredible variety of players and styles to mix it up with and makes 
 it that much more fun when going through the Create-A-Team setup. This was my first stop, and I 
 have to say, I'm VERY impressed. When I first sat down and saw the screen shots from EA and GameSpot, 
 I didn't expect it to be that deep, but the fact is, once you sit down and start to tinker with 
 the various aspects, it is a relatively deep mode. No, it doesn't have Create-An-Arena in the same 
 way that NHL 2004 did back in the days of Xbox hockey, and it could use a bit of customization 
 in terms of logo choices, but it is still a VERY solid feature, and my Birmingham (UK) Renegades 
 thank EA for that one! I decided that it would be best to take players from the Free Agents pool 
 to build my team's roster, and wow am I glad I did! You not only get the NHL's free agents, but 
 all of the other leagues as well, and it gives you a great group of players to build a team with! 
 Yes, there are a lot of over-the-hill NHL-ers in the mix (Roenick, Mike Keane, etc) , but there 
 are some solid players still in that mix, and you can build a strong and competitive team if you 
 have the time to sit down a sift through the names.
  
  My next step was the Edit-A-Player feature, to see just how much control we were given this year. 
 I'm happy to say that it is incredible as well! Being a goalie fan, I was ecstatic to find that 
 goalie pads were completely customizable, even the nondescript green pads of Marty Turco could 
 be livened up as much as you wanted. Brands are true-to-life, so the options for pads are as open-ended 
 as your imagination. My only complaint with the equipment lies, as it does every year, with the 
 Goalie masks. You're given the generic team-themed masks like last year, but you're also given 
 a group of about 9 or 10 new custom design masks. This would be excellent except that they aren't 
 customizable beyond simply selecting them and seeing how they look. There's no ability to customize 
 colours, no ability to make them truly belong to the goalie or the team, just plain old designs. 
 Now, make no mistake, I'm thrilled that they're in the game and that goalies can be customized 
 to that level, but I surely hope that by next year's installation we can take that mask customization 
 one step further.
  
  So, I've made my team, edited a few players' gear, what's next but to check out the lineups and 
 hit the ice? So, those were my next stops. The lineups this year are fairly up-to-date, but the 
 cut-off missed a few of the bigger post-rush signings, like Roenick. It's a small nit-picky thing, 
 and if you have the patience to sit down and tinker with it, you'll get your up-to-date lineup. 
 Outside of that tiny tidbit, the rosters are perfect. So, now I was ready to hit the ice!
  
  Before jumping straight out there, I gave it a go in practice mode, and I've come to discover 
 that I'm going to make a horrible goalie. The Be-A-Goalie mode is a lot of fun, but you've got 
 to be on your game if you hope to stop pucks with any consistency. Playing off the rush on the 
 offensive side of the puck in practice mode also shows how realistic the AI is this time around, 
 as your teammates will do everything in their power to find some open ice for you to get the puck 
 to them, and the defense will do everything they can to stop you. It's a huge reward to watch a 
 puck-cycling team find that open spot and stuff the puck home, and you will have to work for it 
 this year. The defense will learn from you and stop what you're doing!
  
  So I've now had my fun in practice mode, it's time to get out there and do it for real. Next up? 
 Dynasty mode. I elected not to take my created Renegades into the Dynasty mode for now, so selected 
 my favourite Dallas and Iowa Stars combo. My first action as the GM? To trade Mathew Barnaby (sorry 
 Barney, but you're not my kind of player) . I managed to make it a nice pickup at Barney's expense 
 and off I went. I fiddled with the line combinations, went through a few more practice sessions 
 and then hit the ice.
  
  Games in NHL 08 are far more realistic than any previous incarnation we've known, and you'll see 
 it straight off the draw. If you're not thinking hockey, you'd better start! There is a bit of 
 a learning curve if you're new to hockey in general, but what better way to learn the ins and outs 
 of the various aspects of hockey than to simply get out there and do it? One thing that struck 
 me once out there on the ice -- you really feel the atmosphere of the crowd. As the away team in 
 my first game, you could feel the silence if you dominated play for any length of time, or you 
 felt the disappointment as you scored against the home team. The chatter as play moves on (the 
 'Shoot' chants or 'Use the D' screams) is intriguing to listen to, and it shows just how intuitive 
 the game is now. You have to dig in if you want to win games, as I barely squeaked out a 4-3 victory 
 in my first match.
  
  Overall, I'm incredibly happy with my initial impressions of NHL 08, and I feel that this is a 
 fantastically solid game. I'm looking forward to unlocking the Jerseys soon, but there's more than 
 enough to hold players over until that time.
  
  This is a very solid release.

Review:  Any true hockey fan can honestly say that this is not an amazing game. It is really that good. 
 The skating animations are phenomenal,, skill stick amazing, and new to 08 is the one on one play 
 and create a play. Also this year your D are actually where they are supposed to be and this allows 
 the player to have an effective powerplay and more importantly a well rounded offense. The AI is 
 incrediably smart as they switch thier stratagey to your style of play. I could go on but I let 
 you discover the game for yourself. Forget 2k8 worn out gameplay and buy this game. EA is officaly 
 back on top where they belong!

Review:  i was pleasantly surprised whe I played the demo that this is one fluid game the controls are good 
 but just the fact that you can set up plays in the zone, work the points and all that makes for 
 a great and engrossing game. I like the shot stick from last year but not much else. This year 
 the animations look fantastic especially little touches like when their heads turn and their bodies 
 lean when turning and cutting. I got to say I have both NHL 2k8 and NHL 08 and 2k8 plays a good 
 enough hockey game especially after you learn the controls but I think I find myself going back 
 to 08 more this time around. This may very well be one of the better NHL's in series from EA

Review:  Hi All,
  Last night I drove over the border to Canada to get the game. I had four hours of sleep becuase 
 I played all night and had a meeting at 7:30a. m. So hopefully what I will write below will make 
 sense. I have been playing NHL even before it had a year attached to their name.. so, that has been 
 awhile. I was looking forward to this game so that I could dissect it. Well, here is a summary 
 version.
  
  Gameplay:
  In All-Star mode, it has been really kicking my a$$. That is actually a good thing. Once I began 
 to analyze why they were scoring on me, I realized because i wasn't playing hockey like the way 
 I play on the ice, but I was still playing arcade hockey. Once I began to play hockey, I was able 
 to get a tie. This is an amazing improvement in my book because it has turned the game finally 
 to a sim version of the game. I kept taking shots in the slots, only to be reminded by the announcer 
 that this particular strategy was already old. The skating is smooth, and the control options are 
 great. I do wish there was some tutorial that showed what kind of moves can be pulled in this year 
 game. So all and all, the goalies are tough, the AI is smart, and the game is at the right pace.
 
  
  Score: 10
  
  Graphics:
  I thought NHL 08 was going to be the best game in terms of graphics from the EA lineup, until I 
 saw NBA Live 08. Okay, so now, they are second best, but even at 2nd place they are great! Can 
 they be better, not sure if the Xbox 360 can manage it, but as a pc gamer, it does satisfy my need 
 for crazy graphics.
  
  Score: 9.5
  
  Presentation:
  Lame, lame, lame. It doesn't really get me excited. I know that this is a tough thing because you 
 don't want to make the presentation too long where people are like start the game already , but 
 they can do a better job in integrating presentation with the game to make it more exciting... for 
 example, we have all talked about displaying players milestones... this is in the direction I would 
 go towards. Score: 7
  
  Audio:
  Besides some annoying songs, and you can ever please everybody with the selection of songs, the 
 game audio is really great. On a surround system, it is great to hear on the left back channel 
 Point! Point! The sounds of hits against the board is really well done. The only question is Who 
 the $% #&amp; is Will? 
  
  Score: 9
  
  Value: Having Practice mode is awesome. The AHL team in Dynasty is a great addition. Create a team 
 and create a player, very fun. Online functionality, getting to where we all want it to be, BBBBUUUUTTTT... 
 I really wish that more was done to Dynasty. I want more involvement with the finances of the team 
 and more involvement with the media. Having practice in Dynasty would have been great as a way 
 to improve players. Fantasy draft should have not been left out including the skill competition. 
 So, since I play the game mostly in Dynasty mode, I wanted more.
  
  Score: 8.5
  
  Total Score 8.8

Review:  The best Hockey game ive ever played. this is must own game from the skilll stick to the new online 
 features, plus the fact you can play with your AHL teams as well. 2K8 can try to copy this but 
 will never master it like EA.
  All the player models and graphics are absolutley stunning. The sound has been updated which is 
 better. The conputer A I has come so far to give more of a challenge. All a round this game is 
 absoulutly amazing, if nhl 09 can beat nhl 08 i will be shocked. To all the sens fans out there 
 GO SENS GO!!!
