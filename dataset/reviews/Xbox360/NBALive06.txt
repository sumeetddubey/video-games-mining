:::Review:::
First impressions count for a lot, and NBA Live 06 certainly delivers in that regard. However, while 
 the game looks next-gen at times, it doesn't play like it. 

  NBA Live 06 can be considered, in a lot of ways, the first true next-generation basketball game. 
 The game engine has been rebuilt from scratch, and the game does indeed make a great first impression 
 on high-definition screens, with excellent-looking player models and courts. Unfortunately, that 
 great initial impression fades gradually the more you play. Though NBA Live 06 is still a fun basketball 
 offering that's noticeably slower and more simlike than recent entries in the series, it falls 
 short of its promise. Flaws like poorly blended animations, an erratic frame rate, a horribly flawed 
 free-throw-shooting mechanic, and the lack of a franchise mode combine to keep NBA Live 06 from 
 being the great basketball game it could have been.  

          Player models look fantastic in NBA Live 06.     

  When you first look at NBA Live 
 06 on an HDTV, it truly does look like a next-generation game. After initially loading Live, you're 
 immediately dumped into a practice court, where you can start shooting around and dunking with 
 an NBA player (the game defaults to cover-athlete Dwyane Wade) . Pressing start brings up a menu 
 from which you can jump into a game, create a player, fiddle with rosters, or start season mode. 
 If you choose to play a quick match, the game will load while still letting you shoot around the 
 practice gym. Once the game loads, you're treated to a fantastic broadcast-quality introduction, 
 with the camera spinning around the arena from up high and then right in to player introductions. 

  Immediately, you'll notice the high-quality player models. Player faces are spot-on, for the most 
 part, and it's also nice seeing the same amount of care and detail going into the coaches. The 
 skin textures, even if they are a bit shiny, are also the best we've seen in a basketball game, 
 with excellent definition on musculature. The lighting inside the arenas is a bit odd, though. 
 It's most noticeable when you look at a shot of players huddling around their coach, but it almost 
 seems as though the arenas aren't fully lit, as you'll see an excessive amount of shadowing on 
 character models. Sometimes it looks like you're playing an interactive basketball documentary 
 shot through a Hi-8 video camera instead of watching an NBA game broadcast.  

  Just looking at the introductions and the first few possessions on the floor, NBA Live 06 would 
 easily be pronounced the best-looking basketball game ever. But once you play the game for a while, 
 the biggest weakness in the visuals begins to become more apparent: the animation. Certain animations 
 look great, like players fighting through screens, some of the juke moves, and especially the various 
 dunk animations -- which look extremely fluid and are fun to watch. The developer has even cleaned 
 up a lot of the ice skating that we've all grown weary of in the other versions of Live. Where 
 the visuals really fall apart is in the way the animations blend together. Player dribbles and 
 collisions all seem to pop from one to the next. Sometimes you'll see a passed ball fly across 
 the court at an unnatural speed, or players will suddenly stick to (and unstick from) one another. 
 The defensive crouch stance and animation also looks odd, as the players look more like chimps 
 hobbling around with their arms outstretched than they look like pro basketball players trying 
 to stay in front of the ball handler. What's more, the frame rate can be slightly erratic at times, 
 especially when playing at 720p. It's never enough to hinder your gameplay experience, but it's 
 definitely noticeable enough to exacerbate the animation issues.  

          The dunks are also a highlight of the game.     

  If you're unlucky enough to still 
 be playing on a standard-definition television, then NBA Live 06, like many other Xbox 360 launch 
 games, probably won't induce much of a wow factor, either. The detailed character models still 
 look pretty good during replays, but the players in-game look so small and fuzzy that they're tough 
 to distinguish from one another. Worst of all, the font sizes used for the menus and interface 
 were clearly designed with HD in mind, only. You'll have a tough time reading certain menu items 
 in standard definition. This issue is most apparent with the names underneath the players you control, 
 as they're all but unreadable on a standard-definition TV.     

  The actual gameplay should feel very familiar to veterans of NBA Live. The control scheme is lifted 
 right out of NBA Live 05 (not 06, as freestyle superstar controls are not in this game) , with separate 
 dunk and shoot buttons, a pro hop button, tip dunks, and, of course, the freestyle control stick. 
 You will notice, however, that the freestyle stick isn't as powerful as in previous games. Since 
 it's not so easy to break down your defender off the dribble, you'll probably feel more inclined 
 to move the ball around with some passes to find an open man. The offensive artificial intelligence 
 seems better here than in previous Live entries, with regard to player spacing, so passing the 
 ball around should be just as viable an option as isolating your best ball handler. You'll also 
 get some fun out of the post game, where you can use fadeaways, drop steps, and spin moves to try 
 to free yourself for an easy score. If that's not enough offensive variety for you, Live 06 also 
 uses a quick play system similar to March Madness' floor-general feature, which lets you quickly 
 call six different plays from your playbook using the D pad. You can also easily adjust offensive 
 and defensive sets at any stoppage of the ball through a quick menu system, as well as bring in 
 bench players or adjust rebounding/fast-breaking tendencies.  

          Unfortunately, the animation doesn't blend well.     

  As far as defense goes, Live 
 06 on the Xbox 360 feels a lot like previous games in the series. You can easily bring a double-team 
 to the post by just dropping a perimeter defender down to try to tie up the ball. You can use the 
 right analog stick to poke at the ball with either hand, but missing a steal on a lunge can result 
 in an open lane to the basket for your opponent. Your AI teammates do seem somewhat slow to both 
 rotate and close off driving lanes if you let a ball handler into the paint, and the default slider 
 setting seems to call quite a few fouls if you mistime your block attempts on defense. Rebounding 
 still offers some of the same ball-vacuuming flaws as found in previous Live games. You'll see 
 some balls mysteriously end up in the hands of rebounders who are boxed out of position, but the 
 problem isn't too pronounced. We also didn't like the fact that players running the fast break 
 with you don't seem to run hard or fill lanes the way they should.  

  These are all minor quibbles, though, compared to the horrible new free-throw-shooting mechanic. 
 The new mechanic isn't described anywhere in the manual. You have to pull back on the right analog 
 stick, then push forward in a straight line, kind of like swinging a club in Tiger Woods. The problem 
 with this mechanic is that it's hard, and you get absolutely no feedback on why you've missed. 
 You need a surgeon's precision in order to sink a foul shot. The ball will simply clank off the 
 rim, and you don't have much of an idea why. Were you off-center? Did you push too hard? Too slowly? 
 Not a steady enough speed? Who knows? The game certainly doesn't tell you. And the worst part is 
 that there's no practice mode where you can try free throws to figure it out yourself. Expect to 
 shoot about 10 percent or worse from the charity stripe, until you figure out how it works. We 
 never quite did figure it out in our days playing the game. Since the computer tends to foul you 
 a lot in the paint, not being able to hit a realistic number of free throws ends up being a great 
 hindrance to winning. This is an even bigger problem for online play where a cheesy strategy is 
 to just foul your opponent anytime he goes for a dunk. Since it's so hard to hit free throws, getting 
 fouled basically equates to a turnover.  

  Aside from quick games, NBA Live 06 includes a create-a-player feature, season mode, and online 
 play over Xbox Live. No, we didn't forget anything in that list, but you'll wonder if maybe the 
 developer did, as there's no franchise mode in the game. You can trade players and coach your team 
 through the playoffs in season mode, but once the championships are over, so is the season. The 
 lack of a multiyear franchise mode certainly hurts the value of the overall package. You'll also 
 find some other odd missing features, like a fully controllable replay mode. You can toggle instant 
 replays after any basket you score, but these will only show canned replays of the score from two 
 different camera angles. If you want to see a replay of anything, or if you want to move the camera 
 around in replay mode yourself, you're out of luck. As far as online play goes, performance in 
 our online play testing ranged from bearable to unplayable. The smoothest games we experienced 
 still made it difficult to get the timing down on jumpshots, while some of the other games moved 
 at utterly glacial framerates. Hopefully the problem will get better as the online population ramps 
 up and the geographic distribution of players evens out, but as it stands, online play is certainly 
 not a strongsuit for the game.  

          You can play online, but no franchise mode is available.     

  At least the sound is 
 excellent. The crowd realistically gets riled up or quieted down, depending on the performance 
 of the home team. When it gets really excited, the roar is actually quite impressive -- especially 
 on a good 5.1 setup. The commentary from Marv Albert and Steve Kerr is also excellent, with a lot 
 of insightful and interesting color comments from Kerr. There's also a decent hip-hop soundtrack 
 from EA Trax, which features the likes of Jurassic Five and M. I. A. to groove to.  

  The best way to sum up NBA Live 06 on the Xbox 360 is that it feels a lot like NBA Live 05 with 
 a fresh coat of paint thrown on. Aside from minor tweaks here and there, not a lot has changed 
 with the basic gameplay, which should feel very familiar to longtime fans of the series. The graphics 
 definitely are a great step up from previous-generation basketball games, especially with the fantastic 
 character models in the game. Unfortunately, NBA Live 06 doesn't look quite as good as it should 
 in motion, thanks to poorly blended animation and a sometimes uneven frame rate. The game also 
 doesn't look very impressive on a standard-definition TV. The lack of a franchise mode further 
 hurts long-term replayability. If you've been a longtime player of NBA Live and want to get a peek 
 at the direction EA is taking the series in, then the game is still worth checking out. But taken 
 as a full product, it falls short of delivering a true next-generation basketball experience.

Review:  EA Sports games has been making sports games for a long time. NBA Live 06 was one of the 16 games 
 released for the 360 Launch. Having NBA 2K6 released made it have competition from the start. In 
 this review I will be using the 2K sports version as a comparison.
  
  Game play: 7/10
  
  The game is setup with fairly easy controls to learn to play the game. Offense setup is fairly 
 easy to learn as with the defense controls. All basics moves are there. Passing is not complicated 
 as all you have to do is face the teammate to pass the ball to. In harder difficulties you just 
 have to be aware of the opponents in the way to force turnovers. Depending on the distance to the 
 basket you have two types of shots to use to score. The same can be said for defense moves in stealing, 
 jumping to block and intercepting the pass. With the use of each of the NBA teams, their superstars 
 have certain moves that will help you score slightly easier.
  There are quick games, season mode and multi player options. In local multi-player the game allows 
 you to have up to four controllers. I did not play this game online and thus I cannot comment on 
 it. The online multi-player was already shut down by the time I bought my copy so I didn't get 
 a chance to evaluate it. 
  
  Graphics: 7/10
  
  The graphics are quite good especially for a game released in 2005. Not only can you tell their 
 faces from their real life counterpart, you can notice height and weight differences between the 
 players. Not everyone is a clone with a face rendered on. Only the crowd looks a bit two dimensional. 
 The playable views are good with decent shooting perspectives.
  
  Sound and Music: 7/10
  
  I like the in game sound as you hear sneakers squeaking and the crow cheering. Seems like most 
 sports games has real songs in the menu screens, the songs are good but get fairly boring with 
 its repetitiveness.
  
  Difficulty: 1/10 (Degree of skill to enjoy the game)
  
  Basketball is a simple game. The game offers a variety of ways to adjust to your skill level. From 
 changing rules to creating rosters you can adjust the game to suit your needs and help balance 
 out matches between friends. Choosing a better team over another always seems to help
  
  Final Thoughts:
  
  In comparison to the 2K sports version, I would have to say they are basically 
 the same, you cannot go wrong with either choice. The only difference is the online play. The price 
 in most places is relatively cheap that you can have both to compare yourself.

  ESRB Rating: E for 
 Everyone
  
  Gameplay: 50%
  Graphics: 30%
  Durability: 20%
  
  Gameplay (8/10)
  NBA Live 06 certainly plays like a next-gen game. If you've seen one basketball sim, you've seen 
 them all, but the newest title has much improved speed and balance than previous titles. As always, 
 there's a very nice season mode.
  
  Graphics (9/10)
  The graphics are very smooth and much advanced for their time, even on a next-gen system. The lack 
 of lag is very impressive, especially when the graphical quality goes down to beads of sweat on 
 players.
  
  Durability (7/10)
  
  Overall Score (8.1/10)
  Rounded Score (8/10)
  
  Final Thoughts:
  A very solid game that can be bought very cheap.

Review:  I'll get to the point here. NBA Live '06 is crap. I know much has been said about EA's first next-gen 
 sports titles. Yes, they are all missing major features that the PS2 &amp; Xbox versions all have. 
 The main problem with NBA Live, however, is the fact that this game wasn't good on any platform 
 in the first place. This series has been going downhill for years and this game doesn't do anything 
 to help that problem.
  
  Lots of reviews have raved about the graphics in this game. They say it really looks like a next-gen 
 product. I have no idea what these people were looking at. When I play this game, I see slighly 
 enhanced Xbox visuals. The player models look terrible. The rest of the game looks decent, but 
 nothing to get you to spend $60. The play-by-play is what it always was before. Marv Albert and 
 Steve Kerr do a decent job here. The music is a selection of hip-hop, as usual. Why don't developers 
 realize that the soundtrack could benefit from some rock tunes, as well?
  
  The main problems rear their ugly head once you start playing a game. After about ten minutes with 
 this game, I was yelling at my screen. Every irritating flaw I have had with the series over the 
 years has not been fixed here at all. There are still WAY too many blocks. It's still too easy 
 to steal the ball. The low-post play is atrocious. The free-throw shooting is impossible and incredibly 
 stupid. The player animations are terrible. There is no franchise mode. There are no 'freestyle' 
 moves. There is no 'All-Star Weekend'. There is no FUN. And don't even get me started on how horrible 
 the default camera angle is and how many shots it made me miss by changing on me at the last second 
 so I can't even see the player I am controling.
  
  If you have played any of the NBA Live games that have come out in recent years, you will know 
 what to expect here. And that is not a good thing. This series is far behind 2K Sports' NBA 2K 
 games and this game, in particular, is a joke. There is no reason to purchase this game (just like 
 there wasn't on the original Xbox) and the only saving grace here is to rent this for the easy 
 1000 gamerpoints.

Review:  NBA Live 06 is only about 25 dollars new now and $14 used. If u missed out on NBA Live 07 or NBA 
 2k7 and just want to play basketball then buy this game. So here is the review of NBA Live '06. 
 NBA games are usually knocked because of bad gameplay. The gameplay is good in my own right. There 
 is no carrer just a season mode and there's not really that much to do in this game. The A. I. is 
 smart like when they're down by 3 or 4 with 25 seconds on the clock they'll keep on fouling you 
 and they'll end up winning the game. : ( The virtual gym is actually kind of fun too. Back in late 
 2005 when Microsoft released the 360 NBA Live 06 was one of the best looking games out (with Perfect 
 Dark Zero and Madden 06) now it looks ok. But the sweat is looking real. So its pretty good.
  
  
  Overall 6.6 an okay game worth the 15 bucks used not so much worth 30 dollars new.

Review:  NBA Live 06 delivers both the power of the xbox 360 and at the same time gives you the thrill of 
 experiencing the thorough apects of basketball in every detail both graphic wise and gameplay even 
 though it is an older game you still get some fun out of it i don't really follow basketball but 
 i play and this game seems pretty close to real thing ffrf rfreuie ijriufjr o ferfjrfjre erfireifhr

Review:  I only bought this game because i love sports games and it was on sale for $15. i was surprised 
 when this game got a bad review when it is actually a good game. I really like the free play at 
 the beggining and found myself playing it for about 25 minutes when i first got it. The gameplay 
 can be difficult at times but you just need to get used to it. The graphics are very well done, 
 but a little too much muscle. The sound is great because when it's almost at the end of the game 
 and the score is tight and your playing in your home court, every basket you make the crowd goes 
 nuts!. The things i did not like about this game is the free throw is pretty hard and the camera 
 settings aren't good and there aren't many choices. even though i am not a hardcore basketball fan, 
 this game is addictive and can provide hours and hours of fun.

Review:  This is a good basketball game, but rent it first.
  
  Pros: Excellent player models, create a superstar option, main menu is practice, easy to move the 
 ball down the court and to do close range shots, jerseys are well modelled and move with the character
 
  
  Cons: Movement aren't the best, near impossible to make free throws unless you set the difficult 
 to zero, where it is still difficult to make them, extremely easy to fowl, they happen about every 
 two minutes, it's difficult to block other players, nearly impossible to make 3's or any far range 
 shots
  
  This isn't the best basketball I've played, but it's still fairly addictive and enjoyable to play.

Review:  This was the game that I was waiting to buy because of the graphics and awesome gameplay. I have 
 Gears of War and Dead Rising but I can't get enough of this. Even though it is almost 2007, I don't 
 plan on buying NBA 2K7 or NBA Live 07. One reason is that people are still playing on XBOX Live 
 so it's really fun. I did all of the achievements and have sadly only won 6 games and lost in 3. 
 I love the graphics and the new practice mode at the start of the game. The two things that stink 
 the most in this is no All-Star Weekend and no game modes except season mode. I'm sorry I can't 
 tell you either NBA Live 06 or 07 but you won't be disapointed with NBA Live 06 unless you don't 
 have XBOX Live.

Review:  When I first got my Xbox 360 I was excited about the next-gen sports games, so I bought this. Wow 
 what a mistake. When I first played it I get to the menus, which are terrible, the whole practice 
 court idea is very annoying to me. So I'm looking for dynasty mode and what do I find, Season mode, 
 yes, Season mode. The biggest disappointment in a sports game of my life. So then I thought maybe 
 the gameplay would make up for these minimalist features, wrong. The gameplay is terrible, its 
 so easy that its not even worth playing. But it wasn't over there, I thought maybe some semi-decent 
 online play might justify my purchase. wrong again. The online is terrible, laggy 95% of the time, 
 and trying to join a lobby was pure hell. EA has really shown me how terrible they are for the 
 past year, and hopefully they can redeem themselves in 07. For anyone who bought this game, they 
 bought a demo, that's all it is, a highly overpriced demo. My closing comment is that I will never 
 buy another NBA Live game again. It's all Nba 2k games for me now.

Review:  This game shows nothing of the 360's power. The only thing it shows is how to embarras the nba 
 players and the nba live franchize. The camera angle, let me talk about, it is retarded Although 
 you change the camera setting, it screws it self back to normal. The game shows a bit of next gen 
 sequences but mainy it is still back in xbox's era. The only times the players look good are in 
 the menu's. They tried and tried and screwed up, lets hope EA dosent make this damn mistake again. 
 And if they do, embarras fake players not real ones.

Review:  It's starts out promising. Being able to play in the lobby while waiting for the game to load up 
 is fun and keeps you in the game . Graphics are pretty nice without being spectacular, but the 
 sweat graphics look all wrong. The Camera is the biggest pain. Always trailing behind on fast breaks 
 and never finding the actual action. The referee's are very strict as well and if you don't tone 
 it down a bit you spend half the time giving or taking free throws. Although there is some fun 
 to be had here it's definitely not enough to account for the price of admission. Hopefully things 
 will get smoothed over in time for live 07

Review:  NBA live 06 for xbox 360 is a perfect display of graphics and delivers on above average gameplay. 
 The only thing missing are some basic gameplay modes like dynasty and its perfect . The menu takes 
 you right in the middle of an abandoned warehouse to revolutionize the way menus look and feel. 
 You get to toy around with dwayne wade or change your player to practice a bit. You can create 
 a player with the in debt details or play a game on xbox live which creates a level of intensity. 
 NBA 2k6 is horrible in comparison graphics wise and the revamped physics has launched NBA live 
 06 the leader for next gen consoles.

Review:  Once the game begins to load, y ou get play as Dwayne Wade and have a little shoot-around... Cool... Then 
 you start to play the actual game.
  
  The first thing I noticed is the abnormally slow gameplay. Even the fastest players in the NBA 
 move as if they're crawling. If you're running at full speed with the turbo button pressed down, 
 it takes about 8 seconds to run from baseline to baseline. No Joke.
  
  The graphics are decent, but the cutscenes get very annoying as they play the same team-coach huddle 
 cutscene every time practically every time play is stopped. The sound is decent, but not much different 
 than the other NBA Lives.
  
  One thing that really surprised me was how there isn't any NBA Store like the previous NBA Lives. 
 I find that to be pretty disappointing. The bottom line is this game isn't that great of a basketball. 
 It may look like it's good with the still pictures on the internet, but NBA Live 06 really lacks 
 the fun gameplay.

Review:  It's not great at all. I would never buy this one since it is practically like 2005. They barely 
 changed or made anything better about this game then 2005. I believe they should have really thought 
 about this new one this time and not make it so alike to 2005. They should think over what else 
 they could add, like the FIBA teams maybe someday, but I understand that it is hard to always make 
 a game every year for those hungry fans out there of basketball that would really be worthy. Maybe 
 someday they can add some features that were never in any of the other games and make it a true 
 revolutionary classic game for a long time that can't be beat easily.

Review:  I played NBA 2K6 and NBA 2k7 before I even rented NBA Live 06 to give it a try. It wasn't long 
 into the game that I was like, man this sucks. Compared to the 2K NBA Basketball games NBA Live 
 is nothing, there should be no competition between 2K and EA here. Everything that might be considered 
 half way decent, which there isn't very much, in NBA Live is way better in NBA 2K. The controls, 
 camera angles, graphics, and game play options are just terrible in this game. So far my experience 
 with Next Gen games, EA's sports games which I loved the most when I was playing the PS2 are just 
 junk, both this game and Madden are huge disappointments for me. Now I wish 2K sports was capable 
 of making an NFL game.

Review:  This game is just another basketball game. The only difference is that its got Way better graphics 
 and it for the 360. There isn't much to do in this game besides the career mode. I think that there 
 should be some kind of slam dunk contest or three point shoot out. But there is nothing. The game 
 play is average and similar to the others in its series. The game can be addictive at times but 
 it only goes so far. I would say if any one is thinking of buying this game that they should go 
 out and rent it first to experience it because its not worth buying.

Review:  I was hoping that this game would give the 2k6 series a run for its money. It didn't. I do have 
 to say the graphics were better but the gameplay just stunk. I borrowed the game from a friend 
 and he said that it was a pretty good game but he hadn't played NBA 2k6. I let him borrow my copy 
 will I played his. I played it for about an hour or so and knew that this game was horrible. I 
 tried to play it again the next day and just couldn't get into it. The controls just don't feel 
 natural and the way the game is layed out is also a cluster. I would pass if you haven't already 
 played this and try NBA 2k6 instead.

Review:  This game was absolutely terrible i couldn't believe it. I downloaded the demo on my xbox and really 
 liked it. So i went out and spent my hard earned money just to find out all that is different from 
 the demo is you can use all teams and play longer games. There are absolutely no extra modes besides 
 season and you can only play 1 year and then it's over. No dynasty no career nothing. I honestly 
 would rather play 06 or even 05 than this game. Graphics aren't great and gameplay is boring. Don't 
 even bother with this game it's a huge rip off i will definitely think twice before buying EA games 
 after this.

Review:  this game is to easy to scor on an oponet so thats why I rated it a 6.3 becaus it is to boring 
 ther is no story line to it .the game has good grafix you can see the sweet on the player expesaly 
 when you get to go to the line. Some of the players are slow and some are fast it depens who you 
 are playing with. the game is to slow when you are playing like when you get out of bounds you 
 have to press A to continue. the game is ok but can use a litle more work on the game play . That 
 is all I have to say.

Review:  First off the graphics are one of a kind, i don't have a HDTV (because i'm poor) and the graphics 
 still look gorgeous, little details like the sweat on the players addto the effect you get which 
 is Wow. The sound is OK with good commentary and crowd cheers and the fact you can practise while 
 the game loads makes this game unique. However these are the only things good about the game, the 
 season mode is beyond terrible lacking imagination and style. There is very little to do in the 
 game with choices really between Play Now and Season with no challenges which i would have liked 
 to see. Overall the game does prove what developers can do with Next Gen graphics but it doesn't 
 prove EA's skill to come up with a good basketball game.

Review:  when i first stated playing 06 it was the best game in the world to me but what got me mad was 
 the modes that they took out and what made it real disaponting was that they did not have a instant 
 replay which i just not understand but the graphics are perfect ever body looks like the real version 
 and almost play like them with the shot signature and another thing was that the season only had 
 82 games for the season which was very confusing to me so i already now that i would not finish 
 the whole season so i would just would play the exhibition games

Review:  Gameplay:
  I really do hate the default camera in this game. It's just a simple basketball game that is very 
 laggy, jumpy, and buggy. The framerate in the game jumps every single time you quickly run, pass, 
 or shoot. It's like the game has to have time to adjust before you try and do 2 quick actions at 
 once.
  
  Graphics:
  The best part of the game. The players look real and so does everything else. But the movement 
 and fluidness of the game is terrible, which really bogs down how it looks.
  
  Sound:
  Boring comentators and crowd and music. Yawn.
  
  Replay:
  None at all. Even the online didn't 
 help this game. Everything about this game makes me not want to play:
  
  Overall:
  Every aspect of this game screams crappy port. Pass on this game.

Review:  Pros: This game has amazing graphics! I dont even have an HD television and the graphics are beautiful. 
 I like the practice mode you go right into at the beginning of the game and being able shoot around 
 while a game is loading is a very unique feature. Also this game has decent commentary.
  
  Cons: This game feels the same as the other NBA Live games and I definitely dislike the old NBA 
 Live games. Also the free throw shooting difficulty is pathetically complicated. There is also 
 no fantasy draft and gameplay can get boring while playing at an easy difficulty level. Frame rate 
 can also be slow at certain moments of the game.

Review:  first off, this truly exhibits the 360's graphic power. the actual gameplay is very fun, but other 
 than quick games, this game is very limited. the season mode is just awful and there is no create 
 a team option or any real additional content at all! would recommend for someone who would use 
 this title just to sit down and play a quick game but in the sense for the hardcore basketball 
 fan, this game just doesnt do it. there are team playbooks, but truly this entry in the nba live 
 series just doesnt seem to upgraded. ea sports seems to have been stuck in neutral the past couple 
 years. so this year i would definitely have to recommend nba 2k6 over this. hopefully ea sports 
 can really get a next-gen title out by 07'.

Review:  Ok, the graphics are sick. Anyone who says 2kSports games have better graphics are criminally insane. 
 The graphics on this game are by FAR superior to 2k. The 2kSports game is a below average game. 
 Its graphics leaves a lot to be desired and has few difference from the original xbox/ps2 version. 
 You can tell in the new EA game with the graphics, but lets face it, this game is horrible. Free 
 Throw shooting is hard, but it IS possible contrary to popular belief. It should NOT be as difficult 
 as it is. Gameplay is slow, and it lags. Players will light you up even if they werent that good 
 in real life and shooting isn't smooth. It lacks 90% of the content the xbox/ps2 games have (All 
 star weekend, franchise, dunk contest) and quite frankly, it is the least playable basketball game 
 I have played since NBA Live 2002. The 2K series in my mind, has never been very good, EA always 
 dominated for the most part. When live switched its engine with Live 04, I thought it would fly 
 away and leave 2K in the dust like Madden has. The sad thing is, it just cant do it. Live leaves 
 a lot to be desired. I have already seen screen shots for 2k7, so I would suggest waiting on that. 
 The graphics seem to have massive improvement. Live has a lot of upgrading that one year couldn't 
 possibly make up. Don't even rent this game.

Review:  First impression: Greatly detailed character models but with so many sports titles already opn 
 the 360 that didn't live up to the PS2 versions I was very hesitant in making the purchase.
  
  After buying out of boredom and wonder: Found only 1 other improvement in the game (the playable 
 loading screen/menu) . The camera angles may make the game feel real but they for lack of a better 
 word: suck. The PS2 version offers so much more in so many ways: the slam dunk and three point 
 competitions, better create-a-player, cpu opponents would work more like a team... I could go on 
 for hours listing many different reasons why buying the better and $cheaper$ PS2 version would 
 satisfy you in ways that only that naughty neighbour with the 6 inch skirt, a ruler, pigtails, 
 a swimming pool and a years supply of jello,,, anyways, this game is still a great game but it 
 plays too slow, almost as slow as Fight Night for the 360. Although this game has dissapointed 
 me i'm still a dedicated NBA Live fan (just not for the 360) .

Review:  When I first put this game in my Xbox 360, my jaw dropped open. It was absolutely beautiful. I 
 loved watching the sweat, and how realistic the animations were. The only flaw that I had with 
 this game, was the lack of options. I missed the All-Star Weekend. That was the highlight of the 
 original Lives, and with that gone... The game scored VERY low. This game is very underappreciated. 
 This game is a sacred possesion of mine, because it's different from the other basketball games. 
 There is just some enticing about it, making me crave it. Sure, players feel like they're walking 
 when they're running, and the game has it glitches. But EVERY game has glitches people. If you 
 like basketball, get this game. No questions asked.

Review:  I wasnt too impressed with the season mode. It seems that all EA is makin are good graphics. I 
 mean, they are sweet on 1080i but the season isnt great. You can only do 1 season over and over 
 again. And no fantasy draft either. But overall its a pretty good game.
  
  It also missed out on a couple of other things too. Allstar game is there but no dunk or 3 point 
 contest. That was a thing that really bites. Again, if your looking for a good frachise game this 
 isnt the game.
  
  However if your looking for a great game on high def. This game is awesome!

Review:  Now I am not going to touch base on the Live experience of the game or the experience of playing 
 this game vs a friend. This review is my time spent playing this game simply against the computer. 
 So here goes.
  
  First of all the game is very PRETTY. If you allow the game to show its beauty and let the game 
 go untouched as it loads, it will look wonderful to you. But after a few times, WE ALL press A 
 as quickly as possible to speed up the process to get to the actual game.
  
  Now the player models are really good. The players seem to move at a decent rate. Even the coaches 
 and the fans look nice. Of course in any game, you will have some problems, but for the most part 
 it, this games is PURE EYE CANDY.
  
  Now the game play itself is well.... in one word FRUSTRATING. This game is not fun one bit to play. 
 The computer team puts you on the FT line and well, I went four games in a row and DID NOT MAKE 
 one FT. Of course I lost each game. The opposing teams STAR player just kills you, NO MATTER what 
 you do to try and stop him. My point here: Arenas goes for 47, Pierce goes for 51 and Jason Richardson 
 well lets just say he continued the trend and TORCHED ME. So the game just feels real slow, even 
 if you speed up the game in the options. You want to utilize the in game controls, well you better 
 have hands that are like Speedy Gonzalez. The juke moves really dont work that well to get you 
 space. Fouls are called at a rediculous pace. The passing is decent though if you utilize the left 
 bumper. Dunks is what makes this game good. Three pointers well are not easy to make, but Arenas 
 shot like 20 of them and made like 10 against me.
  
  The Camera control! Are you kidding me! Does EA even play this game? If so what do they say about 
 the camera? It is the worst camera control I have seen in any game and this is going back to my 
 NES days. the camera angles are terrible, the players quickly out run the camera and I HAVE TO 
 WAIT to see what I am doing. Plus YOU MUST play the game closer to you, unless you are fine with 
 jacking up shots from the other side of the court, which happens to look real, I MEAN REAL FAR 
 AWAY FROM YOU. EA should be ashamed of themselves for putting out this game with this type of camera 
 set up. I can handle having only the ability to play a season, even the FT thing I can swallow, 
 but the camera set up, really is POOR. Again, I would love to hear EA's side to this idea and camera 
 set up.
  
  The sound is excellent in the game, the crowds get real amped or they sit on their hands. The plaers 
 sweat and the coaches roam. Even the fans look nice. The courts all are crisp and beautiful.
  
  All in all, EA really had better step up with the next release of their games! This game is 
 very poor in depth. Sure the game looks nice, but the game doesn't feel right, the camera don't 
 move right, the speed isn't right, the player control isn't right and well I can't say anything 
 about FT's, I just know it isn't right cause I have not made any yet.. 
  
  This game SHOULD NOT be bought. Heck, EA should ship us all a discount on our next EA purchase 
 for even buying this game. It is bad, and I MEAN REAL BAD!

Review:  With the most realistic graphics in games history, you might even think your in the game in real 
 life. Also, the nicest dunks can be dunked in this game, it's just so beautiful once you dunk, 
 and the shots to go as well, most known players who shoot weird or shoot the way that they do, 
 NBA Live 06 shoots exactly the way an NBA player shoots, for example, Shawn Marion shoots weird 
 and releases early but still makes his shot. That's just unbelievable that they made Shawn "The 
 Matrix" Marion shoot the way he does. But if only there were many options to play with for example 
 dunking contests and stuff like that then i think this game would be the most perfect game ever 
 created.

Review:  Okay, I read all the reviews saying that live 06 wasnt that good. But i had to buy it and say
 Yeah right". Oh it was fine for the first few days. But then it got to easy so i set the game on 
 a higher difficulty, and i got pissed. Come on!!!!! First, i cant get any shot to go down. I dunk 
 it with Kobe, and he misses it! Then some low rated player like Tyronne Lue starts dropping 50 
 points on me! COME ON! And it keeps happening consistently. You will have Kyle Korver, Demmar Johnson, 
 and guys i dont even know, getting to look like Kobe out there!
  Other than the gameplay, there is nothing else to do! you just play one season over and over! thats 
 it. They dont even have Retro teams! And the worst thing of all, The FREE_THROWS! I get the best 
 freethrow shooter in the league and he shoots 5% at the line. DANG IM PISSED!
  But other than my critacizing, the graphics are awesome! But they dont last when you have no emotions. 
 I also thought the gameplay was okay if it wasnt for what i said up there. And if you want something 
 to give you a good time, its NOT going to be Live 06. Good Game for a while, but it just doesnt 
 last.

Review:  At first impression this game blows you away with its visuals and graphics. It easily has the best 
 graphics of any sports game out. The practice mode when starting the game and loading is genius 
 and the stadium pregame **** is awesome. But yes the gameplay is a little suspect. The spin move 
 is way too overpowered as you can continuously spin all the way to the basket and dunk in most 
 situations. And also there are many times where you get fast breaks with no chance for the defense 
 to recover. But for 40$ unbelievable graphics and still addictive gameplay when your with your 
 friends makes this a good buy.

Review:  One major up in this game is the graphics the were outstaning on HD TV's they looked very goog. 
 They looked ok on reulgar defintion but on as good a in HD. Another cool thing was how you could 
 shoot around with what ever player you want while your in the main menu. You can also do a shoot 
 around while the game you have choosen is loading. The place where this game is realy laking is 
 content. You can create a player, play now, and do a one year seasson mode. If I rember corecttly 
 that is all you can do!! So I don't think this games worth your money, and unless you love B-ball 
 It isn't even worth your rent!

Review:  NBA Live 06 on the 360 is amazing graphically and it sounds really great to if you have some sort 
 of surround sound. A lot of people are disappointed about All-Star weekend, Dynasty, and a bunch 
 of other modes being taken out. I'm not concerned with game modes with a development team like 
 EA who is trying to surpass 2K Sports in some way. 2K has dominated the last 3 yrs with excellent 
 gameplay and adding to it every year in a smart way. EA now is completely going from scratch, and 
 trying to make there game just as good if not better. I'm glad the Freestyle Superstars was not 
 in the 360 version because the superstars literally, takes the fun out of the game, and got boring 
 fairly quickly. The presentation in Live for the 360 is awesome, with Marv Albert, Steve Kerr, 
 once again providing the action. The game was a lot slower, which is good, because not every team 
 is like Phoenix and Dallas. There are a ton of teams though who are like the Spurs and the Pistons. 
 The arenas are stunning with the fog, the crowd, and the feel, yes, i said feel, you feel like 
 you are playing a road game if you are in season and are on the big 7gm road trip. This game, even 
 with the stripped features of the current gen versions, is a big step forward, and with EA taking 
 advantage of the ESPN license they bought a couple of years ago, EA can definitely destroy the 
 competition starting with NBA Live 07.

Review:  I am a big fan of NBA and when I got this game for 360 I couldnt wait to play it. Yes I had the 
 option from NBA Live 06 and NBA 2K6 but I chose Live. Hey I have been playing the Live series since 
 back in 95 so there was no way that after 11 years I was going to switch over. The game was pretty 
 damn fun. I just like playing the game so not having the dunk contest or the 3-point contest did 
 not bother me at all. If you just want to play a game then this game will make you happy. There 
 are only 2 things that I didnt like about this game. When you were doing a fast break it felt 
 like a crawl. The pace of the game can get slow at times so that was a bummer. And secondly, you 
 cant unlock any jerseys or anything. I mean look at MLB baseball you can have like 8 different 
 jerseys per team, how come you couldnt at least have a few different jerseys per team for this 
 like they had in 2005? Other than that I would have to say that this game is great if you dont 
 mind few options but just want to play some ball.

Review:  Well, graphics wise anyways. The gameplay is the same as it always has been throughout the franchise, 
 which is a good, simple pick-up-and-play game. It has some freestyle moves, which are more like 
 button combos. The freestyle moves introduced in current-gen consles presented a lack of skill. 
 This time around, it is much more improved, also having an immediate helper on the D-Pad is impressive. 
 Press it one direction to change defenses, or press another and you might go to an Exhibition game 
 or Xbox Live lobby. But there are some major flaws. Free throw shooting is revolting, it dosen't 
 give you anyway to learn how or practice. And it's limited features gives it a downfall. No franchise, 
 dynasty, all-star weekend, draft, nothing but create a player, which is amazingly in-depth, Exhibition, 
 and Season mode. But the graphics are flat-out amazing. Player models and textures are the best 
 I've ever seen, and dunk animations are incredible. But player transaction models need work. This 
 time, EA Trax has some nice songs, like Remember the Name, Like That, and Grind Time. Definetly 
 worth renting for basketaball fans, and a good buy for people who don't mind limited options.

Review:  I must say, before i bash this game, it had some very good player models and displayed many great 
 visuals and sounds. Saying that, is bassically all I can say on the positive side.
  
  Very bas single player mode, and online play riddled with 10 year old kids reaking havoc. This 
 does not contribute to the games value, after racking in as many gamerscore as p [ossible with putting 
 as little effort as possible, just throw the game out, seriously even if you rented it, throw it 
 out, you will be doing the store a favour.
  
  I did not enjoy this game at all, Stick to NBA 2K6 instead.

Review:  Once again this year EA decides to rush a game in time for a console release and while there final 
 project was a great look into the future. it was so obviously made this way that no one person 
 in there right mind would buy this game
  
  graphics & sound - the xbox 360 brings brightness and great sound quality to the game. the commentary 
 lacks emotion and doesn't really put you into the game. 
  
  gameplay - any basketball gamer will jump into the game really quick. the controls are standard 
 and you get use to all the moves.
  
  overall - only season mode and online play make this game very half done. the only reason to get 
 this game is for the achievements. 
  
  MUST RENT (for achievements)

Review:  Sell this back and buy NBA 2k6.
  
  I was going to choose 2k6, but when I got my 360, the store didn't have it. I wanted 3 games, so 
 I grabbed this one thinking "Well, I really liked past NBA Live's, so I guess sticking with what 
 I know isn't a bad thing."
  
  I was dead wrong.
  
  The graphics are great and the gameplay is just about as good as past games, but that's not enough 
 to make up for what this game is missing: a franchise mode. Without that, it just seems pointless. 
 Playing one season over and over? Not gonna cut it.

Review:  If you don't mind the loss of franchise mode, I have one thing to say: Go buy this game. The graphics 
 are fantastic and the gameplay is also excellent. The sound is what you'd expect from a basketball 
 game. However, if you like to tweak your team in franchise mode, you should shy away from this 
 game. Why? Because there is no franchise mode, only season mode. Which is very disapointing, because 
 the in-game action is the best I've ever played. It plays with the smoothness of what you'd expect 
 from an NBA Live game (except for the choppy framerate) , yet plays with a much more realistic feel. 
 EA really pleasantly surprised me here. Next year is bound to be fantastic.

Review:  This game is not as bad as most people make it seem to be. The only thing about it, is that it's 
 straight basketball. When it comes to video games people expect added features that take away from 
 real life basketball. But for what it is, it's a good game. I feel that it captures the essence 
 of the sport and is fun. The game play is smooth, although I had to speed the game up (fast breaks 
 were anythin but fast) . The controls make sense, and the graphics are much much better then NBA 
 2K6. I rented that game for a week and prolly played it the first two days. NBA Lives 06 is the 
 best basketball game out for the xbox 360 right now.

Review:  This games graphics engine is nice and choppy. Please people dont waste your time or money on this 
 game. EA has alot of work to do before it can bring this dying series to life once again. The camera 
 angles all suck and the camera cant even keep up with the players. Also what happened to the 3 
 point shoot out or the dunk contest? I'll tell you , EA sports was just to lazy and didnt want 
 to put in some extra work, so why not just put out a watered down version of the game on a better 
 system. Graphics are ok gameplay is just horrible. Get to work EA because 2K sports is gonna give 
 you a run for your money...

Review:  Okay, now before this game came out we ALL knew that it was going to have a very little selection 
 of features so there is really no need for me to hop on that situation. The graphics on this game 
 are superb, a very beautiful game. The gameplay though.... they could have done alot better than 
 this, really. I love 2k's gameplay way better, its an exact port plus 2k runs fluidly so the gameplay 
 is going to be on point regardless. But for EA to start from scratch and all, and by it not having 
 any features they could have at least kept the same gameplay from the current gen game. The game 
 glitches alot and it plays like a konami game, NBA STARTING 5 for instance. That right there alone 
 is why this game is not is good as its supposed to be, that gameplay is horrible. If you follow 
 EA sports they always do that in the begining of each system so 07 excpect nba live to be much 
 better, like the transistion from nba live 02 to 03, if you don't know play those 2 games to see 
 what I'm talking about.

Review:  I will say this first before I start my review for this game. Before playing this game I had already 
 played through NBA 2k6 and enjoyed the beautiful graphics, easy gameplay setup, and camera angles 
 to immerse me into the hardwood action. Now let me say this after playing NBA Live 06 I went racing 
 back to 2k6.
  
  Why did I go racing back well first off the controls for this game are very hard to get down once 
 you pick it up. The passing is close to impossible to get the ball exactly where you want it to 
 go. The player controls aren't that great either as it is very hard to maneuver around the big 
 men down inside the paint. The thing that I hated most about the controls however was how the free 
 throw shooting was laid out. It was similar to 2k6, yet somehow dumbed down and for me impossible 
 to get the hang of. While in 2k6 you could see the motion of the player distinctly to down exactly 
 when to release the ball to get a easy bucket.
  
  The graphics again seem to me to be trying to hard to make it look next gen with player models 
 on players that look nothing like there real counter-parts. Another annoyance was how much sweat 
 was on the players, I mean while 2k6 did have sweat it wasn't immediately covering the players 
 bodies once they started playing. The player models also looked choppy compared to the ones in 
 2k6. I will give Live kudos though for fully rendering the coaches and fans unlike in 2k6 where 
 they just ported the coaches from the Xbox version.
  
  The camera however was one of my biggest annoyances with this game. All the camera options it gave 
 I never got the angle that I wanted either putting me to close or too far from the action and on 
 the angles that tried to follow the action the camera was too slow and I would have to wait for 
 it to catch up with me before continue playing which would just slow the pace of the game down 
 for the worst.
  
  Positives about this game that I really liked was the load screen where you controlled Wade from 
 the Heat while waiting for your game to load, a suggestion for 07 would be to be able to choose 
 I player you would want to play with instead of just having the same one over and over again. Also 
 unlike 2k6 Live started fresh with their game with options on this game that weren't on the other 
 version. But in a way this hurt them because 2k6 while porting their modes from the Xbox version 
 had more variety to the gameplay.
  
  Overall if you are even thinking about picking this game up go with 2k6 it is a better way to spend 
 60 dollars then on this basketball game.

 game... People i see say that nba 2k6 was better. Well i played that and the graphics didnt come 
 close to this game. Ea sports is has always had the best sports graphics. Its gameplay is more 
 polished than 2k6's. I have so much fun in this game and the best moment was online. I played some 
 kid who didnt even know how to play he was like 6. I had the spurs he had like the mavs. I beat 
 him like seventy something to 4.

Review:  NBA Live 06 certainly shows promise, but fans shouldnt be subsidizing promise with their hard-earned 
 dollars when a more seasoned alternative is available. NBA 2K6 cannot compare to NBA Live 06s 
 flashy visuals and terrific commentary, but it offers far more depth and long-term appeal. That 
 said, there is still fun to be had with NBA Live 06 as long as you 1) tweak the default sliders 
 and 2) can live with some basic features. NBA Live 06 would have benefited from being delayed a 
 few months to deliver the quality and polish one expects from the leading publisher of sports games. 
 Basketball fans looking for the best rendition of the sport should let NBA Live 06 dribble through 
 their fingers and score a copy of NBA 2K6 instead. Next years battle will hopefully be more competitive.

Review:  Let me start by saying I bought this game because NBA2K was out of stock. I usually follow the 
 reviews on gamespot before I buy a game. Gamespot was dead on. This game is frustrating, the players 
 do not seem to move realistically, the graphics are pretty but there are some performance issues. 
 After playing the game for about week, it just wasn't fun anymore. I am running the game at 720P 
 on a 32" TV and sometimes the text in the windows is too small to read. (buy a bigger tv I guess) . 
 Those are just a few of the annoying things about the game. I did however like the sound, if you 
 are running 5.1, the stadium SFX are great. The players look great too, you can usually tell who 
 is who. To sum it up great sound and graphics but not a lot of fun to play. I would only buy if 
 you are a die hard basket ball fan looking for another basket ball title no matter what the game 
 play.

Review:  I've been a fan of the NBA Live Series for a while. I'm not a huge basketball fan, but this franchise 
 is hella fun. Well, that is until NBA Live for XBOX 360 came out.
  
  Grapically this game is awesome. You can see the sweat running from the guys faces. Shaq's face 
 is really creepy, why? Cause it looks EXACTLY LIKE HIM! The reflections and lighting on this court 
 are awesome. This makes me look forward to next years NBA Live from a graphic standpoint.
  
  Okay, when are video game companies going to realize, its all about camera angles. No matter 
 what camera angle I tried, they were all HORRIBLE! The gameplay is very sluggish as well, not a 
 good thing to have in a sports came where every move counts.
  
  Sound effects are great, you can hear the crowd cheer or boo the hell out of you. Honestly though, 
 its a little too loud. You can't even hear the play by play comentator whatsoever. I mean could 
 the crowd be totally out of control ALL THE TIME? Yeah I didn't think so. Although its totally 
 awesome to hear the shoes of you and your opponent squeak. 
  
  Frankly there is nothing about this game that keeps me wanting more. The camera angles and gameplay 
 are so horrible, I just want to throw this game out the window.... Okay, so I traded the game for 
 store credit. Could you blame me?

  Graphics: Awesome ! The animations are great and the players are very beautiful and close to reality. 
 The game speed is just a bit too slow.
  
  Gameplay: Almost the same as nba live 05 (no superstar control from 06) . The camera are just less 
 good and the free throw are a bit too difficult.
  
  Sound: Rap music, good commentary and good sound in the court (like before) .
  
  Value: Horrible! 
 Dynasty mode, playoff mode, practice and All-star week-end, That's all gone ! There is just online, 
 create player and a bad season.
  
  That's a very good game to rent, but a bad game to buy.

Review:  Graphics - The graphics are stunning , extremly realistic visuals is defintly what they spent all 
 devlopment time on in this game. 
  
  Gameplay - It's all really slow , i'm not sure if it's the frame-rates or just the way the gameplay 
 was set up , you can only play through one season in season mode , and there isn't all this kind 
 of coverage , like the past nba live games . You don't even have the option to view instant replays 
 , which might be a reedming feature with how good the graphics are. The camera angle is also annoying 
 and the computer is hard to beat - given the crappy gameplay and slowness. 
  
  Sound - Average sound you would expect from a basketball game , soundtrack is pretty big. 
  
 
  Value - Multiplayer is so horrible , it makes the game EVEN SLOWWER , plus it's extremly hard 
 to find a match , it's also laggy - leadingg to an extremly slow and crappy multiplayer.

Review:  NBA Live 06 for the Xbox 360 is definitely not the best basketball game currently available for 
 the system. The graphics look great, the player models look almost like their real life counterparts 
 and the arena designs look really good too, even the coaches got the next gen graphics treatment. 
 The sounds are good from the EA sports tracks, to the crowds. The commentary is decent, but not 
 really that great. The gameplay is pretty much your typical NBA Live controls, one of the big downfalls 
 this game has is the free throw shooting. EA has decided to try to a free throw control scheme 
 where you pretty much control the shooting like NBA 2K6's shot stick except EA's rip off of the 
 shot stick handles horribly and is nothing compared to NBA 2K6's shot stick control. There are 
 different modes of game play modes, but this game has the worst season mode I have ever seen. The 
 season is just one season, once you play through the season and complete the playoffs and finals, 
 you have no other choice but to quit the season and play the same year season over again. Most 
 of the achievements are pretty easy and gamespot has a great article on how you can literally simulate 
 your way to the achievement points. This would be the best game on the system if it had a more 
 robust season mode and had a better free throw control scheme. Having played both NBA Live 06 and 
 NBA 2K6 I can easily tell you to skip NBA Live 06 and get NBA 2K6. Hopefully we will see dramatic 
 improvements to the NBA Live series in NBA Live 07.

 i cant even put it into words it must have the best graphics ever created. The gameplay pretty 
 good but not too great, i was mostly dissapointed that there was no slam dunk contest cause im 
 nasty at those id prolly do the 720 dunk if there was one though, but the 540 is also a good option. 
 I also missed the playmaker stuff cause i was nasty at playmaker passes and shooter so i thought

  Let's cut the crap, the game is worth buying, if you have friends.
  
  This game is made for 
 home use with friends and stuff.
  
  The graphics are amazing, the sounds are perfect, and the gameplay is a little iffy, but hey its 
 fun.
  
  The only things left out in this game is Dynasty Mode, Dunk Contest, and high flyer moves. Everything 
 else is on there.
  
  This game is definately worth renting alot, but I would buy it if you was a NBA fan like I am. 
 It's really not as bad as all these people say it is...

Review:  I love my Basketball Games but NBA live has never been a favorite of mine. This time I had hoped 
 with new hardware and new engine that this game would rival the 2k series which has always produced 
 better sports games than EA.
  
  I was sooo wrong. NBA Live 06 for the 360 is a quickly made game and it shows. There is no depth 
 at all to the title and the game feels clunky and outdated. 
  
  The graphics are well done although some players just look weird. Courts are well done although 
 you cannot tell one arena from the other. Player models are sharp and the animations are top notch 
 but that's where the good in this title ends.
  
  EA has again shown their laziness in creating their games. I used to love EA games but lately they 
 are much to be desired and this game continues that trend.
  
  This is by no means a bad game but it is by no mens a great one.

 i have palyed so far on the 360. the last basketball video game that i played was nba jam. that 
 game was really fun, and i still play it. this game i played driven for a need of gamerpoints, 
 and had no fun while playing it. the only real fun i had, was... well in order to get all the gamerpoints, 
 you must have on online victory. so i went online and this guy let me beat him, and i let him beat 
 me. and as we played we talked about oblivion and super mario rpg. it was good times, except for 
 the fact that we had to play the game. playing the game was the only not fun part about it. luckly 
 i only rented the game, and did not purchase it. hopefully ea will spend some time on the game 
 next year, and make one that is not homasexual. straight up homasexual

Review:  NBA LIVE 06 for 360 is okay. It could have been a lot better. Just like madden 06, they rushed 
 this game and didnt put enough time into putting extra things into it. Gameplay is pretty solid, 
 however, the players seem to miss a lot of the very easy shots sometimes. Graphics for this game 
 are amazing. The sound is also pretty good, but i've heard better. There arent very many game modes 
 for this game though. You've got season, play now, and create a player. That's about it. Online 
 for it is really good. NBA fans would prolly like this game a lot, but if your just looking for 
 a good multiplayer game to play once and a while, just rent it.

Review:  The controls are easier are easier on 2K6 compared to NBA LIVE but the graphics aren't as good. 
 I like the 1 button vs. 2 on LIVE to shoot and if you are close enough to the basket then they 
 automatically do a dunk or layup (if they are short) The steals with the right thumb stick is cool 
 too. That way you aren't just mashing buttons and getting them confused. On LIVE you have one button 
 to shoot and another for dunk-layup.
  I wouldn't own this game.
  Compare the two games and see what you think...
  I enjoyed the graphics on this game but I just 
 couldn't get all the controls on LIVE down. 
  Even the free throws are easier and more understandable on 2K6. On 2K6 you pull the right thumb 
 stick back and release at the top of his pose and release. On LIVE it took a long time to get it 
 and noone knew how to do the free throws but it is down on the right thumb stick until the ball 
 is at face level and press up.

Review:  After the disaster that was Tom Clancy's G. R. A. W., I found myself once again down at the local 
 EB games looking through the exact same line up of titles that I've been looking at since last 
 November and wondering 1. When can we get some original 360 games? And 2. What will I play until 
 then. Having downloaded a demo of Madden and not been impressed, I decided to see if there was 
 something out there in the NBA games that might tide me over until Oblivion comes out (and Blazing 
 Angels.. that game looks sweet.) Being the avid Gamespot member I am, I've read alot of reviews 
 about Live 06, many of which admonished the game for poor camera work, etc., and I'd also read 
 the reviews for 2k6, which got praise for everything across the board. Well, despite it all, I 
 decided to take Live 06 for a spin. It was a risk, as I traded in G. R. A. W. and Quake 4 in order 
 to save some cash on it, but in the end, it was a decent trade. Not stellar, but decent. Here's 
 the breakdown:
  
  Graphics: I had heard that this title was one of the best-looking on the 360. Having gotten alot 
 of hands on with the game, I can honestly say I have to agree. The most impressive thing about 
 it all, to me, was the fact that there's VERY little to no lag in this game offline. Online is 
 a disaster zone, and I'll get to that later. But for the single player and split-screen gamers 
 out there, this game could offer just the experience you need to burn a few hours. Character models 
 are accurate, down to the sweat on their faces, and the arenas are impressive. The crowd could 
 use some work, but this was a launch title, so that's nit-picking.
  
  Sound: The sound is good. Crowds will get more into the game if you're at home and leading, and 
 if you're at home and trailing, you'll be able to hear a pen drop. I thought the hecklers in the 
 audience were a nice touch, but you can only really hear them if you turn your TV up considerably. 
 Dunks sound good and the swish of the net when you hit from the perimeter is true. It's a basketball 
 game... there's really not much to say here.
  
  Gameplay: I've heard this game got alot of its features chopped from the original Xbox version 
 to come to the 360. While I don't deny that, I will say this: I haven't played a basketball game 
 in years, and when I do play sports games, I just want a season mode, good stat tracking, and a 
 decent multiplayer mode to use when friends are over. That said, Live 06 delivered for me. There's 
 no GM mode, or fantasy draft, or things like that... I'm not even sure I named those correctly. 
 I don't need or want those options, as I would never use them which is probably evident by my inability 
 to even list all of the features they cut. But there is a season mode and stat tracking, so that 
 kept me happy along with the smooth multiplayer. Now, let's talk about online play. DON'T TAKE 
 THIS GAME ONLINE. Honestly. I haven't seen so much lag since the early days of D. O. A. 4 online. 
 Free throws are tricky enough in single player, but online with the lag factor thrown in, you can 
 forget it. Also, many of the teams (especially the Heat) are overused and over-perform consistently. 
 Just pick the Lakers or the Heat or Lebron James (who wishes he could play A THIRD of how good 
 he is in this game) , and you've got a sure win. I'm still tossing this game in and playing here 
 and there, but I never venture online.
  
  All in all, NBA Live 06 brings to the table nothing but a basketball experience. If you're looking 
 for depth, I suggest you look elsewhere because this game is straight and to the point. It's fun 
 for offline multiplayer, and you can play quite a few games in season mode before you'll tire of 
 it. With this one, I suggest a rental just to check out the visuals and gameplay and then, if you 
 need a multiplayer game or if you really like the game engine, which I personally think is pretty 
 good, you could pick it up. Officially, I recommend this game as a rental with the possibility 
 of purchase pending your rental experience.

Review:  Well, first off, NBA live 2006 is NOT worth the sixty dollars. I repeat, not worth it! 
  
  The Gameplay of this game is very good, the players act VERY close to the real NBA stars, how they 
 run the fast break or how they shoot, it was almost perfected in a way. However, what lacks in 
 this game is alot. The great Dynasty Mode is missing along with the 3-Point shoot out and Dunk 
 contest such as was in in NBA Live 2006 on the XBox and NBA Live 2005.
  
  The sound is almost laughable funny on how the basketball sounds like a toy rubber ball. Along 
 with the dunking and shooting.
  
  The graphics, however, are very good on the Xbox 360. The sweat dripping off Dwain Wades face is 
 awesome and sweet. The basketball courts reflect the light of the stadium and so much detail was 
 put into the Create a player thing. However, I do think they should add some more or should I say 
 alot more detail into the crowds and how they look and what they do. 
  
  The Commentary in this game is the best I've seen to DATE on a NBA game. The best, the voice acting 
 is awesome and what they say can be funny too.
  
  I bet if EA games had more time, they would have made this game very good, but they rushed it and 
 it turned out just a fair XBox 360 launch game. If you are a fan of the NBA Live franchise, think 
 on how you want to spend your sixty dollars . . . I mean come on, when its on sale, get it but 
 don't waster your money on this.

Review:  What was EA CANADA thinking! You can tell that the developer spent 90% of the time working on the 
 graphics and sound and the other 10% taking out what made the origional nba live 06 fun. The kids 
 love the slam-dunk contest, the 3-point shootout and the superstar moves, but forget that all that 
 the people wan't know are cut-scenes and not close screens. The games graphics are absolutely shocking, 
 best player models in any sports game well ever. But the frame rate and the camara position holds 
 the game back alot. The sound is nothing to forget either because they have fantasitic anouncing 
 and well G-UNIT UNIT. This game would be great, for $20, because all you get is one season xbox 
 live, and a fairly well done create a player. If you wan't to show your shiny new 360 off to your 
 friends i recomend that you show them the loading screan it's unbelievebel, you see the basket 
 rise up from underneath the ground and Dwayne Wade looking at his muscles, you can tell this is 
 next-gen. It's kinda sad when your bosting about the loading screen being the best part of the 
 game. It's to bad that the game eventually loads and you have to play the game, well the gameplay 
 isn't that bad it's just a big step down from the current gens live game.

Review:  When stepping into the world of baskeball, you expect your game to improve over the course of the 
 years, right? well just like in this case, the series has been taking a toll for the worse, and 
 this may be the dropping point. This game is nothing but an import that loses some of its flair 
 from the already "sub-par" xbox version. Just like madden, this game has gone through a major overhaul. 
 Many things are missing from this game, and i guess they just wanted us to enjoy the beauty of 
 the graphics, while leaving the mighty bad gameplay behind. what else can i say? this has to be 
 the sorriest excuse for a basketball game since the "NBA On NBC" series.

Review:  Ok, when you look on the court before the game and the camera is following the players around, 
 it is one of the most beautiful things ever. Whats really strange is that as soon as the game starts 
 up, your like "What the deuce". The graphics, while you are playing, look just abit better than 
 the normal Xbox. So that is a mixture of good and bad. Once again, in a basketball you have the 
 standard controls, so if your new its pretty easy to just grab a controller and start playing. 
 Nothing special was really brought to this 360 launch title other than a nice sliver of pretty 
 graphics. Overall, the only way that I can fully encourage you to go and get this game, is that 
 if your a hardcore fan of basketball or of the series. Dont expect anything new though.

Review:  NBA Live 06 makes my 46" Samsung DLP sing! It's fricken gorgeous! Tried 2K6 for the 360, took it 
 back - looks like a xbox title in a new box. I don't care if NBA Live 06 for the 360 doesn't have 
 a franchise mode. When my buds and I game we don't care what kind of franchise crap is in the game. 
 They pick one team, I pick another and we ball (period) .
  
  Also, EA does it right - no interface crap to get in the way -- this is the clean dope. i can tweak 
 my offense, defense, change a play or swap a player in seconds... no menus to fumble with... everything 
 makes sense.
  
  NBA Live 06 flows smoothly from buzzer to buzzer.

Review:  when i first played this i game i thought it was absolutely horrible. i've been playing nba 2k6 
 for a while and this game didnt play nearly as good as it. nba live has potential to be good tho. 
 some players faces look amazing, but others are way off, and the skin texture is good, but the 
 bodies look really really bad. nba 2k6 had very realistic body detail but the skin wasnt great. 
 the gameplay in this game has problems. the frame rate stinx and its really slow. also some really 
 weird things happen, like for example once when i made a pass the ball like went flying around 
 in circles in the air for nearly 10 seconds, strange but w. e. if ea put alot more time in this 
 game it would be good, i expect it to be much better next year.

Review:  i start off by saying that i am very PICKY about my SPORTS GAMES
  
  GRAPHIX (yes that is deliberate)
  
  Well just the pure graphics are nice. animation is very 
 frusterating. compared to FIFA 06 (x360) its choppy. there are points were its smooth (the dunks 
 are perfect) but not as much as we would like. the players are spot on look wise. I wish the arena 
 were more.... intimate and more well lit. they are dark. 
  i love the active scoreboards. the time, fouls, timeouts left are all kept track on that jumbo-tron. 
 uniforms are nice but cant choose from any of the classics. however i wish the names on the backs 
 of the jersey were alot more to life. too small i think. but its ok. GRAPHIX-B+
  recommendation for next year: better camera angls and animation!!
  
  SOUND
  
  Sound is 
 good. no complaints..... oh yeah.... i have one. HIS NAME IS GOMES (pronounced G-HOMES) . NOT GOMEZ. 
 damn marv. you can pronounce a name wrong, but not any of my celtics. really upset. haha. SOUND-B
 
  recommendation for next year: player chatter on the court. cheering or jeering of the players
 
  
  GAME PLAY/COMPETITION
  
  First of all, i play on the ALL-STAR level. i like competiton, ALOT. But i do want to win at least 
 50% of the time. i get no joy out of starter or rookie. i know people get pissed when they lose. 
 so they turn the difficulty down to make up for their lack of skills. Like me, i am not PERFECT. 
 still need some work on the defensive end. so when i am doing my franchise, i am playing 10minute 
 quarters (yes takes an hour to finish one game) on the all-star difficulty and all the default 
 settings. YES I CAN HIT FREE THROWS. not that bad.... you wimps. so my games go about 150-130. i 
 do win by 20 points. but still. THEY CANT MISS 3 POINTERS. like, chris paul poured 50 points on 
 my ass and went 7/12 from beyond the arc. so i think the AI needs work. i would say the AI on the 
 PSP version is better than the X360. they just dont miss. only way i out score them is blocked 
 shots and the 20 steals a game i get. in my season delonte west averages 5 steals a game. 
  But i love the competition. the game play can suffer due to the shotty animation. so hard to time 
 your jump shots. but patience. speaking of patience. love the free throws. reminds me of the first 
 World Series Baseball for the DC. the PULL THE TRIGGER THAN LET GO TO SWING. that was awesome. 
 NO FRANCHIES MODE!!!!! oh man that pisses me off. i love to play a season, then sign free agents 
 and draft players after the season. good stuff.
  GAMEPLAY/COMP- B-
  next year: pray to God that Rudy Gay wont pour 70 on my ass.
  
  FUN/REPLAY
  the game is fun. 
 i love the NBA so i love this game. If you want an NBA game, you can never go wrong with NBA LIVE! 
 but once you complete one season... your done.
  
  sorry for spelling errors!

Review:  This game was built up very high, and because EA has had such great success with their sports games, 
 I believed the hype about the game. But, I never should have spent a dime on this game. This is 
 a the appitamy of a rushed game, that has not nearly enough content to warrant the $60 price tag. 
 To be honest with you, the only innovative part of the game that was new and interesting was the 
 loading screen, where you could practice taking shots with Mr. Wade. The difference between this 
 game and NBA 2K6 is cataclysmic, and it is a travesty that EA released this game, due to it's serious 
 lack of any interesting content such as an actual off season after you finish a season in dynasty 
 mode, which is in shambles itself compared to last year's game. If you want to play a basketball 
 game for the Xbox 360, don't kid yourself by buying this game, you will not be pleased, trust me. 
 Go out and buy NBA 2K6.

Review:  When I reached the main menu, I found out why EA Sports Develops and Publishes these games. The 
 main menu is your favorite ( Dwayne Wade as default) player practicing in a high tech court with 
 all-star players pictures (like Steve Nash and Ben Wallace) on the walls. Press the start button 
 to access the somewhat more un-stripped menu than Madden. There's create-a-player. But nothing 
 else. The create-a-player mode, is one of the most customizable editing systems I have ever seen. 
 But the graphics are what you should look out for. When I played as the pistons, they looked like 
 the pistons, not video game models, looking unlike their real selves. When you move your jersey 
 and shorts wave in the air that passes by you as you heard for the goal, the basket. I hope you 
 know this, I'm not an EA fan boy. I don't like where they're going with the stripping of the modes 
 that separated the EA games and the 2K games. But I have to give it to them.
  
  Hear me out, do not buy or rent madden, buy NBA Live! If you like the NBA you will not be disappointed 
 like you will with madden. NBA Live has a pretty good game play with phenomenal graphics. And with 
 create a player.
  Final-9.6/10

 happy, but anyway is still the best game I have played on the 360. When you first try it you won't 
 believe how much they have improved on the graphics and sounds. When you score the crowd are so 
 into the game that you don't believe it. So I recommand you to try this game and see for yourself 
 how great this game really is.

Review:  this game is awful, I went to best buy and they didn't have 2k6, so i decided to go with live thinking 
 that previous EA games have preformed better than the 2k versions. This time around it was a different 
 story, and it made me sick. (i just wasted 60 $) . graphics are just so-so, and the gameplay is 
 not nearly as smooth and realistic as 2k6. also, as you are playing realize that if you want to 
 challenge yourself you might as well go to the playground and take on your shadow because you can 
 glide past defenders and score inside at will. JUST LISTEN TO THE GAMESPOT REVIEW, they nailed 
 it.

 you know your stuff, then NBA Live 06 is the best NBA game out. I tried both and NBA 2k6 is way 
 to easy and is so unrealistic it surprises me you like it more then the real stuff. When I say 
 real stuff I'm talking about the amazing gameplay with the freestyle stick, amazing dunks, and 
 sweet player skills. Not to mention the PLAYERS actually look like the players in real life. No 
 fake animated player like in NBA 2k6. The only reason i rated it a 9.9 and not a 10 is because 
 I have a Nice screen to enjoy playing this game on and everything runs smooth. Ive played it at 
 a friends house on a smaller tv and it was just a little below great. So if you are looking for 
 the REAL NBA Game, Pick this up!

 to make your own character and go through the regular season with him. The graphics are stunning 
 and really portray the individual look of each character. The game has every players own unique 
 pre free throw warmup which just adds to the realism. The game also has an actual real time sweat 
 counter that looks pretty cool as the game goes on. THe courts are great and each players jersey

  GAMEPLAY is simply out of hand, and ps2 and xbox versions are alot better when it comes to gamplay.
 
  
  while player models are well done, you have this feeling of weirdness when playing on the court, 
 and animation is not that great
  
  i recommend everyone not to get this game and for everyone to go for nba 2k6 which rite now is 
 the best basketball game in the market. EA is getting worse and worse when it comes to there sport 
 games and i was a huge fan until this game came out, so please, everyone do NOT waste your money

Review:  This game was supposed to be the sweet Bball game with insane graphics. Well the graphics on the 
 player models are brilliant but the animations of them glitch and jiggle. Say you have a good lane 
 to the basket so you go for it you press the dunk button from about 6ft away and the game glitches 
 you to about 2ft away with your hands on the rim. Another Example: you're the point bringin' the 
 ball down the court at a walk then you press the juke button and your player owns the defender 
 everytime even on the higher difficulties. C'mon EA lets mix up the outcomes a little bit. Overall 
 the player models look fantastic but between the glitchy animations, dumb season mode, and the 
 retarted camera angles this game needs some work. I rented it for 4 bucks and thats about what 
 I would pay to own it. And trust me when I say that my rating for it is generous.

Review:  if u have played nba live 06 for the ps2 or xbox i suggest not cashing out for 06 on 360 casue 
 all that u get is better graphics ... but if u dont have the ps2 ver ... read on.
  
  in the graphics department well this game looks fantastic it has very nice graphics and i played 
 it on regular tv so in hd it might even look better so grapichs are the best thing u get in 06.
 
  
  the gameplay is like that of 06 in the other versions but the controls are mapped out nicley on 
 the 360 controler.
  
  wwell i think the game modes are not a lot for the only thing u get is seson and online and quick 
 mathces thats it it might be fine but more game moders would have been better such as 2k6. there 
 is also no practice mode .
  
  the free throw system is well good and bad sometimes its good when u get used to it but i think 
 the old system is better .
  
  all in all nba 06 for the 360 is a cool b-ball game and i dont think basket ball fans would be 
 dissapointed if they play it .

Review:  Well, first i would like to say i've played 2k6 on the Xbox . the game got so damn boring after 
 a while. Then i went to a friends house and played both Live and 2k6 on the 360. Live IMO rules. 
 2k6 is still the same old boring game on the other systems. They focus too much on simulation that 
 it dulls down the game. I acutally like the way the shooting motion looks, kinda of unrealistic, 
 but i've come to realize that realism is not appealing to me anymore. All in all, its ashame that 
 a game like Live is shunned beacuse it's not a "TRUE SIM". Or the "ANIMATIONS DONT BLEND" Who gives 
 a hoot, the games fun as hell to play and thats all that matters, the people who think 2k6 is better 
 really makes me mad

Review:  NBA Live 2006... A good game for the die-hard basketball fan, but not for the average joe. The graphics 
 are great and all, but the it just lacks substance.
  
  The main quibble with the game is the free throw controls, you throw the ball with one sweep of 
 the right control stick. I found myself to be missing my free-throws 60% of the time. The game 
 is way to easy if you pick a great team like the 76ers, because you've got Allen Iverson, who can 
 outrun, just about anyone in the game.
  
  The game isn't worth a purchase in my opinion... this might just be another rental only title...
 
  
  Just another mediocre EA sports title...

Review:  This game is a perfect example of all glamour and no gameplay. The visuals for NBA Live '06 can 
 be downright astonishing at times (especially on HD) . But that's something you already know ....
 
  
  As for everything else, I'd say one of the most entertaining aspects of the game is the create-a-player 
 option (which is pretty customizable) and the start up menu where you can play around with up to 
 4 different hoops players before actually selecting a game type. When you do pick your teams and 
 start the game up - instead of going to a dull loading screen, you are allowed to keep shooting 
 around with your hoops player until the game pans into the arena when it is finished loading. It's 
 a very unique and definitely an impressive feature of the game. Sadly, that is where most of the 
 fun ends.
  
  The gameplay of NBA Live '06 is rather unimpressive. You can basically score at will with a star 
 player by driving to the basket (maybe throw in a hop step) and slamming it home. Fouls are pretty 
 frequent and the blocks are few and far between. The animations tend to hover in between very sleek 
 and impressive to choppy and outdated. The camera view is another problem that I have with the 
 game. I was never able to find a suitable view no matter how much I tweaked it. It always seemed 
 to find a way to make things difficult. Perhaps one of the more perplexing aspects of the game 
 is the free-throw shooting. Basically, this is left up to you to figure out. Yeah, I'm sure some 
 of you have figured it out - BUT, it should not be left up to us to figure out. A brand new free 
 throw system should come with instructions! The best thing I could come up with is to make the 
 most as fluid as possible with no hiccups in it. I seemed to make about 50% (maybe a little less) 
 when I did that; however, for the most part every player posted Shaq-like free throw %'s and worse. 
 Free throw shooting is a big part of basketball and it's completely unacceptable to have an ineffecient 
 system.
  
  Probably my last complaint on this game would have to be the missing Dynasty mode. I can't understand 
 why there is no franchise mode. How can you not include it?! It really blows my mind how something 
 as important as that can just be left out. Not really much else to say about that. If you want 
 a good basketball game, go for NBA 2K6. The game not only has superb graphics, but championship 
 gameplay to along with it. EA definitely needs to kick it into high gear for next season's release 
 if it wants to keep up with the competition.

Review:  What can I say about this game, the sweat looks nice, and the character models look nice, but the 
 Sweat on the characters models stink. The shirts and shorts move off beat, and the gameplay made 
 it hard to score a Slam Dunk????
  Sorry but if I am in the paint by myself and I consistantly miss a slam dunk, then something is 
 seriously wrong. To make sure it wasnt the players that I was playing, I made my own and set things 
 that would affect Dunking to 99, and in practice, every shot went in. In the actual game, I missed 
 more then 85% of the time. 
  This was a complete disappointment, I expect better from EA. 6.5 is the best I could give them, 
 and I think that is overdueing it. I hope to see this game improved in the future. And that I will 
 be able to get out of a personal foul when I want, instead of just cringing up. Rent before you 
 buy is all I can say.

Review:  
  Whoever made this game must have had a secret love for either the Lakers or Kobe Bryant. I am pretty 
 sure in the manual it says somehwere - "Once Written By A Wise Man - He Who Gives the Ball to Kobe 
 Bryant will score more than a soccer mom. and after playing this game for one full season mode 
 the man speaketh the truth, at least in the NBA Live world. 
  
  There should be more to be said about this game. The arenas are fantastic and some of the player 
 models are well made. The players do sweat as advertised and the announcers aren't as repetative 
 as some other games I have played. Unfortunately for my season mode my Kobe Bryant had 142 points 
 in a single game on the hardest setting possible. He made three-pointers from almost anywhere and 
 was the leading stealer for the 2006 season in my virtual ownership of the Lakers. 
  
  Should a game be this easy with one player? My only Xbox Live interaction was to get my "one win 
 online" achievement and guess which team the other player took? The Lakers, featuring Kobe Bryant. 
 Oddly enough I wasn't the only person to find this glitch as respectively our Kobes together scored 
 around 150-200 points in an 5 minute quarter exhibition Match. 
  
  Defense is the best aspect to this game because offense is just way too easy. Trying to get your 
 teamates to play specific defenses is a chore, but if pulled off correctly it can leave you going 
 on 30-0 runs (my best defense oddly enough was the 1-3-1) . 
  
  Sadly, the best reason other than the season mode to play this game is the main menu where you 
 get to practice solo in a virtual arena as the game loads. Play with 2 or more people and this 
 loading screen becomes a blast as everyone scrambles to practice shots before a game. 
  
  This game has no other features. No slam dunk contest. No 3-point shoot out. No horse. 
  
  
 Live 2006 had it's fun moments for sure. Moments from ridiculously unrealistic ballplaying and 
 not from realistic competition. I reccomend this game only to people who can get a hold of it for 
 20 dollars or less. Preferably less.

Review:  The best of the 2 NBA games out there. Granted EA took a lot out of this game, it still is awesome. 
 Free throws are tough. Season mode is good. Great game. Look for NBA Live 07 to have all the extras 
 and better looking graphics, to then by far take a lot away from NBA 2k series. This game has great 
 player models and the courts are as real as you can get to this point. As a first generation 360 
 game, it looks damn good. The best looking sports game out, especially for a launch game. The bad 
 downsides to this game, no rookie game, no slam dunk contest, and no 3-point shootout, but definately 
 look for these in the next edition. The controls are all the same, so you don't have to re-learn 
 how to play the game that you all most likely love.

Review:  this game has the best graphics for the xbox 360 and presentation. When i first played it i would 
 of gave it a 7.9 but when i got used to the camera it got addicting. If you dont mind there is not 
 a lot of modes then get this game. If you like basketball get it. This game is so good this is the 
 fifth best xbox 360 game out there. Listen to the people reviews not the others. The online play 
 is solid and the gameplay is nba live gameplay. EVeryone of the reviews on this game didnt have 
 any problems with the gameplay it was just they took out all these modes that is the reason a lot 
 of the gave it a seven.

 up Grapics and there You go. Im not Saying it is bad but i expected more then just that. The grapics 
 are out of this world. and the gameplay is Tight. I expect better from You EA Next year. Make sure 
 you have a Differant game next time or i will not be spending a extra $60 on Nba live 2007 just 
 for the grapics. Need a game that will make me buy it for my Next-Gen system. Do you think i would

Review:  This game is extremely overrated by readers. The gameplay is at most mediocre, the player designs 
 (headband colors, armband designs, etc) are not up to par with the 360's capabilities. On top of 
 that, the players look cartoonish, and are way too fat. The gameplay has not changed between the 
 last-gen versions, and the only reason Live is rated so high is because it is created by EA Sports, 
 and if you looked at the reviews for the last-gen versions, you would know that the gameplay wouldn't 
 be much different from them. The 360's graphic capabilitieshave been abused by sports games. Sure 
 the graphics are great, but they forget about whats most important, the gameplay. 
  I would reccomend NBA 2K6 instead, the gameplay is the same as the old version, but the old version 
 got a very high rating, plus they also have boosted the graphics in the game up to par of the X-Box 
 360.

Review:  I'm pretty sure most Xbox 360 owners are staying away from this game due to the horrible reviews 
 it has been getting. I was one of them that refused to listen to the reviews, and wanted to really 
 see for myself how it was. I have to tell you, I was shocked.
  
  Sure, there's not much in the game, but who needs the worthless extras that were in the Xbox and 
 PS2 versions of Live? The boring All Start mode? The lackluster slam dunk competition? The boring, 
 "let's tap two buttons" three point shootout? Other than that, there's really not much that was 
 left off the console version that I can remember, and if there was, it wasn't good enough for me 
 to remember it anyway, so it really doesn't matter. 
  
  I don't understand how the main review here on GameSpot said this game only looks Next-Gen at times. 
 I'm playing on a standard, non-HDTV, and I'm still amazed by the incredible graphics. Sure, I know 
 they will look better on a HDTV, but what you get from NBA Live 06 on a standard TV is good enough 
 if you ask me. 
  
  The gameplay is smooth, and takes no more than one full game to get used to, and that's a good 
 thing. Xbox Live is quite the experience as well. When you get in there with a good player and 
 get a good back and forth game going between the two of you, you really won't have as much fun 
 anywhere else. 
  
  The Create-A-Player mode in NBA LIve 06 is by far, the most complete Create-A-Player mode on ANY 
 GAME since THQ's SmackDown! vs RAW series for the PS2. Want to create Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, 
 or even Larry Bird to perfection? You can do it here. Unlike other games, your created player looks 
 just as good, if not the same quality as the other players in the game, which is also amazing. 
 
  
  Putting it simply, while NBA Live 06 may not be next-gen in gameplay modes, it sure is in presentation 
 and graphics, as well as online play. Those three things alone create probably the most fun (not 
 most complete) basketball game I've ever played. And that's what this is about, right? Fun?

Review:  EA's first attempt to basketball next gen, is not a bad one, graphics are awesome as expected, 
 gameplay is good, free throw system is something new and have to get use too, but once you get 
 it down its like a real free throw one fluid motion, only problem is when you put difficulty on 
 All-star and Superstar, players shot animation is awkward and can't nail a shot unless by luck 
 I feel, update I now play on Superstar and shot the ball with no problem, was told by a guy on-line 
 I hald the shot button to long, have to have a light press and release at the top of your jumper. 
 But is a Good game haven't played NBA2k yet, but its worth a rental. I wonder when will they get 
 All-Time teams like NCAA Football and Madden, 89-90, 90-91 or 2003-2004 Pistons.

Review:  GOOD: Live 06 is a Great game.
  
  BAD: But like Madden 06 for Xbox 360 they took off the Dunk Contest Three Point Shootout and even 
 the Dynasty Mode which all 3 were my favorite partz of Live. Ive been a Live fan since Live 95 
 and that even have Dunk Contest and 3 point shootout, Practice, One on One, Legendary Players, 
 Nba Store what were they thinking to take off stuff. Why take out stuff when you could add in stuff. 
 If they didnt take off any think then I would have game the game probably a PERFECT SCORE but they 
 did take off almost the whole game. If they would have took anything else off then you would only 
 be able to play against computer. It only has a couple of game modes Season which you play about 
 82 or 52 games and the season is over. At least you can still create a player but if your a black 
 person and you want braids then the braids look like your bald with a whole lot of lines in you 
 head. It kind of embarrasses your player. The freethrows has to be the worst make of Freethrow 
 history. Itz the hardest Freethrow ive ever tried to shoot. My created player cant even hit a freethrow 
 on SUPERSTAR, you will have to play on rookie to have a chance at shooting freethrows. 
  
  GOOD: But if you can get over all of that then itz actually a good game including the EXCELLENT 
 GRAPHIX, PLAYER MODELS, AND ARENAS OR COURT, and GAMEPLAY, even though your going to be 1 For 20 
 from the Freethrow line. Otherwise the game can get pretty addictive.

Review:  Just like gamespot i have a good and a bad. The bad is the free throw is difficult, the camera does 
 not follow the players at times, and their aren't that many jerseys in the game. The good is play 
 while it loads, looks good even on standard tv's, it's addictive, the ghrapics are perfect and i don't 
 even have an hdtv. First of all, NBA LIVE 06 is better than gamespot rated it they should get fired. the 
 game is fun when your playng by yourself. But even better when playing with a friend, gamespot tried 
 to say it don't look real at times. But it do, i have had this game for 2 days and every body looks 
 like themselves. NBA LIVE 06 on the xbox360 is way different from the other systems. It's not just 
 the ghrapics, i think it's because it seems more simulating and not arcade. the camera angles are 
 not bad. It's just sometimes they can't keep up with the players. Gamespot said the camera angles 
 look to far back. But you can zoom in. And really you don't have to. The game does seem slow on it's 
 default settings. Not as slow as other people try to say it is. You could put the speed on 100, not 
 even and it will be faster, but it really seems slow because if you run with someone like shaq he 
 seem to run like a turtle. But if you run with someone like Iverson they run fast and make the game 
 feel faster. The free throw system is hard, when i first played live i basiclly missed all my free 
 throw shots. The next day i played with the two all-star teams and hit 8 out of 13. Sometimes you'll 
 get lucky and make them. You'll mostly make them when your shooting with a good free throw shooter. When 
 i first played live i could not stop playng. So you know it's addictive. Season mode is good but 
 not great, But if you E-mail and stuff like that, you won't get it here. As you read this review you'll 
 notice that i have said more good things than bad things about live. that's becuse it's their is, creating 
 a player is good but i don't reaaly care for it. Ifyour wondering if you can edit player you can. What 
 i like about that is you can see the players close up and. If you have someone with long hair like 
 Nash their hair will move when you rotate them. Their jerseys also move to, when you turn on the 
 game, your basiclly playing all ready. you can select players to play with. You start with Wade but 
 if you save with a different player playng it will start with him. their are not alot of jerseys, no 
 throwbacks, only home away and altrenates. but their are cheats to unlock other ones. NBA LIVE 06 
 for the 360 is better than the other systems. It has more up's than downs. It's the first game i 
 got for the 360. I don't know if this is better than 2K6 but it's still hot without the slam dunk 
 contest and stuff. It isn't like they won't have them back next year. It's addicive and better than 
 what gamespot gave it. It's better when playing when somebody, but other than that i recommend it 
 even if your not a basketball fan. This year is superb but you know next year is going to be better.

Review:  Okay, this will be a short review. 
  
  Graphics-20/10
  Simply amazing. Actually seeing the beads of sweat roll down Dwayne Wade's forehead is just tickling. 
 Also, looking at the three rolls of meat in the back of Shaq's head is engrossing. And the coaches... Awwww 
 MAN!
  
  Gameplay-7/10
  Meh. It's okay. The only thing that saves it is the graphics. But the cool thing about the main 
 menu is that you can actually practice with a player with other people. It's really neat and it 
 looks simply amazing.
  
  Sound-7/10
  It's pretty good. The swish of the net sounds really realistic. Decent and acceptable.
  
  Value-8/10
 
  This game's value is this; it's better than any other NBA Live out there, so get it now. It's 
 worth it.

Review:  So, to start....... I originally wanted to get NBA 2K6, but, I wasn't able to and got this game 
 instead.... From the beggining, I thought this game was gonna suck, and it did, when I first played 
 it.... I totally sucked..... like really band..... I created a character, customized him, and then 
 I tried to make a season, but I couldn't even figure out how to get him on the playable roster 
 even after it said he was on the team (I did figure it out eventually, but through a lot of time 
 spent... actually, it was an accident that I figured it out) ...
  
  Anyways, I started getting better, and, surprisingly, the game started getting better too..... It 
 still wasn't "Oh, I just love this game!" but it was "Oh, this game isn't that bad...." I beat 
 season mode and I did some stuff....
  
  So, the controls.... they aren't that bad.... maybe a little work here and there 8.5/10
  
  gameplay
 
  pretty sharp actually, though it takes way too long to finish a game because of all the stops... One 
 thing that just pissed me off, for example, are the free throws.... they're not way way to hard 
 on offline, though they still are hard... but online, that's another story... also, on free throws, 
 it takes a while for the character to be prepared to actually shoot. Rasheed Wallace, for example 
 takes forever, like 8 seconds (maybe a little less) ... but YEAH!!! You feel really angry! so, I 
 give this a 7.8/10
  
  Graphics
  Awesome 9.5/10
  
  Longetivity...
  This game can get boring pretty fast, after maybe a week or so it starts to get boring..... yeah, 
 even before, or maybe after... There's just not much to do... Season mode is practically all they 
 really give you, and live, it okay, but for my connection, LOTS OF LAG! I give this a 6/10
  Overall 7.5/10

Review:  if the people at EA would have given this game all the features it could have been incredible. 
 apart from the looks which are fantastic the gameplay is so good, it is very realistic, very fun 
 and it is for me the best basketball game out there. 2k just ported the xbox version over and improved 
 a couple of things whereas this started all over and scored on everything excepy features. if i 
 had to advise some one into buying a sport game it would be this, actually i would tell you to 
 save your money and get fight night 3 but for basketball this is my clear choice

Review:  I admit it when a new system comes out i become somewhat of a graphics whore, sorry but when im 
 dropping 400 bones on a new system i expect to be amazed. Thank you NBA Live 06 for making me happy 
 in that respect.
  On the sports side of things this baller is easily the best lookking sports game to grace the 360 
 when it came out in launch.
  Its the only one that truly screams out next gen.
  Whether its the sweat on the players faces or the championship banners taht you can see all over 
 staduims its all here graphically.
  The NBA superstars now also play a more physical game , as defenders will now use there forearms 
 to keep big boys like shaq out of contension to beat them easily.
  Next year though players need to show a little bit more emotion like when commiting fouls these 
 guys are soulless, plus id like to see 07 play faster this game feels very slow at times and it 
 does affect gameplay somewhat.
  The biggest issue i have with this game is the fact that there is no franchise mode that just kills 
 me inside and it made me want to get my money back and it is a very great reason to score this 
 game low but, online baby oh how it performs it keeps the replay value up there and it keeps it 
 fun for hours on in. Anyone that is looking for a good hoops title should look here

Review:  This game is awesome. I purchased it for the 360 today along with Madden from my local Game Rush 
 Block Buster, then went to another game store with an Xbox kiosk and asked the manager to let me 
 test it out. He was very kind to let me do this. The next thing I know there is a crowd of people 
 around me just amazed at what they were seeing. One lady asked me "are you really controlling those 
 plalyers"? I've never seen a prettier game (besides Madden which I played next) . If this game gets 
 a bad rating don't trust the rating. The game is slowed down a little but it's for the better. 
 The dunks and animations are awesome. You will swear you are watching a real NBA game. The freestyle 
 controls are very tight and feel so natural in the game. The "R" button thorws olley- oops. The 
 "R" trigger is for Turbo. The player models are so detailed that you will even notice facial scruff 
 and don't get me started on the player models hair. Yes EA left out the dunk contest, three point 
 contest and other gameplay modes but for a first game on a new system they have really stepped 
 up their game. The sound is also great as the crowd will have you thinking you are really in the 
 arena. The attention to detail in each arena is just plain sick. I cannot wait to get my own 360 
 on Monday. I'm rating this game by what is actually in the game rather than the modes that are 
 missing like most company

Review:  Man what a big jump from Nba Live 06 from the PS2 to Nba Live 06 on Xbox360. Now I can't even see 
 myself playing Nba live 06 on the playstation2 because of the big difference in graphics between 
 the 2 games. From way the players look, the coaches look, and the court. This game just looks terrific. 
 Yeah there are a couple of things missing from the previous Nba live due to the fact that they 
 rush this game for the xbox360. Another thing you might not like is the fact that they changed 
 the way you shoot the ball from the freethrow line which is annoying. I think this will hold you 
 til the next nba live is out. At least you're allow to create your own player from scratch. The 
 only problem is that you can only play one season there's no dynasty mode that's one of the many 
 things missing from this game. But man oh man does this game looks great. I can't wait to see what 
 nba live 07 will look like. I hope Ea Sports doesn't disappoint me. If you're want a baskeball 
 game that looks great than you should get this for your xbox360. Comparing it to Nba 2k6 I think 
 this one looks better.

Review:  Many people think that this game is a good one because of the NBA Live games in the series, and 
 they have all been good since NBA Live 2002. But this game for the XBOX 360 is not a good game 
 at all. One major thing that is wrong are the camera angles.
  
  The camera angle are very confusing and are not very impressive. Instead of the usual behind the 
 back view, its view is realisticly placed on the far end of the court, and zooms in when the action 
 is on the other end of the court. This might sound like a great addition to the game, but when 
 you're on the far end of the court, which is where all of the action is, it's very difficult to 
 see the action. Even when you are on the press box camera setting, when you sometimes go up for 
 a rebound, the ball and rim will be out of view. Also, if you do a fast break, you go off the screen. 
 How can the person with the ball go off of the screen?
  
  Another thing is the fact that nearly everything that I liked about NBA Live 06 isn't even on the 
 game. The superstar moves aren't on the game, as well as the dunk contest. One good thing about 
 the game is the graphics, but I do not think that graphics are everything. If you want a solid 
 NBA game, but NBA Live 06 for XBOX, but if you want a game with good graphics but poor gameplay, 
 go ahead and buy NBA Live 06 for XBX 360.

Review:  My last review was rather biased and rather 1-paragraphed, so this time i will go over each and 
 every subject in detail. first i will give you a short introduction to NBA Live 06. NBA Live brings 
 you in your living room into the wrath of playing in the NBA. Xbox live capability is really good, 
 barely any lagg and it's gripping. for people that don't agree with this review. say that please, 
 disagree but for those who agree, agree. the graphics really get to the point of showing people 
 what next-gen gaming Is, it's almost to the fact of perfect. iverson is iverson, shaq is shaq. 
 Anyway enough of that. the gameplay is the same basically as most other NBA's but the Free-throw 
 shooting is hard. depending on your ability to time and which player you have throwing it, is the 
 reason if it's a miss or a hit. some matches you'll have a 0/12.. where some online matches the 
 lag can help you and get you shooting 11/12, the sound.. yeah the sound is good. no less that i 
 expected of course.
  
  Graphics:
  The graphics get along the point of showing you what next generation gaming really is, just look 
 at the sweat running down them. it's amazing. the graphical ability of the game you can't fault. 
 for people who think it's bad then they obviously know nothing about basketball and have never 
 seen an nba game before in their life. NBA live will take some beating and i don't think that beating 
 will be given by NBA 2k6.
  
  Gameplay
  As i said 2k6 won't beat it. nor in graphics/gameplay. the gameplay is electrifying. pure brilliance 
 on your television, On a HDTV - wonderful Normal tele - Just as great. NBA is an enjoyable expreience, 
 and no you can't use a created team/player online.. think of it.. they'd play you in a 'fair' match 
 when your miami heat thinking your cool, they'll come on the court and anihilate you with people 
 like iverson, shaq, carter, wade and all the rest of it. NBA Graphicwise beats alot of games hands-down. 
 the dunks look good, the players look good the court looks good, IT looks good.
  
  Sound:
  well there is never really much to say about the sound i find on NBA games but, i might 
 aswell write a little something instead of being pathetic. The sound is good. commentary is brilliant 
 and can give you tips sometimes. there isn't that much more to say about the sound so i will leave 
 it at that.

Review:  Everybody has to **** about the new sports games for the 360. Well people for sports games that 
 have been rushed, and built for the 2nd time from the ground up... these games are damn good.
  So..... like my views on Madden 06 for the 360, this game brings it to the house. The graphics are 
 completely unbelievable with the detail of players. As you may have heard it even details the sweat. The 
 gameplay is fun, but at times irritable when your star player can not make a shot. The only thing 
 that I would really complain about is that the closest thing they have to a dynasty is season mode, 
 which really pisses me off. How are you supposed to enjoy a basketball game with only one year of 
 play? I don't like having to start over after each year.
  Overall EA did a damn good job for a rushed game just as they did with Madden. I don't care what 
 you people say. They only had a couple months to totally impress for launch, and with their time 
 limit they impressed me. Pick this one up if your a basketball lover.

Review:  I've always been a Live enthusiast, but this year I was incredibly disappointed. Not only are the 
 graphics only so-so (arms look like stick-figures at times) , but the gameplay is pretty much the 
 same as the Xbox version... nothing special or next-gen. The players sweat looks good, but they'll 
 sweat like hogs within minutes of thhe game starting... completely unrealistic.
  
  Then my biggest complaint, the lack of any and all game modes. You either play an exhibition, or 
 a single season. No dynasty, no career, no franchise. What's the point??? I beat the season once, 
 and haven't picked up the game since. There's absolutely no replay value in this game, and it's 
 safe to say that EA pretty much mauled this series here.
  
  If you want a solid basketball game, you're much better off with NBA2k6. It's realistic, the graphics 
 are incredible, and there are tons of gameplay modes that'll keep you coming back again and again. 
 2K is the new king of basketball games!

Review:  when i first played this i was amazed about the rating most ppl gave it. I guess nobody knows how 
 to rate these days. So after playing it, i didnt want to stop for a long time. i would say about 
 5 straight hours of playing this game that most ppl thinks sucks. and know i am going to get it 
 for christmas while you guys bs about it and say it can burn in hell. I seriously dont understand 
 why u guys dont like it. So that is the end of my review and this game has a great gameplay and 
 good graphics.

Review:  I have been playing 2k and live for a while. Both games have there ups and downs. If you cant decide, 
 this is a time where you forget all the reviews and rent them both. You dont want to get a NBA 
 game that doesnt feel right. 
  
  Things that i like about Live is the control and game play. The game is easy to pick up and play. 
 Graphics and music are great. 
  
  Things i didnt like are how the face expressions on the players. No All Star Weekend. Also the 
 lack of subsution, you can have the same guy through the whole game and he wont get tired.

Review:  It hurts when a game Ive enjoyed since I was a wee little 15 year old went wrong and right in 
 so many little ways.
  
  I was still excited when the menu to the game started off by showing the good graphics as Dwayne 
 Wade sweated for no reason. The positive of the game is not good enough to outweigh the disappointing 
 not so revolutionary graphics and brand spanking new glitches. A new not so cool thing is that 
 the game play tends to slow down, and guess what; the player can still dunk through the back board, 
 and another new thing is the CPU tends to run out of bounds sometimes.
  
  The best thing is instead of a loading screen you get to practice while the game loads but for 
 some reason i felt EA Sports put all their effort into this instead of the game.
  
  Basically nothing much has changed: its still the same game play (which I like) even though its 
 not so realistic except for the new player contact which lessens your chances of dunking or driving 
 in on just anybody, and another not so good addition is the free throw controls, which I first 
 thought was impossible but now is manageable.
  
  Unwillingly I will tell you the good which is: Same game play, good graphics for cut scenes like 
 free throw warm ups and quarter breaks but you cant tell when youre playing with the not to mention 
 crappy slow camera angles, but I play with sideline zoomed in view like how it used to be for 2003 
 so I dont have to worry.
  
  See I try to stop saying bad stuff about the game but I cant, another thing is the players dont 
 have facial expressions, they maintain one look on their face the whole game, and they exaggerate 
 the sweating because they play for 15 seconds and theyre already sweating.
  
  Youre hearing this from a NBA Live fan, I was since 2003, and well all I can say was at least 
 I got 1000 easy points added to my Gamer Score. 
  
  Final thought: Get NBA 2K6, rent NBA LIVE 06 just to check it out, oh yea I forgot one more thing, 
 its overpriced and no more dunk contest or shoe store or ... i'll just walk away before I spit 
 at my computer screen.
  
  EA Sports... tisk tisk.

Review:  Kinda wishing I bought 2k6 now. The game itself looks great, but the game play, its just weird, 
 it seams as though no matter how good the players are, they perform equally, for example a 60 overall 
 plays the same as a 90 overall for the most part. Playing against superstar is a *****, it seams 
 imposable, ive tried 5 times and lost by 1-4 every time, it seams normal at 1st, then their FG 
 percentage goes up in the 4th quarter, its totally insane, and congrats if you have the chance 
 to beat the CPU in superstar. 
  The BIG part about this game that brings it down its that there is no dynasty mode, just a single 
 season, which its pretty stupid...

Review:  I have been playing nba live now for 7 years and this game sucks there is no features at all. You 
 get seaon and creat player thats it. What happend to nba live? I will be trading nba live in for 
 call of duty 2 all the EA games are very bad this year for xbox 360. Will be looking at other basketball 
 games for next year. Im very disappointed in the game. The good things about the game is graphics 
 which is the 360 not the game and i do like the new way to call timeouts and set up plays. The 
 new way to shoot free throws is way to hard i have to make the settings to rookie to make a shot 
 with a good free throw shooter. I dont understand why EA would come out with such a bad game. Dont 
 get this game! thanks

Review:  6.4!? Cmon' this game is fun, addictive, and highly entertaining. NBA Live 06 is mostly build around 
 the XBOX Live experience. The seasons, and stuff feel extremely rushed because theres so many things 
 that you can't do. Like the 3-Point Shootout, or whatevers been in the previous titles for the 
 PS2 or XBOX.
  
  The Graphics are groundbreaking. The music is so catchy. The gameplay is so smooth.. I just can't 
 figure out why everyone's so disappointed in this game title. 
  
  The Multiplayer experience seems like everything is equal. Neither team has a huge advantage (Stat 
 Wise) ; and almost all luck has been eliminated. I absolutely love how the Live experience has been 
 set up with the 360 and NBA Live takes advantage of that. I've given this game a 9.5/10.

Review:  NBA Live 06 for the XBOX 360 looks really good, but just plays like NBA Live 2005 on the current 
 generation consoles but a lot slower. The frame rate in NBA Live 06 glitches up for about a second 
 or two sometimes during game play. Hopefully, next time EA will use more than just 30 frames per 
 second on games. Controls such as freestyle superstar like on the current generation versions have 
 been removed which makes it a little bit less entertaining, although the dunks look really good. 
 This NBA Live is a bit more realistic than any other of the previous versions. All the camera angles 
 seem to be a little awkward and too far away from the action. Up close the graphics look amazing!!! 
 Every NBA player that I have seen so far has looked like their real life counterpart. There is 
 a lack of modes from the previous versions of NBA Live such as Franchise mode, Dunk Contest, and 
 the 3-Point Shooting Contest. The game play is alright but not great, or even like the past few 
 versions of NBA Live. I would not recommend anyone to actually buy this game because it is not 
 really worth $60. My advice would be just to wait until next years version of NBA Live. If you 
 are interested in this game you should rent it or download the demo for free on XBOX Live Marketplace. 
 Remember EA rushed to try to finish this game in time for launch and you can tell, but I am almost 
 positive that next year NBA Live will be back to normal and running at 60 frames per second.

Review:  This game should get atl east a 8.5 due to the graphics. This is the first time we have seen a 
 Nba Live on the 360 and maybe next year we can criticize it but not now. Not only does this game 
 provide aww inspiring graphics, but it also has terrific game play. When you miss a shot it feel 
 like a real shot on tv, and also sounds like it. The menu (Which is REALLY creative) is a practice 
 gym, so your never out of the game. So is the loading screen, this I think is the first step into 
 "Next-Gen", I mean no waiting to load, thats nice. The players look real and so does the court, 
 one of my favorite things is how they give you a sense of how big the arena really is. Sure there 
 are flaws like no dynasty and dunk modes but who cares? The free throw shooting is a hit and miss 
 and the fans still look bad, but for a title that had little time to be made its not bad. There 
 are invisible walls that prevent the ball from going out of bounds but next year will be better, 
 when the full power of the 360 will be used. Overall this is a great game and you will love it.

Review:  I cant believe it you come out with something great different and revolutionary and what do you 
 get, hated on. Nba Live 2006 is first Graphically, an amazing title just for the Graphics alone 
 deserve a higher score than what gamespot gave it. I do agree that not having all the features 
 that it should have is a downfall but we all know it will be there next year, and plus am tired 
 of reading reviews that just dwell on that, give it up for all the things that the game does great 
 right now seems to not even matter to gamespot. The game play is really good probably not the best 
 ever but it difently is top notch, players fighting for positions in the post nice, players that 
 shoot like there real life counter parts and look exactly like them or extremely close nice, the 
 commentary is as real as it gets with not the same repetitive thing being said over and over but 
 actually stuff being said that you will hear in a actually real life NBA game nice, The game has 
 been slowed down to a realalistic game pace maybe for some a little slow, but thats because some 
 floks rather a more arcadey basketball game but not here. The players do sweat alot but that deosnt 
 bother me at all, if any thing it adds to the games realalistic Graphics. The animation and collision 
 or popping from one move to another, call me blind but I dont really see it, and it may get a 
 little jerky but honestly not enough, for me to really complain about it. Dont believe the hype 
 thats all I have to say get this game and be amazed with sic Graphics and gameplay, if you love 
 basketball you need this game, you will not regret it. DHAVIC speaks the truth take or leave it.

Review:  Although this game may lack all of the extras that we have become accustomed to in regards to NBA 
 Live, my feeling is that EA is on the right track. The graphics are incredible. This is what I 
 expect from a next-gen console. For all of the complaints EA has had in regards to lack of graphical 
 upgrades, it appears that EA has done its homework. 
  
  The one issue I have is the framerate. It doesn't move as smooth as it appears to run at 30 FPS. 
 A little herky, jerky in spots. The post-up animations are tight.
  
  In regards to gameplay, yes the gameplay is a tad weak. The camera angles are tough (whatever happened 
 to the classic camera angle from the NBA Live 95 and 96 games?) . It makes it very difficult to 
 play defense and grab rebounds. However, it isn't so painful that you can't play it. It is still 
 a fun game that needs to be tweaked. A diamond in the rough.
  
  In regards to the extras, there really isn't any. There is a season mode, which is essential. The 
 best part may be the load screens where you can shoot around all day long. Four players can join 
 in.
  
  In summary, if you want a sweet looking game that plays decent enough to have some fun minus all 
 of the goodies (All-Star weekend, franchise, etc.) this is not a horrible purchase. However, if 
 you are a casual gamer I would wait until next year's game. I am certain EA will load that puppy 
 up with all the fixins...

Review:  Upon first play of this game I was very impressed as im sure we all were with the graphic presentations 
 of the practice gym and the upclose display of the player model of Dwyane Wade. Once you actually 
 start plyaing its a whole nother story. The frame rate is very choppy much of which we're used 
 to from previous NBA Live titles but for a Next-Gen game you'd expect these kinks in gameplay to 
 be completely diminished. On top of the choppy frame rate the camera angles are hideous. There's 
 not a single camera angle that's familiar to any seasoned or verteran NBA Live Gamer. This is what 
 it all comes down too... The amount of patience you have with games like this and also if you have 
 no choice but to play THIS game given that you bought NBA Live instead of NBA 2K6. In anycase I 
 took the time play the game as well as figure out some camera angles that were abit better that 
 others. Season mode is ok as wekk as online gameplay. Some say this is an AMAZING game while others 
 say its ABSOLUTELY AWFUL... Im somewhere in between. Its not THAT bad of a game... It's honestly 
 what you make of it.
  
  P. S. If anyone knows how to view an Instant Replay please let me know.... yes... sad but true... I 
 DONT KNOW how to view my replays.

Review:  This game is the best in its series! So what that it lost the slam dunk contest and the all star 
 shoot off! You can have your own dunk contest and shoot off as you wait for the game to load. The 
 game is gorgeous! Graphics that are most def. next gen! The game still left me with the feeling 
 that I was playing the NBA Live series. I saw no glitches that they spoke of. Free throws are the 
 easiest thing in the world on that game. So easy, that, if GS couldn't figure that out, then they 
 do need a new job!!! It's called timing! and most gamers have it! Having no replays when I want 
 them does down right suck but will be overlooked. Although the game does not deserve a "9", it 
 does not deserve a 6.4 or whatever it was given. This is coming from a person that has hated every 
 live that has come out since 2001! Just my opinion, but it had to be said!

Review:  I downloaded the demo from Xbox live and that was all I needed to know to determine this game was 
 horrible. EPSN 2k5 on the original Xbox was much better gameplay wise. The free throw shooting 
 is nearly impossible, and the whole flow of the game is just off set. The players move stiffly, 
 and don't have the free moving flow we would have loved to see match the graphics and detail. No 
 camera few seems just right and the whole game just seems sloppy. All the cutscenes in the world 
 wouldn't cover up the shallow gameplay EA put into this game. I havn't tried ESPN yet, but I don't 
 think it could get much worse then this.

Review:  For starters, Live 06' does show the potential of next generation consoles. 
  Graphics - Superb, with the exception that the sweat looks monster veins and the players' mouths 
 seemed to be superglued shut. Not even when a player is horribly hacked does his mouth open one 
 bit, just that same look of not really caring anymore (kind of the same feeling I get from EA Sports 
 about their games) . 
  
  Gameplay - Pretty good for the most part. Some slow motion and framerate problems, but usually 
 not a huge deal. The controls are easy enough to use, giving the game a pretty short time for a 
 learning curve. I did find that if you play the game as is, without switching any of the options, 
 making normally gimme shots is pretty frustrating. A lot of times your team can shoot from within 
 5 feet of the basket, get about 3 offensive rebounds, and still not put it down. And of course, 
 the free throw shooting.... it's just plain absurd. I get the feeling Shaq made a huge financial 
 contribution to this game so they would make it look like it's not only him that has problems from 
 the line. The camera angles can be tweaked, but once again, leave much to be desired, especially 
 when moving down the court (be careful where you throw, cause you're not going to see where the 
 ball ends up for about 2-3 seconds.) Dunks and shooting are realistic and fun to watch, but not 
 what I expected from a next gen game.
  
  Sound - Not really a huge part of the game for me, but as sound goes, it sufices.
  
  Value 
 - If you actually have the money to spend on the X-box 360, then 60 would usually seem cheap in 
 comparison. But not for this game. I was one of the lucky ones who rented it before buying it. 
 I know nobody likes to wait, but I think renting a game first is truly the only way to go. After 
 2 days you can bring it back if you'd like, but once you buy it, you're stuck with that empty feeling 
 of wasted money, which if you're somewhat poor like me, is not a good feeling.
  
  Overall, a great rental game worth a couple days of good fun and competition with friends, but 
 not something to rush out and spend 60 on.

 the game down a little be not as much as they did i dont think $60 is worth a season mode and Xbox 
 live (for the lucky people who have it) even madden kept franchise mode, but EA is happy because 
 like me many people just gave them $60 for a $30 game. my words of advise... wait for next year 
 when we get all of the modes we need and then some then they would make THE best basketball game 
 the have made yet.

Review:  Let me begin by saying that I do not currently nor do I have any plans to actually go out and purchase 
 NBA Live 2006 for the Xbox360. I do own the Xbox version of Live and this review is off of the 
 NBA Live 06 Demo available off the Live Marketplace and the extensive time I was able to get with 
 the game at the Microsoft Xbox360 Zero Hour event.
  
  The most evident change from the last generation of consoles (PS2, Xbox, GC) to the newest generation 
 is the graphics. To me it seems as though EA Sports spent a rather large majority of their time 
 developing this game from "scratch" on the graphics. The arenas, player models, crowds, coaches, 
 lighting, and presentation are all the best I've ever seen in a basketball game. Yes, I do think 
 they are way better in this game than NBA 2k6 for the 360. The reason I feel this way is because 
 the textures used for the skin look a lot better, have more color, and the sweat graphics look 
 more realistic. The only problem I have with anything graphical are some of the transitions between 
 animations in the game... they just don't seem to blend as well as I had hoped.
  
  On the gameplay side, the difficulty settings allow for pretty good challenge between teams. The 
 default settings are a little too slow for my liking, but of course that can be changed. I gave 
 this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of 
 the game versus the Xbox 1 version. I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise 
 mode??? The game seems to play more simulation type of bball, but the numbers at the end of a game 
 don't follow. Maybe next year or the version for the PS3 will be what Live gamers were expecting 
 from a next generation title.
  
  The sound and presentation in the game are fantastic. The arenas feel alive and watching the game 
 and the start screen is great.
  
  Finally, I have to give this game such a low value rating because all you are getting for a $60 
 game is a single game mode, basic season mode, online play, and create a player... I don't think 
 it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console 
 versions. It's like NBA Live without serveral of the features that make Live such a fun bball series.

Review:  i saw game play footage of this game and i was like wow!! this game looks soooo cool. so i went 
 and preordered it. that was the biggest mistake i have made in the last month. the first time i 
 saw how the players looked and all that stuff i was shocked it was a game. but when i played it 
 , it was horrible. one of the only good things about it is that its loading screen allows you to 
 practice with any player of your choice. the free throws are cool but theres no way to practice 
 them so its kinda hard to get used to. another cool feature is during a dead ball, you can make 
 lineup changes without having to go to the start menu and all that other riggamaro. the players 
 run way way to slow. you can turn up the game speed but that doesnt help much. when you pass the 
 ball it seems like the ball is a rocket comin out of their hands. another weird thing is when you 
 dribble really really slow the ball moves in slow motion too. you can make passes that would really 
 get stolen in real life, but they go right by the players heads. this game looks amazing but nba 
 2k6 is way way better. this game is mediocre at best. im selling my nba live also if anyone is 
 interested its 45 dollars with free shipping. its only been used four times. email me at mmdogg723@yahoo. com 
 if you are interested.

Review:  Well when my friend, Kareem, brought over his 360 and NBA Live 06, he wanted me to review the game 
 and then tell him my opinion. So I agreed and started to play it. I have played NBA live before, 
 but the 360 version differs from its Xbox counterpart (not in a good way either) .
  
  Gameplay 5/10:
  I noticed right then and there that the 360 version was lacking most of the game 
 modes the Xbox version had. I was disappointed, but I just kept playing on. The game took an inovative 
 idea to let you practice on a court while the game was loading. That in itself was next gen as 
 well as the menus. However, It didn't feel next gen when it came down to playing the matches. It 
 was the simple pass and shot routine with no innovative features what-so-ever. The franchise mode.... a 
 simple husk.... and the commentary is so bland that I would prefer John Madden doing basketball 
 commentary as well.
  
  Graphics 9/10:
  I bet this is the only reason why many people bought this game: the claim of updated graphics. 
 Yes it looks undeniably next gen, but at what cost? EA took away most of the game modes just to 
 update the graphics to next gen material. They had accomplished that greatly and even I have to 
 admit that the graphics are good. However, without the gameplay to back it up, it is not even worth 
 the 60 dollars people are paying. Another downside is the graphics on the court stutter at times 
 so it makes the animation of the player choppy and stick out.
  
  Sound 9/10:
  The way the sound is played it makes you feel like you are in the court playing basketball with 
 your fellow team mates. The crowd is as loud and helpful/annoying as ever, and the sweet sound 
 of that swish or dunk to rub it in your opponents face. The downside is the commentary. It feels 
 like they read it from a script, and thus it sounds very bland and brings away from such ambience. 
 Also they repeat the same comment most of the time. 
  
  Value 6/10:
  To conclude this review, NBA live 06 is apparently an over-hyped game relying on graphics more 
 than on gameplay. Thus it makes it a pretty under averaged game. For basketball fans and those 
 who are thinking about getting it: either rent this game or buy NBA 2k6 (It is a better game) . 
 For those of you that bought it: trade it in... you will not get any satisfaction after a while.

Review:  As the 1st game I powered up on my new 360, I was blown away the the graphical prowess of this 
 game. My initial reaction was that it looked so good I wanted to $hit on myself! Seeing Dwayne 
 Wade in action the first time while playing the shoot around in the menu screen gave me high hopes 
 that this would be THE basketball game of all basketball games. The menus are intuitive and fresh 
 and the crispness of the visuals will leave you in awe. The problem is that the actual game play 
 is less than spectacular. It's okay, but I've played better on lesser systems. You can tell this 
 game was rushed like the rest of the 360 launch games. Player movement feels sluggish and choppy. 
 The animations don't seem to connect well, and having a game with great graphics but choppy animations 
 makes no sense. All in all the game is a bit boring and disappointing. Though the stadiums look 
 amazing and players look pretty much like their real-life counterparts, there was little flair 
 and emotion conveyed on the court and I felt like I was just going through the motions and couldn't 
 wait till my 5 minute quarter was over. I'm glad this Live is no dunk-fest but the on-the-court 
 action is so bogged-down it makes me sleepy. Free throw shooting is achieved by pulling the stick 
 down and pushing it up to simulate the follow-through of really shooting the ball. Sounds good 
 on paper but unfortunetly its a crap shoot as the game never tells you how to do it right, so expect 
 less the Shaq-like percentages. 2K6 is better looking and more fun and exciting and having played 
 it right after Live, I was even more blown away by 2K6's graphics and became even more disappointed 
 in Live. 2K6 has a franchise mode, Live does not. 2K6 has better stat tracking and records all 
 types of interesting stats and tendencies that make you feel more connected to the experience. 
 Live just doesn't feel as complete as 2K6, as usual. There really is no reason to pick up Live 
 over 2K6 this year. To satisfy you curiosity rent it first, but I'd recommend that you buy 2K6 
 NOW!.

Review:  NBA Live 06 for the Xbox 360 is by far one the worst basketball games ever created. I could almost 
 live without the missing features, but the gameplay hasn't changed much. The absolute worst part 
 about this game is the camera angles. It doesn't matter how much you zoom in on a 57" HDTV, you 
 can still barley see the players on the opposite side of the court. The graphics are great, but 
 certainly not worth $60. I can't say that I would buy this game for $19.95. EA has a long way to 
 go to convince me to ever purchase another one of their basketball games. If this is next generation 
 basketball, I want no part of it. Save your money and either buy NBA 2k6 (and I am not a 2k fan, 
 but I own it also and it is much better if you have HDTV) or wait until NBA Live 07.

Review:  This game was not worth the wait at all. Its an arcadey basketball sim thats pretty to look at 
 but has absolutely no substance. The player animations are great individually but they just dont 
 blend well on the court. The player intros dont make a great game you know. The arenas look great 
 but theres just not enough good with this game to make it stand out. The lack of franchise mode 
 leaves you with nearly no replay value. However, if you're a diehard b-ball fan then you might 
 as well check out the game, i mean it can only get better right? And if you just want a good looking 
 basketball game that you can play with your friends and stare in awe at the dunks with, oh yeah 
 those are good too, then at least rent the game and enjoy the little there is to appreciate.

Review:  It's sad that EA put this game out. I don't care about dunk contests and three point shootouts, 
 but gameplay I gotta have. When the game first comes up it looks amazing. D Wade is there for you 
 to shoot with while you wait for the game to load. This, I thought was very cool. After that, it's 
 all crap. Sloppy graphics, game speed is way off, camera is too far away from the gameplay and 
 so on and so on. I know this is EA's first basketball game for 360 but at least give us something 
 that is worth playing. EA could have come to my home and hit me with a baseball bat over the head 
 and robbed me of my wallet, I wouldn't have felt any different than I do after spending $60 on 
 this game. Either way I got robbed. I'm going home tonight and hooking up my old XBOX and play 
 Live on it. Sad but true. By the way, WTF is with the free throw shooting? Garbage, Garbage, Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!

Review:  I got NBA Live06 for the Xbox360 on Launch date. I also got Madden and NBA 2K6. Let me tell you 
 NBA Live is the worse game Ive played in a very long time. What people are saying about the frame 
 rate is true. Its so slow and players move like they are in slow motion even on the highest settings. 
 I will say the graphics are nice and I actually like the commentary but I just cant get past the 
 game play and the movement. NBA 2K6 blows this version of LIVE away by miles, not even close.
 
  
  I took the game back to EBX today and traded it in for another game. I told the guy at the counter 
 that you will be getting a lot of NBA Lives back because of the game play. He laughed at me and 
 said look over here. When I looked there were already 5 other copies of NBA Live returned and 
 its only been 4 days since the 360 has been out. Do yourself a big favor and get NBA 2K6 if you 
 must have a Basketball game for your 360,
  its much more polished and a great basketball game to boot.

Review:  The fact makes the game the worst game..
  
  1) The frame rate is too know in a unacceptable stage where you cannot even to catch the right 
 time to ahoot the ball.. The whole game is lagging from the beginning to the end.
  
  2) The camera angle is sux.... move too slow which makes a fast break impossible... hard to see 
 what's going on in the far side of the court.
  
  3) Player model is great?? NOT AT ALL~~~~!!!!! just take a look of the players' arm... they are 
 impossiblly long which the scale of their arm to the body are scary... every player looks like 
 a monkey who get a long long arm.... ( take a look on Ben Wallace, his long arms make me laugh every 
 time)
  
  4) Lack of game modes.....
  
  Well, the 1) point was the most critical point, it makes it impossible to play.... actually i dont 
 care the player model or lack of game modes, because i am a nba live fans.... but this game really 
 disappointed me... i traded it in on the 2nd day for 2k6, and 2k6 is far better than live..... 
 i found no reason to purchase live06

Review:  I imagine EA games wanted to set this game up so everyone will have to purchase Live 2007. The 
 options are non-existant. No season to season play, no Career mode, no crib etc. I should have 
 bought NBA 2k6 or the normal XBOX version of the game as I prefer content over the graphics. If 
 all you want in this game is eye candy, it's for you, otherwise buy the other console version of 
 this game. What's dissapointing is I'm reading the same type of reviews for Madden 06 and Fifa 
 06. Which also leads me to believe college football and basketball will be lacking in game modes 
 also.

Review:  the graphics are amazing but the features, the coolness of the actual game, is gone in the xbox360 
 version: the dunk competition, the 3 point competition, the 1 on 1 competition, the time/score 
 based 1 on 1 dunk competition is all gone... the freestyle dunking, shooting, blocking, scoring 
 options are extremly awkward to put into play whish makes it less fun than it all ready is. the 
 game is now just plain, not that great to play, so, i don't recomend it, besides, if thers no special 
 features and 2k5 had a better rewiew then i would go for 2k5.... actually i am going for 2k5, i'm 
 gona go return that crapy NBA live 2006 game and get NBA 2K5 :D
  i don't recomend the game for ppl who really do like basketball games, and even if your new at 
 games, try it out then decide, don't buy it right away, like i did. (bad choice)

Review:  I preordered this game months ago because I always liked the live series more then 2k, then after 
 reading the reviews I was real nervous and even tried calling wal-mart to see if I could switch 
 games, but it had already shipped. So when it got here my expectations were low, but man was I 
 suprised. Graphically this game is very impressive and the commentary is alot better thent he 2k 
 series. The thing that really suprised me was the gameplay, its practially the same as live 2005, 
 but is that really a bad thing, that was my favorite game of the series up until now. The only 
 disapointing thing is franchise, but at least you know next year when they have everything its 
 going to be no doubt the best basketball game out there, even though I already think it is.

 saying bout the game but stop player hatting on NBA LIVE 06. the best thing about the game is the 
 freestyle with the player like steve nash can do his off the chain passing and kobe bryant can 
 do his shooting or go do the lane and dunk on some one in your way .And when you are playing around 
 in the gym you can pause the game and setup the team you want and the team you want to play aganist

 due to the lack of features and bad camera angles this game falls well short of what coulda been.... 
 EA hasnt made a good basketball game since live 98 and this is why from now on Im goin with Espn. i 
 dont really know what Ea's problems is but i dont think they really care what they do n e more. 
 they jus continue to throw out junk year in and year out. the madden on 360 lacked some features 
 also but it still played well and i enjoy it.. but Live lol.. its almost laughable out bad tha

 one of the worst hoops games on the market. Oh dont get me wronge here, it lookks crazzy for the 
 most part, if yoiu like monkey looking plaryers, and choppy animations. I love nba 2k6, but im not 
 a live basher, i played live for two weeks when it came out on the ps2, but then i bought nba 2k6 
 opn my xbox, lets just say live got sold. I would never pay 60 or even 30. Hell i dont even want 
 the game for free, this game is the first nextgen flop ive seen so far. The areeneas make this games 
 graphics stand out , but it takes more then that, nice try EA, but give up already. I mean they 
 bit 2k sports gameplay really hard on the ps2 and xbox live 06, just give up.

Review:  When I first got to the menu screen, I noticed that the text was to small for my taste. I litterally 
 had to squint to read the text. It is the same when your playing the game. The text on the score 
 board area is very small and hard to read. (It may be differant if I had a HD tv) Anyway the presentation 
 is great in the game. The announcing is great and probably the best that Ive ever seen. 
  Yes they cut out the slam dunk contest, but I never play that anyway because I found it boring. 
 So I wont miss that. But thats your call. 
  One thing that really botheres me is the freethrow shooting. It is the most diffucult thing in 
 the game. I think out of 20 freethrows im lucky if I make 5.
  You will like this game if you dont mind that the slam dunk contest is missing and the text is 
 small and the difficult free throw shooting. Maybe it takes time to learn, I dont know, but its 
 very fustrating. 
  Another problem is the camera angle. The far end of the court looks so far away. its hard to see 
 the players. Also they dont always pass to the person that I want it to go to. I cant tell you 
 how many back court violations I have had and that makes a user fustrated for sure because you 
 know you didn't want it to pass to that person.
  Overall i am happy with the game. the graphics are great the players look just like the person 
 in real life. The stadiums are great looking. Rent the game first if your not sure.

 made me feel like I'm really controlling a real NBA player until this game. Amazing graphics and 
 sound make this game more lifelike then any other sports game to date. The gameplay and animations 
 are great, not perfect but are very good especially for the first next gen live. Don't listen to 
 all the reviews on the net about this game, they are rediculous. This is hands down the best sports 
 game I have ever played, and I have played them all since the nintendo days. I am a hardcore NBA 
 fan and am very, very pleased with this game. You will not be dissapointed.

Review:  what an awful game for the so-called next gen. Looks sharp, plays pretty shocking. I reckon the xbox360 
 is looking pretty shaky. most the games are just ports from previous consoles and the originls arent 
 that good. PDZ is good and PGR3 is too. Only a couple of decent games after that. Anyone who hasnt 
 bought a 360. DONT!!!!! Thers less to play on this than previously. the same as FIFA Madden and Tiger 
 Woods EA is just ripping you off. Most games on the 360 have been rushed to make more money in time 
 for XMAS. just wait for the ps3 to come. Who needs Live if you got no good games to play on it!!

Review:  This game is really worth the 60 dollars it gets... Live 06 is the next gen of all sports games 
 futures... I was amazed by the graphics and detail of the players... Just the sweat dripping off 
 Garnett on the line is WoW!.!.! The sound in the game like the PA announcer sounding just like 
 the PA announcer is awesome... The NBA LIVE franchise is living up to what it always has! The game 
 has a solid sound projection... The lineup for the starters is like your in Madison Square Garden 
 actually sitting down in the courtside seat or watching the game from your living room couch. Live 
 06 out plays NBA 2k6 by far... The game is an instant 360 platinum classic. EA really knows what 
 their doing with the gameplay alone. The best thing about the game I would have to say is when 
 you see the lights turn on in the Arena when the game starts just the 360 view of the place is 
 unbelievable.

Review:  This game has many different features... Once the game loads you are practicing right away, and 
 can select a pick-up game from there, and while the pick-up game is still loading you are still 
 practicing!! You will see a lot of the players shots, and some awesome awesome graphics... go rent 
 this game now. You will have mixed reactions, it does have season mode but no franchise mode! Big 
 thumbs down EA but still this is better than any LIVE game I've played. I have not really gone 
 deep into this game since I got ripped off by Wal-Mart and got a CORE system, but none the less 
 it looks great.. I have a standard tv and it looks great, from the sweat to the jerseys boucing 
 around, to the hair moving.. its great. The sound is awesome when your team makes a big play the 
 crowd is roaring!! Some ok soundtracks and the commentary just might not say anything for about 
 1 minute. There is a lot of value for its first next-gen basketball game, so go on rent it first 
 or buy it.
  
  Final Verdict: 5.9 Mediocre
  Please remember rent it first!

Review:  Well The graphics are nice, thats really the only good point of the game. This game is a complete 
 downgrade of nba live 06 for the xbox or ps2. This game has basically been stripped of all the 
 extra game modes, and online game features that made this game fun. Ea did the same thing like 
 with they did with madden, they concentrated so hard on the graphics, then how the game played. 
 I do not pay 60 dollers for a graphic updates with less features then that of previous live games. 
 To top things off the Nba live series has never been about simulation, its all about this arcade 
 style of gameplay. If u want a true simulation then pick up nba 2k6 made by Espn. I was gonna say 
 this game was a disappointment, but I expected a product of this caliber from Ea.
  
  Honestly do not waste 60 dollers on just a graphics update, its not worth it.

 when you take out the best part of the game just so that you can have a loading screen u can play 
 on big whoop. I mean just look at it the gameplay looks like something out of sega. Then they get 
 rid of the only thing they had 2k didnt thats superstar, u would think they would just make that 
 better but no they take it out. Honestly what was EA thinking when they bring out a game with less 
 features then on the current gen system Plz bring back what we loved about the game.

 that everyone has been expecting for years... its just so realistic.. the graphics are absolutely 
 awesome.. the gameplay is a little slower but its for the better.. the features that have been 
 taken out have never been a highlight for me.. the season mode s just as good as the dynasty and 
 the all star weekend was pretty useless anyway.. in comparison to 2k6 this game looks about a 100 
 times better graphicswise and soundwise.. the gameplay in 2k6 is still a little bit better but 
 ITS THE X360.. WE WANT GRAPHICS.. and after playing both and previously being a 2k6 fan.. i must 
 say Live just took the lead.. definately a must buy on launch day.. (along with PDZ)

Review:  Played this game at my local Gamestop and I have to say..... The graphics in the game are ALL WORLD 
 . I have never seen anything that looks this tasty. The way the sweat works in this game is so 
 real its scary. It builds over time. The animations are crazy!!!. I did this dunk wit Lebron and 
 I thought I was still watchin him school the wizards a few days ago. The opening menu is nice too. 
 you can play a few seconds after you turn the game on. On the gameplay side of things. The controls 
 are really responnsive and feel right when you execute them. There are a couple of issues with 
 some of the jump shots you take but that aint nothing new with live. The experts who play live 
 know how to avoid that . All the talk of features being gone isnt a joke. No fanchise is really 
 dissapointing to me cause that was the only other thing I did other than take money from my freinds 
 and play online. No all star weekend is nothing to me . I did care for that anyway. Overall this 
 is would be the game I choose because it just looks awesome and I dont care for the missing elements 
 that much (except franchise)

Review:  I was highly disappointed in the PS2 version of LIVE. Then they came out with crap. It looks totally 
 awesome with no game play value. How does a game go from being the premier title of basketball 
 games to crap. I will explain this for you. EA has gotten complacent with the titles they bring 
 out. The look of a game is not always the greatest part of a game. We play games for game play 
 graphics add flavor that is it. When I first played the I was blown away with the look then I started 
 playing and laughed!! Can you say reverse. EA took a huge step back. I guess they thought since 
 they were the premier title basketball game that they can bring out crap and the people would still 
 buy it away. That is the definition of being complacent !!!!

Review:  They are a bunch of idiots that are users on gamespot. The reason being because they talk as If 
 they didn't play the game but come on the website and trash talk about it. Whoever had said NBA 
 Live 06 is a bad game must can't afford a Xbox 360. This game is the best sports game I've ever 
 played. Yes I know they no longer have freestyle superstars,3 point, dunk contest, dynasty mode 
 and salary caps. But this is a completely new console and understand they are working from the 
 GROUND UP. Actually some of these events are unnecessary such as freestyle superstars that made 
 Live 06 for the current gen terrible along with all buckets dropping. As others said it took the 
 fun out the game because the majority of the freestyle moves were unstoppable. Dunk Contest ,3 
 Point contest was amazing at first but then became extremely boring. Truth is those mini games are 
 for kids. I rather them work on the gameplay and make it great, than add a bunch of ridiculous 
 events that are not needed. NBA Live 06 for the next gen has made me overwhelmed.

Review:  This is by far the best b-ball game in history. It offers in depth and almost near realistic gameplay. 
 What more can you ask for. So there are somethings that are missing, but consider this the rebirth 
 to the best thing in sports entertainment. So as far as the competition is concerned, they are 
 both good games, but only one can win and it seems as if the one that i am writing for would by 
 far be the victor. Please if anything, buy this game, you will not be dissapointed. Oh yeah they 
 left out a dynasty mode, but i can say this. How many people can actually vibe with a dynasty mode 
 in basketball games, so for just that factor, thats no reason not to get it. Freestyle superstars 
 is gone, but to me that was a waste of time, because to many of the moves were unstopable and took 
 the fun out of the game, so who needs it anyways. As for the dunk contest, after the first time 
 its was great, then the second time, it was the same thing. So come on who really needs it anyways. 
 Enjoy and holla

Review:  This game was a total let down to me. I was expecting some decency out of EA since it "rebuilt" 
 for next-gen. I'm not gonna bash this game for not having features, there's plenty of people doing 
 that already so I think everyone gets the point. I'm gonna bash this game for being a disgrace 
 to the game of basketball and the fans who love the game. 
  
  The ball physics are totally disgusting. The most unrealistic I've seen in a basketball game in 
 years. The player models are NOT all that, I don't care who says what! Look at the screen shots 
 and judge for yourself! In one screen shot where T-Mac is taking a freethrow, his arms look bigger 
 than his fricken legs, his head, and almost his entire waist!!! Almost every player has gorilla 
 arms! You call these "the best player models" in any basketball game to date??!! PFFFSH!!! Yeah, 
 they are if you're living only in EA's world. Truly, what should be said is that these are the 
 best NBA player models to date in EA Sports history!
  
  The gameplay speaks for itself! In case some of you can't understand what it's really saying, I'll 
 translate it for you: "GARBAGE!!!"
  
  Camera angles are crap! Only one camera angle worth playing in and that is too far away to make 
 you feel like you're involved in the action on the court.
  
  Commentary is the best I've heard..... from EA, that is.
  
  The only good thing about Live is 
 the Arena atmosphere, the loading menu, and setting plays on the fly. Those goodies are not worth 
 $60. I'd say $20 bucks and you got yourself a customer, EA.

Review:  The New improved (well kInda well not really) Nba Live 06 for the 360 was a great dissapointment 
 this year. EA rushed on this game and made it worst. The player models are amazing i might say 
 but graphics dont make Gameplay which is the most important thing about a game but hey some Live 
 Fanboys dont know that. Here is a List with the problems of this game
  
  1. ASW is gone
  2. Dynasty Mode is Gone
  3. You got a season mode but no Salary Cap
  4. Possibly the loading 
 gameplay could be the best part of the game
  5. Camera is extrmely annoying is not fast enough to catch up with the game
  6. Live is like a 
 regular match nuttin special
  7. Freestyle Superstar thingy is gone
  8. nothing big but the Characters Sweat like there taking a shower
  9. You Pay more and Get A Lot 
 less
  
  I was looking forward to a Slam Dunk comp with these nice graphics but yet i cant really know that 
 now. Tim Tschirner says that they changed the camera views in this game to make it more realistic. 
 What they did was make it worse then what it was before. Freestyle Superstar mode thingy is also 
 gone so you cant do those flashy dunks anytime you want. It does happen sometime but that AI decision 
 as in the Computer not Allen Iverson.
  
  Well this is my review i could write more but i couldnt play enough of it all i know is this game 
 is not worth 60 and 50 possible a good 30 dollar title for what you get in this game. I am not 
 a 2k fanboy or an EA fanboy im am writing a review so dont get all dissapointed or offended.

Review:  I'm a fan of NBA Live and was a fan of the current gen release of this years game. I was really 
 looking forward to playing this game and doinga franchise and playing online. But Franchise wasn't 
 there, and other things as well. The Superstar abilities were a nice add on (though things could 
 get gay sometimes) , but they were gone from what I hear. I'm sure the gameplay itself is fine since 
 I don't mind the current gen gameplay and it looks close. Kudos to adding stamina to the game because 
 I'm sick of my friends only using one guy to play against me that never gets tired. 
  
  My complaint is that this game really seems more like a play with your friends kind of game. You 
 can't just sit down and enjoy it really yourself. Seasons are kinda lame unless you play with a 
 bunch of friends and do a fantasy draft (which I hear fantasy draft is not available in season 
 mode. I could be wrong) . Theres only really online mode left then, which is fine because I planned 
 to play online. But sixty dollars for season mode and online mode. I don't know man. Next year 
 when and if all the features are back, you can bet I'll be there waiting to get the game the day 
 it comes out because it will be amazing then.

Review:  This game is awesome. I purchased it for the 360 today along with Madden from my local Game Rush 
 Block Buster, then went to another game store with an Xbox kiosk and asked the manager to let me 
 test it out. He was very kind to let me do this. The next thing I know there is a crowd of people 
 around me just amazed at what they were seeing. One lady asked me "are you really controlling those 
 plalyers"? I've never seen a prettier game (besides Madden which I played next) . If this game gets 
 a bad rating don't trust the rating. The game is slowed down a little but it's for the better. 
 The dunks and animations are awesome. You will swear you are watching a real NBA game. The freestyle 
 controls are very tight and feel so natural in the game. The "R" button thorws olley- oops. The 
 "R" trigger is for Turbo. The player models are so detailed that you will even notice facial scruff 
 and don't get me started on the player models hair. Yes EA left out the dunk contest, three point 
 contest and other gameplay modes but for a first game on a new system they have really stepped 
 up their game. The sound is also great as the crowd will have you thinking you are really in the 
 arena. The attention to detail in each arena is just plain sick. I cannot wait to get my own 360 
 on Monday. I'm rating this game by what is actually in the game rather than the modes that are 
 missing like most company knuckle heads are doing. This game will have you hooked for quite somtime 
 to come. I love women but this game is just pure sexy.
