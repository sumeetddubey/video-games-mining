:::Review:::
It's all funny and little fun in this politics-themed party game. 

  When you first see the box art featuring a big-eared primate with a goofy smile jumping over a 
 cartoon White House, it's clear that Hail to the Chimp, "The Presidential Party Game," is all about 
 satire. What's not clear is exactly what sort of game you can expect, and this disparity is a good 
 metaphor for the game itself. Hail to the Chimp is so keenly focused on delivering humor that it 
 seems quite unconcerned with offering entertaining gameplay. After a few hours with the game, you'll 
 wonder if they should have just nixed the playable parts entirely.  

  The humor that was so clearly the focus of developer Wideload's efforts is Hail to the Chimp's 
 only redeeming feature. The title screen is a "live" broadcast of GRR news, the animal kingdom's 
 version of CNN, complete with scrolling headlines and hosted by the jaded, Cronkite-esque Woodchuck 
 Chumley. The stories and occasional advertisements that "air" on GRR skewer a wide range of American 
 institutions, including the government, the press, and all facets of pop culture. The breadth of 
 topics is impressive, despite the ostensible focus on politics, and jokes run the gamut from barely 
 groanworthy to incisively witty, though the scales definitely tip toward the former. GRR delivers 
 Hail to the Chimp's humor in a polished, varied way, and hearing headlines like "The Internet: 
 What is it and how is it ruining your children's lives?" and watching ads sponsored by The Plankton 
 Council is quite entertaining, at least until the content starts to repeat.  

           Teleports, treasure turtles, and tentacles will soon make things much more hectic.    
   

  Actual gameplay is far less entertaining, because it's light on humor and heavy on button-mashing. 
 Whether you choose single- or multiplayer, the game is the same. Four characters run around a wacky 
 arena grabbing clams, whacking opponents, and trying to accomplish whatever the particular game 
 mode demands. Clams represent votes (take that, money-grubbing political establishment!) and function 
 much like gold coins do in other games. Some modes require you to grab clams then deposit them 
 somewhere, while others demand you grab clams in a certain order. Whatever the mode, the game quickly 
 devolves into a chaotic clam-snatching clobberfest, which sounds fun but feels like nothing so 
 much as a subdued game of Hungry Hungry Hippos. Winning requires a bit of skill, a good deal of 
 luck, and a whole lot of patience, so victory is never very satisfying. Playing the single-player 
 mode will unlock more multiplayer arenas and On Demand GRR segments, but since these segments come 
 up in the title-screen rotation anyway, you're better off sparing yourself and your thumbs and 
 just setting the controller down. Playing with a few lively opponents can be fun, but the gameplay 
 is so lackluster that the fun doesn't last long.  

  Hail to the Chimp's unique cartoon look is another bright spot, albeit a small one. The stages 
 do tend to be busy with hazards, moving parts, clams, and power-ups, and keeping track of where 
 you are -- and whether or not you're alive -- is initially taxing. However, you'll likely get the hang 
 of it once you've got a few sessions under your belt, thanks to the bright, distinct player colors 
 and vivid character designs.  

  It's a shame that the gameplay doesn't live up to the respectable standards set by the humor and 
 visual appeal. Hail to the Chimp has some great chuckleworthy moments, but any enjoyment you get 
 from them will be sapped away as you play challenges that somehow manage to be frantic and dull 
 at the same time.

Review:  This is a party game. In my opinion, if you play this game alone, it is only half as fun as if 
 you are playing with friends or at a party. That is why it is called a party game. It would have 
 a 9 if more people played on xbox live. I can see how some people will love it and some people 
 will hate it. People who love shooters and other extremely violent games, or anything rated M, 
 and any other game than that is horrible, those people will hate it. They wont like it because 
 you don't shoot people in the face. Everyone else will like this game because it is fun for all 
 ages and can entertain a lot of people. The gameplay focuses around clams, which is a little odd, 
 but there is a lot of selection between what kind of games you can play and where you can play 
 them. The whole game has funny political humor too, that has actually made me laugh a few times. 
 Considering this game only costs 40 dollars instead of 60, I think that makes it a good deal. Those 
 aspects make this game completely enjoyable. As I said before, the only bad thing is lack of players 
 on xbox live. So if you like games other than shooters, and you don't care if you don't blow peoples' 
 heads off in this game, than you should get it.
