:::Review:::
Even if the new bells and whistles aren't enough to bring back established fans, this is still Lego 
 Star Wars at its finest. 

  LucasArts and Traveller's Tales happened upon an alchemical combination of nostalgia with the 2005 
 release of Lego Star Wars, a jovial action adventure game that mined a pan-generational affection 
 for both George Lucas' space opera and those colorful Danish building blocks. Its 2006 sequel was 
 better, largely because it was based on the original trilogy rather than the prequels. Now Traveller's 
 Tales has wrapped the contents of both games into a single package with Lego Star Wars: The Complete 
 Saga. That's a great deal of content, and if you haven't played either Lego Star Wars games, this 
 is a solid package made even better by improved graphics, new levels, and online cooperative play. 
 If you  have  played either Lego Star Wars games, though, you'll be getting a lot of recycled content 
 here, which makes The Complete Saga harder to recommend.  

           The Lego re-creation of the famous scene where Darth Vader says 'Sit on it, Potsie!'  
     

  The basic appeal of Lego Star Wars is that it lets you act out some of the more memorable Star 
 Wars moments with cute little Lego people, a concept that hits so many different nostalgia triggers 
 with such precision that it almost seems sinister. The game itself is an action adventure with 
 a heavy focus on puzzle-solving and cooperative play, often at the same time. You'll make your 
 way through the Naboo palace, the cloning facility on Kamino, the streets of Mos Eisley, the corridors 
 of the Death Star, and other distinct locales, with a small party of various characters in tow. 
 While there are literally dozens of characters that you can unlock and play as, they all fit neatly 
 into a few different character classes, each with unique and appropriate abilities.  

  Though you can control only one character at a time, you can switch between which character you're 
 controlling on the fly, and much of the game is deliberately designed to force you to switch back 
 and forth between characters often, making full use of their various abilities. Of course, all 
 the characters and vehicles, and large portions of the environments, are made out of Legos, which 
 creates a surreal, playful kind of aesthetic. It also figures into the gameplay pretty often, as 
 you often have to build objects to progress. The game breaks away from the action adventure format 
 on occasion for a vehicle sequence, such as the pod race from  The Phantom Menace  or the attacks 
 on the Death Star. They're rarely as polished or intuitive as the action when you're on foot, but 
 they work well enough and break up the action nicely.  

  The group-based format has always made Lego Star Wars ideal for playing with another person, and 
 in The Complete Saga for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, you can finally play the game cooperatively 
 over the Internet. This is far and away the most significant addition to this package, and it's 
 been nicely integrated, making it easy for another player to jump into the game at almost any point. 
 In addition to online play, The Complete Saga features a number of other upgrades, mostly pretty 
 minor. A few new gameplay sequences, such as the pursuit of bounty hunter Zam Wessell through Coruscant 
 from the beginning of  Attack of the Clones , have been added. Other sequences have been changed, 
 such as the gunship cavalry chapter near the end of  Attack of the Clones , which now has less 
 of a gun-blazing shooter feel and features some puzzle elements.  

           If you've played a Lego Star Wars game before, be prepared for some dj vu.      

 
  Since this is the first time the content from the original Lego Star Wars has appeared on current-generation 
 consoles, all of the visuals have been enhanced for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It makes the 
 whole game look about as good as Lego Star Wars II did when it was on the 360 last year, with sharper 
 textures, a nice plasticized shine on the characters, and loads of focus effects. Save for widescreen 
 support, the Wii version doesn't look much different from the original releases, nor does it make 
 much use of the system's motion controls. Without the improved graphics or the online play found 
 in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, The Complete Saga on the Wii is a bit less appealing. 

  Many of the changes and additions in The Complete Saga are the types that only those who've played 
 through Lego Star Wars I or II would notice, and that's the rub. For those who've already played 
 one of the Lego Star Wars games, a full half of what The Complete Saga has to offer will be recycled. 
 The online co-op play in the 360 and PS3 versions helps, since playing the game with another person 
 can change the dynamic and pacing of the game quite a bit, but otherwise it would be much more 
 cost-effective to just pick up a used copy of the one you haven't played.

Review:  Having already garnered much success with Lego Star Wars: The Video Game and Lego Star Wars II: 
 The Original Trilogy, developer Traveller's Tales has taken full advantage of the capabilities 
 of all the three next-generation consoles to add new characters, new levels and some fairly new 
 features to bring to you the most exciting LEGO game to date - LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga.
 
  
  So for the first time ever players can build and battle their way through the events of all six 
 Star Wars movies in one video game. 
  Despite it basically being Lego Star Wars: The Video Game and Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy 
 put together with a decent session of fine tuning, Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga offers tongue 
 in cheek humour and in many cases non-stop enjoyment.
  
  The gameplay hasn't been significantly improved since the launch of Lego Star Wars II: The Original 
 Trilogy in 2006 although new characters such as Zam Wessell, Watto and Boss Nass add to the untouchable 
 collection of 160 characters to contend with. 
  
  But what makes Lego Stars Wars: The Complete Saga a real family game is the puzzle solving. This 
 encourages creative thinking through the use of teamwork and unique building situations only possible 
 in a LEGO galaxy far, far away.
  
  New game features include enhanced Force powers, new power-ups and a new Challenge Mode. And, of 
 course, all the levels from the original Star Wars have been revamped to meet the high standards 
 set by this next-generation of gameplay.
  It's a fairy easy game to grasp. Scenarios get progressively harder, but children shouldn't find 
 it too taxing. And adults should whizz through quite quickly. The eternal quest for gamer points 
 will keep many coming back for more. 
  The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 also allows for new high-resolution LEGO models and characters, 
 along with new environment graphics and special effects.
  
  For anyone who has already enjoyed the first two LEGO Star Wars games this is the perfect way to 
 round off the collection even if it is slightly similar to the two previous titles. And for newcomers 
 this is a brilliant introduction to the weird and wonderfully wacky world of LEGO Star Wars.

Review:  Let me start off by saying that this is the best in the series. The graphics are awesome and the 
 on-line play is funner than I thought it would be. The problem is I've played the other two before 
 and that being said, it sucks some of the newness out of playing the levels over again. Yes they 
 mixed it up with some new levels and vastly improved graphics, but some of the magic is missing. 
 Anybody who hasn't played the last two games this is a must, if you can get past playing with LEGOs 
 again. That being said, this game is a worthy purchase in a lot of ways. The 1st is a great bang 
 for your buck. Now I seen it in the store for less then $20 and for a game like this that is surprisingly 
 deep, it's worth it. The levels are designed that you play most of them more than once because 
 yo need different characters to do different things, so the replay value is very high .

Review:  Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga is bascially two games in one, but with lots of new features 
 (characters, levels etc.) and a new co-op online mode. It's a good game, but not great. 
  
  Let's start with the flaws. This game is really fun when you still have missions or levels to beat, 
 but once you get all the characters and finish all levels, it gets extremely pointless and boring. 
 The characters are exciting when you first get them, but become lamer once you use them a bit. 
 The levels are very diverse. Some are tricky with puzzles that can confuse you enough to make you 
 insane, while others are ridicuously easy. The levels where you fly a starfighter aren't exciting 
 and does most of the driving for you. You just shoot randomly.
  
  But this game also has some decent features. It's two games in one, first of all. The fist game 
 in the series was based on Episodes I-III while the second was Episodes IV-VI. This game combines 
 the two of them and adds new levels, characters, collectibles, and features. The Complete Saga 
 is not available on the original Xbox or PS2, like the other games were. This game is available 
 for the PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS only. The PS3 version offers stunning graphics and a co-op free 
 online mode accesible through the PlayStation Network. The co-op mode lets you play through a mission 
 with someone else or just hang around the Cantina causing trouble. Of course, the game offers co-op 
 with a frined you may have over. You can team up with them and do many things. Plus you can easily 
 come up with a strategy with ease. 
  
  In conclusion, Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga is a good combo of two hits with new characters 
 and features, but gets boring once you finish it. My Rating: 7.5 out of 10

Review:  O. K When I bought the PS3 there was an offer, buy foru games and get one free, so I bought the 
 game and they gave me LEGO Star Wars for free, I went home tried the game and found it entrataining 
 for a little while, but after some time, got bored.
  The game offers a lot of characters that really offer diversity to the game, the problem? There 
 are only three types of characters when you narrow it down, the ones with close ranged weapons, 
 the ones with blasters and the droids, the last ones being just a step or two above useless.
  Even with its lack of variety for characters, at least you get to drive pods and spaceships, which 
 are very cool, for a while, but after doing the same thing over and over again it different places 
 with different ships, the game gets again boring.
  This is game is good for those times when you dont know what to play, and its much better than 
 the other two games, full of glitches that made some levels impossible. SO if your thinking of 
 buying a LEGO Star Wars game, I would recomend this one of the other two.
  But still... It would be better just to rent it for a few days than buying it.

Review:  This game is fun my second game one my PS3. My point? I find it funny some how when they die they 
 fall into lego pieces. The graphs look pretty good and this is the first lego star wars i ever 
 played and one of the bes experience I had in a while. Its REALLY fun with a friend trust me. GO 
 TO THE 2 PLAYER ARCADE MODE IT IS SO MUCH FUN!!! But in the single player mode the people that 
 are following you are just so STUPID!!! they just follow you. They attack a opponent and they don't 
 die. and most of the time they just block the shots. It gets annoying that you always have to kill 
 everyone buy your self when you have like 3 - 6 players with you. But yet its awesome still. I 
 like how they did the episodes. Each episodes were like levels and you have to beat like 6 parts 
 of the episode which was great idea. It was fun making your own character and putting them in the 
 levels also its cool to have like all the characters in the six movies in the game even if they 
 are useless. SO OVERALL a great game.

Review:  This game is a grower.
  
  I bought this when it first hit the shelves and I am still playing it a few months later. The simplistic 
 gameplay and great looks give this game an awesome replayability.
  
  Its great for kids and adults alike. I have had many hours of fun running through the story of 
 Star Wars and finding all the secrets in the nooks and crannies. The puzzles involved are pretty 
 simple but at the same time fun to complete.
  
  Within the game you will find yourself running from episode 1 all the way through to "The return 
 of the Jedi". You firstly assume the roles of the respective characters that appeared in those 
 movies until you complete the story. After this stage you can then run around the levels as whomever 
 you like unlocking content with which the original story characters could not unlock. There is 
 a combat arena style gameplay for fun and also pod racing among other things. Its highly fun to 
 just run around the levels collecting your coins to unlock more content. Its definately worth the 
 money for it and its a great little gem of a game.
  
  The comical value is also quite quirky and funny at times...
  
  I can't really say anything 
 bad about this game. It's pretty much all you would expect. Definately worth checking out!

Review:  If you've played either of the games on their own, you'll enjoy this. If you haven't played either, 
 you'll enjoy this. If you've played both games already, and collected everything there is, you 
 might want to skip it. Or you could be a dear, give both copies of the individual games to someone 
 who can't afford them, and buy this one, so that you have the whole shebang all in one snappy package.
 
  
  I fit into the last category, having owned and beaten both games previously, I was a little hesitant 
 to buy this one. But, there's a few new additions, including the challenge mode, a few extra levels, 
 and a few extra characters.
  
  I was skeptical, but I enjoyed going through the whole thing, collecting everything, just as much 
 the second time, as I did the first, maybe a little more, since combined, it seems like such a 
 greater feat.
  
  Lego Star Wars is one of the most accessible platformers around and I think you'd be hard pressed 
 not to find yourself having a good time building Lego in a galaxy far far away.

Review:  I picked up Lego Star Wars on a whim. I've never played any of the previous versions so it was 
 all new to me, and I found it to be an entertaining distraction that was very easy to just pick 
 up and play.
  
  Graphically it's not a monster, but you don't expect it to be. The environments are crisp cartoony 
 versions of their big screen selves, and you occasionally get a good laugh or have a nostalgia 
 moment.
  
  The gameplay is fun, quick, and mindless. Just smash stuff while getting from point A to point 
 B. Pretty simple. The puzzles are usually easy. You can't really run out of lives, though it is 
 annoying to lose all of your little coin/cogs.
  
  As far as story goes, you're pretty much expected to know what happened already. None of the characters 
 speak, but since I already knew the story, that wasn't really a problem with me. And I was pretty 
 entertained by the scenes where something off the wall occurs.
  
  Overall not in the running for game of the year, but a thoughtful, humor filled time consumer.

Review:  Well here we are, no more Lego Star Wars for us.....
  
  Now if you have played Lego Star Wars 1 or 2, this game will not really surprise you much since 
 it's basically those games with extra content and some prettier levels
  
  But that ain't bad, the Lego formula fits well with Star Wars one and the extra stuff added here 
 fits well in. The character roaster is really impressive, with new characters such as Watto and 
 Zam Wessel now available for you to use and both the old and the new roasters ready for you to 
 unlock them
  
  The Bounty Hunter mission are present here along with about every secret from the first 2 games 
 and a little more secrets like the blue minikits (which only annoy me, but i guess they helped 
 someone play this game a few extra hours) and those are horror to catch
  
  Well this is Lego Star Wars, so when you die you only loose money which there's endless amounts 
 of everywhere, so it's not really a challenging game, just a game that likes to make things long 
 and simple
  
  If you are really considering to buy this game, I'd tell you to go ahead right now and buy it, 
 it's a fine time killer and a nasty one too, but if you are only reading this review because you 
 are bored, I think you should go find a copy of this game in a few days or so, just to make sure 
 you won't be bored and you won't read these random reviews on Gamespot
  
  This is a game for every Lego and Star Wars fan to enjoy, not so sure about other people though.... 
 I hope you will get it or you have it and you enjoy it as much as I did (BTW, though it's not hard, 
 it can take you a long time to complete this game 100%)

Review:  This isn't my first lego game, I bought Lego Star Wars 1 and 2 before and I loved them, so I knew 
 what to suspect from this game. Even though this is pretty much the same thing as Lego Star Wars 
 1 and 2, but i still loved it, and now it is in HD for the first time making it look a lot better. 
 One good thing i liked about this game was that they added blue mini kits, a new level, and most 
 importantly, the first three episodes are actually challenging, because in the first Lego Star 
 Wars, the mini kits were so easy to find and the characters were cheap. Probably the best addition 
 to this series is online play, if you want to play with a friend but he can't come to your house, 
 just play online it is a lot of fun. If you are a kid and you like lego, this one is a no brainer, 
 even if you don't like lego you should at least rent it because it is a lot of fun.

Review:  this game is very fun to play over and over. while its not a very complicated game it is very enjoyable 
 for all ages spanning over all 6 star wars movies and a vast collection of characters for u to 
 mix and match including a create ur own lego character. the games stages are great in length the 
 graphics are excellent considering the whole game is made of legos. and u can also play online 
 with a partner and use ur headset or with a friend. its not very difficult to beat this game but 
 it has good replay value and some cool unlockables like storm troopers with carrots instead of 
 guns its funny to see them chase after u with carrots or chewbacca caring c3po on his back like 
 in the movie. so for anyone who likes legos or star wars or both i recommend this game its just 
 plain fun for the whole family!

Review:  Lego Starwars is the first in a series of games from George Lucas. If you've never played the previous 
 Lego Starwars like me, then this game is a treat for you. Starwars sound track? Check. Every character 
 imaginable from all six movies? Check. Humor? Check but a little to much.
  
  Controls are simple but fluid, with attacks that vary depending on which character your playing 
 as. Each character does come with his or her own group of special abilities when it comes to the 
 environment your in. People with guns can grapple, Jedi's can move stuff with the force, droids 
 can unlock objects or doors. It all works well for replay value.
  
  Sound is well done, but lack of voice acting is sad.
  
  I would almost consider this game for 
 $39.99. Though it was great family fun.
  
  Online and offline co-op is the jewel of Starwars complete saga. I just doesn't seam as much fun 
 playing alone. It's definetly a must have game for couples who enjoy playing games togather and 
 Starwars.

Review:  Gameplay 7
  The great thing about Lego Star Wars is that you can easily pick up and play, and makes initial 
 gameplay very fun. But soon you'll find the difficulty not posing a problem at all, as whenever 
 you die, you instantly respawn to the exact location, which makes the already easy bots to kill, 
 that much easier, which makes gameplay at some parts more of a chore then anything.
  
  Story 7.5
  It follows the Star Wars storyline amazingly well, it just lacks depth. Though there 
 is no voice acting, the comedy within Lego Star Wars can be hilarious, which arguably makes up 
 for it.
  
  Graphics 7
  The Lego characters do look stylish, and resembles real Lego blocks very well. But the lack of 
 detail, which was done on purpose I would imagine, still makes 7 the maximum score it can achieve 
 in this category.
  
  Multiplayer 6
  It does have multiplayer, but it's very limited. You can play with a friend online, and play out 
 the story as you wish, but the real fun to be had is by hooking up another controller and playing 
 with a friend next to you. I would actually recommend doing this, as it's the most fun that can 
 be had out of this game.
  
  Length 8
  Thanks to being the last two, rather short, Lego Star Wars games combined, you can get a reasonable 
 7-8 hours out of playing through the storyline alone. There is a lot of re-playability to be had, 
 with tasks such as finding hidden vehicle blocks and collecting a certain amount of Lego pieces, 
 throughout each level, among other harder tasks.
  
  
  It's a fun game, though that may lack challenge and depth, has a brilliant charm, hilarious cutscenes 
 and fun co-op play to make up for it, which earns Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga a solid 7.5.

Review:  i bought this game a while back and sold it 1/2 weeks later,
  i think its absoulute rubbish but thats my own opinion i thinks its exactly the same as the others 
 apart from a frew things nothing special,
  i also find the game very very easy, and i aint a good gamer im ok but even my four year old cousin 
 got bored and believe me he loves lego and starwars,
  i was so dissapointed with this game,
  personally i hate the way when you die you just respawn 
 meaning your really cant fail, i think you just lose coins and thats it
  although the humour in this game is quite funny, which lego has done well,
  but if you havent 
 play starwars before then it could be a lot of fun but personally no thanks.....
  they have brought in new vehicle driving ,but i dont like the camera angle on it.
  i spose i 
 have been harsh in this review but if you havent played star wars before there are a lot of good 
 things, you can buy characters for free play its a great laugh if you have another player ,playering 
 with you the gameplay is quite good but could be made easily better,
  thanks for reading, please give me feedback

Review:  I first was thinking along the lines of rating this game better than Lego indiana Jones but I feel 
 more interested in Lego indiana jones for some reason now. However I do preffer Lego star wars 
 for the amount of characters involved. The amount of levels and the amount of extras also.
  And of course its so funny and good fun collecting Studs to buy new characters and finding all 
 of the mini kits to complete the game with a 100% can be hard but entertaining, sice the puzzles 
 are so unique and the player will so want to know whats behind the secret bonus doors.
  If you have previously bought Lego star wars Episodes 1-3 and the original trilogy then there is 
 not much point in getting the complete saga since its got all the same levels, but obviously not 
 all the bonus levels.0
  However if you did want to get this game but have the previous versions then I would recommend 
 trading them in at your local Game store and use the trade credit to get the Complete saga or sell 
 them on ebay.
  My overall rating is 7.5/10
  entertaing but its basically the old star wars lego games and its more for younger people.

Review:  This is a really great game. Being a fan of both Lego and Star Wars (and so is my son) , this is 
 a nice way to combine both of them in yet another exiting and very interactive form) .
  The graphics and sound effects are excellent and the story-lines can easily be recognized and connected 
 to. For die hard gamers, this is a bit easy, but I just love playing this with my son. One aspect 
 of the game that could be improved, would be to have the characters speak up more during the game 
 sequences and even during the clips (even actual dialogs from the movies) . Now it is mostly limited 
 to grunts and sighs. There are some, but there could be a lot more.
  In short... excellent game and well worth its money. I hope there is more stuff like this coming 
 and it has me looking out for the Lego Indiana Jones game.
  But we're definitely not yet done with this one, because there are lots of other things to still 
 be discovered and enjoyed.

Review:  The idea was simple, yet brilliant. Combine the two greatest things in the world in one powerful 
 video game; Legos and Star Wars. The complete collection gives players a wild ride through six 
 episodes plus bonus levels. The drop out co-op mode makes it a great game to play while your ladies 
 come and go. After I beat all the levels I had to find out what happens when you collect all the 
 gold bricks. I spent many hours collecting gold bricks and when I finally got the last one I saw 
 the coolest prize in the video game world. The graphics are amazing, I feel like I'm playing with 
 real legos when I play. The selection of characters to choose from makes sure you will never get 
 bored. Even after I collected all the gold bricks I still play the game with hopes of getting 100% 
 completion. I love it!

Review:  For those of you looking to reclaim the feeling you used to get playing TMNT: Turtles in Time on 
 your Super Nintendo with a friend, here it is. 
  
  This is a great game to play whether you have a friend to play with or not, but co-op is really 
 where it's at. There is a good mix of action in this game to lightsaber or blast your way through. 
 Also some fun puzzle solving elements that sometimes require 2 or more characters to accomplish. 
 This is where having a human partner really comes in handy.
  
  This game is full of unlockables and treasures. So much in fact you will most likely spend more 
 time trying to find everything than actually just playing through the game. Replay value is pretty 
 high due to these additions. 
  
  Having never played any other Lego Star Wars game, I can't compare this to it's predecessors, but 
 I would say it stacks up very well among any other co-op game I have ever played.
  
  The casual gameplay feel also adds to the ability to have fun with it. No matter what your skill 
 level this game will be easy to play. You could have a game with Grandma if you wanted to. 
  
  This game isn't without it's down sides though. It can be frustrating at times when it can 
 be easier to hit your partner than an enemy. Bad camera angles can lead to falling off an edge 
 or an annoying respawn somewhere you don't want to be, and finally maybe the most frustrating thing 
 is that the online co-op promised simply doesn't work for the majority of people. But, if your 
 looking to have fun with a friend, spouse, parent, or grandparent this is the game for you.

Review:  Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga is a bit like TV 4 series boxset, all separate 4 DVDs in one 
 box. But that doesn't mean Next-Gen owners and those who haven't played the Lego Star Wars games 
 shouldn't buy it.
  
  If you don't know the story of Star Wars, have you been living under a rock? in the game, you get 
 to play all the Episodes. You start trying to negotiate with the Trade Federation and end blowing 
 up the Second Death Star.
  
  In the game, you play as Jedis, Blaster characters, Droids, Bounty Hunters and small characters. 
 Each one has a special skill that helps you access secret areas. To get new characters you need 
 to collect different coloured Lego studs. Each level has 10 Lego canister which make a Lego mini-version 
 of Star Wars vehicles and a red brick which unlocks special abilities like Invincibility and Moustaches 
 for you to buy.
  
  The graphics are excellent, Lego characters shine, floors reflect and the areas can be quite realistic. 
 The Sound Effects are amazing, you'll love hearing every blast, swoop and beep-beep. And hear the 
 ground braking music of Star Wars, composed by John Williams.
  
  Also if you prefered Lego Star Wars 2 to the first , then you like this. The first 3 episode have 
 be redesign to resemble the sequel with new areas and whatnot.
  
  Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga is an awesome game, with so much to do you'll be on it for a 
 long time. There is nothing new here but that doesn't me it's still isn't enjoyable.

Review:  To be honest, this game is really not that good for an adult. It's action is simplistic, humour 
 is shallow, gameplay repetitive, and so on.
  
  However, if you love star wars, and played with LEGOs while a child, you'll immediately fall in 
 love with this game. Watching little animated LEGO characters portaying the most famous star wars 
 scenes is just endearing and the colourful and detailed graphics really make it look like we're 
 seeing LEGOs and not videogame graphics.
  
  The game allows you to play through the six episodes of the star wars saga, playing with many different 
 characters and vehicles. However, that's not even half of the game, since there are hundreds of 
 new things to unlock like unique chracters, vehicles and special abilities. You can even combine 
 different characters to make all new ones. 
  
  For children, the game is extremely fun and the puzzles actually are quite positive for their learning 
 with simple but focused reasoning involved and a focus on team work.
  
  Sound is basically lifted from the films, both music and FX, but that makes it even more fun to 
 watch the scenes played out by LEGOs.
  
  If you have kids and want a game for them, this is perfect. If you're an adult nostalgic star wars 
 and LEGO fan, this is also for you.

Review:  I bought this game for my girlfriend and we have had a blast playing this. Great Lego action with 
 some silly things thrown in here and there. Doesn't have the best visuals ( Hey its Legos!) but 
 its a blast to play. The Co-op is fun although the AI can be a pain and the camera angle can get 
 in the way at times causing someone to die or fall off the side. Replay value seems moderate as 
 there are tons of things to collect and unlock, such as characters from all 6 movies and lego pieces 
 to collect though each level to build a lego vehicle. As well as create your own lego guy to play 
 through.
  
  Its Star Wars and Legos what is not to like about this? I would recommend picking this up for your 
 lady or kids or just any Star Wars buff that just wants something to kill time with.

Review:  Lego Star Wars has been a great franchise ever since the first one, so why not release it on the 
 next gen consoles? I've got a few good reasons: To start, the graphics were possibly better in 
 the first game! Maybe it's because they're using the same engine still? Second, it hasn't really 
 changed much, actually, while I was playing, I forgot I was playing the Complete Saga and thought 
 I was playing the first again! It's like playing through the same game again! Level design has 
 barely changed at all, the bigggest difference is probably the change to some of the ship levels. 
 Third, it's still too easy! All dying does is make you lose studs, which you can easily pick back 
 up again! Yup, piece of cake.
  But it is easy to pick up and play, since it's controls are so easy and fun. Also, something that 
 the game still has is the sense of humor that we've come to expect from a Lego Star Wars game. 
 (Maybe it's because all the cinematics are the same as before) But still, that might not be a bad 
 thing. Also, this game has like over 100 characters to choose from, which make's the game a lot 
 more fun, because as you unlock new characters, you get new pieces for your character creator, 
 which I'll tell you about now.
  The character creator is as fun as ever, and now it has some new parts to make it better! Something 
 wrong with the character creator however, is you can only play as your characters when you're in 
 free play mode in a level, which is bad if you want to control your characters around the cantina. 
 On a completely different note, there are still lot's of extras to choose from, but it suffers 
 from a lack of explaination. If you don't know what I'm talking about, I'll tell you, if you buy 
 an extra like, I don't know... maybe... Poo Money? You may never find out what it does because 
 theres nothing that tells you. (I still don't know what that extra does!)
  Now, something that Lego Star Wars is famous for is it's awesome co-op mode, because it's so easy 
 to join in and drop out, which is fun in tough situations. There are also lot's of little hidden 
 things throughout the game such as cars that you can build, then you get to drive them around levels. 
 (Sometimes even to the end!) My sister and I still have trouble deciding who get's to drive the 
 car. Lego Star Wars is a really good game, although something I just remembered is that if you 
 found the minikits in the other games, then you'll know where they are now. Anyway, it's probably 
 a better game if you haven't played the others, because if you have played the others then this 
 will seem too similar. 
  
  Pros: Good sense of humor. Descent length. New characters keep the game interesting. The character 
 creator returns. A butt load of extras that will keep you occupied.
  
  Cons: Nothing explaining what the extras do. Some new levels aren't as good as you'd expect. Too 
 similar to the previous games. Graphics aren't very next gen.
  
  I give it a 7.5/10 because it's a good game but it hasn't changed enough.

Review:  Well, this being the first Lego star wars game I have played I will just go straight to the review....
 
  
  Well, as soon as you start the story mode you will see how great the graphics look. The game starts 
 you in a lobby well there are lego characters, a small counter to buy stuff, rooms full of levels, 
 and extra places just to explore. Everything in their looks great but where the graphics really 
 shine at are at the cut scenes. The cut scenes look amazing and and everything is well detailed. 
 The textures, models, and everythign else just look great. I think they have out done their selves 
 doing the graphics.
  
  Well, in the lobby you can go to rooms where their are doors with numbers on top of them. Some will 
 be locked some will be open. If you go to one that is open it will start off with the story of whats 
 going to happen. Whats cool about that is that the story is the loading time. so as soon as you 
 read that you can start right away. Every level has a story and theres over a 100 levels. Every time 
 you complete a level you unlock free play where you can replay the level with any character. Which 
 is good because you cant enter some places with out a certain character. The places you cant go 
 to are places full of extra stuff lie coins, parts, or other unlockables. Once you finish a whole 
 story you unlock challange which is the same thing but a little harder. As soons as you finish 
 a level it tells you if your a true jedi (depends if you got enough coins) , the parts you collected, and 
 some other stuff you can collect during a level. Each level is about 15-20 minutes long. The animations 
 in each level are wordless but pretty funny.
  
  The actual gameplay is an action adventure with alot of puzzles mixed in. There are over 70 lego 
 characters and alot of them have their own diffrent gameplay. Some can jump higher then other, some 
 have guns others have swords, some can use hooks, and some are slower then others. The gun combat 
 is pretty good you shoot and most of the time it knows where your shooting at and hits their. The 
 sword gameplay is good and effective since you can reflect bullets with it. The puzzle elements 
 are based on lego elements. You build stuff with legos, you move legos around, and just do these whacky 
 things with legos. The computer teamates are good at puzzle solving but act dumb while fighting. The 
 boss fights are cool but could get repetive. Their are sequences where you ride a ship and have 
 to use ship gameplay to pass a level. when you shoot stuff are use the force most of the tiem you 
 will get coins for it. Coins are too easy to get but at the same time to easy to lose. Everytime 
 you die you lose coins and they dissapear in like 5 seconds. If you dont even care about coins then 
 their isnt no dealth penatalty for you. All together the contolls are very good and tight.
  
  The sound is very good and I don't think anything is wrong with it. Their is a lot of lasting 
 appeal in this game due to alot of unlockables like extra  
 alot of other stuff. Their is co-op offline and online and it works very well and is alot funner. 
 So alltogether this is a very enjoyable tittle it has lots of lasting appeal, great graphics, and 
 fun gameplay.

Review:  We had Lego Star Wars I and II for the XBOX and they both were a big hit with the kids. I recently 
 purchased a PS3, so I was happy to see I could get both on a single disk for my PS3. From what 
 I can tell the graphics have been given an upgrade and look pretty sharp on my HDTV. There are 
 also some new vehicles and creatures, but 95% of it is the same as the originals, but more polished. 
 
  
  If you a new to Lego Star Wars then you definitely want to purchase "The Complete Saga". This game 
 is destined to be a classic and a must have for any game console.

Review:  For someone who's played the first two, there is very little new material at all here, except for 
 redesigned levels and some new features.
  
  That isn't the best way to get you to buy a game, but it's true. There's no denying it. You get 
 some sequals, and you think, "Hold on, this is the same as the last one!" Obviously, whenever we 
 say this, we are exaggerating, however with Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, you'd be hitting 
 the point spot on.
  
  There is NO WAY you could say it's any worse than the last two. Everything has been improved, so, 
 here are the new features:
  
  ONLINE: Great fun, being able to play online, especially as you can meet other people who love 
 the little pieces of Dutch plastic!
  
  GRAPHICS: Obviously improved, now it looks like you really are playing with LEGO, and not just 
 plastic bricks! Oh, wait, they're the same thing...
  
  TWO-PLAYER: You can now go head to head in duals, which is great fun!
  
  Apart from that... 
 nothing much is new. But don't let you put it off!
  
  Get this if you've never played them, or if you've played them to death. But whatever you do, trade 
 in the first two, you won't want to play them after this!!!!!!
