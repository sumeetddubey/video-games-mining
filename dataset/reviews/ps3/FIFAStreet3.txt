:::Review:::
FIFA Street 3 has plenty of style but not quite enough substance to justify the price of admission. 
 

  In the world of FIFA Street, soccer isn't just about scoring more goals than your opponent; it's 
 about humiliating your opponent at every opportunity. FIFA Street 3 from EA Sports Big pits teams 
 of both contemporary and classic soccer stars against each other in matches played all over the 
 world, taking in some unusual locations that have an impact on the gameplay along the way. The 
 action is fast-paced and fun for a while, especially when you pit your skills against other players', 
 but the single-player options are very limited and the absence of a team-building career mode is 
 disappointing.  

  FIFA Street 3 makes a great first impression; the menus are slick, the licensed soundtrack of more 
 than 30 songs is a perfect fit, and the colorful cartoon art style works really well. Well over 
 200 soccer stars appear as playable caricatures in FIFA Street 3, and they look great running around 
 the game's seven different locations. There's no end-to-end camera option from which to view the 
 action unfortunately, which is fine if you're used to playing traditional soccer games horizontally, 
 but odd given that it was the default view in FIFA Street 2. Locations in FIFA Street 3 include 
 a beachside parking lot, a playground, an oil rig, and a Tokyo rooftop among others, and each of 
 them offers a slightly different experience. Every playing field in FIFA Street 3 is enclosed by 
 walls or fences of some kind, but because those walls and fences vary so much in height and design, 
 they impact the gameplay. The ball is less likely to go out of play if the field is enclosed by 
 tall walls with no windows cut into them, for example, and you can bounce the ball off walls and 
 fences to perform some unorthodox tricks and passes.  

           Each of the seven locales offers a slightly different experience.      

  There's no 
 shortage of spectacular moves to perform in FIFA Street 3, but you might be surprised to learn 
 that the game actually downplays these in favor of realism for the most part. Few of the tricks 
 that you perform using the right analog stick would look horribly out of place during a regular 
 soccer match if they were performed far less frequently, and it's really only while in gamebreaker 
 mode or when running up and along walls that some of the moves border on unbelievable. With that 
 said, FIFA Street 3 fudges its ball physics pretty frequently. It's not nearly as noticeable as 
 it has been in previous entries in the series, but there are definitely occasions when the ball 
 appears to have a mind of its own and seems more concerned with making a trick animation work than 
 with behaving convincingly. The same can be said of players falling victim to tricks, since they're 
 sometimes required to spread their legs apart or even stumble to the ground for the canned two-character 
 animations to work. The tricks look good, but it's frustrating to have one of your players be taken 
 out of your control just so he can get beaten.  

  Unlike previous FIFA Street games, the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of FIFA Street 3 don't award you 
 points for performing tricks or for beating opponents. As a result, there are no matches in which 
 the winner is determined by the number of trick points scored. This is unfortunate given the lack 
 of variety on offer here, because while there are some different rules you can play by, your objective 
 is always to score more goals than your opponent. Matches in which you can score only with headers 
 or volleys, or in which gamebreakers aren't permitted don't really do enough to keep things interesting 
 for long, and matches without time limits can be painful if you're up against tough opposition. 
 For example, matches typically last between five and 10 minutes, but the final match of the single-player 
 street challenge mode -- in which you have to score eight gamebreakers against a team of classic 
 all-star players -- took us almost 45 minutes to win.  

  If you're playing FIFA Street 3 solo, the street challenge mode is the only option you have other 
 than setting up individual matches. Rather than being sorted by country, the players in street 
 challenge mode are grouped into teams that are themed after their play styles, their builds, and 
 even by the brands that they're affiliated with. You can unlock 25 of these teams as you progress 
 through the mode's 30-plus challenges, and then they're available for use in multiplayer games. 
 The difficulty curve in street challenge mode is nigh on perfect, though even the artificial intelligence 
 of the toughest teams you come up against can be exploited to some extent. Having your defensive 
 players pass the ball around among themselves at the back while your opponents' gamebreaker bar 
 ticks down and only one of them attempts to retrieve the ball is easy to do, for example.      
     Gamebreakers don't guarantee goals, but they make scoring a lot easier.      

  Multiplayer competition is where FIFA Street 3 is at its best. Both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 
 3 versions support up to eight players online, and on a single console they support four and seven 
 players, respectively. Multiplayer options include all of the same match types that feature in 
 the street challenge mode, as well as a fun "playground picks" mode in which both team captains 
 take it in turns to choose a player from the same national squad to form their five-man team before 
 kickoff. When playing online there's also a "world challenge" mode in which results from players 
 using the 18 national teams featured in the game are used to generate a league table of sorts. 
 Searching for opponents online rarely took us more than a few minutes, though using the filter 
 to find players of a similar skill level often just presented us with a message stating that no 
 matches could be found. Very few of the matches that we played suffered from any lag, and even 
 when they did it wasn't enough to be detrimental to the gameplay.  

  In case you're wondering about the differences between the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of FIFA Street 
 3, there really aren't many. The PS3 version's player models have jagged edges where their Xbox 
 360 counterparts are pretty smooth, and we noticed a couple of stutters in the frame rate on the 
 PS3; but they're essentially the same game. The Xbox 360 version features achievement points, of 
 course, and to earn the full 1,000 you'll have to prove yourself in street challenge mode, online, 
 and against at least one other player on the same console.  

  FIFA Street 3 plays a more enjoyable game of street soccer than any of its predecessors, but the 
 lack of anything resembling a career mode with player and team progression really hurts the single-player 
 experience. This year's game ultimately marks an unfortunate victory for style over substance, 
 but at least it was a close contest.

Review:  From Fifa Street 2 on the legendary PS2 ,I felt there was something really enjoyable with street 
 soccer games and now Fifa Street 3, with all the deficiencies in this game, it's a game that shouldn't 
 leave the parties alone thanks to a great multiplayer ,fantastic graphics and gameplay but with 
 some infirmities like bad single mode that have been made many of gamers underrate this game. I 
 believe it's not a masterpiece but why we just leave the influences behind after being inflamed 
 of infirmities? alright .talk about the game. the best thing in this game is the graphics .it's 
 not realistic and has not made to be .all of the game's things like players ,events and anything 
 else is like 3D cartoon animations but they'll bring you a lot of fun if you play online or with 
 your partner and friends .the music of this game is really good to enjoy the game and the sounds 
 are really hale as they supposed to be. Gameplay is as good as the past one and you can do many 
 different tricks in the game that you couldn't do in the past one like run along the walls just 
 like Prince Of Persia series ! last thing, if you are a single player and often play single or 
 don't have a partner to play, it's just wasting money but if you like to have a fantastic time 
 with friends, don't miss it because this is what you want!

Review:  
  We played fifa (professtional series) , pro evolution (winning eleven series) and some other soccer 
 (football) games and in them we experianced the same casual done-this-been-theremoment... 
 you know same old professional restricted gameplay type . 
  
  Well , in this game you have whatever you wana do , play dirty , professionally , tricky , humilately 
 .. ect . as the old same previous fifa street games. However , this one really adds more nowaday's 
 tricks and they're really fun to watch the players doing-it with Flexibility , realisticly kind 
 of way and plus you even have the ability to manage your moves while you're among the other team 
 players and direct them to avoid any tackles ... it really works perfectly right. 
  
  I know you can dribble , do tricks and stuff in the Professional series soccer games but in this 
 one you really have the fun feeling while you're dribbling not like PES08 which high-up your stress 
 while you're roamimg among the other team. 
  
  
  Wondering about the score ? (7.5)
  
  The graphics is unacceptable for me .. personally. Hell , gamespot gave it 6.5 and the graphics 
 is one of the good's in their list !? :S i dont get it so i refered my claim as an opinoin ; the 
 players looks so unrealistic in all ways body shape , face, .. ect. the graphics is fine for most 
 People i guess, so its not an issue if you only care about the gamplay... which what helped this 
 game for not getting 4.0\10 . 
  
  
  Conclusion : 
  
  *Buying it = Fun and wont regret it if you're a soccer fan. 
  
  *Not buying it = Maybe not 
 a smart move , espeacially when its so cheap now (24-17$) .
  
  *Renting it : Fair enough.

Review:  it's one of those games were you just can't sit there by yourself and expect great entertainment. 
 When playing 'Fifa Street 3' you will have those once in a while moments when you feel undefeatable 
 and lost in the game, so you score the winning goal in a stunning 'backflip off a wall pass' and 
 then your most beloved team player does a patriotic header, we all jump up in praise.....
  
  This is definitely a loner game when playing by yourself, but i have to say, the multiplayer 
 is a section of the game that is built for social events, such as, family reunions, sleepovers, 
 or just a game for you and your friend. 
  
  Though i have to say, with the awesome soundtrack that really increases your adrenaline, sometimes 
 you will find yourself standing up saying, "GOGOGOGO!", "SHOOOOOOOT IT!". The game can become intense 
 at times, but it only last's about 5 - 15 minutes by yourself.
  
  Overall I think this game is good for young kiddies looking for easy and quick entertainment and 
 wanting to feel like a rebel/ teenager with the 'street' setting.
  
  ENJOY THE GAME AS BEST YOU CAN!

Review:  Fifa Street 3: Review
  
  First of all i must say that being a big fan of the Fifa Football (soccer) series myself i was 
 very impressed by the way that this game turned out.
  
  
  The Attributes: 
  
  The first attribute that im going to make about this game is the use of 3D graphics which made 
 the game seem all that more real.
  
  The second attribute im going to make about this game is the amount of skill that one player can 
 do at any time during a match, (which is definitely a step up from the skill that is usable in Fifa 
 08.
  
  The third and final attribute im going to make about this game is the way that the game developers 
 have spent a lot of time on the background graphics e. g. (beach arena, shipping yard) as well as 
 spending time on perfecting the player realism. 
  
  
  The Downsides:
  
  The first thing i must point out about this game is that there realy is not alot to do, i mean 
 once you have completed all the challenges (which are pretty easy) your stuck eaither replaying 
 the same challenges over and over again, just playing friendly or going on line.
  
  The second downside to the game is the challenges, as i metioned before mos of the challenges are 
 pretty easy and that aside almost all of the challenges are, well, the same so it gets realy repetitive 
 and boring.
  
  The last downside to the game is that you cant even make your own players so using the same people 
 all the time is a bit boring, (at least you can make players in Fifa 08)
  
  
  All in all i would say that this game is worth buying for fans of the Fifa series, but other people 
 would most probably enjoy it to. 
  
  But one word of warning don't play the game for an extended amount of time otherwise it can get 
 a bit boring.

Review:  Just like my tag line says and like pretty much every other review said, this is solid game as 
 long as u got some friends or an internet connection to play.
  I've honestly spent about 30 minutes off-line, and got bored. However once i jumped online it was 
 a different story. Fast, smooth gameplay, paired with solid control and super easy to master skill 
 system was enough to get me hooked to play for hours.
  As for the play modes you will not find anything you havent seen before in online sport games but 
 that again is not the point. Nor is the depth of the game a strong one. However just going nuts 
 with over-the-top skill moves, insane shots, while trash talking makes up for any lack of super 
 deep career modes. By far the best online mode is the "playground pick". It has some charm to it 
 and it can prove for some very interesting teams and some fun fun games!
  
  Graphics are not bad either. They could have done some more polishing and player model detail, 
 as you can mostly tell the big stars by their defining characteristics. Anyone that you dont know 
 by their long braided hair, different hair color, peculiar size and so on, you probably wont recognize 
 without the name tag. Overall though it is the theme of the game which comes out thru graphics 
 really well, and you feel like you are playing "backyard" soccer at ALL times.
  There are enough playgrounds to go around, but eventually you will get bored with them too, and 
 hopefully in some near future there will be some DLC that fixes this and few other lacking aspects 
 of the game. Also another feature that should have been in the game is the player customization 
 ala NBA street, where you can buy new shoes, balls, accessories and so on.
  
  By all means worth mentioning is the soundtrack. It is not a typical FIFA soundtrack but it is 
 as eclectic and worldly as it can be. Big change here is that its very much beat based. For those 
 that dont like the beats, dont worry. Songs are perfectly paced for this type of game, and eventually 
 not matter what you will learn to enjoy it!
  
  All in all, if you got frustrated with terrible trading system, and even worse scouting system 
 of FIFA 2008, and want some unadultarated, quick and intense soccer, you should own this. Otherwise 
 i say find a friend that owns a copy or rent!

Review:  Ever seen the James Bond film, Casino Royale? Well if you haven't this is going to make no sense 
 to you whatsoever, so skip to the rest of the review. However, if you have, imagine the opening 
 scene with the guy who jumps through the building site and stuff. Now, imagine that bloke who did 
 all the insane stunts and mix him with a Blackpool Pleasure Beach cartoon atrist, you know the 
 ones that do really goofy caricatures, and throw a football at him. Ta Da! You have FIFA Street 
 3, kind of...
  
  After that long, and kind of pointless ramble, we'll get back to the game. I have never been a 
 fan of football games, he one with men with posey men with nice hair and are relatively lanky compared 
 to American Football player s- who are basically rugby players. I find them tedious and pointless, 
 why play football on a screen when you can go to fresh patch of turf and do it yourself? Lazy git. 
 However, something struck me about FIFA Street 3 - hoever much you may think it is, it isn't a 
 football game and heres why:
  
  It's an extreme sports game. Like Tony Hawk, Skate and SSX, not as extreme as those extreme, but 
 along those lines. The tricks and animations are as fluid as those games and it's not often you 
 see Ronaldhinio performing a back flip off some wall, whilst playing a match.
  
  Fluidity, is a great word to describe this game, everything work so spontaneously, kind of, and 
 looks extreme natural, though they are cartoons. It's a weird combination, but it pulls it off 
 extremely well to present a unique and realistic quality to the game. 
  
  The game sees squads of 5 not 11 and different speciality types. Like Ronaldhinio is a speedy bastard 
 whilst Rooney can charge through puny French players like upright baguettes. It's a bit like Team 
 Fortress in the sense, and it works to a degree, just a times feels like you have to use particular 
 types of players to win particular situations.
  
  Showtime Mode, gets built up within a game very easily - a bit too easily, as the AI tend to take 
 advantage of the fact you can build it up through volleys and keepy ups and then using it to score 
 unstoppable goals. One nuisance.
  
  Second nuisance, like the footballer described earlier, the game is a bit lanky or thin on content. 
 There's a career mode and a poor attempt at a challenge mode which is miniscule compared to the 
 size of Roony's face. 
  
  However, the game is fun to play a lot more so than annual FIFA and PES, it adds that little bit 
 more fun of unrealisticness to a game which gives the matches a bit more excitement. You're not 
 just kicking a ball down one end of the pitch, your performing gravity defying moves and comet-shotting 
 the win.
  
  It looks brilliant, and it was a brave move for EA to do so with the artistic style, adding to 
 the essence of fun. Pitches are "urban" but successful in presentation.
  
  Overall, FIFA Street 3, racks up points with presentation and pure enjoyment but lets itself down 
 in the second half with a lack on content. A severe lack of content. But I have to bare in mind 
 though, this is the only football game that has ever held my interest for more than an hour - quite 
 an achievement.

Review:  I will say that this is what I have been waiting for... for long time since FIFA Street 1 & 2 was 
 out, though I prefer the FIFA Street 1 more than the FIFA Street 2, because the graphic of the 
 FIFA Street 1 it's more better.
  
  'But when it comes to FIFA Street 3... I totally love it coz you can now show off online with mate's.... lol
 
  
  It's a nice game of the year!... Superb...!
  
  To look at, too, FIFA Street 3 is a bit of a corker. The players are all heavily stylised, so Wayne 
 Rooney looks even more of a powerful brute, and Peter Crouch somehow manages to look even freakier 
 than before. Something that's surprisingly possible. 
  
  The Challenge mode offers the real single-player meat, handing over a series of progressively more 
 difficult tests of your footballing ability. Instead of just scoring the highest number of goals, 
 you need to slam them into the back of the net in a specified manner. So you might have to force 
 a few home by only volleys, or maybe a series of headers. A bit like we used to play back at school. 
 
  
  After a few hours of play, the cracks start to show. Your team mates can be a daft bunch, refusing 
 to run into space and forcing you to play the game the way the AI wants rather than how you love 
 the game. 
  
  Scoring too is a little irregular. One blast may bring about a flying save from the keeper, while 
 another simpler effort somehow sneaks in. It just feels rather random instead of down to your abilities. 
 Never a good thing for a sporting title.

Review:  FIFA Street 3 does manage to improve on the failures of the last two games, it's still lacking 
 in a few very crucial areas.
  
  The closest it comes is the series of challenges that is used to unlock the full roster of more 
 than 250 players. While there certainly are plenty of challenges to work your way through, the 
 experience gets very stale once you realize that you're simply playing standard matches over and 
 over again with slightly different win conditions. Sure, you'll see things like "be the first to 
 score five headers or volleys" or "score 5 Game Breaker goals" but that only lasts for so long.
 
  
  FIFA Street 3 would have been served much better by a standard player creation game mode that allowed 
 you to earn the all-stars from across the world while still leveling up different attributes. We'd 
 feel much more connected to each game if there were a few players who were consistently top-performers 
 for us, but with Street 3 we were always rotating old players out for the new and improved footballers 
 that we were unlocking along the way.
