:::Review:::
The AC/DC Live: Rock Band Track Pack is a short but sweet experience that leaves you feeling like 
 you didn't get a Whole Lotta Rosie. 

  Rock groups don't get much bigger than AC/DC. The Australian hard-rock act has churned out 17 studio 
 albums over 30 years, including one of the highest-selling albums of all time,  Back in Black . 
 With that kind of success, it's a no-brainer that Harmonix signed the Thunder From Down Under for 
 an exclusive game all to themselves, following the inclusion of "Let There Be Rock" in Rock Band 
 2. However, though the songs on AC/DC Live sound and feel amazing to play, with only 18 songs (the 
 setlist from the band's famous Live at Donington DVD) , no special features, and fewer modes than 
 either Rock Band or Rock Band 2, this game feels very much like a dirty deed done dirt cheap.  
 

           Angus' new suit proved less popular than his classic schoolboy uniform.      

  Despite bearing the name and soundtrack of AC/DC's feted Donington Park gig, the game provides 
 no visual indications that it has anything to do with either the band or the venue. While you're 
 playing, the screen is simply graced with generic Rock Band band members playing a generic stage. 
 Since there are no Brian Johnson, Angus Young, or Malcolm Young character models to be seen, the 
 only indicator youre playing an AC/DC game is the band's iconic sound.  

  However, you do get some bang for your buck. The game sells for a budget price of 24.99 in the 
 UK, or $29.92 exclusively at Wal-Mart in the US, and the tracklist should keep any AC/DC fan happy. 
 It comes as no surprise that the audio quality is again top-notch, with the game receiving a remastered 
 overhaul of the Live in Donington concert. Rock Band doesn't get much better than being able to 
 rock out to classics such as "You Shook Me All Night Long," "Back in Black," "Thunderstruck," "Highway 
 to Hell," and "For Those About to Rock (We Salute You) ." Regardless of whether you're assigned 
 to lead guitar, vocals, drums, or bass, the result should be a wide grin on your face. The highlight 
 for many fans will no doubt be playing some classic guitar riffs as Angus, although if you're up 
 for some screaming, Brian Johnson's vocal part is also a pleasurable -- albeit raspy -- experience. 
 Brilliant beats and self-indulgent drum fills make fan-favourite tracks like "T. N. T." and "Thunderstruck" 
 must-plays and provide a truly visceral drumming experience.  

  Unfortunately, you can't play Malcolm Young's rhythm-guitar parts, which is a disappointment considering 
 how instrumental he is to the band. Instead, as with Rock Band itself, you'll have to settle for 
 bass if you're not on lead, vocals, or drums. Because it's based on a live performance, AC/DC Live 
 also has some of the most ridiculously long ending bonuses seen, most noticeably in "Let There 
 Be Rock." There's the chance to rack up some serious points (and some aching muscles) in the dying 
 moments of a song. AC/DC Live doesnt feature its own dedicated World Tour or online modes, but 
 by redeeming a free one-time code printed on the back of the manual you can export and use all 
 18 tracks in your Rock Band or Rock Band 2 career and multiplayer modes just as you do current 
 DLC. Also worth a mention is the lack of trophy support.  

           AC/DC Live has a solid line-up which any fan will get a kick out of playing.      

 
  AC/DC Live's lower price and the ability to export songs to other Rock Band games makes up in 
 part for the lack of content and shorter experience. However, it still feels like this game has 
 squandered an opportunity to capitalise on the rich history that an iconic band such as AC/DC has, 
 as well as the specific content offered by the AC/DC Live branding, given the amount of material 
 on the attendant DVD. If you're a fan, you'll certainly get some thrills out of it, but it's not 
 the definitive experience that it could have been, and casual fans of AC/DC and Rock Band will 
 find that their money may be better spent elsewhere.
