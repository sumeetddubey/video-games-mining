:::Review:::
At World's End isn't a bad game, but its dull, repetitive combat and uninspired mission structure 
 prevent it from being much fun. 

  It's almost hard to believe in this day and age of movie and game tie-ins, but other than a couple 
 of handheld games, the last  Pirates of the Caribbean  movie didn't have a companion game on consoles. 
 Disney Interactive Studios is making up for lost time with Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's 
 End, which features plotlines from both the second and third  Pirates  movies. While the game does 
 a solid job of capturing the look and humor of the movies, it fails to emulate the films' action 
 sequences very well. The combat is extremely simple, and you'll grow tired of mashing on the attack 
 button well before you reach the end of the game.  

          Fighting is so easy you can do it with your eyes closed.     

  The first half of the 
 game follows the events of  Dead Man's Chest , specifically Captain Jack Sparrow's attempt to recover 
 the heart of Davy Jones to avoid becoming a member of his crew, and it culminates with Jack's encounter 
 with the Kraken. The second portion of the game sees Sparrow and his not-so-merry band of misfits 
 joining together to take on Lord Beckett and retrieve the heart of Davy Jones once and for all. 
 Even if you've seen the second film, the story is quite difficult to follow since it's told by 
 way of a mishmash of well produced, yet disjointed, cutscenes. You'll recognize several scenarios 
 and locations from the movies, but there are many things you'll do that aren't in the movies.  
 

  During the course of At World's End, you'll sword fight your way from Tortuga to Singapore, which 
 may sound exciting, but it's really not. There's only one button used to swing your sword, so all 
 you do is run up to enemies and mash that button until they turn their back and you finish them 
 with a final slash. Enemies literally appear out of thin air and put up little resistance as you 
 pound the attack button. Occasionally, you'll come across a tougher character that can only be 
 killed with a special move. As you kill a bunch of lower-level baddies, your attack meter fills, 
 and eventually you'll be able to perform a cool-looking finishing move. You can punch enemies, 
 and when you don't have a sword handy, you can kick them, though you're rarely forced to result 
 to fisticuffs. The only move in your basic arsenal that's consistently fun is the sometimes useful 
 ability to grab and then toss enemies. You can sling them into each other, or toss them off the 
 sides of buildings and docks, which is great fun. There are a handful of weapons, such as guns, 
 knives, and grenades, which are scattered throughout for you to use. Unfortunately, they're not 
 very useful. The guns work OK, but knives and grenades are particularly difficult to aim. If you 
 mix up your attacks (or pick up bags scattered throughout the levels) , you can raise your notoriety, 
 and on the Xbox 360 your notoriety score will be uploaded to an online leaderboard. The game makes 
 a big deal about notoriety, but it's utterly pointless, especially on the PS3, which doesn't have 
 leaderboards.  

  Most of your time in At World's End is spent as Jack Sparrow, though you'll also get to play as 
 Elizabeth, Will, and a few other characters. Sometimes you'll even get to fight as all three at 
 the same time, switching from character to character by pressing the D pad. These are the worst 
 parts of the game because characters you aren't controlling don't do much in the way of defending 
 themselves. This means you're constantly switching characters trying (often futilely) to keep them 
 alive. There are plenty of checkpoints in the game, but for some reason when these three-person 
 battles come up, you're forced to start with the same amount of health every time, which is a big 
 problem if you came limping into battle with a limited amount of life left. The rest of the game 
 is quite easy, so dying shouldn't be much of a problem.  

          The duels look cool, but there isn't much to them.     

  The only time At World's End 
 mixes up the fighting is during the boss battles, which are one-on-one duels similar to those seen 
 in the movies. These start with a brief cutscene, and then the game switches to a side view with 
 three circle icons on the side of the screen. When your foe is about to attack, a circle will appear 
 around the icon, and you must move the analog stick in the appropriate direction before the bigger 
 circle shrinks to the size of the icon. If you block all of your opponent's attacks, you'll be 
 able to press a button to counter his attack and also attack by moving the analog stick up, down, 
 or toward your opponent. None of these fights are very hard, but they do manage to be rather intense 
 and they always end with a humorous cutscene.  

  When you're not fighting, you'll spend most of your time running, climbing, and jumping through 
 levels, looking for people to talk to or finding lost items. Though you've got a wide variety of 
 moves at your disposal, the controls are relatively simple, even if they are a bit touchy sometimes. 
 Once again the PS3 version of a game gets tacked-on Sixaxis controls. You can tilt the controller 
 left or right to keep your balance while walking across narrow beams. There are also occasions 
 where the icon for context-sensitive areas doesn't appear, even if you're standing where you should 
 be. The levels are strictly linear, and a handy compass points you in the right direction should 
 you ever get lost. None of your objectives are particularly interesting, a fact made worse by the 
 copious amount of backtracking you'll be doing. For example, you'll visit Davy Jones' organ not 
 once, not twice, but three times. There are lots of collectible items on each level, and if you 
 find everything, you'll be rewarded with unlockables and achievement points. You'll end up with 
 less than 300 points for beating the game, so if you're looking to get points, you'll want to keep 
 an eye out for chests and hidden items. Split-screen co-op and competitive play let you take on 
 swarms of enemies in timed challenges, and you can even duel against a friend. Their inclusion 
 is a nice gesture, but the results are underwhelming.  

  At World's End's best aspect is its graphics, though the PS3 version isn't nearly as attractive 
 as the Xbox 360, thanks to an extremely choppy frame rate that really brings down the whole experience. 
 The characters all look like their movie counterparts. Jack's drunken stupor is a bit overdone, 
 and he's not as flamboyant as he is in the films, but that's just nit-picking because the likeness 
 is uncanny. The animation is quite good, particularly when you're just running around and jumping, 
 but there isn't enough variety to the fighting moves. Each character plays and attacks the same 
 way, so you'll see the same few attacks over and over. The sword fighting is surprisingly violent, 
 especially when you consider there's no blood. It's anyone's guess as to why it's OK for a T-rated 
 game to show someone getting stabbed in the chest and the blade going all the way through the person's 
 body, but it's not OK to show any blood around the wound. The locations in the game look very nice 
 as well, and the camera will zoom in to make sure you notice, often at the expense of the gameplay. 
 The Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman look just as you'd expect -- you'll notice detailed rigging, 
 rusty metal bars in holding cells, and detailed timber on the decks. Since nearly the entire game 
 takes place on or near water, it's important that the water looks good, and it does.  

          Chacter likenesses are spot-on.     

  The game's audio is solid, albeit unspectacular. 
 You won't be hearing Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley, or Orlando Bloom, but the soundalikes do an 
 admirable job of filling their shoes. It's just too bad there isn't more dialogue to flesh out 
 the story. The game uses the movies' soundtracks to punctuate the action, fading in and out depending 
 on the situation. It's not the best score you've ever heard, but it fits the game well. The sound 
 effects are good, but there's not enough variety to them. Granted, there's only so much that can 
 be done with clanging swords, but there could have been more variety to the catchphrases that your 
 foes yell when they attack.  

  When it's all said and done, At World's End is a very by-the-books approach to a movie-based game. 
 It has, and lets you play as, all the characters you'd want to play; it doesn't deviate from the 
 movies' plots too much; and it takes you to many of the locations you see in the films. While those 
 are good things, the game really would have benefited by taking some risks. The biggest problem 
 is that you're playing as a cool character in an exotic location, but you're not doing anything 
 interesting, just running around picking up items and hitting the attack button endlessly. Unless 
 you're a huge fan of the  Pirates  trilogy, you'll want to rent this one or pass on it altogether. 
 If you're trying to pick between the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, go with the 360; it has a better 
 frame rate and achievement points.

Review:  Yeah, I realise I will lose a whole bundle of respect for this review, but the truth is, after 
 all is said and done, I enjoyed this game. It is like The Catwoman game, I did not expect to enjoy 
 that one so much either. That isn't to say that this game does not have its flaws. Trust me it 
 does, and they are huge and glaring.
  One thing, could they not get at least someone who sounds like Johnny Depp to do a voiceover? This 
 game turns captain Jack Sparrow into a pantomime of himself. That plus a combat system that is 
 damn near embarrising. No actually, let us get rid of the damn near part. When you are sword fighting 
 an enemy, all you do is hit one button. On the third swing of your sword the enemy turns his back 
 on you and quits fighting.
  Okay, those are the two things I find I did not like about this game. I did like the exploration 
 parts. When you are not fighting the game is a pretty good run around platformer. So if you do 
 play this expect to be climbing and jumping, trying to find treasure and lost items.
  The combat does improve later in the game when the bad guys get harder to beat. The boss battles 
 are cool, yet there are sections where you fight as three characters at once. Just keep switching 
 off, because when you are not controlling a character, they stand there to get chopped down.
  The big star here are the graphics. The likeness of the characters are spot on from their movie 
 counterparts, and the backgrounds are nothing short of amazing. 
  Everything about this game told me I should not have liked it as much as I did. To tell you the 
 truth I have no real urge to go through it again, but for the time I played it. I did have fun.

Review:  Based on the third movie in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, At World's End isn't really worth 
 checking out unless you're a die-hard fan of the series. Since there wasn't a video game for the 
 second movie-God only knows why-the game developers decided to add it on here. The game does a 
 good job of both recapturing the movies' plot and feel. The voice acting is decent, but the real 
 actors from the films aren't in the game. The soundtrack makes you feel like you're both watching 
 and playing the Pirates of the Caribbean. The best part about this game is its graphics. Characters 
 look like their real life selves, and the environments have high detail to them. The Xbox 360 version 
 is much more attractive, though, since the frame rate is a lot better and the game runs smoother. 
 Where the game fails is in gameplay. The mission design isn't really that fun, since you'll be 
 running around either fending off foes, or searching for a person or lost item. Combat is not that 
 much fun. It's simple button mashing, and the animations look ugly. The game won't take you all 
 that long to beat, and it isn't a very memorable experience. I myself didn't enjoy the game and 
 it isn't recommended unless you must have a Pirates of the Caribbean game.

Review:  If you enjoyed the movie, then you will not enjoy the game! This game has me stumped, i don't honestly 
 know what to say, only, it's a renter...
  
  To start off, let's talk about the plot. It opens with no idea what's happening and is no way like 
 the movie, and you only have to pull levers and follow a guy that teaches you how to fight, a very 
 annoying fighting sytem to! You use your sword, and the way you fight is so, so, er, gay! I never 
 say a video game is "gay" but this one is, for it's combat. Fighting with your sword is like waddeling 
 a feather around. No blood, same swiping action and it has terrible fighting graphics, with every 
 enemey looking identicle! Then there is a boos battle, which is a waste of time because it's over 
 in a flash!
  
  The graphics are ok, except combat, but locatons are great and fun to interact with. Your character 
 is voiced well by Johnny Depp, but everything else about voice acting is horrible. There off key, 
 can't act wella nd voices sound murkey!
  
  Dissapointing, rent it first, if you like it, you can get it cheap from game stores for about 20. 
 But it isn't even worth that!
  
  4.5/10

Review:  this is game is 1 or 2 player,
  1st the 2player is very good fighting a mate,
  the 1 player is ok........... the fighting combats are dead boring moves,
  but finishing off 
 is quite fun,
  being different players varies well being jack always has that cheeky look and great finishing 
 off moves ;)
  the SIXAXIS controle are very lame,
  i hate switching between characters eg your jack fighting away o no elizabeths dead, you have to 
 fight for them all,
  but since i bought this game only for 20 was a good buy the graphics are quite good
  i think 
 my rating is fair for this good game, room for improvement, maybe onlinew would be fun. its the best 
 in the series so far,
  the dueling mode is good in the campaign having to press up down left and right to deflect the 
 ememies attack but can get annoying if your a bad guesser, but the normal combat is rubbish just 
 X X X X X X yeah hes dead etc it drags but the story keeps you hooked if your like me and havent 
 seen the film,
  hope you enjoyed my review. thanks

Review:  Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End for the PS3 is a decent game that feels unfinished. The 
 plot of the game is based on both Dead Man's Chest and At World's End, it works out pretty well. 
 You play as Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, and a whole bunch of characters from the 
 movie. The biggest problem with the game is the combat, it's dull and flat. All the characters 
 you play as fights the same, the only difference is the special moves. The graphics are great in 
 this game, nicely detailed, and it's gorgeous to look at. The character models are great as well, 
 they look like their movie counterparts and the voice acting is really good. The music is pretty 
 good as well, it feels like you're the movie, which is a cool experience. The dueling in this game 
 is repetitive, instead of being simple, the developers had to make it complicated. You have to 
 move the right analog stick to fight and all the opponents do mainly is block it, you just have 
 to hope your sword hits them. You'll have more fun the Dead Man's Chest levels than the ones based 
 on At World's End, but overall Pirates of the Caribbean isn't a great game, but it's not bad either. 
 For the fans it's worth the rental, for everyone else you should at least check it out.

Review:  Ok so I'm pretty sure that if you are reading this that you ether like pirates of the Caribbean 
 or you think that being a pirate is fun I say this because for me looking at the game at first 
 glance did not impress me but I got it in a ps3 bundle so I thought id give it a try. The story 
 starts of with events from the seconded movie and then move into the third witch I think is nice 
 because I've seen all three movies and I forget how jack got sent to the locker and well other 
 things I don't want to ruin the movie for people that ant seen but in places the story has been 
 tweaked to fit in better, it had to be done but its sad none the less so don't rely on the game 
 as a replacement for the movie but it has been done well it the story runs smoothly or as well 
 as can be expected of a movie game with so many movie games being let downs this game isn't one 
 of them. Ok now on to the fun stuff the fighting is pretty basic punch and slash, can use specials 
 and on some enemies you'll need to on some, grab combos not that great and shooting pretty fun 
 there are many different characters that you play as but fighting style don't change only the specials 
 do witch is a bit of a bore the most sad thing about combat in this game is the duelling feature 
 witch made easy to use and can be fun but after a wile you'll begin to dread them because there 
 are played using high middle and low attacks that you can use and you can defend if you can defend 
 four attacks then you can counter and start attacking press up down or left on the controller to 
 attack or defend it could have been good but instead is a chore. That was the bad things about 
 POTC and now for the good graphics are cool lots of extras nice sound track big fights fist and 
 sword you can shoot through knives and grenades character models well detailed and jacks movements 
 are spot on awesome voice work and a good laugh but only give it ago if you like the movies.

Review:  Pirates 3 the game isn't as good as the movie, (Obviously) mainly because the graphics are poor, 
 the levels are very bland, and combat is a boring as hitting the square button until your enemys 
 back is turned. The best thing about the game is the good voice acting which, until alittle while 
 ago, I thought was actually by the actors themselfs!
  
  Sometimes using the SIXAXIS to traverse massive gaps can be interesting and even fun! Some of the 
 levels are eunique, but all of them get repetetive and boring after a while, especially since all 
 of them are the same but with different design, and more then half of the game is ship levels.
 
  
  I understand that the PS3 is hard to develope on, but I still expected more from what people call 
 "Next Gen". I do think that being able to switch characters is cool, but only for so long. (Especially 
 since they're all the same)
  
  Pros: Good voice acting. Some SIXAXIS controls are cool. You can really tell that Eurocom and Disney 
 Interactive tried.
  
  Cons: The game can be beaten in an afternoon. The graphics are pretty good, but not great. Repetetive 
 combat that doesn't even have any blood. 
  
  I'd say it's worth a rental though, you might even find out that you like it.

Review:  With expectations lowered, POTC: AWE is an enjoyable game. Don't get me wrong, its not a bad game.. 
 but its not a great one either. The bad points first, the combat rivals the Dynasty Warriors series 
 for simplicity and button mashing boredom. Seeing as the game centers on the combat, this is a 
 bit of a problem, but the 'special moves' (hold R2 and choose from one of the on screen prompts 
 once you've filled your guage up by attacking normally) and 'Jackanisms' offer some respite from 
 the mashing of X. The ability to grab enemies and throw them elsewhere, particularly off cliffs 
 or ledges is enjoyably violent, and you're rewarded with gold coins for it, as you are for the 
 special moves. The combat is repetitive and often dull, but taken in small pinches it remains satisfying. 
 Problems do arise however in the form of targeting problems, all too often as you try to land a 
 killing blow to a particularly tough character as you're close to dying, one of his weak cronies 
 gets in the way and you automatically begin slashing away at them instead. These frantic scraps 
 are hectic enough, but when the game insists on repeatedly throwing other characters to control 
 at you so you often have to look after 3 characters it becomes infuriating. These sections generally 
 work around a templete of one or two 'boss' type characters that take a fair bit of perseverance 
 and a special move to defeat, and only once they are defeated do the endless stream of cronies 
 stop respawning. Its pointless to attack any of the cronies until you've killed the boss character, 
 as they'll just keep streaming in and slashing the 3 characters you are forced to juggle with to 
 stay alive. If one dies, thats it, game over. Nevertheless, the fighting is fun. The learning curve 
 is put together well enough to make sure the fights never become too challenging, and though frustration 
 arises from the situations detailed (and EVERY level has those moments) , anyone who can be bothered 
 to just keep hammering that X button will get through in about 3 tries maximum. The graphics are 
 pretty, if not as incredible as some games already have become on PS3. There's nice lighting effects, 
 and, thankfully for an often sea based game, the water is well handled. Rain looks especially impressive 
 on the first level, as it runs along the cobblestones. The characters all look remarkably life 
 like and the animation is nice (if sometimes a little cumbersome) . The main problem looks-wise 
 is a rather shoddy frame-rate, it runs smoothly throughout, but every now and then- and not always 
 due to heavy graphical power needed- the frame rate becomes flickbook-esque. The sound is good, 
 the films' (contrary to the name, POTC: AWE spans both the POTC sequels storylines) score used effectively 
 and responsively to the action. The sound effects are atmospheric and work well in an understated 
 way. Dialogue is indistinguishable from the real deal, and the comments from your oppenents are 
 impressive.. albeit repetitive. There's a lot to be said for the cinematic duel sequences, which 
 are essentially the real boss fights of the game. focusing on a simple Up, Down or Lunge forward 
 system you either have to defend or attack using the right analogue stick and those 3 directions. 
 Building up a guage through successful defences and hitting X also creates a counter move. The 
 game's simplicity really works in its favour in these sections, as the camera is allowed to roam 
 far more cinematically and involvingly, and impressive animations are really shown off. The use 
 of PS3's SIXAXIS controller's tilt function is sparingly placed into sections where you have to 
 traverse precarious bridges, and thankfully these are never too hard as a tap of R2 as you lose 
 your footing stabs your sword into the bridge or plank and saves you from a death. This does take 
 the tension away, but it saves frustration arising from the tilt function, so it never really feels 
 like an annoying novelty, more a token part of the game that adds a bit of variety to the gameplay. 
 The main story lasts around 8 hours, and thankfully features cutscenes only using the in-game graphics, 
 so they are tailored to the levels instead of the levels being tailored so much to film cutscenes, 
 or indeed just having the usual out-of-place, annoying film clips between levels. Once the story 
 mode is completed (the last level being long, frustrating, but ultimately one of the better examples 
 of the totally linear gameplay) , there are multiplayer options to enjoy- timed runs through levels 
 with a co-op partner, and duels are playable; and they are effective enough but the same criticisms 
 of the single player game apply here too- but it is less frustrating without having to juggle multiple 
 characters. The game has plenty to unlock and its pretty safe to say you will have to return to 
 the singleplayer to unlock everything.. its just unlikely you'll want to, as previously mentioned, 
 this game is best in short bursts. Don't expect anything brilliant or innovative and there's plenty 
 to enjoy in a mercifully brief game. Pick it up in your bargain bin if you can.

Review:  Lucky I rented it, if it were 50 cents, I wouldn't buy it. The controls are awkward, the movement 
 is reminds me of the old apple II days. In short, it is not worth playing. It is a disgrace to 
 the PS3. Don't waste your money on this first generation game. It is a strain to think up enough 
 bad things to say about this piece of crap game but since I need 100 words, PLEASE save your money 
 for a good game. Have I made my point in 100 words????? Still need more, the music is so boring 
 that my house mates told me to turn down the sound or quite playing.

Review:  You play of course as Captain Jack Sparrow, as well as some other characters from the film. You 
 play thru the second and third film in the game. The game is a mix of the hack and slash and small 
 adventure puzzle elements. GOOD THINGS: the graphics are very pretty and the characters are awesome. 
 They have all the same movements and action from the film. The enviroments are good also, such 
 as the trees, water and surrondings. The game is real simple and very easy to just pick up and 
 play. Some good voice acting also, so are the sword sound effects. BAD THINGS: this game does not 
 give you a challenge. it also repeats itself with fighting then puzzle, fighting then puzzle, which 
 gets kind of old real quick. The game turns out to be dissapointing with the fighting, no changes 
 thru out the game, same combos over and over as well as same moves. The game can be beaten in a 
 day, so deffinetly not worth the 62 bucks. The story element is flushed back and forth and could 
 have been smoothed out a alot better. You dont spend much time in the 3rd chapter of the series, 
 even tho the game is named after the 3rd movie. OVERALL: if you are looking for a game just to 
 kill a day on, then borrow and rent this game. I enjoyed the movies and like the actors, but the 
 game was dissapointing. Thanks for reading this, and remember this is just my opinion.

Review:  Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is the final Pirates movie (and game) as far as publicity 
 knows. Since there was not a Dead Man's Chest (2nd movie) game. The creators fit the 2nd movie 
 into the game in the beginning, adding to the content. So when you first start out your at the 
 Prison where Jack snuck into in the beginning of the 2nd movie. Continue on to Isla de Cruces, 
 Singapore, Shipwreck Island, and never foget Tortuga. Where you can never leave without a good 
 bar-room-brawl.
  
  **GamePlay**
  
  Lets note though that it's not as fun as it could have been. You cant roam the ocean freely or 
 even steer to your next destination. They'll just say to Singapore! or Jack saying .. Tortuga... 
 and you go there instantly. The game is quite fun. When you first start out you may seem the controls 
 to be a little weird at first but that's only because its new. Just like every other game. Jack 
 does his infamous walk when you go slow a bit. Controls you pick up easily on. Especially because 
 of the combat being so easily done.
  
  The combat in the game mainly comes at you with only three different moves. Grapple (Triangle) 
 which in that case, you can throw him into other enemies, to the ground, or off the dock/ship; 
 or punch him in the face til he dies. The Square button controls ONLY the punching really. It can 
 be used effectively when using it with the Cross button which controls the sword. Its simple hack 
 and slash with not many moves. A few taps with the sword, punch, fatal sword blow and its as easy 
 as that. You also have a combat meter which fills up everytime you defeat a foe in a different 
 way than the last. Fill it up and you are able to pull off some crazy impales on the Royal Navy, 
 Pirates, or Davy Jones crew.
  A new effect is also the Jackinism. Which he impales the sword in the ground which will give it 
 a green glow. Now, you can only pull off this move when you have collected a small head. And then 
 every slash against an enemy instantly kills him and it collects his soul. You should get 100 by 
 the end of the game. Me on the other hand ended with 31. It was fine. Possibly something extra 
 though if you get the 100. Who knows?
  
  **Graphics**
  
  The detail of the game is very incredible. Especially when you first set out to the ocean, and 
 you see the sparkle on the waves. Or coming out of a cave on Isla de Cruces. The sunlight beams 
 down on the rocks making it look so real it will blow your mind. You'll definetly stop a few times 
 in this game just to admire the graphics and details. Trust me..
  
  **Sound**
  
  Sound is not an issue with the game. It does however have Some bad voice acting. because It does 
 not follow too closely to the movies. But it tries. It makes a pretty convincing effort of Capt. 
 Jack and Will. Elizabeth may sound a little corny. But if your a true fan you really wouldn't care!
 
  
  **Value**
  
  Because of the levels mainly being a go to point B from point A, collect 7 of these items and return 
 them it does not exactly have the HIGHEST Value level. Some people will play it again. Some won't. 
 The game could have been a lot better in ways I could think of and it would have raised the Value 
 level. But honestly its a little slacking. Only because its the same combat moves over and over 
 again. Going into areas that all seem the same. If only there was actual movie cutscenes in the 
 entire game.... = (
  
  You can always go back however and collect more souls, collect more of the items you missed. And 
 the souls just add on. Items you gotta do all over again. They dont matter though. Dont forget 
 the Callypso puzzle pieces which unlock things like Charactor Models and Artwork. If you like that 
 sorta thing. I only unlocked 2 so I dont know whats in the other chests under extra.
  
  **Overall**
  
  The game does not even take too long to beat. Each level can be around 30 minutes 
 long and there aren't many levels to boot. The game will not last more than 10 hours. Unless your 
 really slow. Which I dont see how you can be with this game.
  
  The game IS really great though, if you love Pirates of the Caribbean. It is a must for the serious 
 fans and know that they will love it no matter what. I dont expect it for people who want a great 
 challenge though. Because Pirates is a simple game that fans will loe to play becase its Pirates.
 
  
  **FINAL**
  
  I rate this game an 8.1.

Review:  PotC: AWE. Is a movie based off the game PotC: AWE. Um.... in it, you play as Jack Sparrow, Will 
 Turner, and Captain Barbosa. It's a hack and slash action adventure game that has limited puzzle 
 solving sequences. It gets kind of old after halfway through the game since you basically just 
 kill enemies. Love the music. The graphics look good, but the frame rate drops like CRAZY! In the 
 Gamespot review, they said the Playstation 3 version did so I'm guessing that's why my game is 
 laggy. Anway, the game is kind of short, but pretty decent while it lasts. Not a game I'd buy (won 
 it at a raffle) , but it's worth playing maybe for a weekend.

Review:  this game is alright i mean the graphices are very col and top nocht but the gameplay does get 
 a little repetitive some times and the cut scenes dont resemble some of the parts in both of the 
 movies. But i really did like the fact they put in an muliplayer mode and the ability to swap character 
 during batles at times. Also the music is the best part in the game and i have to say its freakin 
 awesome. But if you like the Pirates of the Caribbean movies and you want the game that is fun 
 and immersive like the movie versions i recommend you rent this game before you even buy it.

Review:  Gameplay: This game is way to repetitive. All it takes to kill an enemy is pushing X 3 times. The 
 sword fighting duel is slightly better, but not much. That also is repetitive and is way to slow. Plus 
 there is acompass you get that doesn't show you the way to anything. Graphics: These graphics were 
 O. K. but nothing special. The texture in the backgrounds are pretty blurry. But they captured the 
 characters style pretty well. Sound: All the cast from the movie was there reprising there roles. The 
 music sounds like it belongs in a pirates game. Value: You probably wouldnt want to play this game 
 again. Just rent it. All in all this game is not very good. Im glad I rented it.

Review:  What can i say first their review of SM3 and now this? gamespot what are you doing, seriously.
 
  Now my review,
  i'll start with the graphical side, it looks AMAZING, the character models are fantastic and the 
 environments are incredibly immersive, when playing as Jack Sparrow its really cool to see him 
 swagger about with that funny walk he has, the animators have got it just right lol. I find it 
 really cool when fighting on a ship and you can see the action going on on the other ship and because 
 the graphical side of the game is so incredible, it all looks believable.
  
  the story sticks close to the second and third films, although there is the odd sidetrack or alteration 
 made which is understandable considering games progress slower than films (otherwise it would be 
 a short game lol) and when alterations to the story are made it still feels believable and it never 
 pulls you from the experience of potc
  
  Johnny Depp and others don't add their voice to the game however the voice actors who imitate them 
 do a really good job of capturing their characteristics, especially Sparrow's voice actor, its 
 hard to tell the difference to be honest, however while Depps voice was captured spot on, you can 
 tell Will's voice actor and Orlando Bloom apart (who cares tbh lol) but its still a good job.
 
  
  Overall Pirates of the Caribbean: At world's end is a fantastic game, good length, story, involving 
 story which captures the humor of the films fantastically and great graphics all make it a brilliant 
 game. Play it

Review:  After seeing the reviews from a couple different websites, I was hesitant to purchase this game. 
 I was able to play this game for the PS2, and I actually liked it. Normally every movie turned 
 video game results in a not so fun and exciting game; this game however is a different story. To 
 start the graphics are very nice looking. The characters look very life-like and the environments 
 are detailed and immersive. The game also follows the movie well throughout the missions. It seems 
 like many people think that the fighting is boring and dull. I completely disagree with this, the 
 combat is actually quite fun, there are multiple different moves that you can pull off and even 
 finishing moves.
  
  After talking about some great points for this game, it is not perfect. To start off, I realized 
 that the camera is sometimes a little annoying, not to the point where you are lost in the game, 
 but it can sometimes force more damage during combat. Another negative is that the frame rate is 
 not so great; there are times where it seems like the game is a little laggy; nothing horrible, 
 but noticable. One other thing is that the main characters do not talk as much as I hoped for; 
 the voices sound great; just like the chracters in the movie.
  
  Overall:
  
  +Great Graphics
  
  +Nice &amp; detailed looking environments
  
  +Combat is fun and in-depth
 
  
  +Realistic Sounds
  
  -Sometimes aggravating camera
  
  -Low frame rate
  
  -Charcaters don't talk too often
  
  I would definitely recommend this game to friends. This 
 game would be enjoyed my almost any Pirates of the Caribbean fan.

Review:  good game
  just like the movie and i agree a lot better for playstation 3 then on the 360
  may seem pretty dumb from maybe small clips you see but the graphics are truely next gen and musci 
 and sound are amazing defenttly worth buying
  or at least renting the games doesnt really have a use after being beaten unlike halo 3 or resistance 
 fall of man... but yea its a movie game you cant really expect much i mean other then the hulk 
 no movie type superhero games ever did really well but this one was based mainly on the fact that 
 its a movie game and thats why it got a low rating so dont believe the ratings...
  and defently see the movie as well before playing the game its a must see

Review:  As far as graphics are concerned this game is sick in the visual department. Details on there faces 
 and clothes and the backgrounds, its just nuts. The game never skips at all in frame rate, maybe 
 some choppy animations here and there but nothing bothersome in anyway.
  
  The gameplay is the fun yet boring. If only the system had more things you could do, it would have 
 been great. Your left with a punch, sword slash, L2 for focuse, a throwing button. Its very NES 
 days plain. Yet, fun if you can get into it. Every now and then it offers sideway fighting scene 
 moments that have 3 balls: high, med, low that u point ur analoge too. These battles can be easy, 
 while some can require your focus. Every now and then you have to switch around 3 character. This 
 is more or less baby sitting. Its such a bother to worrie about all 3 of there health bars. It 
 also carries some button tap moments like hit X here or something. But its never random.
  
  Sound is perfect, enough said it has all the songs from the movie.
  
  Value well, beat it one 
 or two times and ur done. Does have a sorta shallow multiplayer though pick a character and fight 
 a friend.

Review:  Every time a game comes out for both systems the PS3 version is always the worst of the Two. Why 
 do I want to buy a more expensive system that has less impressive games. I have played both systems 
 and I have to say, The PS3 is nothing but a disappointment. Do your self a favor and skip the PS3 
 version, get the Xbox 360 one instead! Yet another PS3 game that is not as good as the same game 
 on Xbox 360!!! Don't get me wrong Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is not a bad game its 
 just not good as a PS3 game. It's very choppy on the PS3 system. It also not as pretty as the Xbox 
 360 version, Yep that right!!! the Xbox 360 has better graphics and runs smoother... AGAIN!!!

Review:  Within the first twenty minutes, I thought, Holy Crap, this is like the first Harry Potter game! 
 
  
  That's one of those thoughts you DON'T want to have.
  
  The game looks great, and they've really captured the mannerisms of the characters perfectly. The 
 voice acting isn't too bad, and the overall concept appears to pull off well. The score fits in 
 perfectly- and did I mention how great it looks?
  
  So great, in fact, that you'll quickly forget the all-to-familiar 'tutorial level', cliched fetch 
 quests, and sub-par story editing and sequencing that's all supposed to make you feel like you're, 
 'Living the movie!'. Problem is, this is an epic movie crammed into an after school special of 
 a game. Starting with the camera- which allows such a high degree of precision that there is absolutely 
 no way for the game to automatically move it on its own- even while you're fighting. Fortunately, 
 the quick click of the thumbstick will revolve the camera to directly behind where you're standing, 
 allowing you to concentrate on one enemy at a time by obscuring all the others. For more precise 
 movements, you can even try to readjust the camera while moving the right stick while you now have 
 to reach across and mash the fighting buttons with your other hand. Brilliant- it's this kind of 
 novel approach that will allow this version of the game to outsell any others' production.
  
  This leads me into the fighting- repetitive, bland, button-mashing. The duels are awesome and 
 work brilliantly (once you get the slant) , but are over far too quickly. The innovative use of 
 the SIXAXIS for tight-rope walking is also well incorporated- and also used sparsely.
  
  The sequencing of the story really killed it for me, though. This is a glaring flaw noticed within 
 the first twenty minutes of the game, and is just rough. I can't even describe how awful and broadly 
 nonsensical the amalgam of final product is. I played this for the story- the great novels it could 
 fill, and such. I got the airliner emergency card.
  
  I consider myself a formidable fan of the movies, and will still attend opening night. I would 
 recommend to those considering it, to wait until opening results of this game come in. It's a mixed 
 bag on likeability, and you would have to forgive the franchise for a LOT of hackneyed excuses. 
 The die-hard's are going to kick and moan the most, as their precious story is ruined. Those that 
 like [any] pirates, and don't mind a 'go rip down those posters to get your next mission' style 
 of game won't mind. Personally, I can't help but feel I've done a lot of this before- and it was 
 more fun then. Sure, it didn't look as good, didn't star pirates, and didn't have Depp's voice 
 acting samples, but if I've done it all before, why do it again?
