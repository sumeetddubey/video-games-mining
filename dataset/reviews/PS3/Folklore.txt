:::Review:::
You'll have a good time with Folklore, despite some design and storytelling quirks. 

  If you had proof that there was life after death, would you live differently than you do now? Would 
 the world change -- and not just for the better? These are questions the characters in Folklore wrestle 
 with. It sounds like the setup for a deep role-playing game, but in actuality, this is an action/adventure 
 game with rather few RPG elements that tells an intriguing, convoluted story set in two distinct 
 worlds: modern-day Ireland and an afterlife based on Celtic traditions. Folklore is an inconsistent 
 game with some minor gameplay and storytelling issues that keep it from reaching its full potential. 
 Nevertheless, even with these flaws, it manages to be an enjoyable journey into the lands of the 
 dead, where our memories take many different forms.  

           You know a girl with hair like that is up to no good.      

  The game is separated 
 into two different regions. First, there is the Irish village of Doolin, where two characters are 
 trying to solve a series of murders. One of them is Ellen, a young woman who's received a mysterious 
 letter from someone claiming to be her long-lost mother, and encourages Ellen to come to the village 
 to find her. The other is Keats, a reporter for an occult magazine who received a message of his 
 own, one that points to strange goings-on in the same village. The second region is the netherworld, 
 a series of afterlives that are home to the memories of the dead. There, a tale of political intrigue 
 plays out that relates to the events in Doolin in ways both obvious and not so obvious. Just don't 
 be surprised if at first you aren't all that taken in: It takes the story a while to ramp up.  
 

  The story itself is great, and it gets more and more elaborate before the twists begin to unravel. 
 Unfortunately, the manner of storytelling isn't quite so grand. Most scenes play out like a graphic 
 novel in that they feature static images and dialogue boxes without any voice acting, and with 
 music that doesn't always fit the mood of the scene. It's an interesting design choice, but it's 
 weirdly flavorless. Folklore wants you to invest psychologically in Ellen's mission, but it's hard 
 to get a handle on her because those scenes are so devoid of personality. By contrast, the standard 
 cutscenes that occasionally crop up are eerie, beautiful, and well acted, and they provide a distinct 
 sense of place and time.  

  The real-world gameplay consists of moving either Ellen or Keats around the village to interact 
 with other characters and look for the occasional clue. The game always tells you where to go and 
 what to do, so the Doolin portions are like playing a PC adventure game, only without puzzles. 
 The first five chapters are playable from both Keats' and Ellen's perspectives, so you'll experience 
 the story from both sides. Each character's story is linear, but you can switch between them once 
 a chapter is finished, so if you want to play out the initial five chapters as Ellen and then do 
 them again as Keats, you can. But you're better served by finishing each chapter one at a time 
 from both perspectives, an approach that keeps the story more consistent and interesting. You'd 
 think it would be good to have the choice to follow each character as you see fit, but it's weird 
 to go back to chapter one and play as Ellen if you've already completed several chapters as Keats. 
 It really hurts the saga when you get the story out of order like this, so why developer Game Republic 
 would have given players the chance to weaken the tale is an even greater mystery than Ellen's 
 past.  

  Luckily, the game picks up significantly once you're in the netherworld. The worlds you visit are 
 visually lush and filled with all sorts of fantastic creatures. They're brimming with gorgeous 
 details, stunning lighting, and strong color palettes that infuse the environments with more life 
 than the actual land of the living. Your goal? Slay the monstrous folk and suck up their souls. 
 Neither Ellen nor Keats use a weapon -- at least, not directly. Instead, they rely on collecting 
 the ids of the netherworld folk to summon for use in battle. As you progress from chapter to chapter, 
 you gain more and more folk, and they have a wide range of uses and abilities. Some act as short-range 
 melee weapons that you use by pounding on a button as if you're swinging a sword. You can also 
 send a flying machine into the air to drop bombs, slash enemies with an electrical monster, or 
 summon a creature that flings ice shards into the air.  

  There are dozens and dozens of different folk to collect. Although you'll probably tend to use 
 the same few as often as possible, some enemies are resistant to certain attacks and weak to others, 
 so you'll need to constantly shuffle your folk and experiment with different tactics. You will 
 occasionally come across hint books scattered about that are suppose to help you determine some 
 of these creatures' weaknesses, but these books are rarely useful. The writing on them is just 
 scribbled nonsense, and their scratchy doodles don't always help you figure out which folk you 
 should be using.  

  Once you defeat a folk, you can suck out its id, which floats above the downed creature in the 
 form of a bobbing pink silhouette. To collect the id of a standard enemy, you hold a shoulder button 
 and yank upwards with the Sixaxis. Stronger enemies and bosses require a little more perseverance, 
 and you sometimes have to free the id by shaking the controller rapidly, tilting the controller 
 back and forth, yanking the id upwards, or doing a combination of these and other things. It's 
 an intuitive use of the Sixaxis, and the sensitivity of all these actions is pitch-perfect. It's 
 awesome to watch the ids getting sucked up, and it's simply fun to do. If you haven't captured 
 the id previously, you'll now be able to map it to a face button and summon the folk in battle. 
 If you already have it in your inventory, you'll be leveling it up for greater attack power, an 
 increased health bar, or other advantages. You can also level them up by destroying various stones 
 scattered about and collecting the remnants.  

  The levels are beautiful and take you through war-torn battle zones, lush green fields, bubbly 
 seascapes, and other dazzling worlds. The biggest problem with them is how linear they are -- and 
 how long it takes to load them. The combat areas are generally small arenas connected by narrow 
 corridors. The zones are small, and they are all separated by loading times that are far too long 
 and far too frequent. This can be a huge annoyance because there is such little room for maneuvering, 
 especially when there are multiple large creatures attacking you in these confined spaces. It feels 
 as if an old design necessity has been shoehorned into modern technology, and it doesn't work all 
 that well. It constantly removes you from the game when you just want to be beating up creatures 
 and sucking up their souls. Fortunately, some of these weak levels are held together with fantastic 
 missions that force you to collect a certain creature's id only after you've defeated all the others, 
 or that make you follow a particular folk so you can find the correct door to move to the next 
 section.  

           It's electric. Boogie woogie woogie.      

  There are side quests to take as well. All told, it might take you 20 hours to finish Folklore, 
 depending on how many of these quests you accept and whether you are intent on capturing every 
 single id. However, there is a caveat: Much of the gameplay is repeated, in that you're taking 
 Keats and Ellen into the same areas and fighting the same bosses. Fortunately, there are some differences 
 between the two characters. For example, Keats collects some folk that are different from Ellen's, 
 and will therefore need to use different tactics for boss characters. Another variation is Keats' 
 rage mode, which makes him temporarily invincible. These differences are minor, but they make each 
 character play just differently enough that you won't be too annoyed by the repetition.  

  The storytelling issues and linear environments get in the way, but overall, Folklore is an enjoyable 
 game that spins a good yarn and can be a lot of fun to play. It doesn't make a great first impression, 
 but you should stick with it. After all, you get to suck the souls right out of your enemies. There's 
 something to be said for that.

  Folklore is one of those types of games that come and go. Saying that Folklore was a very enjoyable 
 game to play with a very interesting storyline, but the game itself suffered from a few problems 
 that held it back from being a great title, maybe even an amazing title. Folklore doesn't do a 
 good job at first impressions but if you stick to it and get used to the world of Folklore, you'll 
 find the game more appealing. Folklore requires the use of the SIXAXIS feature as you play thought 
 the game. If you like using SIXAXIS, you may find Folklore being one of (If not only) best titles 
 on the PlayStation 3 that uses that feature. As impressive and beautiful as the background visuals 
 and level designs are in the netherworld, the real world can feel quite dull and depressing looking. 
 The level designs can feel linear as well. Most of the time you'll find yourself in claustrophobic 
 areas and moving along set paths without giving you the freedom to explore. As you progress through 
 the game, you take control of two character where you have the choice to ether play one of them 
 through the game for several chapters and them going back to the other character or, play each 
 character simultaneously which is the best option to appreciate the story more. The story will 
 unravel in a graphics novel type comic book consisting of moving image that requires you pressing 
 a button to move on to the next page with no voice acting. While the graphic novel style aspect 
 can look quite interesting at first sight, there's really no sense of atmosphere with keeping up 
 with the tone of the story and sometime the music can feel out of place with what going on. Folklore 
 is really something you've never seen before and you probably want see anything like it in some 
 time (or again) in terms of game-play. The story is unique and is worth the 6 hours or so game-play. 
 
  
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  *****2. The Plot*****
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  
   Story
  
  I found the plot in Folklore rather interesting to say the least. If you like fantasy stories (Like 
 myself) you may find the story appealing. The plot is probably (I think) the best thing about folklore. 
 You play two characters, Ellen and Keats both trying to solve mysterious events that brought them 
 to a village called, Doolin.
  
  A series of unsolved murders A mysterious telephone call... A letter from a dead mother these 
 peculiar events draw Ellen and Keats to Doolin, a sleepy Irish village that hides a gateway to 
 the Netherworld. The Netherworld is a fantasy place where fairies and other strange and special 
 creators are real. In search for answers, they both must travel to realms beyond our own, seeking 
 the knowledge of the dead by harnessing the power of nightmarish creatures  lost souls known as 
 Folks.
  
  Play each character and solve the mystery by traveling to different realms and worlds to meet the 
 dead, whose memories hold the key to the past.
  
  The story is good and will make you feel at first as if you're playing a murder mystery game instead 
 of a fantasy RPG. The story unravels in a comic book style layout and just like the old RPG days 
 there are a lot of reading required. There are a few cinematic cut-scenes as well as some voice 
 acting but 80% of the games cut-scenes are layout in a comic book style, which require you to read 
 as you press the button to continue on to the next page.
  
  The story is quite unique as it tries to question the philosophical fact of, what happens in the 
 after life. Which make it, (to me) a very interesting story line.
  
  -------------------------------------------------------
  
   Playable Characters
  
  Ellen:
 
  Take control of Ellen, a lost young women desperately trying to find out about herself, as well 
 as her past. Ellen lost her parents at a young age and was brought up in an orphanage. Now a 22-year-old 
 student, she has few memories of childhood save a faint, recollection of her late mother. During 
 her adult life, Ellen has felt a strange sense of unease, thus struggling with self-confidence 
 and friendship. But a letter, arriving mysteriously from the mother she thought was dead, gives 
 her renewed hope, and sets her on a journey to Doolin. 
  
  Keats:
  Take control of Keats, a young man trying to investigate a series of mysterious events. Keats is 
 a reporter for a second-rate occult magazine, "Unknown Realm", and writes skeptical articles usually 
 attempting to rationalize supernatural phenomena. When he receives a mysterious phone cal from 
 a woman in Doolin who claims that fairies are about to kill her, Keats sees perfect diversion from 
 an impending deadline and sets off to investigate.
  
   Other Characters
  
  Scarecrow:
  This halflive shows Ellen the way to the Netherworld. He speaks with the cheerful 
 abandon of a fairytale jester, but his aloofness suggests an eerie insincerity.
  
  Belgae:
  This invisible halflive helps Keats into the Netherworld. The bearer of a sharp intellect, 
 and genteel manners, he appears to serve an unknown authority.
  
  Suzette:
  Young Suzette is the first person Keats and Ellen encounter in Doolin. Suzette is mistrustful of 
 others, and she too seems to have come to Doolin only recently. But, why?
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  The Plot Score 8/10
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  *****3. The Graphics*****
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  
  The visual design as well as the level design are very beautifully modeled and rendered being in 
 the netherworld. In the real world, the village of Doolin however can feel quite dull and depressing, 
 which makes the game less attractive at first sight. The special effects and folk designs are great. 
 Each folk look interesting in it's own way, as well as the characters themselves. 
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  The Graphics Score 8/10
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  *****4. The Game-Play*****
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  
  The game-play requires the use of the SIXAXIS feature as you play through the game. The game-play 
 is fairly easy to play, you move from one realm to the other fighting Folks and absorb their Id 
 (or soul) . Collecting a Folks Id (soul) is necessary in Folklore because there are you're only 
 means of weapons. Absorbing a Folks Id can then be called upon in latter battles. Absorbing an 
 Id from a Folk requires the SIXAXIS. When you attack a Folk a few times, there Id can be seen hovering 
 over there head in a pinky color, which you'll have a certain amount of time to absorb the Id before 
 the Folk regain strength. Absorbing the Id will require you to move, shake and tilt the control. 
 It is a lot of fun to do and later on as you progress, you'll need to perform combos. Ellen and 
 Keats both can absorb Folks, but they each have there own different Folks to collect and fight. 
 Some Folks are resistant against other Folks so you may need to use different Folk and experiment 
 a little bit. There are over 100 Folk to find, collect and use. There 7 chapters to play through 
 which doesn't really put too much into the life value of the game. In the first five chapters you 
 have the choice to play ether Ellen or Keats as you progress. You can play one character from start 
 to finish if you wish, but you may find the story more appealing playing them simultaneously. At 
 the end of every chapter you are taking back to Doolin where you'll have to find the next entrance 
 to the next netherworld. Boss fights are quite challenging but once you know their weak point and 
 what Folks to use, they're pretty easy to take down. The game can feel quite repetitive as you 
 near the end. 
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  The Game-Play Score 7/10
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  *****5. The Sound*****
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  
   Music
  
  The music is not very memorably in the game. Sometimes the music can feel out of tone with what's 
 happening in a scene or game-play. 
  
  -------------------------------------------------------
  
   Sound Effects
  
  Sound effects 
 are good but not really worth going out for surround sound. 
  
  -------------------------------------------------------
  
   Voice Acting
  
  There are 
 a few in-game cut scene with voice acting but there really nothing that great. The voice acting 
 are quite poor, but there are only a few in-game cut scenes so it not really a big of a problem. 
 
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  The Sound Score 6/10
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  *****6. Life Value*****
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  
   Main Story Length
  
  The main story will probably take you about 5 to 6 hours to finish and after the game is done, 
 you can't help but feel that there should have been more.
  
  -------------------------------------------------------
  
   Extra Content
  
  There really 
 is nothing in terms of extra content. You can buy patches from the PlayStation Store, which adds 
 a few additional mission that require you to hunt for Folks, and more costumes. You can play Dungeon 
 Trail which basically require you moving from one area to the next fighting Folk and raking up 
 as much points. 
  
  -------------------------------------------------------
  
   Replay Value
  
  After your first play through, and a few extra hours playing Dungeon Trail, 
 there really isn't much more in the replay value. 
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  Life Value Score 5/10
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  *****7. Final Thought*****
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  
  Folklore to me was a good game that has a very interesting story line and impressive visual design. 
 The game-play did feel repetitive at time and as I near the end of the game I found it quite boring, 
 due to the repetitiveness. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the game, despite the many flows. 
  I would not recommend this game to everyone, but if you like using the SIXAXIS feature, like mystery 
 stories and a simple game-play, you should give Folklore a play.
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  Final Thought Score 7/10
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  *****OVERALL SCORE 7/10*****
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Review:  I really enjoyed playing the mystery portion of this game. It was very entertaining to uncover 
 more of the mystery of Ellen. I must say to be honest it kept me guessing throughout the whole 
 game. While I enjoyed some of the levels and fighting in the game, it mostly just made the game 
 awkward and strange. It also gets a bit repetative, especially since to truly understand everything 
 in the game you need to play both characters. What makes this even worse is that you almost have 
 to play them both in each chapter, I played the level once what makes you think I want to play 
 it again. Even if it does have a different character the second time around and some of the storyline 
 is different. This game should have been more of just a mystery game and had no fighting to it 
 what so ever. I give it a 6.5 because I would suggest this game as something to occupy your time, 
 but it is a bit off the wall and awkward.

Review:  Folklore is truly a sight for sore eyes. Its a brilliantly told story about a girl named Ellen 
 and a guy named Keatz. You can play both sides of their tale.
  
  The cut scenes are shown in several different ways. One of which is a very interesting comic-book 
 style. Each and ever cut scene is well done and tells the part of the story they are telling very 
 well.
  
  In story, theres a murder in Doolin, the town of the dead, and you must find out why there was 
 a murder while finding out about your past.
  
  Gameplay-wise the game plays well both as an action adventure game with RPG elements tacked on 
 which work great. Only problem is that whenever you switch out your powers there's about a 5 second 
 pause in the action.
  
  If you are wondering about the game download or find someone with the demo on their PlayStation 
 3.

Review:  Folklore is one of those odd little games that is destined to be generally dismissed at first, 
 only to be a sought after title down the road. Its a wonderfully unique experience, but one that 
 won't appeal to the casual gamer, and certianly one that is intended for a very specific audience.
 
  
  Essentially, what makes Folklore the type of title that many gamers bypass is exactly the same 
 thing that will impress those whom can appreciate it; its style and method of storytelling is very 
 beautiful and unique, and this might be offputting to the casual gamer. Those whom have a penchant 
 for dark or twisted fantasy atmoshperes and don't mind oldschool presentation methods will find 
 a completely entertaining and rewarding experience.
  
  The game is basically an action-rpg, with a focus on story and real time combat. You'll navigate 
 towns and areas and interact with characters as you would most adventure rpgs, but you'll also 
 have to collect monsters (called "folks") which you will summon into battle, which gives the game 
 its RPG elements. The game honestly has an "oldschool" feel to it, which will be a detrement or 
 bonus, depending on your personal tastes. Personally, I found the return to simplistic design and 
 story driven content to be quite refreshing and entertaining. Thats not to say the game is without 
 its technical merrits, but it essentially boils down to roaming from area to area, summoning the 
 creatures you've obtained, and exploring a fantasy type landscape. The motion control function 
 comes into play as the method of capturing the "essence" of the various creatures or "folks", but 
 other than that the action and gameplay won't surprise you with originality. That said, the gameplay 
 design fits the atmosphere and concept very well, and when combined with its artisitic flair and 
 engrosing story, Folklore becomes a game that rises above the sum of its parts.
  
  Presentation is where the game will either lose you or bewonder you. The story is along the lines 
 of a dark fairy tale, full of intrigue, mystery, and a very unique sense of melancholy seldom seen 
 in games. Where many casual gamers may get lost is in the execution, others may actually see this 
 game as a very unique piece of art. Cutscenes are done in a series of very pleasant but formuliac 
 stills, almost like a comic book. The music sets an earie mood, and the dialogue is well written 
 and entertaining, but you won't find the flashy movie-esque video and voiced sequences. You'll 
 see the scenes play out with voice bubbles and subtle scene changes. This was a deliberate attempt 
 by the developers to offer a unique storytelling method, and while I was able to appreciate it, 
 I can see how it would seem awkward or off-putting to gamers unable to appreciate the style. If 
 you can appreciate this artisitcally odd but beautiful method of storytelling, you'll find yourself 
 surprised at the layers and depth of the story. Also of note is that the story plays out from the 
 perspective of two separate characters who each have thier own motivations, so again, an odd design 
 choice may seem like a deterent or welcome change depending upon your tastes.
  
  Graphically, you won't see a tone here you haven't seen before, but you have to keep in mind that 
 the focus of this game was always intended to be based around the artistic style and the story. 
 Areas are easily navigate and look like you'd expect from a fairy tale, and menu screens and dialogues 
 are well organized. The game plays and looks great, but not astounding, as the combat and visuals 
 are really intended more to support the story than they are to impress by themselves.
  
  Folklore is a wonderfull title, whose intrigueing story is full memorable characters, a unique 
 storytelling method, and truly unique art, but its also a title which may not appeal to casual 
 gamers. Those who are willing to give it a chance will find a very charming and unique experience.

Review:  Folklore is a unique game in that its one of the few that utilizes the six axis controls for your 
 PS3. When you beat enemies you play what's like a mini fishing game to capture the folks of the 
 enemies defeated. You then use these enemies to fight for you and can level them up by catching 
 or defeating more of them. Some are easy others take some work and keep the game from becoming 
 too mundane. The story in folklore is told through two characters in a comic book type text picture 
 method. This really wasn't the best of choices as its kind of confusing and makes that characters 
 have less personality than they would if more voice over was used. You start off and are allowed 
 to choose either Keats or Ellen and play their chapter of the intertwined story. You can play in 
 whatever sequence you want though its best to keep both characters storylines close together. Both 
 characters are fun too use and have strengths and weaknesses One is ranged and more maneuverable 
 the other fights up close and personal. Both have different folks to capture. The enemies or folks 
 as the game calls it are quite interesting. Each level has a theme and enemies to fit the theme. 
 You have to play each level twice and fight the same bosses with each character. So there's lots 
 of backtracking as most quest also send you back to a certain area. The levels are beautifully 
 designed with lots of vivid colors. The combat is fun for the most part. The only issue I found 
 is that in some smaller areas the camera really blinds you. The flying enemies were quite difficult 
 to see and defeat due to the camera angles. The story, though told poorly, is interesting enough 
 too keep you playing just to find out what's really going on. You should get around 20 hours out 
 of the game. You'll get more if you play the online dungeon trials and downloadable quests that 
 the game offers. 
  
  
  
  Good 
  Use of Six Axis
  Nice Music 
  Unique enemies 
  Very vivid colors throughout
  
  Bad 
  Camera can blinds you at times
  Lots of backtracking 
 
  Poor story telling method relies heavily on text
  Flying enemies are difficult to see on screen

Review:  What Folklore does is take a charming concept, add some magic and interesting characters but it 
 takes a wrong turn too often. So, without further ado, the review of Folklore.
  
  Before the story begins, you have to choose a character: the moody but suave occult paper writer 
 Keats or the young, orphaned Alice. Alice suddenly gets a letter from her supposedly deceased mother, 
 which points her to the mysterious town of Doolin. Keats gets a mysterious call from a woman who 
 claims she is being attacked by faeries. He is also pointed to the little town of Doolin. At arrival, 
 the two cross paths and discover an unanimate body on a cliff. It soon falls off the cliff and 
 after checking it out, it appears to be Alice's mother. The story is genuinely interesting in the 
 beginning, and manages to keep you interested for some time, but two faults make the story in the 
 end uninspiring: You pretty much have to go through the game twice with only minor tweaks to story 
 and gameplay, and the ending in the game is by far one of the most confusing ends in gaming. The 
 character's are interesting though and the environments are beautiful and atmospheric. Too bad 
 that the shortcomings are so obvious, though.
  
  The game is an action game, and as such the battles are in real-time. The core gameplay mechanic 
 is using other monsters id's, which are their abilities. You issue them to one of the four basic 
 buttons and are varied in power and length. Some are basic slashing id's, and others require imaginative 
 thinking to use. A lot of them, however, become obsolete when others arrive on the scene. The ingenious 
 part is how you achieve the ids. After damaging the enemies a certain amount, their id pops out, 
 which you then "suck" out. For this, you use the Sixaxis controls in all kinds of ways, which actually 
 play very well and are easy to use. You can then level up the ids by defeating (damaging the enemy 
 until it disappears) certain enemies or collecting a certain amount of ids. Controlling the character 
 can sometimes feel a bit clunky and the jumping can be improved. The enemies are, however, incredibly 
 diverse and fun to fight, and the ids are entertaining and accessible.
  
  Then it's the different characters. The difference is regrettably small. The only real difference 
 is the occasional new id, but otherwise, everything is the same, which makes playing the game twice 
 monotonous and repetitious. There are few games that can pull this off, and Folklore isn't one 
 of them, sadly.
  
  The game looks beautiful, with a bunch of beautiful locations. The enemies look good, the characters 
 as well and the cutscenes, put into a comic book form, are exciting and innovative. The environment 
 is colorful and surreal, but occasionally feel like a reused format. Otherwise, this factor is 
 a plus in the game.
  
  The music is airy and nice, and fits the atmosphere perfectly. However, the music is not that memorable 
 but it's cool while it lasts. Not much else to say.
  
  Just as a side note: The game is pretty easy once you get used to the enemy patterns and movements 
 and some ids are pretty overpowered, but it doesn't really retract from the fun of the game.
  
  If you're looking for a PS3 exclusive that's worth playing, you don't have to look further 
 than Folklore. However, be warned that the game isn't for anyone. So, overall, an engrossing but 
 slightly flawed tale.

Review:  This game is very good. I don't want to rate it a 9 because their are some things that I didn't 
 like that much. 1- The fighting I think it would have been a little better if they were able to 
 fight for their selves especially the guy. 2- I think that when you fight one of your enemies it 
 shouldn't be only like 2 types to beat that enemy because it start to get annoying. Their was more 
 bad things but I want to move on to the good things. 1- I love the story-line and I love all the 
 fantasy that is involved in that game 2- I love Ellen and Keats and I had actually began to feel 
 sorry for them while I was progressing through the game. 3- I like that they had a variety of monsters 
 to pick from. Some thing else that I like about this game is all of the things that you may do 
 when you didn't travel to a realm and you are at that small village. I love all the people in that 
 village and while playing that game you may actually feel connected to them when you reach their 
 part of the story in the game.

Review:  Going into Folklore I didn't know what to expect. I heard good things about the game but I had 
 also it was more mediocre. 
  
  Folklore's story is pretty entertaining. The entire game your trying to find out what happened 
 in the mystery town 17 years ago that the two main characters, Ellen and Keats, go to at the start 
 of the game. Theres some interesting plot twists and some interesting surprises even though some 
 of them are rather predictable. Overall, the story ends on an interesting note and wraps up the 
 characters stories and of course the big mysteries of the events that had transpired in the town.
 
  
  The gameplay is different and thats probably why I enjoyed it so much. Its no Lost Odyssey or Tales 
 of Vesperia but it brings something new to the table. It's kind of like Kameo where you absorb 
 bad guys and then you are able to use their power. Most enemies have different powers (Fire, water, 
 thunder, wind, sleep, etc) . So if you capture a fire baddie and you are now fighting a water baddie 
 you are most likely going to use the fire one to absorb the water one. 
  
  For a 2006 game, the graphics are pretty good. They aren't anything special but they get the job 
 done. The CGI cutscenes look very pretty but of course they are CGI. The gameplay graphics are 
 fine but again nothing spectacular. Framerate holds up fine and the loading times are not too bad 
 but some may find them just a tad too repetitive and lengthy - especially the impatient people.
 
  
  The orchestrated music in the game is fantastic. There are some nice tunes in the game that had 
 be humming everytime they started to play. This is definately one of the highlights of the game. 
 
  
  Overall, Folklore was a great purchase at $30. I put in about 15 hours to complete the story. There 
 are also a bunch of sidequests and some downloadable content if you like replay value. If your 
 an RPG lover or a gamer who loves stories, this game may just be for you because I had a lot of 
 fun with it.

 more time.. maybe its cuz i play a little bit to much but haha I dont care cuz I love it .. and 
 this game is one of my favs :) .. well rpg fans should play that game too and its cool that u have 
 to play with ellen and keat .. plus.. the graphic is good too :) .. viva la ps3 lol .. If you are 
 interested in the "underworld-thing" .. then try this game. It have a different picture of the 
 "underworld" and the "after life". The characters in this Game have all a another story but at 
 the end maybe the same? You have to find it out .. And if you already did than u know what I mean. 
 
  
  Now I wish you fun with playin games and I hope you like this game like I do.

Review:  
  
  "Folklore" is every art fan's idyllic dream. From start to finish, your senses will be engaged 
 in hundreds of sumptuous sights and sounds, beautifully blended in a sea of lush, vibrant colors 
 and moving melodies, each referencing several art movements all at once, from realism to surrealism, 
 minimalism to impressionism. The bundling of layers and layers of cultural and aesthetic influences 
 into this arresting peace of audio-visual fanfare is baffling, to be honest, and its unique artistic 
 expression is surely the main focus of the game. Journeying through its locations is always a breath 
 of fresh air in the polluted aesthetic of the videogame environment, and it's not to wonder, since 
 it comes from a group of artists not commonly associated with videogames, such as the art director 
 Kohei Toda or Kenji Kawai, one of the game's 5 soundtrack composers, known for his work on Mamoru 
 Oshii's animes ("Ghost in the Shell") and Hideo Nakata's movies ("Ringu") . As the authors themselves 
 admit, it's a work heavily inspired by Patrick Woodruff and Roger Dean, Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, 
 amongst many, many other visual artists and composers. It's impossible to find a game that so clearly 
 presents itself as an interactive art lesson, compressed in space and time into this beautiful 
 fantasy story about a little girl named Ellen.
  
  Ellen is all grown up now and lives a normal life, until the day she receives a letter from her 
 long lost mother. Desperately in search for clues concerning her past as a little child, of which 
 she bears no memories, she goes back to her childhood village, Doolin, an island along the Irish 
 coast. There, she becomes aware of her power to travel into the Netherworld, the land where the 
 spirits of the dead roam freely. Searching for her mother, she thus embarks on an allegoric journey 
 into the deep corners of our collective subconscious' dreams concerning death and the after-life. 
 She explores several different interpretations of death, from the lands of the Faery Realm, a curious 
 vision on Celtic mysticism, to the dark halls of Hell Realm, a modern view on religious Inferno, 
 passing through an interpretation on atheist philosophical currents, The Infinite Corridor. Each 
 of these worlds is tightly bound by an unique aesthetic frame, which allows the enormous variety 
 of artistic styles and influences. The tale of the occult and mystic, which weaves these worlds 
 together is interesting, dramatic and well written, even if at times, a tad eccentric for its own 
 good. Delivered through nicely rendered cutscenes, a few FMV's by Shirogumi and a stylized 3D vignette 
 type of cutscene, which mimics graphic novels' framings and mise-en-scene. The only major downfall 
 in the narrative department comes from the lack of voice acting in the vignettes, which are the 
 most prevalent storytelling vehicle in the game. At least, cutscenes and FMV feature good cinematic 
 production values and excellent voice acting.
  
  Where "Folkore's" ambitions are brought back down to earth is in the interaction dimension. A sort 
 of narrative driven action/adventure hybrid with mild rpg elements, "Folklore" never frees itself 
 from the weight brought about by its director, Takashi Shono (director of the "Genji" series) and 
 its executive producer, Yoshiki Okamoto, (who also co-directed the first "Genji" and produced/directed 
 a vast portfolio of classic Capcom games, from "Street Fighter" to "Resident Evil") . Despite the 
 artistic marvel present in the game, the head honchos behind it decided to bring in their knowledge 
 on the ludic genres they knew best, creating a game which revolves too much around mindless grinding 
 and action, specially considering it's a 20 hour experience. The result is an overlong "Onimusha", 
 with repetitive and dull combat, and with a bland level design that's the same for each of the 
 realms you explore in the netherworld. The poor interactive mechanics severely mar the story flow, 
 and systematically impede a proper exploration of the wonderful sets designed by the art department, 
 not to mention that they make little sense in an artsy production such as this.
  
  "Folklore" is an experience like no other, and one that deserves all my love. Its sheer artistic 
 value is enough to capture the spirit of any art enthusiast, and make him dream profusely with 
 such delectable and delicate artwork. However, there's a price to pay for its ambitions: to suffer 
 the tedium of the game's poor combat and mediocre game design, which constantly shatter the otherwise 
 virtuous 3D art museum of "Folklore". But hell, is it a ride worth dying for

Review:  Folklore - one of the worst games i have ever played. The game starts off slowly, and quite frankly, 
 never picks up. You play as 2 characters - either Ellen or Keats, both who's characters are extremely 
 bland and 1-dimensional. the game basically consists of talking to the people of a mysterious village 
 of Doolin and the Netherworld looking for clues about a murder mystery, then going and fighting 
 some mystical creatures called folks, with other folks. the more folks you obtain to use, the more 
 you have to waste time in the menu screen flicking through your inventory finding the folks which 
 are able to kill other types of folks. in order to completely kill a folk, you must 'suck their 
 soul' by rapidly shaking the sixaxis controller - as you can imagine, it is pretty cool the first 
 few times you do it, but the novelty soon wears off. 
  
  In terms of visuals, both worlds seem pretty half baked, with linear paths which you can deviate 
 very little from. the inhabitants of these worlds seem very lifeless also, with limited dialogue, 
 no voice acting and banal appearance leaves you somewhat detached from the world, rather than absorbed 
 in it (like what a REAL rpg would offer) . finally, the story telling almost all happens through 
 still animations resembling comic book strips - this attempts to capture the supposed mystique 
 of the game, but just seems like the developers were trying to cut costs and corners, resulting 
 in a completely unenjoyable experience. 
  
  So, to summarise, The concept was ok, however abysmal character development; poor gameplay; a frustrating, 
 tiresome combat system; lifeless worlds and AI; and poor story telling media make the game a waste 
 of time and money - avoid at all costs

Review:  In folklore, you wander around, aimlessly trapped between two worlds, trying to solve a series 
 of very mysterious mysteries. The storyline is based on two characters, both of which you can play 
 chapter by chapter, or one then the other until you finish the game. The characters overlap each 
 other over the game as they progress throughout the story creating suspense and question of the 
 characters motives until you actually play the other character. Unfortunately, as you thrust yourself 
 headlong into the game, you realize the game play becomes very redundant and repetitive as each 
 character plays through the level. (imagine going through the same very long level twice... the 
 entire game) . On the upside, the plot contains many twists and turns and makes a final exit with 
 a very creative and innovative story ending.

Review:  Okay, let's get this straight before I run off with the usual ticking boxes of a review: Folklore 
 is not the kind of game that will appeal to many. It won't really appeal to many RPG enthusiasts 
 because its pretty linear in a way, and the combat is hack and slash.. and upgrading doesn't really 
 seem to come into play. It won't appeal to straight up action fans though as the hack and slash 
 is no where near constant and the way it plays, you'll find it hard to constantly find new lures 
 in the action side.
  
  So what makes it special? 
  Visually, its not the most impressive game in the traditional sense. But like the plain girl who's 
 somehow the most beautiful in the room, Folklore combines a deep, deep amount of atmosphere and 
 subtle effects to become perhaps more beautiful than the sprawling worlds and graphical nous of 
 more recent PS3 games. Fairy dust twinkles, underwater levels shimmer and bubble, seeds drift from 
 fields and elaborate mazes that enchant and play on every good surrealist theme ever (clocks, mirror 
 images, anyone?) . In fact, the only time you won't go "isn't it beautiful?" is in the purposefully 
 bleak and unpleasant Warcadia level, all muddy browns and war torn expanses.
  
  The sound design compliments it all perfectly, the stirring and eerie music managing to avoid Danny 
 Elfman style twee and genuinely emphasizing the beauty of these skewed worlds. The sound effects 
 create mood subtly but brilliantly, a constant rumble of the sea above in the underwater level, 
 the distant gunfire of warcadia, the subtle noises of each of the folk you capture.. Instead of 
 a grating distinctive noise each time you use the folk, you are instead greeted with a quiet but 
 effective sound effect if needed. 
  
  
  But its mainly the story that astounds with Folklore. I challenge you not to get drawn into the 
 murder mystery/supernatural plot, because, truth be told, its more engrossing than 90% of any other 
 game's stories. Okay, so actual cutscenes are few and far between, the story generally being played 
 out in soundless comic strip cutscenes.. But its hugely immersive and the fact I've spent months 
 dipping in and out should tell you its a game to last..
  
  
  But, alas faults are on their way. The way I've dipped in and out should betray the ultimate flaw. 
 This is a game that I've clocked up around 6 hours on in the space of months since its release. 
 It simply is not a game to sit and play through, its one to dip in and out of. Perhaps this is 
 because the largely voiceless story and immersive storyline can make you feel like you're reading 
 a book, and the gameplay can be frustrating. A strange distance is felt whilst playing, and when 
 the eventual action kicks off its difficult to match with the otherwise relaxed atmosphere, in 
 fact most of the time I found myself wishing I could just get on with the story rather than fighting 
 another horde of enemies.
  
  Nevertheless, it is possible to bypass these enemies- but often you'll need at least one of their 
 souls to use as a weapon for a later boss (or Folklore as they are called) . 
  
  Overall, its a game thats difficult to describe. My advice is download the demo from the playstation 
 store as it pretty much perfectly illustrates the game for you, from the real world into the fairy 
 world, and some of the combat. Just be warned that the path-battle arena-path style gameplay is 
 applied for the rest of the game.. But with variations, obviously. 
  
  Its a fantastic experience, just whether it can truely be classed as a game for the modern generation 
 is debateable. Its an absolute gem, and one that I think many people will delight in discovering.

Review:  I was highly anticipating to play this game when it first came out because i'm a big fan of the 
 rpg's , but i managed to buy and play it for a year later, so what i think about it? Mmmm... i 
 would say that it kinda dissapointed me. Is not a bad game but i don't know, i expected more. The 
 gameplay gets repetitive and boring right when you begin to play. The most entertaining time i 
 would say that was with the bosses. It's true that the sixaxis use in this game is essential but 
 don't add that much fun.
  I think that this game try so hard to be revolutionary in the gameplay and i think that's exactly 
 the reason that falls short. 
  Also the story is lame. The dialogues are very cheesy and don't will keep you interested. 
  In 
 the end i finished the game without having much fun playing it. It was more like a duty to get 
 free from it and forgetting as soon as possible.
  To finish i want to say rent it first. DON'T BUY IT like i did, because if you don't like it you 
 will regret it spending money on this thing. Oblivion is the one and only great rpg out there right 
 now for the ps3 until the almighty Final Fanyasy XIII cames out next year.

Review:  Folklore is one of those games that not many people know about, and even fewer own. However, it's 
 a game that's more than worthy of your attention, if you have the patience.
  
  The story begins by introducing you to the two main characters; Ellen, a young blonde woman who 
 recieved a letter from her presumed dead mother, and Keats, a journalist for a paranormal magazine. 
 Keats recieves a phone call around the same time Ellen recieves her letter, and they are both sent 
 to the tiny cliffside village of Doolin, Ireland, where they find a woman dead, and most likely 
 murdered. And so the story begins, with both Ellen and Keats attempting to decode this murder mystery, 
 and discover why exactly they were both called to this small town.
  
  The answers to these questions can only be found one way, and that is by speaking to the dead themselves. 
 Lucky, then, that Doolin is no ordinary town. Doolin has within it a portal to the Netherworld; 
 the land of the dead. Keats and Ellen must traverse this gorgeous, but dangerous realm in search 
 of the answers they are looking for, and there are many questions that needs answers. Where is 
 Ellen's mother? Who was the lady that was killed? Who killed her? Those and more questions will 
 arise as the plot progresses. In fact, eventually you will be trying to answer not only these questions, 
 but you will be called upon to save the Netherworld itself.
  
  Though much of your time will be spent attempting to decode these mysteries, much of it will also 
 be spent protecting yourself against the dangers in the Netherworld. And it's your time spent in 
 combat that is the most satisfying part of the game. The combat system is fun and deep; throughout 
 the Netherworld there roam numerous folks, which resemble fantastical creatures that could only 
 be thought up in your imagination. Defeat the creature, and you will be able to capture it's Id; 
 it's soul, in other words. Each Id you capture will allow you to use that folk's Id in battle. 
 For instance, defeating and capturing the Id of a bug like creature that sprays fire at it's enemies, 
 and you will be able to let loose a copy of that creature to attack any enemies you happen to run 
 into. It's a great system, and loads of fun.
  
  Of course, with so many possibilities for attacks, it would make sense that some work better against 
 certain enemies than others. That is explained to you in a little journal of sorts. You will recieve 
 pages as you go along, filled with pictures showing which creatures are vulnerable to which attacks. 
 You will need to utilize this in order to defeat the most difficult foes you will encounter, the 
 Folklore. The Folklore are large, difficult foes that normally take more than one strategy to defeat, 
 and it will be necessary to defeat them in order to venture further into the Netherworld. There 
 are 7 realms, each one venturing further from the last; the first is a beautiful image of a possible 
 heaven, yet later on you will be braving the landscape of areas that represent Hell itself.
  
  The way you capture Ids is another great gameplay element. This is one of the few games that 
 utilizes the six-axis in a fun way; when capturing an enemy's Id, you will see that creatures soul 
 float above it in red. Lock onto the soul, and flick the six-axis upwards to literally yank the 
 soul out of the creature itself. Larger creatures are more difficult; their souls will grow green, 
 and turn red randomly. You can only attempt to capture it when it is red, and you have to time 
 it right. This will almost always take many pulls to fully capture, but it's a fun and intuitive 
 use of the six-axis and an interesting way of gaining new weapons, if you will.
  
  Overall, Folklore is a great game, filled with beautiful scenery, funny, likeable characters, and 
 a storyline that only gets more interesting as it moves along. It's truly a gem that's just sitting 
 out there waiting to be picked up. So do yourself a favor, and give this game a try.

Review:  This game does not require a lengthy review. Lets just say that I personally feel that this game 
 is highly underrated as I NEVER heard a single thing about this game and just by chance happened 
 to see it at blockbuster. I found it very interesting! The game play is, for lack of a less common 
 term, great! You fight using the abilities of your vanquished enemies and you must learn how to 
 use them in different given situations. Plus all the boss have weakness' that you MUST exploit... 
 It really makes you think. It's unlike any other action RPG where you just take your weapons and 
 hack away... Plus, your weapons get stronger if you satisfy certain criteria. It make you more 
 in charge of how you play the game. I'll admit that the story is blah and quite predictable. However, 
 another great thing about this is all the content that you can download. For a little over 15 bucks 
 you can get 12 additional members for BOTH characters and 3 additional weapons for both characters... 
 That's 24 new missions and 6 new weapons to play with... Plus new costumes which I could care less 
 about. There are even some content that is free.
  
  In the end, it's a very good game and although I have not yet beaten it, I can't comment on it's 
 replay value, but I'm quite sure that I could use this as a quick lets kill some things and have 
 fun game seeing as how the story is a little lacking. Honestly, also, due to the average LOW score 
 on video game websites and almost NO news of this game (no hype) I found it deserving of more attention. 
 Not 100% positive if it's worth buying for everyone (will be for me) , but it is definitely worth 
 a rent. You just might be surprised... hell, you might even enjoy the story...

Review:  A JRPG Exclusively to the PS3 and it under-played but none the less its awesome. think of this 
 game as the "Chaos Legion" of next gen.
  
  People thought Chaos legion was a failure when infact i found it to be better then the DMC series. 
 
  
  All in all i dont wanna say to much because folklore is very strong story-wise, if your a PS3 owner 
 and love JRPG's I strongly think you guys should give this one a go, the word "Fantasy" has never 
 been so strongly shown in a next gen game before until folklore came around.
  
  All in all...
  
  Graphics-8 out of 10- it could have been better being a 2007 PS3 exclusive, 
 none the less it was a beautyiful game, i cant wait for games like Final Fantasy XIII and Final 
 Fantasy Versus XIII to truly show what the PS3 can do though.
  _____
  
  Presentation-10 out of 10- The world of folklore is an awesome one the in-game battle system is 
 solid, the characters (even though there are VERY FEW of them) are all interesting to some degree 
 and it all meshs well even the creatures AKA fareys looked unreal.
  _____
  
  Sound-9.5 out of 10- This games sound effect were immense the voice acting for the two lead characters 
 sounded like newcommers to voice acting so thats why im cutting them some slack, but the music 
 and battle sounds were downright awesome!
  
  _____
  
  Gameplay-9 out of 10- Awesome gameplay, think DMC and Kingdom hearts sept toned down action and 
 more clarity of thought when fighting, also the two main characts ellen and keats have two diffrent 
 styles of gameplay even though they share many folks, many of which being Ellen seems to be more 
 nimble and has attacks to slow down or make the foes weaker she also seems to take alot of damage 
 due to the cloack most likely, while Keats is Over powered with insane damage fast attacks and 
 crazy combos that are hard for foes to take, he also has a exclusive power "Transend" were he becomes 
 literaly invisable for a short time and all his attack turn into AOE attacks blowing everything 
 around him away in  you name it, Yet with 
 all this power he has he seems to take more damage then ellen in during certain fights and certain 
 foes. All in all a great battle system that imo i can relate to i just wish they had finsher moves 
 or "Reations" like Kingdom hearts has, basicly meaning moments were things slow down and you have 
 to press buttons such as circle or square really fast and you do a really "Flashly" move dealing 
 great damage or instant K. O. just like what SCIV is doing in there latest installment... although 
 thats a Fighting game with JRPG elements so i guess that does not count.
  _____
  
  Lasting Appeal-7 out of 10- Although granted this game is unreal and overall awesome unless you 
 download the Bonus add on content (Which is ALOT if you have the cash) then yes it'll last alot 
 longer but i dont have the cash now so right now its in the air, although if they ever offer more 
 Free DLC go straight for it its sweet.
  _____
  
  OVERALL-~8.5~- out of -~10~- 
  
  Final note: Its a great PS3 Exclusive game thats Highly underappreciated, i for one am still enjoying 
 it, lets just hope sony decides to make a Sequel or another JRPG Exclusive title for the PS3, Although 
 all we need is the Two big bad Final Fantasy XIII Dou more JRPG's from sony would be nice aswell. 
 since Tri-Ace And Square enix seem to be spitful towards Sony as of late. *Sigh*
  
  Atleast there working on Final Fantasy XIII More faster now, so until then Enjoy folklore its a 
 game that falls into the list of chaos legion.

Review:  If the PS3 is short on one thing it's RPG's. Enchanted Arms was ok (underrated even) , Oblivion 
 has been well received but other than that there really isn't much choice for gamers.
  
  Many hardcore RPG fans may argue that Folklore isn't really an RPG, for one it can be finished 
 in 10-15 hours instead of the standard 40 hour mark and it's quite action heavy.
  
  The story sits uncomfortably between a murder mystery and a fantasy tale. The settings are the 
 Netherworld and the small village of Doolin off the coast of Ireland.
  
  You play as two characters: Ellen who has come to the island after receiving a letter from her 
 long forgotten, thought to be dead mother and as Keats, a smarmy journalist from an occult magazine. 
 They both get caught up in investigating the mysterious deaths that keep occurring in the village. 
 You can play up to Chapter 5 with one character and then you will need to play as the other to 
 progress past here. The best way to go through is by completing a chapter with each character as 
 you go. They will both visit a place called the Netherworld, populated with faeries, folk (the 
 games bad guys) and Folklore (bosses) . These areas are full of bizarre characters which Tim Burton 
 would be proud of in particular the ones that hang around the village pub at nightfall. The cutscenes 
 are few and far between, instead the story is told via comic-book style frames and speech bubbles, 
 it all feels a bit last-gen to be honest.
  
  The graphics start well with the opening cutscene and the first Faery Realm is a gorgeous explosion 
 of colour, in particular the Road of Daru that bears a resemblance to the Otherworld in Final Fantasy 
 X. It's a bit downhill from here though. The Warcadia level is just dull shades brown and the Undersea 
 City miserable blue and greens.
  
  There are a few too many loading screens between each area but if you use the install option (1GB) 
 they'll only last a few seconds.
  
  The story is poor but the gameplay really shines. Every time you defeat a folk for the first time 
 they are added to your collection. You do this by grabbing their id. This involves beating an enemy 
 until you see a fuzzy red ghost image above them, then holding down R1 and snapping your pad towards 
 you to yank it out.
  
  This is one of the only games on the PS3 where the motion sensitive controls of the Sixaxis pad 
 actually work. Bigger folk and bosses will require more than a simple flick to yank out their id. 
 Some will require you to time it when it flashes red, or you'll need to rock the pad from side-to-side 
 in a rhythm to bash the id against the ground, or tilt it gently to balance it or just give it 
 a good shaking. Once you have collected a few you need to assign one to each of the face buttons 
 on the pad. Each one of them will perform a different action. Some will be a quick combo attack, 
 or a slow but powerful one. Others may produce a flaming or other elemental attack while others 
 may cause a status change, for example the sea creature that sprays a gluey mucus to slow down 
 a speedy foe or the strange dog-like folk that distracts the curious imps.
  
  A blue bar determines how many attacks you can use, the more powerful the action the more Action 
 Points will be used. Combo attacks take up very little whereas calling in the heavy artillery of 
 the spider-like tank folk will use up around half the bar. This AP bar refills after a few seconds 
 as Ellen and a bit faster when playing as Keats.
  
  The other advantage Keats has is his 'Rage Mode.' This is an extra bar that builds up with each 
 attack. When full you can enable it by clicking L3 and R3 sending him into a more powerful and 
 invincible state. It doesn't last long and it takes so long to build up you'll probably forget 
 about it.
  
  While the two characters share the same levels they sometimes take a different path and are rewarded 
 some different abilities for their folk collection.
  
  The highlight of the game is undoubtedly the Folklore boss battles that often can only be defeated 
 by using specific folk. Scattered throughout the realm are book pages that have illustrations depicting 
 how the legends say Folklore and tougher enemies can be defeated. For example, the first boss has 
 tentacles that suck up anything around it, so send out your spiky folk which will clog up its pipes, 
 followed by a folk that uses its horns to slice, chopping off the tentacles. This is followed by 
 using a wind folk to expose the vulnerable area on its back so you can unleash your Imps combo 
 attacks. Keats faces the same bosses but with different abilities and folk to fight with, so this 
 keeps it feeling fresh.
  
  There is a wealth of extra downloadable content available on the PSN store. Each set usually involves 
 a new costume for Ellen and Keats, some new folk and a new quest. There are also two extra folk 
 that you can download for free, but you'll drop them from your team pretty quick. There is a dungeon 
 editor for you to create your own areas populated with your own choice of enemies. You can then 
 post these online challenging people to beat them. This and the side quests will help to squeeze 
 some extra life out of the short main story mode.
  
  The gameplay of Folklore is considerably better than the story and the Sixaxis motion sensor is 
 unique and works brilliantly. Game Republic should take this and run with it in a completely different 
 story and they could come up with a true classic.

Review:  One of the first elements of the game that struck me was the comic book style in which scripted 
 scenes are carried out. I liked the slant on this, as opposed to fmv sequences or other overused 
 mediums for delivering the story, this was a welcome addition and evoked feelings of the old detective 
 comic strips like dick tracy I used to read when i was younger.
  
  The Folk capturing system is highly innovative and makes excellent use of the motion sensing controller. 
 The folks themselves are very interesting with excellent character design. The boss fights are 
 incredibly fun with impressive detail. The stages are engaging and the music does well to set the 
 mood. Overall an excellent game.
  
  The game is a tad short, even with playing through the game with both keats and ellen completion 
 time clocks in around 15 hours or so. However, if you wish to capture every folk and get every 
 item this will increase. 
  
  Replay value is moderate, i enjoyed the story so much that it warrents a second playthrough but 
 probably wont for the average joe.
  
  If you are a fan of RPG's I highly suggest adding this game to your collection.

Review:  Folklore, as I see it, is one of the best games on the PlayStation3, for so many reasons~~!!!!!!! 
 They are as follows:
  
  The story:
  Pure suspense! You choose to play as either Ellen, a young woman seeking her dead mother, who mailed 
 her saying that she isn't dead, or Keats, a reporter who works for a magazine called "Unknown realms"
 
  With both of them having their own different side of the story, their own fighting style, and 
 their own intentions of going to the Netherworld [The world of the Dead] I'd definitely recommend 
 playing with both!
  I mentioned that both of them go to the Netherworld, this is the place where they talk to the dead 
 people, and the creatures [Folks] who live there, each realm of the Netherworld has its own Folks, 
 and and they aren't allowed to trespass to the other realms, however, the king of a certain realm 
 will send a number of his people with you when you go to the next realm to "help" you, but, is 
 that really is intention? Will Ellen ever find her mother? Will Keats find what he's looking for? 
 Yep! Those are not the only questions you face, you'll also be asking yourself loads of questions 
 regarding cases of troubled characters you meet. Yay for murder investigations!
  
  Gameplay:
  During the day, you'll be in Ellen's village [Doolin] where you'll be talking to the 
 people of the village, looking for clues, and getting your ticket to the Netherworld, yes, you 
 can't go to the Netherworld just like that, you have to obtain what they call "momento" which is 
 something that belongs to the dead person, and given to you by a family member of the dead person 
 who has unfinished business with this family member. Yep! you work as a messenger between those 
 who are living, and the dead ones =D
  Now during nights, you go to the Netherworlds, where you get the action part of the game! You beat 
 Folks, then absorb their souls using the sixaxis controller, and BOOM! You can use this Folk as 
 a weapon now! by going to your Folks menu, then give the Folk you want a button to use it "O, X 
 triangle or square" You can have as much Folk combination as you can imagine ^__^ There are also 
 sub-bosses, whom you have to defeat then absorb their souls~~!! And you'll most likely use them 
 against bosses! But how do you know which to use against which? Dooon't worry!! You'll be given 
 pages of a book revealing the boss's weak point using the sketches and drawings in the page! =D
 
  
  The graphics / presentation / design:
  Folklore's polygonal graphics are simply amazing! The environments are beautiful and the characters 
 are gorgeous! All the Folks look like fairies from fairy tales!
  You have pre-rendered cutscenes with a little poor voice acting ^__^;; but the amazing graphics 
 makes you forget that!
  The voice acting isn't much of a factor in this game as most of the cutscenes are't pre-rendered, 
 but they look like a comic book, showing you pictures of the events, with bubbles containing what 
 the character says.
  
  The sound:
  Magnificent! The soundtrack makes you feel like your inside a fairy tale story book!!
  
  This 
 game is a must-BUY!!!!!! =D PS. Keats is hot! *loves*

Review:  this game is just simply awesome,
  
  the gameplay is controlled like a game like kingdom hearts, but the way is you attack is you use 
 creatures you absorbed, I wont spoil any, but the first two that you get at the beginning act as 
 a shield and a weapon.
  
  the graphics look inchanting, as every bazarre creature looks impressive and fantastic.
  
  
 the voice acting isnt the best, but its not bad either.
  
  the music is really good as well.
  
  the story is split between comic book segments, there 
 is cutscenes, but they don't happen often, the comic book like way the game uses evens out the 
 story well anyway.

Review:  I was apprehensive about buying Folklore for the longest time. I had played through the demo a 
 couple of times, and I just wasn't sure if the story or gameplay appealed to me. FInally, I decided 
 it was worth a purchase, and it was well worth the time and money.
  
  Folklore is a unique game unlike many games that all seem to follow a very similar path. The story 
 is a dreary, murder mystery that will have you hooked from start to finish. The gameplay is very 
 enjoyable as well. It reminds me a little of a game on the Gamecube called Lost Kingdoms, but Folklore 
 is much more refined. Using Folks "mosters" to defeat other Folks is very engaging and will have 
 you constanly wanting to find the next.
  
  Graphics - Like many have stated, technically the graphics aren't amazing. They are above average, 
 but not amazing for the PS3. The art style is where the game shines. Each realm of the Netherworld 
 is gorgeous, and the town of Doolin fits the atmosphere so well, it's amazing. Near the end of 
 the game, I felt like I was leaving a place I had been for years. It's a lovely little town regardless 
 of the torrid past it has. The characters and Folks are all very unique and look great. The animation 
 is nothing to complain about.
  
  Gameplay - I don't need to tell you how the game plays. You can watch videos, or play the demo, 
 but if you're like me, don't judge the demo as a final product. The "folk collecting" gameplay 
 gets very addictive after a couple of hours, and the Folk you gain have some very useful, and for 
 a lack of a better term, cool looking moves. Collecting information on the murders in the town 
 of Doolin was a very enjoyable part of the game for me as well.
  
  Sound - The sound is great in my opinion. Although, there weren't alot of voiceovers, the voice 
 overs we do get are great, and add alot to the story, and the music is just great. I will remember 
 music from Folklore for years to come.
  
  Story - Excellent. If you enjoy a supernatural/murder mystery, you should be all over Folklore. 
 Some people may hate the comic book style cutscenes with no voiceovers, but I thought it was a 
 very unique way to tell a story, and I loved it. It was a gamble on the developers part, but it 
 paid off for people such as myself.
  
  Overall - If you're on the verge of buying Folkore, and you don't know what to do, just buy it. 
 I doubt you will regreat it. The graphics are lovely, the gameplay is fun, and the story is excellent. 
 A true PS3 gem that will get lost in the crowd. It's sad, because Folklore is truly a 9/10.

Review:  Pros:
  
  -Excellent story line.
  -Great character and monster desings.
  -Both colorful and at the same time "dark" graphics. (In other words... great XD )
  -Good soundtrack
 
  -Great use of Sixaxis control.
  -Fun boss battles.
  
  Nuetral: (Can go either way)
  
  -The two character system. 
  
  Cons:
  
  -Normal battless can get a bit repetitve...
 
  
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  
  This is my first game for the PS3. Saying that... I was REALLY impressed. From the graphics to the 
 gameplay, everything seemed almost "fantastic." The strongest point in Folklore is definitely it's 
 story. (I'm just going to say that so I won't spoil much...) The gameplay is also really good. 
 It uses a good variety of sixaxis controls, from moving it up and down, to left and right, and 
 shaking it rapidly. Boss battles are also fun. There sort like "puzzles" in which you have to find 
 their elemental weakness, where to hit them... that sort of thing...
  
  It does have a two character system in which you choose between two characters after a chapter 
 is completed (you eventually have to finish both.) Both characters have to go through the same 
 dungeon and mostly the same enemies sadly. The only good thing, is a different side of the story 
 is seen with the two characters.
  
  Lastly, normal battles can get a liitle repetitve... they are just a bit too numerous that I found 
 myself skiipping them after a while...
  
  Overall a great RPG for the PS3, and a must get.

Review:  I played it first as a demo. At first I think it's kinda boring 'cause of the comic 
  book story telling. I'm not an RPG player but as a play the game i got more 
  in to it. It reminds 
 me of pokemon, like collecting all the ids is very fun. And price is good too. i bought it 2 weeks 
 ago for 40 euros. and lots of missions to download on psn store. so what else i can say, great 
 graphics, not so very good story telling on the Doolin murders. but it's worth trying. i like the 
 way it looks and the game play is just fine. i wish they'll do a sequel or a prequel for this great 
 game. one thing the slags is that it turns out that you will have to play the game twice, they 
 should add more realms and folks. It could have been better if they also give keats more costumes 
 like ellen. It lacks cinematic cgi cuts, instead they placed these comic book type story telling 
 style. It's making it so lifeless. They should also make a way to travel beetween realms alot simpler 
 rather that doing those slow walks.

Review:  Folklore is a action rpg by the same people that brought you genji days of the blade. You take 
 the role of two characters. A young girl in search of her dead mother and a young man who works 
 as a journalist for an occult magazine. The gameplay consists of you traveling through different 
 worlds battling enemies known as folks. The weird unique characteristic about the game is that 
 you can obtain a folks power by absorbing their soul. YOu do this with the sixaxis controller and 
 it all works very well. There are different ways you must capture a soul depending on which one 
 it is. In the first 2 worlds It will be just mostly lifting the controller up while holding R1. 
 The more souls you capture and use the stronger that particular folk will become depending on the 
 criteria needed. Some folks can get an extra hit extended to their combo and some just get more 
 powerful in terms of strength. The one thing that is annoying about the game is that you have to 
 play each level twice, once as the girl ellen and then again as the man keats. While keats might 
 have some different folks during his chapters of the game as well as different uses for some of 
 the same ones, there is not much of an impact on gameplay. The one cool thing Keats can do is turn 
 into a demon and do a cool fast hit multiple combo and you an a huge bomb like explosive attack 
 which spreads out pretty far and can have a different element put on the attack depending on which 
 folk it is. There isn't much voice acting or any over the top cinematic scenes like in Uncharted 
 or Ratchet and Clank, but the story is presented pretty well considering it's theme. I mean yes 
 it is the PS3 and there probably should have been more cut scenes and so on to make the story seem 
 cooler, but it isn't bad. The story itself is pretty deep if you don't lose track of what is going 
 on and it can act as a symbol of how society in real life is a lot of the time. The other problem 
 with the game is that it is only about 15 hours long. There is a level editor mode which is fun 
 for a little while, but won't last an extremely long time. You can make long hallways with large 
 rooms and that is pretty much it. You place folks to battle in the rooms and set a time limit. 
 You have go online to play other people's levels in order to gain points to add new folks to your 
 own levels and battling like this can teach you to how to use your folks really well. The other 
 problem with this game is that the side quests are kind of boring and don't really task you to 
 do too much. The characters in the side quests each have their own personality and it can be fun 
 to read what they say. After you find all the folks within a given area of the game, there will 
 be a hidden one with each character for you to get. They can be quite tough to defeat and sometimes 
 it does take some thinking. If you are an RPG fan with an interest in political, philisophical, 
 or psychological type ideas, then don't miss out on this great game.

Review:  Folklore is a game that sets you up for an awesome adventure through the opening movie and presentation 
 of the first chapter, but it takes a while to really grow on you and suck you in. If you give the 
 game a chance, it will suck you in though without a doubt. I really love the characters in the 
 game, and the voice acting is well done, but for a PS3 game it really falls short in what should 
 have been done to push the next-gen capabilities. My favorite aspect of the game has to be collecting 
 Folks for fighting, it makes me feel like Pokemon meets Kingdom Hearts. Kind of. While the battle 
 mechanics can get repetitive after a while, I felt like there was enough involved with the Folks 
 to keep me interested in the game. It does feel very linear though, so be warned about that, and 
 also be aware that you will be playing through the game as two main characters. You can choose 
 to play the characters and their chapters in any manner you wish, but it's probably best to stick 
 to alternating characters at each chapter so the story syncs up and you don't forget earlier parts 
 when you go back to a different chapter closer to the beginning of the game. It makes the game 
 more interesting to see the scenes play out from two completely different perspectives, but at 
 the same time can become a little repetitive to replay scenes for a second time.
  
  My biggest complaint about the game is the text-based presentation of the story. When there are 
 animated sequences and voice acting in the game it is an amazing treat, but be aware that this 
 is not as frequent as you would expect especially for a PS3 title. It kind of reminds me of the 
 original Tomb Raider in that aspect, there wasn't very much when it came to music but when you 
 finally got some music it was an awesome treat that made you want to hear more. Although, I am 
 not so unforgiving that the fact that Folklore chooses to present the story in a comic book style 
 manner using text over sound to unfold the mysteries of Doolin Village affects how much I enjoy 
 the game, but the fact that the font is extremely difficult to read does. After the second night 
 of owning the game I searched the menus for an option to change the font face or increase the size, 
 I even went online looking for a way to do this. But, without any luck I have resorted to playing 
 the game strictly on the largest television I own and when I am fully awake. I don't have glasses 
 or contacts, nor do I need them, but I just cannot under any circumstances read the font used in 
 Folklore for every aspect of the game, especially if I am tired. I will just choose a different 
 game if that is the case. 
  
  Overall I really enjoy Folklore and I am glad it is a part of my PS3 library. For one of the few 
 RPG's available to the console, it isn't a disappointment and I think that if you are looking for 
 something to tie you over until Metal Gear releases, this is the perfect pick!

Review:  If you ever asked "Why do you play video games?" and your response is "To drift away and do nothing 
 for a few hours other than fight creatures in a fantasy world" then Folklore is the game for you...
 
  
  The game lets you go through a Journey to seven incredibly vibrant realms, all uniquely designed 
 and tailored to fit their distinct personalities. From the ruins of the Undersea City to the never-ending 
 maze of the Endless Corridor, each destination is different from the next.
  
  Inspired by western fairy tales, you will interact or clash against a cast of over 100 originally 
 designed creatures, and monsters. Using the SIXAXIS wireless controller, you will have to battle 
 monsters and shake them into submission and get their powers from them. The absorbed powers will 
 be used to capture or defeat the monsters that lie ahead.
  
  You will begin the game as either Keats or Ellen and learn their story and gameplay style. Keats 
 uses traditional direct attacks while Ellen uses strategic methods to trap her enemies. Decisions 
 made in one story line will directly impact the story path of the other. 
  
  Finally, Folklore is indeed graphically superb (very HD TV friendly!) . The graphics will keep you 
 hooked on Folklore for hours on end, the gameplay can sometimes be a little bit slow. But those 
 times are few and very minimal, as 99% of the time you'll be loving every second of what Folklore 
 has to throw at you.

Review:  For being one of the best looking games on the PS3 this one is a huge disappointment. Watching 
 the trailer for this game made me think it was a winner. After playing it for a few hours I just 
 wanted it to end already. The story seems to drag on forever!!! Just tell me who killed who already!! 
 It takes an hour to explain one stupid little detail. The game play is ok in parts but overall 
 is pretty week. On the plus side this games graphics are phenomenal. The graphics are what sucked 
 me into buying it. If you are looking for a good RPG play Oblivion not this. This is not a terrible 
 game but not a great one either. I'm not a fan of the whole Pokemon thing with the cards and all 
 of that garbage so maybe that is why I don't care for this game. If you dig that sort of thing 
 than you probably will enjoy this one.

Review:  This game starts off with some beautifully animated and voice acted cut scenes. It really draws 
 you into it from the start.
  
  When you eventually gather the first of your "folks' and enter into your first battles, you'll 
 be amazed and awed by these spirits that you can release upon your foes. Some of these spirits 
 are quite large and all of them have unique attacks.
  
  Animation in this game is beautiful, as are many of the character and level designs. Combat while 
 using Ellen has a graceful but deadly feel, while fighting with Keats feels bestial, which gives 
 a nice twist to playing two different characters. Also, a few folk have different attacks varying 
 on which character is using them.
  
  Boss battles are generally entertaining, focusing on using the right Folk to damage the enemy enough 
 so they they will go into "phase 2 form" as with many bosses from other action RPG's, bosses have 
 various forms witch require different strategies to beat.
  
  Unlike some recent games, ie. Devil May Cry 4, where the bosses' second stages make them exceptionally 
 tougher, faster, and more deadly... most of the bosses here will simply make you change tactics 
 and perhaps harry you a little more.
  
  The story is relatively entertaining and easy to follow, especially since you see and do everything 
 twice, once as Ellen and then a second time as Keats.
  
  When you play this game, you're going to want to play each chapter as Ellen first and then as Keats 
 to get the most out of the story. This is because Keats' usually makes judgments on situations 
 that turn out to be correct, while Ellen usually questions everything that occurs. It feels more 
 natural to play as Ellen with a questioning mind and then as Keats with an introspective view.
 
  
  The few problems with this game are relatively minor. The first being that many of the Folks are 
 practically useless and you will find yourself using some of the same folks throughout the entire 
 game.
  
  The second being the simple matter that the game doesn't force you to play each level with both 
 characters before moving on. This might seem like a good idea to give the player freedom, but in 
 reality it can actually be detrimental to the story.
  
  Overall, Folklore is a beautiful game that is entertaining to play... and as one of the few PS3 
 games to have gotten extra Dowloadable Content packs (New levels, missions, realms, and folks) ... 
 this game is a must buy for anyone looking for a good Action RPG on the PS3.

Review:  Initial reviews of this game were middling while later reviews steadily grew in appreciation. This 
 may point up an issue with mechanics of reviews in
  general: people that speed through games often just don't get the best impression of them. This 
 game does take a while to truly savor.
  
  The story revolves around Ellen, a young girl with no knowledge of her past.
  She receives a 
 mysterious letter offering her information about her past is she comes to Doolin, a small Irish 
 village with a reputation for the supernatural. At the same time Keats, a world-weary reporter 
 for a third-rate paranormal investigation magazine is called to the same village.
  
  They arrive to find that the person who apparently called them both has been murdered. They both 
 decide to stay and investigate further. Throughout the game you can switch between Keats and Ellen 
 (although not at will, you must wait for chapter breaks) . 
  
  Doolin forms the hub of activities. It's small area to explore (less than a dozen locations featuring 
 perhaps eight residents with whom you'll be getting very familiar) but personable. Luckily the 
 residents don't seem that worried about the murder (and soon, murders) that are taking place so 
 you have time to enjoy the scenery.
  
  Soon, however, both Ellen and Keats discover that, when night falls, they can enter various magical 
 "netherworlds" where they become involved in an ancient conflict which (of course!) has implications 
 for Ellen's false memories. The fundamental parts of the game take place in these worlds, six in 
 total and each with completely unique designs and characters. The worlds are, we're told, physical 
 manifestations of humankinds thoughts about death and the many creatures, or "folks", which inhabit 
 them are created from the dying energies of mankind.
  
  To advance you must traverse these worlds and defeat the many folks which populate them. When a 
 folk is weakened sufficiently their "Id" (or souls, in the Japanese) will appear: a ghostly red 
 shadow of themselves which you can capture. Capturing Ids allows you to use that folk for attack 
 (or, in some cases, defense) . The motion controls of the SIXAXIS is used for capturing ids: a quick 
 flick up will capture the ids of most rank and file folks while for larger foes and bosses use 
 one (or more) motion mini-games.
  
  None of these motion control segments take very long (although some must be done while under attack 
 from other enemies adding an additional element of strategy to some encounters) and most are very 
 satisfying. You may have to "slam" the id back and forth or jerk on the controller when the id 
 changes color or shake it when the id shakes. The controls never feel overdone or tacked on and 
 make for a nice break from the normally clenched gameplay.
  
  After capturing an id that folk will be available for use. There are dozens and dozens of creatures 
 and a huge amount of strategy in their use. There's basic elemental concerns (water creatures work 
 best against fire creatures for example) and more esoteric properties (some creatures "slash" while 
 others "destroy" and still others can "Charm" or cause sleep and, of course, certain foes are more 
 susceptible to different forms of attack) . There are also speed and positional concerns (some creatures 
 only attack to the front, others attack low or high, some at a distance, etc) . In some cases there 
 are tricks to capture a creatures Id since creatures can just be destroyed outright as well.
  
  Further although Keats and Ellen travel in the same worlds they feature very different gameplay 
 styles. Folks are used differently by each. For example the clockwork folk "Habetrot", for Ellen, 
 causes other folk to fall asleep while, for Keats, drops a large pendulum weight on enemies causing 
 the earth quake.
  
  The basic gameplay between characters is also markedly differently as Ellen appears to "summon" 
 her folk: they appear on screen, make their attack and then disappear. While in existence they 
 are solid and Ellen can evade other attacks by interposing them between herself and enemies. Ellen's 
 folk, in general, are also more cerebral with several "sleep" and "charm" folks (classes which 
 Keats lacks) and she has many more long distance attacks at her disposal.
  
  Keats, on the other hand, is a classic video game badass. When he uses folk they appear as ghostly 
 apparitions overlaid on his own body. Where Ellen summons the folk Keats becomes the folk. In addition 
 Keats has an "overdrive" meter of sorts that gives him several seconds of invulnerability and awesome 
 hand-to-hand attacks when activated.
  
  Folks can all be upgraded (to use less magic or increase in strength) but each upgrade is different. 
 You might have to absorb a number of ids from the same creature or from others. You might have 
 to defeat (destroy the creature without absorbing its id) some number of other folk or offer a 
 number of items. Items are dropped by certain folk, given as rewards and found in gems throughout 
 the worlds.
  
  In general the combat is well-done, but there are definitely some wonky camera issues - especially 
 in the tighter spaces. But the game in general is rarely difficult so they don't often become issues.
 
  
  A few of the folk are simply palette swapped versions of others but the vast majority are completely 
 unique and wonderfully designed for their worlds of origin. Creatures from the Fairy Realm are 
 whimsical and based on Celtic lore; the modern, war torn world of Warcadia features military-inspired 
 denizens and so forth.
  
  Gathering and upgrading all of the folk can become a very time consuming (but only sometimes frustrating) 
 endeavor. Even if you like the game (as I
  did) you'll probably give up before you collect everything.
  
  The story weaves between Doolin 
 and the netherworlds where, if you have cherished memento from the recently dead you may be able 
 to speak to them before their energies dissipate into folks. As you advance the story gets charmingly 
 convoluted (imagine the story of your average Japanese role-playing game with a thick Irish accent) . 
 The writing is often laughably weak, but not so regularly poor as to distract.
  
  Folklore is one of the most consistency supported games on the PS3 having received two free and 
 three paid download packs featuring new sidequests, folks, costumes and background information. 
 There's also a rudimentary user-generated content system which allows you to construct basic dungeons 
 and upload them for others to play.
  
  The production values of "Folklore" are almost uniformly excellent. The orchestral music ranges 
 wonderfully from whimsical to melancholy. The art direction and character design is amazing and 
 engaging: you'll become genuinely attached to certain folk. The rare instances of voice acting 
 are well done, if not particularly memorable.
  
  Although the game was somewhat overlooked on release and it takes a while to grow on you, it definitely 
 DOES grow on you in the end. If you're willing to put up with the occasional control and story 
 issues you'll find a truly charming adventure here.

Review:  I very much enjoyed myself playing this game. This is one of the few games that really use the 
 six axis controller to its fullest, which was very fun. stealing monsters souls then using there 
 abilities against other folks. the story line wasn't to bad a lil confuseing that times but you 
 can understand it for the most part. This game is a very long game, which is a good thing. Just 
 warning everyone you should play with both characters because u need to play as both in order to 
 beat the game so just after you beat a mission with one person switch the the other after. Trust 
 me on this one. Anywho there are plenty of places to explore, not so much in the town but when 
 you enter a folk realm. If you want to take a break from your main quest you can go visit the pub 
 and receive side quests which you can get good things from doing them, even new folk you can use. 
 Overall i thought this was a pretty good game, i would recommend this.

Review:  It's rare that I find a game that captures my attention and amazes me the way Folklore did.
  
  The Folks (monsters) that you use throughout the game are as imaginative as any fairytale could 
 describe and the environments you traverse are nothing short of stunning. Tying together these 
 visuals is a thoroughly engrossing soundtrack that only brightens the already splendid world Folklore 
 is set in.
  
  The story is paced just like any good murder-mystery should be; it gives you tidbits keeping your 
 interest until the very end. The only way this game's story could have been better is if all the 
 dialog was done justice with the game's excellent voice acting. As it is, reading through the text 
 in the graphic novel cut scenes kind of takes you out of the game, especially when you're reading 
 things like "Uwee hee hee" which is said by a prominent character in the game.
  
  This would be just like any generic action/rpg if it wasn't for the implementation of the six-axis 
 controls in the relatively average combat system. You're required to move, balance, jerk, and shake 
 the controller in certain ways to finish off and capture enemies in the game. Boss fights are done 
 in inventive ways because you find out their weaknesses via clues you discover in the level beforehand. 
 Also, aside from your own character's progression, the folks you capture can be improved upon by 
 meeting various conditions or using certain items you collect.
  
  There's a lot to love in this game but despite all it's good qualities it's really hurt by the 
 fact that you can't even do the last half of the game without going through the same levels in 
 the first half of the game with both characters. I realize the reasoning behind this (so you can 
 see both sides of the story) but, still, it's pretty tedious to go through essentially the exact 
 same part of the game twice.
  
  All things considered, though; there's plenty of game to go through and Folklore is a must play 
 for any action/RPG fan with a PS3.

Review:  Now that's an original game!... I loved playing Folklore. It was great!. It just reminded me of 
 Pokmon for some reason. Anyone still remember those little freaky creatures? Well I do. Always 
 hated them anyways.. The game! Folklore is a great game created by great/genius dudes. Awesome 
 graphics, awesome game play and awesome story. Well almost awesome story cause it was just weird. 
 But that I was expecting. All the Japanese stories are weird and dramatic. So game starts with 
 2 characters, both coming to this weird little town. One to find her mother, another one to solve 
 a mystery and write the most awesome story he has written. One thing I didn't like was the whole 
 reading part of the game. I'm playing a game people.. Shouldn't have to read if I wanted to read 
 I buy a book (actually did buy a book) . And it wasn't like 'hello'  'my name is bla bla' reading. 
 NO it was like a whole story line. So annoying. They could have just dubbed the whole thing. Anyways, 
 the point of this game is to go to the netherworld (every time I say that I have to think of Michael 
 Jackson XD) you get to Netherworld XP and you have to fight these weird looking monsters and capture 
 them. When you capture them you can use them see that's so Pokmon. 
  At the beginning you can choose if you like to play with the dude or with the girl. Well being 
 a dude myself I chose the dude. 
  Here is a question for ya.
  Choose the girl: you are a girly man.
  Choose the dude: you are gay.
  What would you do? Or 
 is it just me?
  The game! At the beginning I thought that you choose a character and play the story with it. But 
 was like play with the dude, finish level 1 then play with the girl finish level 1... Then the 
 dude again and so on. That's so annoying. I have to play each level twice. It's like I'm having 
 dj vu or something. So there is this bad guy (of course) trying to get from Netherworld to real 
 world and like be the king or destroy it or something like that I don't remember. And you being 
 the good guy have to stop him/her/it... not going to tell you who the bad guy/girl/it is! Not that 
 it was hard to figure it out. 
  
  If the game had like network thing that you could go online and fight other dudes with your new 
 captured creatures that would have been awesome! Hint hint people... make it happen.
  
  Oh.. yea.. Something weird! while I was playing the game. Anyone remember the Design your own folk 
 competition thing? Well I did make a folklore.. It wasn't that good.. it was just a sketch but 
 it was a good idea at the time. Didn't win or get close to winning. So I forgot all about it. Then 
 I played the game and at the somewhat end of the game there is this creature that you have to fight. 
 And it looks sooooo much like my design!.. My character had gynormous head this thing had gynormous 
 head.. My design had skinny body this thing had skinny body  my character was telekinesis this 
 thing was telekinesis my design threw rocks with his mind.. This thing threw rocks and stuff with 
 is mind see a pattern? 
  I mean it was like they just copied my idea. I'm not saying they did! But come on people! What 
 are the chances!?! 
  
  Anyways I don't mind. At least I can say my design got in the game.
  
  With all the reading 
 and the weird and twisted plot the game is great to play for some time. I would recommend it. But 
 don't blame me when you shoot yourself in the head after the 1000 hours of reading one storyline.

Review:  If you've played the Folklore demo, you might have come away with mixed impressions. Yes, the game 
 is insanely gorgeous, yes the characters are cool, yes, the game seems really linear but interesting 
 at the same time. The gameplay is fun and collecting folk ids to use in battle is unique. The text 
 dialogue scenes can be a little disappointing -- not in terms of content, but the fact that the 
 game is on a Blu-ray disc and you'd like voice acting through the entire game. So you're left wondering 
 if you should buy this game to experience the rest of it.
  
  I recently purchased Folklore and I am really glad I did. Besides being a showcase of a PS3 exclusive 
 title that is a visual and aural feast, the game actually deepens and becomes more intense shortly 
 after the beginning... and the beginning is deceptively simple.
  
  What you don't see in the demo is that there are full action cutscenes with fantastic animation 
 and voice acting. Keats and Ellen exude tangible personalities and are enjoyable characters. These 
 cutscenes don't happen as often as you'd like, but that's only a small gripe.
  
  For the uninitiated, Folklore is a whimsical tale of two unrelated people (Keats and Ellen) who 
 both receive a mysterious message asking them to visit the small, seaside town of Doolin. Ellen 
 believes that her deceased mother has contacted her, while Keats is a journalist who writes for 
 a magazine about the supernatural. Upon arriving at Doolin, they witness what seems to be a murder 
 and are soon approached by an invisible man named Belgae who convinces them to enter the realm 
 of the dead and find the murder victim. In doing so, Keats and Ellen are required to obtain new 
 powers to aid their survival in the Netherworld.
  
  But getting in touch with the dead isn't simple, and they must fight their way forward against 
 creatures known as "folk", which are the devolved forms of dead spirits. Upon defeating a folk, 
 it's weakened soul, known as the "Id", becomes vulnerable and you can latch onto, snatch up, and 
 absorb the Id by whipping the Sixaxis controller upwards. After obtaining a folk's Id, you can 
 assign the folk to one of four buttons and use the folk's ability in battle. Because the folk come 
 in a vast variety of over 100 creatures ranging from beasts to robots -- each of which can be trained 
 up in power -- you get to have a lot of fun deciding which folks you prefer to use and collect. 
 However, some enemies are immune to certain folk, so there is strategy involved in their use. To 
 help you out, there are "faery lore pages" to be found, which are illustrations drawn by the denizens 
 of the netherworld that depict certain folk being defeated by another folk... which tips you off 
 if you can understand the illustration.
  
  Keats and Ellen can gain exp from absorbing folk Ids and gain levels, which is a simple element 
 that gives them more hitpoints. There is more to their abilities, but I'll leave that for you to 
 enjoy discovering.
  
  Folklore is a blast to play, but the first world had me wondering if the game was going to be too 
 easy. Apparently, it was just luring me in as I actually died three times in the following world. 
 Wow. The story gets more complicated and reveals more information, but leaves so much unveiled 
 to be discovered. Because the story is so unpredictable, the only way to find out what's going 
 on is to press further forward and there is eventually so much mystery that I find myself itching 
 to get home and work on solving the mystery! It's driving me nuts at work!
  
  Last but not least, Folklore has online elements. First, you can download free game add-ons, such 
 as a folk that was conceptualized by a player and won a contest, so the developers put it in the 
 game. Then there are additional quests and character costume packs, which are about $4 each, or 
 $6 for a bundle of two. The other thing people are excited about is the Dungeon Trial mode, which 
 allows you to create your own levels and then share them online! You receive points for creating 
 dungeons, which eventually will unlock extra content in the game.
  
  In all, Folklore is an embraceable PS3 exclusive that is well worth playing.

Review:  Folklore review
  
  Folklore is the first full-fledged PS3 game I bought and played enough to review. Despite some 
 minor quirks, I find this game to be highly engaging, a joy to see and a thrill to play.
  
  Folklore is an Action-RPG that follows two intertwining characters, Ellen and Keats, who are both 
 drawn to the mysterious village of Doolin for different, yet related reasons. Ellen seeks the truth 
 about her mother and her past, and Keats is investigating the paranormal events in response to 
 a mysterious phone call he receives. Over the course of the game, the player uncovers clues to 
 the history of the village from its tight-lipped residents through the exploration of the village 
 and the Netherworld, by defeating the creatures within known as Folklores.
  
  The gameplay is divided into two parts. One is the exploration phase, where the character goes 
 through the village during the day, talking to residents and gathering clues, in order to obtain 
 a "Memento of the Dead" that enables them to visit a new area of the Netherworld. The meat of the 
 game is in exploring the Netherworld using the various powers of defeated enemies, a. k. a. folks, 
 to overcome the game's various challenges.
  
  Graphically, the game is simply beautiful, especially in the Netherworld. The game boasts both 
 technical and artistic flair, realistic (if simplistic) environments in the village of Doolin and 
 gorgeous, fantastic landscapes in the Netherworld. The very first area, the Faery Realm, boasts 
 colors and wildlife that seems to come right out of a scene of the classic movies Labyrinth or 
 Legend. Each area of the Netherworld features its own theme such as war or undersea with fitting 
 music, environments and enemies. The audio is spectacular as well, with sweeping music highlighting 
 the exploration and engaging, exhilirating tunes playing as you engage in battle.
  
  Speaking of battle, the character you choose doesn't actually fight directly. Every combat action 
 involves using the abilities of a defeated folk against the others. You start with a basic attacker 
 and a shield, but you get many more as you progress. But that does not mean the game is not action-packed. 
 This isn't like Pokemon or a turn-based RPG. You move around and engage enemies in a third-person 
 environment, but your mobility is limited to running and evasive dodges (which aren't nearly as 
 useful as simply running out of the way) .
  
  The gameplay seems repetitive and simple at first; you basically mash the attack button (s) (you 
 can map up to four folks to each of the four face buttons) until an enemy dies, but winning requires 
 more than bludgeoning enemies to death. You have the ability to take the souls, or 'id' of your 
 defeated foes (normal enemies and mini-bosses) ; this is how you obtain their abilities. You do 
 this by absorbing them; after the enemy takes enough damage, their soul appears over their weakened 
 body and glows red, then you press the R1 button and jerk the Sixaxis controller upward to take 
 their soul. This simple action makes combat more exhilirating and thrilling than it would have 
 been if it were limited to simply smacking the monsters around. You're also capable of taking multiple 
 souls simultaneously if you manage to get multiple creatures in a weakened state at once, which 
 leads to experience point bonuses.
  
  To make matters better, when fighting larger boss monsters, you often have to do more elaborate 
 motions with the Sixaxis to take their souls. Sometimes you have to move the controller in rhythm 
 or tilt it left and right, and for some bosses, the motion required actually sporadically changes 
 while you're tussling with the monster's soul. It's great fun to finally win a hard-fought soul 
 as the final step in overcoming the game's epic boss fights.
  
  However, Folklore isn't perfect. Most of the game's story plays out in comic book-like cinema scenes 
 with dialogue balloons instead of voice. There are some well-done CG movies with full voice, but 
 they're few and far between, and the story segments can be a little dull. Also, Doolin is quiet 
 and moody -- the exploration element of the game can certainly be tepid, although the actual story 
 and the mysterious air of the village keeps things interesting (it doesn't help that your character 
 doesn't move very quickly; slowly running back and forth through the town and even the Netherworld 
 can be a chore sometimes) . Combat can get a little repetitive, especially if you're working to 
 improve the power of your folks by 'releasing their karma', which often requires that you actually 
 destroy foes instead of taking their souls, which takes much longer even for the most basic enemies 
 and can get extremely tedious.
  
  The game has added value through DLC available on the Playstation Network which adds extra side 
 quests and bonus outfits for both characters (it's not free though) . Also, you can create your 
 own dungeons using the enemies you have encountered in your own game and upload them online, as 
 well as other network features, which gives the player some options outside of the main quest.
 
  
  Overall, Folklore is a great game. It features a lengthy and engaging quest with two different 
 characters (and different perspectives on the story) , fun gameplay, extra content and very good 
 production values. It's a good choice if you're looking for something original and intriguing on 
 the PS3.

Review:  The score is understandable, but without any recognition, this game is totally worth the fantasy 
 dwelling experience.
  
  The score is done very well and gamers who have already researched and tallied all of the game's 
 reviews will understand that this game is purely immersive. It has some faults some that will need 
 to be addressed - consequencely is not the best game out in the public.
  
  With gameplay, there is music, with character there is voice set, and evidentially, not all of 
 these feats can be top notch because it is extremely hard to predict how the gamer, that is you, 
 will enjoy the experience.
  
  As the story goes, a mysterious destination is considered to be haunted, or well, completely and 
 utterly forsaken because of its background - Doolin, a place of the dead. Ellen and Keats are both 
 lured to the island because of events of inexplicable behavior had occurred. These characters are 
 intertwined, and soon they release the journey wasn't because of pure accident, it was Destiny. 
 You will be traveling many realms to unlock Doolins' pasts inevitable secrets.
  
  Playstation fanatics, who have already played the demo of Folklore, will probably not be too convinced, 
 and while being unsure, some minors will avoid the games perception entirely. The demo did not 
 include, voice sets, fully rendered cut-scenes, the chance to capture half a dozen cute folks, 
 or the opportunity to dig into its plot. However, truthfully, the developers didn't intend on making 
 the demo so negative. 
  
  Look beyond the cake! And onto the icing! Weirdly enough, this game is calling out for you. If! 
 At any point you feel, for whatever stupidly crazy idea, you want to buy this game and look beyond 
 the cake and into the filling! It blatantly means you want the game! If it's a case of shortage 
 of pocket money, plead your parents/carers/friends, to contribute to the game.
  You will regret it later on, I can assure you. (This game is unique because it is a new twist to 
 fantasy RPGS, and storyline entertainment alike.)
  
  - While urging you to purchase this game, I would also like to share with you the reasons based 
 upon why this game is worth it.
  
  SIXAXIS MOVEMENT - Multitudes of 'yanking' abilities, yes that's right, you yank the soul ID's 
 from folks in many ways possible. This is a great introductory welcoming for SIXAXIS use.
  
  A Moving 'Fantastical' story - The story unravels itself, and users will be guessing how sequences 
 existed until later on in the game, answers are found. The story is a puzzle and well, you will 
 only collect fragments of what happened here and there. The end is very rewarding, and you will 
 be please you concurred the netherworld. The game should last for 20-30 hours at minimum. To fully 
 complete all of the downloadable quests and extras, it should be 35+ hours. If that does not satisfy 
 you, each folk can attain 'Karma', known as extra folk traits that could possibly unlock, MC reduction, 
 Attack Combo +, Attack +, Multiple Monster Appearance, and so on, by collecting item requirements. 
 With this completed, it should have taken you no more than 50 long sweating Hours (EST) .
  
  
  
  Smart and competitive Bosses  These are known as the Folklore's. They really are, well, 
 good to challenge. You will be able to collect hints called 'Picture books', one for each every 
 realm. The variations of combo's and techniques from the drawings of folks, corresponding to one 
 part of the boss, are unusually genius. It is clever, and while it doesn't reveal too much information, 
 you will need to first, attain each page. (I'm surprised and disappointed there is no reward about 
 this on Gamespot's official review.)
  
  It is a shame there were not any more bosses in the game, but the amount of them are 'Just right'. 
 Perhaps this will be addressed in a promising sequel.
  
  Graphically effective - The effects alone make this game good value for money. There are displays 
 beyond imagination. The effects define this game. The visuals of butterflies erupting from countless 
 doors, (Hence beyond imagination) is worth the watch. They even have portals!
  The resolution is great and only a few insignificant blurry sharp images appear.
  
  Great level 
 Designs - Without environmental purple skies, glowing pedestals of radiant lights, or even the 
 setup of each realm, it would seem a shame to miss out. 
  
  A significant soundtrack - The outlook is maximized, spine-chilling sounds, fantasy-enhancing notes 
 and tunes - an imagination that will rasp you with an exciting and attractive horror that keeps 
 changing, giving it an edge of much variation in drama. The music varies, from sad, to crazy horror 
 that is quite catchy and smartly out done dilemma. It is certainly different, and should inspire 
 other gaming developers of how to create such an atmosphere of their own, just with music.
  
  Network Features - While the game doesn't offer any offline multiplayer events, Relive the 
 story online and make dungeons and hordes of folks, mazes, battling record boards, and well, 'Look 
 for yourself'.
  You will also enjoy any downloadable content you may have missed if at present you do not own a 
 copy of this game Including some neat quests, and folks.
  
  
  It may seem like much, however, it is understandable to know why this game didn't reach a 10/10 
 because it would need to be 'perfect and accurately composed'. 
  
  I really hope I have convinced late goers to purchase or look at this game between now and the 
 near future. As it was quoted on the Wikipedia official 
  'Folklore (video game) ', taken from its reception:
  
  
  "Folklore was selected as one of 
 Gaming Target's "52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2007."
  
  The story will grow on you, as will the addiction to solve out more pieces to the puzzle, reveal 
 out what Ellen's and Keat's reasons are. Give 'Folklore' some leeway, and let it truly immersive 
 you before you have doubts about the scenario. If you understand, you should have heard of the 
 saying 
  
  'Never judge a book by its cover'.
  
  Just think about that, and my Review. Think about the positives over the negatives. This is otherwise 
 known as a game that introduced off the Playstation 3 spectacularly, and will have fortified its 
 position, on the console, for many years to come. 
  
  This game proved well for my liking, even though I have completed it, as of the date I created 
 this review, I would surely be going back to the game to introduce it to friends who have a hunger 
 for yearning entertainment. It is an epic and I hope reading this review has absolutely increased 
 your hopes of buying, playing, or reading about 'Folklore' the game.
  
  Thanks for reading, hope you learned some useful information despite how 'Overdue' it is.

Review:  Folklore is a very interesting game. Everything about it is very interesting. It may not be that 
 long of a game (the main story is about 10-12 hours) , but it won't disappoint nevertheless. Folklore 
 is not your average RPG either. It's mainly an RPG, however it also includes a bit of Action-Adventure. 
 It is made by Game Republic, the people who made Genji. However, this game far surpasses it. It 
 will not disappoint.
  
  There are several worlds you go to, in order to defeat the enemies which are known as the Folklore, 
 who are accompanied by smaller creatures named "Folks". With Folks, you are able to nick their 
 souls and use them in battle. This can be done by holding R1 to grab their souls, and then flicking 
 up the SIXAXIS controller to suck them in. All you need to do is damage them a fair bit with the 
 other Folks' Souls you already have. Sometimes, you find certain Folks that have a different way 
 of sucking their souls in. One way is waving the controller up and down; another way is tilting 
 it left and right; and another way is shaking the controller around. There are more ways too. The 
 battles are Real-Time based combat. Sometimes, you may find that battles are a slight repetitive. 
 But if you're used to RPGs, then this shouldn't be a problem. 
  
  When fighting the Folklore, you need to find out their weakspots. There are many Folk Souls to 
 choose from when finding out weaknesses. Sometimes, finding pages of the picture books helps to 
 find their weakspots, as it will show pictures of how they're getting their asses kicked. Pages 
 can be found by destroying certain floating crystals that you can come across. These crystals come 
 in various colours, and it all comes down to the certain element it needs to be crushed. The colours 
 give out clues on what Folk you use to destroy them. Folks come in many different forms. There 
 are a number of Folks to find in each realm, which have different benefits, sizes, elements, and 
 stats.
  
  Everytime you suck a soul in, you get Experience. Yes, this game also has experience. You require 
 a lot of EXP so it takes a while to Rank Up. Levels are called Ranks in Folklore. Every time you 
 Rank Up, your stats increase, mainly your Health and Mana. Side-quests can also be done in this 
 game. As you progress, Quests can be attempted. These are entirely optional, but have a bonus item 
 that you receive when completed. I also find that quests are pretty good for training. You can 
 find available quests by going to the pub every now and then. It also depends what time of day 
 it is, as the quests vary whether it's day or night.
  
  There are a few extras in Folklore too. Dungeon Trial Mode is worth mentioning. You can create 
 your own little dungeons. It's quite neat actually. There are also a few expansions for Folklore 
 that can be downloaded via the PlayStation Store. These expansions have a few extra quests in them 
 that can be cleared. They're good for bonuses after you finished Folklore.
  
  There are two characters you can take control of. There's Ellen, who is a girl who goes to the 
 bizarre town of Doolin Village, looking for her mother; Ellen got a letter regarding her mother 
 who she lost 17 years ago. And when she found out she was still around, Ellen took off to Doolin. 
 This little problem turned into a huge mystery about murders in the town and some strange worlds 
 containing the Folklore. You can also take control of Keats. He is a magazine writer who gets a 
 phonecall about a lady in trouble. So he heads off to Doolin Village to investigate. Then, Keats 
 gets sucked in to the mysteries too. 
  
  You have to play through the first Five Chapters with Ellen and Keats. In the beginning, you have 
 the option of which story you want to pick. Every time a Chapter is completed, you get to choose 
 who's Chapter you want to go through next. For example, you finish the Prologue as Ellen. You then 
 get the choice of moving on to Chapter 1 with Ellen, or the Prologue with Keats. Eventually, you'll 
 have the first five chapters beaten with both characters, and then you can move on to Chapter 6. 
 From Chapter 6 onwards, both Ellen and Keats are playable. Then eventually, you get the choice 
 of switching between then anytime you like. The Chapters are slightly altered depending on what 
 character you're playing as. You may notice that you have to go to different parts of Doolin, and 
 talk to different people. A problem I found with this though is that their chapters were far too 
 similar. When going through the realms, the objectives are pretty much the same. I found this quite 
 annoying at times. However, it isn't that much of a problem.
  
  The environments in Folklore are absolutely stunning! Doolin Village looks interesting. It's like 
 a run-down village, with bizarre people you come across. The realms look very bizarre. They all 
 look completely different, and are found in some of the strangest places. The first realm is the 
 Feary Realm. You're in a Deep Forest, so it looks quite dark. The second realm is a Battlefield, 
 you'll be finding army like Folks here. The third realm is an underwater palace, with sea creatures. 
 I will not talk about the later ones, as I do not want to spoil it. They're quite nice too!
  
  The graphics are very well done! All the characters look amazing, especially some of the details 
 in them. The graphics in the levels look very glamorous. Cinematics also appear in Folklore. They 
 aren't very frequent, but they don't add on very much to the in-game graphics anyway. No graphical 
 gitches, no blocky moments, no blurry moments. The graphics in Folklore are simply some of the 
 best i've ever seen.
  
  The sound is decent. It isn't the best, but it's still acceptable. The voice acting is done by 
 nice European voices. Too bad there isn't a hell of a lot of voices, as most of the cutscenes are 
 text-only. The music is fairly good, most of it is very repetitive unfortunately and I came across 
 the same songs constantly. They aren't bad or anything, I just didn't find them good enough to 
 be repeated constantly. Folklore only has about two or three songs that you'll fall in love with, 
 though there's been much worse before.
  
  The game takes place in the present day (about 2006) . A young woman by the name of Ellen is lured 
 to the sea-side village of Doolin, in Ireland, led by a letter from her supposedly dead mother. 
 Meanwhile Keats, a journalist from an occult magazine called Unknown Realms, receives a telephone 
 call from a woman in distress telling him to come to Doolin. Soon he and Ellen find themselves 
 in a murder mystery, where the answers seem to only be found in the Netherworld, the Land of the 
 Dead, a realm that can only be accessed from one place in the world, Doolin. To solve the crime 
 and reveal Ellen's forgotten past, they will need to venture to the Netherworld as travellers, 
 where Faerys and Folks alike await them. 
  
  Along the way they meet many different characters, like Scarecrow and Belgae, who help out both 
 of them in their quest. Throughout the game, players learn about the chaos the Netherworld was 
 put into by a previous Netherworld traveller. The eventual goal is to reach the core of the Netherworld 
 and "fix" the Netherworld. The game takes two different perspectives in the story that shows the 
 different views and opinions of many different characters. While traveling in the Netherworld, 
 many mysterious murders start to occur in the village of Doolin after the appearance of "The Hag." 
 The people murdered are the only ones who knew the truth (or part of the truth) of Ellen's past. 
 There's a lot of storytelling involved and it's all very interesting. Plus, it gets you hooked.
 
  
  If you own a PS3 and you are looking for a good RPG to keep you going for a while, Folklore is 
 definitely your ticket! It is a very neat game and I think it's worth owning at some stage. But 
 you should have this in your collection. Folklore is interesting all-around.
  9/10

Review:  Ok so, me being a massive RPG fan and reading all the reviews of the universe on this game before 
 i even got myself a PS3, decided Folklore would be a fantastic RPG journey, with a gripping story 
 and seemless hours of fun gameplay. However sadly, i found myself quite wrong..
  Before i begin, this is NOT a flame review of Folklore, there are parts that i enjoy, of which 
 i will get to. Firstly however, the gameplay. EXTREMELY frustrating and annoying to have finally 
 completed a chapter with Keats, to then complete it AGAIN with Ellen. That section of the game 
 could have been improved that Keats and Ellen go to completely different locations for each characters 
 chapters. The gameplay is also quite rinse and repeat, you get an item, go to the Netherworld, 
 defeat the Folklore, return to Doolin, watch a few more boring "cutscenes", get another item and 
 yeah... rinse and repeat. Enough flaming, for now. The graphics, are GORGEOUS, i have never played 
 a game that looks so good (excluding Oblivion, remembering i havent had my PS3 for long =P) and 
 the actual cutscenes in the game are just brilliant, and really bring the game to life. Also the 
 game had a really cool idea (similar to Poke'mon but ya get that) however wasn't executed to the 
 potential it could of been. On another good note, the load times are quite quick, and with the 
 amount of extra content available will definately add hours to the gamers who love it. So to wrap 
 it up, love it or hate it fellow PS3 gamers, this is just my opinion, don't let it discourage you, 
 however use it as a warning.

Review:  Wow is all i can say about this masterpiece of a game. When Folklore first came out I didn't care 
 much about getting it right away. It seemed like an average game, i definitely thought wrong.
 
  
  When you first start the game, you choose between Ellen and Keats. At first glance you may think 
 this is the same as every game with multiple characters. However, Ellen and Keats are needed to 
 finish the game.
  
  The graphics are really nice, you may catch yourself looking at your surroundings a lot; Even places 
 you have been to many times.
  
  The first thing you may notice when you start is that it has a lot of text. That may look intimidating 
 to most people and you may not feel like reading. But once you start reading, you cant get enough 
 of it. A general explanation of the main theme of Folklore would be death. The story revolves around 
 death pretty much, and the situations surrounding it.
  
  The game is written extremely good, to the point where both Ellen and Keats are going through similar 
 events, but their views and motives are completely different. They are also completely different 
 in combat. Ellen is more of the "summoning" type. When she uses folks, they act as if they were 
 summoned and she can use them as shields while attacking.
  
  Keats seems to actually "become" the folks. He seems to be the up-close and personal character 
 who uses mainly physical type attacks.
  
  The folks are also varied. I never played a game in my life that made me feel as if i was playing 
 Pokemon... in a good way. It really makes you feel like you have to "Catch em' All".
  
  I already beat the game and im thinking of playing it again. I normally don't feel like playing 
 a game right after beating it, so thats saying a lot.
  
  There is one flaw, the game says on the back of the case that there are over 100 folks to capture. 
 Thats not true, its somewhere around 70. Lying or exaggerating is irritating but it doesn't change 
 the fact that this is a great game.
  
  Overall Folklore is an amazing tale that might take you a few plays to understand. And you will 
 want to play over and over just to savor it.

Review:  Folklore
  
  By: Fs_Metal
  Game title: Folklore
  Genre: Action Role Playing Game
  Platform: Playstation 3
  ESRB Rating: Teen
  Developer: Game Republic
  Release date: October 
 9, 2007
  Overall rating: 9.5/10
  
  Folklore is a game that is hard to describe and, as a result, harder to review. If I was to describe 
 it in one word, I guess it would be beautiful. One glance at the game and anyone could tell you 
 why, but the rabbit hole does go alot deeper than that. It's unfortunate that Folklore got released 
 when it did. The 2007 holiday season was flooded with big name titles like Ratchet and Clank, Assassins 
 Creed and Call of Duty 4, an Folklore feels almost like an independent game among them. It didn't 
 receive the focus of games like that and got list on the shuffle, as a result. Point and case, 
 at the store that I reserved the game. I was the only one to do so. The store received a whopping 
 two copies of it on launch day for the game. This is sad in light of Folklore being a stunning 
 game that everyone should try. Let's look into it and see just what the game has to offer.
  
  Gameplay - 9/10
  
  At the core of any game (yes even role playing games made in Japan) 
 is it's gameplay. Gameplay is the most important thing to every single one of them. IF the gameplay 
 isn't good, the game is not worth playing. Folklore has it where it counts the most. The gameplay 
 here is unique diverse with a sense of familiarity about it. The game can be devided up into two 
 sections. The first is the battling within each realm at night and the second part is the mystery 
 during the day in the town. While the second part is a standard fair, the first part is where the 
 game really shines
  
  In Folklore you visit a number of netherworld realms or afterlifes in which you battle creatures 
 called folks to get to the folklore. At the begining of hte game, you are given a few minor folks 
 to help you along the way. You use these folks to attack the folks outside the designated safe 
 zones within each realm. Once you do enough damage to them, the folks Id (which, in the game is 
 kind of like a soul) appears. You can, then, harvest the id to capture the folk. Once you capture 
 a folk, you can use it for your own purposes, which you do by assigning it to the face buttons. 
 The more folk you collect, the bigger your arsenal of weapons will be, and you will need them. 
 http://img. photobucket. com/albums/v626/fsmetal/Folklore_2. jpg
  Folklore features a unique battle system where you capture creatures and use them as weapons.
 
  
  At the begining of the game, you are given a most basic folk that works as a hack n slash sword 
 type weapon. You whack away at your enemies. You suck out their ids. You gain new folks and new 
 attacks with them. This is where most of the real depth comes into play. There are more than 100 
 creatures to collect in this game, which means more than 100 attacks spread across multiple types 
 of elemental damage. This allows for a large number of folk combonations, which means you can mix 
 it up and find out what works best in what situation. No two folks do the same thing. Ontop of 
 that, the individual folks gain levels by doing things such as capturing more of that same type 
 of folk. When you do enough of this, the folk does what it calls 'releasing Karma' where the folk 
 becomes more powerful in one way or another, such as a wider range of attack or a more powerful 
 attack. To counterbalance it all, there is a bar that is eaten up a bit every time you use a folk. 
 Once it runs dry, you cannot attack until it refills. It keeps you from wailing on everything.
 
  
  There are two characters that you can play as. Keats and Ellen. You switch back and forth between 
 them as you will over the course of the game (I did Keats, then Ellen and back again) . Two two 
 characters are similar, but they do have their differences. Depending on what character you use, 
 there are different folks and different powers for the folks that are the same. Keats is more of 
 a up close and personal type character. He is a tank and fights like it. His folks quite often 
 tend to be less ranged and more powerful. Ellen is more of a tactical character than Keats. Her 
 folks, quite often, tend to be more elemental or long ranged. One further differens is that Keats 
 has a mode called Transcension mode where he becomes faster and stronger while Ellen has various 
 protective cloaks that she can wear. 
  
  The second part is the stuff that you do during the daylight hours of the village of Doolin. This 
 is your standard fair RPG stuff. You will walk around and talk with people to try to figure out 
 just what is going on. These sections are short and full of story, so they are not something to 
 be dreaded. Even so, they aren't too terribly exciting either. The saving grace of this portion 
 of the gameplay is the story, but I will get to that later on. It's safe to say that this is not 
 why the gameplay got such a high mark.
  
  Graphics - 10/10
  
  The gameplay isn't the only thing that shines about Folklore. The game goes beyond being easy on 
 the eyes. Folklore is take your breath away beautiful. I can promise you this. You have never seen 
 anything quite like this game. Folklore is overflowing with style and art. The setting perfectly 
 sets the mood for the game, but the artists didn't slack off there either. Folklore is a stunningly 
 beautiful game from an artistic standpoint. I do suppose that it is worth mentioning that, from 
 a technical standpoint, this isn't the best looking game ever. That being said, when the art is 
 this good, who cares?
  
  I suppose that it is rare to say that the art alone is enough to keep you playing a game, but that's 
 how Folklore is. Even if the story and sound weren't anywhere near as good as they are, the art 
 is reason enough to keep playing. Game Republic have done a fantastic job here in creating 7 completely 
 unique worlds that lend a dark dairy tale look to the world. People think fairy tale and they think 
 childish or something, but you won't get it here. This is more like a fairy tale for adults. Think 
 Pans Labyrinth if you have seen it. This is that kind of stuff. Each realm of the netherworld is 
 beautiful and unique, as well as full of surprises. that make you want to keep playing just so 
 you can see what hte game holds in store for you around the next corner. 
  
  As I previously mentioned, the enviroments are not the only things that got this attention. The 
 netherworld realms of Folklore are full of creatures unlike anything you have seen before. Each 
 one seems to fit in perfectly with their enviroments as well. The creature design here is as top 
 notch as it is unique. There are more strange and interesting critters in this game to pique your 
 interest than you can imagine, and it only adds to an overall enthralling experience that sucks 
 you in and will not let go. Even the most basic folks that you begin the game with received this 
 type of attention. You could tell that this game is a labor of love for the developement team. 
 Alot of blood, sweat and tears went into it's design, and it more than shows.
  
  Sound - 8.5/10
  
  I hate to say that this game slouches in any areas, but the sound isn't quite 
 as good as everything that I mentioned above. That's not to say that it is bad, but it's not as 
 good. The music is not the problem. Folklore features an absolutely beautiful score that has quite 
 a few brooding tracks that really set the mood for it's dark setting and story. It also has faster 
 tracks for things like battle and boss fights. It has appropriate music for every situation the 
 game throws at you, and it is all extremely good. The music to this game helps it feel like the 
 work of art that it was meant to be.
  
  Where the sound drops off a bit, however, is with it's voice acting. While the voice work never 
 drops into the area lf just plain bad, it does range from decent to average. None of it is amazing, 
 but none of it is cringe worthy either. There was a point in time where this was all you could 
 ask for today, but, now days, especially when everything else about this game is such high calibur, 
 this is a bit disappointing. The voice work is good alot of the time. It isn't great though. The 
 battle sounds could also stand to be a bit more varied as well. It's not something that will drag 
 the game down, but it is worth mentioning.
  
  Story - 9.5/10
  
  Here is another area where Folklore excels. The story to this game is fantastic. Much like the 
 world that it takes in, the story has a dark fairy tale feel to it. It works for the game, and 
 it helps it not fall victim to alot of typical Japanes Role Playing Game story cliches. IT does, 
 hwoever, follow the typical 'start out simple enough but get more and more complex the further 
 you progress' stick that all modern RPGs seem to follow. That's not a bad thing, but with portions 
 of the story being devided up amongst two characters, it can be a bit disorienting.
  
  Folklore tells the story of two people who arrive in the town of Doolin at relatively the same 
 time. The town of Doolin is said to be the village of the dead in legend in myth. IT is a place 
 where you are supposed to be able to meet the dead if you wish. One day Ellen gets a letter that 
 claims that it is from her mother, though she believes her mother to be dead. It says to come to 
 the town of Doolin to meet her, so she takes off. She is a college student with no memory of her 
 childhood. Keats is an editor for an underground occult magazine called Unknown Realms. He receives 
 a phone call in his office from a troubled woman begging him for help. She mentions that she lives 
 in Doolin. He decides to investigate. Upon both of them arriving in the village, they spy a woman 
 on a cliff. Keats thinks it may be the woman that called him, and Ellen thinks it may be her mother. 
 The woman falls over and off the cliff. She was dead. They decide to stay and look into this and, 
 hopefully, find out why they were drawn there in the first place.
  
  Folklore uses three types of story telling. The first is the voiced CG scene. The are excellent. 
 The games art shines through even brighter than with the in game graphics, resulting in them being 
 a sight to behold. IT is a pity that they are few and far between, though chapter 5 has one absolutely 
 top notch scene that had me sitting in awe. The second type of story telling is a comic book type 
 cut scene. It would have been nice if these had been voice acted, but they weren't. These will 
 be a love it or hate it type of thing for most players, but they are an effective method of story 
 telling that lends itself ot the games unique but familiar look and feel. The final type of story 
 telling is just speech bubbles with and portraits of the two characters conversing side by side. 
 This happens whenever you walk up to them and talk to someone. 
  
  Replay value - 8.5/10
  
  Folklore took me about 25 hours to beat. I did some side quests, but not all of them. There 
 is quite a bit to do in this game, and doing everything can easily last you upwards of 30 hours. 
 There are a bunch of side quests that you can get by traveling back to Doolin during the day or 
 night and speaking with the bartender. Ontop of that, you can download quests or create your own 
 with the quests with the dungeon trial. In order to get all collect all the folk in the game, as 
 well as the cloaks and everything, you will need to. There is alot to do in Folklore to keep you 
 busy past the main quest, though it isn't the 100+ hour epic that is your typical RPG. I, personally, 
 consider that a good thing. Folklore isn't too long, and it isn't too short either. The game is 
 as long or as short as you want it to be.
  
  Final Thoughts -
  
  There is one annoyance that I have not mentioned yet because I wasn't sure quite where to put it. 
 Thius game loads alot. I am talking before cut scenes, after cut scenes, before levels, after levels 
 and after switching out what folks you want to use. It loads ALOT. The load times are never overly 
 long, which is nice, and you can install the game to the harddrive to improve load times more, 
 but it does load frequently, which can get annoying. That being said, Folklore is an absolute work 
 of art. It's beautiful in graphics, music and story from begining to end. It is alot of fun to 
 play and I HIGHLY recommend checking this one out if you have a Playstation 3 or keep it in mind 
 for when you get one if you don't yet. It is an excellent and brilliant game that should not be 
 missed by anyone that likes action, adventure, great art, good stories or role playing games.
 
  
  Gameplay - 9
  Folklore is a fun game that uses a unqiue and very in depth battle system.
  
  Graphics - 10
 
  This game is a work of art through and through. The enviroments are beautiful, as are the creatures. 
 You have never seen anything like it
  
  Sound - 8.5

Review:  Pros
  + A well-thought, if a bit slow storyline, with one of the best endings in recent memory
  + Best 
 use of the Sixaxis motion sensors to date
  + Beautiful presentation enhances the artistic qualities of the game
  + Excellent monster design
 
  
  
  Cons
  - Levels are extremely linear
  - A few technical issues and constant loadings break up the pace
  - The game is strictly linear, 
 offering no room for exploration
  
  Genji: Days of the Blade was one of the few titles readily available with the launch of the PlayStation 
 3. Developed by Japanese studio Game Republic, Genji readily showed some of what Sony's new infant 
 was capable of graphic-wise, but fell short in the gameplay department. Almost a year later, gamers 
 are introduced to Folklore, Republic's second game, and this time, the final product holds up as 
 both, a beautiful spectacle to the senses and a compelling game experience.
  
  Folklore tells the tale of two strangers, Ellen, a young college student in search of her mother 
 and Keats, a reporter for a third-rate occult magazine whom is investigating a mysterious murder. 
 By different whims of destinies, both Ellen and Keats end up meeting each other in the remote Irish 
 village of Doolin, a place where the death meet the living. And while their goals, motivations 
 and personalities couldn't be any more contrasting, both travelers find themselves engulfed in 
 revealing Doolin's dark history, one that extends to this day, and to the realms of the death itself.
 
  
  While stories that deal with the afterlife aren't anything new, no video game has ever represented 
 this concept as well as in Folklore. While the story certainly starts with the speed of a snail, 
 soon you'll be swept from your feet and you'll be just another person, wondering what is it that 
 is so wrong with Doolin. The game is full of contrasting elements that will always make you wonder 
 if what you are seeing is true or just another illusion, and in some cases, a masterfully crafted 
 lie. Doolin is a prime example of these contrasting qualities, as its tranquility and apparent 
 peace are only compared to the dark secrets it holds. This contrasting nature extends to the game's 
 casts and its leads. Ellen is such as fragile soul that many will wonder if she really belongs 
 within the living, which makes her desire to find her mother the more endearing. This contrasts 
 with Keats extremely sardonic nature, who views life from a completely scientific point of view, 
 much different from his actual job as someone who dwells within the paranormal, and whose curiosity 
 gets the best of him. In all, Folklore excels in its narrative, and giving us characters that feel 
 nothing short of human.
  
  In the gameplay, Folklore certainly delivers as well. In order to see the full picture, you'll 
 have to play as both, Ellen and Keats. You select how you want the story to unfold, but once you 
 reach chapter five with one character, you'll be forced to do so with the other, so you can advance 
 to the game's two final chapters. The game is compromised of two main portions that spread amongst 
 the eight chapters. During the day, you are tasked with investigating Doolin, in the hopes of finding 
 out more about the events transpiring in the village, and in an attempt to find Mementos of the 
 Death, special items infused with enough memories and feelings from someone, that'll allow Ellen 
 and Keats to enter the netherworld. The investigation portions mostly consist of talking to the 
 villagers in order to achieve both said goals. If there is one complain is that the exploration 
 is extremely limited and linear, mostly because the game's environments are very small and contrived. 
 Its also linear because you must perform each required task in a particular order so that you can 
 move on to the next thing. If anything, it keeps the game moving, but some more exploration freedom 
 would have been nice. 
  
  Once you gain access to the netherworld and its different realms, the game turns into a sort of 
 dungeon crawler, and while all of the exploration's contrivances are even more pronounced in this 
 sections, the game has incredibly neat fighting system than makes up for it. Instead of directly 
 doing the fighting, Ellen and Keats will have to capture folks, magical creatures who populate 
 the netherworld. Once a folk has been captured, it will become part of a players army and usable 
 at any moment. To use these folks, you must select which ones you want and hot-key then to the 
 face buttons on the sixaxis, which in turn will allow you to release that folk's particular attack 
 or skill. Each folk is also upgradeable and the number of times, as well as the requirements for 
 these upgrades vary from folk to folk. Is an incredibly simple, yet deep system, as the number 
 of folks goes well over a hundred, and both characters folks are for the most part different than 
 the other. Even when some folks are both shared by Ellen and Keats, chances are they'll use them 
 in different ways. While most folks aren't all that challenging, most are only vulnerable to some 
 folks, adding more depth to the system. The game's boss fights are the best part of combat, requiring 
 different combinations of folks to defeat them.
  
  Apart from the variety in folks, Ellen and Keats are also vastly different characters. Both characters 
 are indistinguishable where movement is concerned and only slightly different in how they recover 
 their magic points after using folks. Their fighting methods are what make them unique. Ellen requires 
 a more strategic approach, as most of her folks are of the long-range type, and since she completely 
 summons the creatures, they take a slightly longer time to appear and do their attacks, which in 
 turns leaves you vulnerable. Keats is more of a brawler, more often than not only partial-summoning 
 the folks and making them extensions of him. This doesn't mean that is all button mashing for Keats, 
 as it is easier to lose life since you are closer to enemies, so folk combining, dodging and defensive 
 moves must be mixed accordingly in order to survive. Both characters also have some supporting 
 skills. For Ellen, these come in the shape of costumes, which will modify some of her attributes. 
 And while Keats doesn't get a fancy wardrobe, he gets a special bar that allows him to use Trasencion, 
 a powerful skill that for a short time will boost Keats attacks at no magic cost, as well as making 
 him invincible. These differences in play styles is one of Folklore's best realized aspects, as 
 you'll have to trek through all the realms with both characters, so while you'll be seeing the 
 same places, as least you'll have to modify your approach.
  
  The last mechanic in Folklore's combat is the capturing of folks. In order to capture a folk, you 
 must first expose its Id, by attacking it. Once its Id is out, you'll have to absorb it by pressing 
 on R1 and pulling back on the Sixaxis like a fishing rod. The motions also vary depending on the 
 size of folks, and instead of only pulling, you may find yourself bouncing the folks Id from side 
 to side or some other fun way of weakening it before making the pull. The motion controls work 
 incredibly well and further immerse you in the adventure. 
  
  If there is something that truly holds Folklore back from perfection, are some of the technical 
 issues it has. For one, the game is handled in small, self-contained portions, which can take from 
 anywhere between 4 to six seconds to load, and while it may not seem like much at first, it definitely 
 adds up once you realize how many of these small areas you'll visit and how much backtracking you'll 
 have to do in some areas. The game also suffers from some slow-down during hectic combat with lots 
 of folks and completely freezes for a good two seconds when you transform and un-transform with 
 Keats. The game also has a momentary freezes every time you switch folks, an affair you'll be doing 
 quite frequently, and is certainly annoying. The camera can also be a bit problematic in more confined 
 areas, and the set camera in some areas don't always give you the best vantage points. All of these 
 issues hurt the game, but they are not enough to make the game unplayable by any means and are 
 only mild-annoyances at most.
  
  While it'll certainly take the best of players a little over fifteen hours to complete the story 
 alone, Folklore also comes with an option called Dungeon Trial, a dungeon maker for you to upload 
 your own dungeons and play other's as well. While certainly a novel idea, its execution is nowhere 
 near the campaign and is very limited. Still, it is a nifty little tool to play with, and for those 
 wishing to acquire every folk in the game, playing through Dungeon Trial will be a necessity. 
 
  
  Graphically, Folklore certainly doesn't push the PS3, but it certainly looks beautiful. This can 
 be mostly attributed to the game's exquisite art design, which invades every aspect of the game 
 in a most welcomed manner. The characters look good and animate well, and the realms you'll explore 
 are certainly beautiful to look at. The folks quite literary steal the show however, featuring 
 some of the best designs ever seen. And they look amazing too. The game unfolds in three different 
 ways as well, one being the CGI scenes for the more dramatic moments, the in-engine cut-scenes 
 and the more common comic book like-panels for most scenes, and all three aspects look amazing. 
 The sound is also a big winner here, featuring some beautiful compositions that set the mood just 
 right. The little voice acting in the game is often times remarkable and all the other sounds in 
 the game are of the same quality.
  
  While Folklore certainly has its fare share of issues, the positive far outweighs the negative 
 and it's worth a shot. If anything, more developers should try to follow Game Republic in creating 
 more innovative and fresh titles such as this.

Review:  To me, Folklore fits the bill of under-rated games. It's very unique, uses the motion controls 
 of the Sixaxis controller pretty well, and the rest of the game is so well done and engrossing 
 that it more than compensates for the slightly limited gameplay. 
  
  Pros:
  1. Fantastic visuals, with really good character animations, fascinating environments, great looking 
 3d effects, and a completely unique sense of style. 
  2. Excellent character voice acting and compelling, visually stunning lead characters and cinematic 
 sequences. 
  3. Unique game-play that's action oriented, but far from a typical action adventure button-masher.
 
  4. Nice replay value in that you can play through the game with both protagonists to hear both 
 of their stories.
  5. There's already been a bunch of well-done add-on content.
  
  Cons:
  1. Gameplay, while unique, does get repetitive.
  2. While the environments look great, 
 there aren't a ton of them, and you'll see them all twice if you play through with both characters.

Review:  Folklore! a fitting title for such a game! in this game you enter as either two characters: a girl 
 who looks like she 's too young for the job and a dude who seems like he knows everything. the 
 story is on some sorta case that the main character got's to solve. of course as you try to meet 
 this goal, you fight your way through all kinds of monsters using cool attacks.
  
  graphics are really nice
  
  sound is cool
  
  interesthing story and characters
  
  no 
 unneccessary gore or blood.
  
  not too violent
  
  good for all audiences
  
  what's there to say?

Review:  A murder mystery game that's also an rpg, what could be better! Don't waste your money on drakes 
 fortune, this game is extremely fun and addictive! Finally a lengthy ps3 game!
  
  I would have to say that this is the real first rpg to hit the ps3 and with it's 40+ hours of gameplay, 
 why waste your money on alything else. I own drakes fortune and while it had some replay value 
 I think I beat in 8 hours. 
  
  There are over a hundred id's to absorb, 7 chapters per player, and several worlds to beat. Story 
 can be a bit confusing but overall very new and fun. The dungeon trials only add to the gameplay 
 hours and overall score to the game, especially since you need to play it to obtain all the id's.

Review:  Overall, Folklore seems to be a pretty good game and it's parent approved. For example a lot of 
 great games are rated M, meaning some parents are skeptical about buying the game for their son/daughter. 
 Folklore fits these parent guidelines, while making the story interesting. In the game you can 
 play as either Ellen, a girl searching for her past, or Keats, an occult magazine reported who 
 recieved a mysterious call for help. Together they must solve the mysterious murders that have 
 occured in the village of Doolin, while piecing together Ellen's tie to the village. The first 
 few chapters (if playing as both) are rather boring as they pretty much stay to the same story, 
 but later on, it begins to branch off a bit when Ellen earns the Faerys favor while Keats teams 
 up with a Messenger of long ago. Along the way you must capture a variety of creatures' "Ids" or 
 souls, allowing you to utilise their attacks in combat, all of which are highly detailed. The games 
 graphics are pretty good, due to the fact that it is for the PS3, but even so, its carefully created 
 "folks"'s characteristics really shine through. The one major complaint with this game is its cutscenes. 
 It cutscene often include an annoying leaf border while the characters' conversations pop up around 
 the screen. There are very few real cutscenes where the characters move and speak. Even so, the 
 game is pretty good overall and I would recommend it to a friend.

Review:  The game is graphically gorgeous, and the gameplay is pretty decent even; even though i'm not of 
 fan of over the top japanese art. Watching the trailer for this, Girl on boat in storm, looking 
 for mom, going to a place of spirits. Hmm sounds familiar. O yea cause this is the exact beginning 
 of Final Fantasy 9. Girl on boat with her mother in a stormy weather. She loses her mother and 
 goes to those Ruins with spirits to find her history. Watching the trailer for the first 20 seconds 
 seemed like a complete rip-off of Final Fantasy 9. Instead of a pirate getting dragged into the 
 game as Zidane did. A reporter gets dragged into the story. Its essentially almost the same story 
 from Final Fantasy 9 that goes a different path and different gameplay.
  
  Although the gameplay was fun and the graphics looked great on a 1080 HDTV, the story wasn't original 
 and completely killed the game cause I felt like I was just replaying an older game. If you like 
 RPG's you've probably played Final Fantasy 9 and this will not be unique for you. But if you never 
 played FF9 this is a fun experience and looks stunningly beautiful
  
  Worth checking out if you are new to rpgs, moderate difficulty and enjoyable gameplay.

Review:  2007 year is filled with shooters, It certainly was a very crowded place to be in if you wished 
 to stand out as a different genre game.
  
  Folklore is a story based in a village of Doolin. A young woman named Ellen receives a letter from 
 her long lost mother who died many years ago when Ellen was five years old. Her mothers body was 
 never found and Ellen still hopes and believes that she could be alive. 
  A letter written with her mothers handwriting certainly pushes Ellen to a new hight of believing 
 as she rushes to the address it was written from - The Village of Doolin. 
  At the same time a newspapers writer for the occult magazine "Unknown Realms" receives a mysterious 
 and frightening phone call in which a woman is creaming and begging for help that she is attacked 
 by faerys in Doolin village. 
  Keats, intrigued and acting on his curiosity as a writer for a good story sets of to the village.
 
  
  The story revolves on a scale of a 17th years old murders that happened In Doolin and as Ellen 
 and Keats try to solve it, new ones appear which makes things more complicated. 
  The years old murder contains many pieces of tragedy that involves everyone on a village, affecting 
 Ellen as a primary role. 
  
  You will play with both Ellen and Keats as each one of them will solve the puzzle in their own 
 way. 
  Through the seven chapters you will visit different world that look very beautiful, and in most 
 cases very unique with gorgeous artwork. 
  
  The beauty of Folkore is in it's artwork and stylish execution of motion, the game portraits beautiful 
 backgrounds that seems magical in away. Each world you visit has its meaning, the dead souls and 
 beliefs of humans portrait: Paradise, Hell, Sorrow, Fear and so on. 
  Those are worlds that co-exits with our own and are seen with those that have strong sense of believing.
 
  Non corrupted and open child's mind has an access to many mysteries, one of them - fairies. This 
 is not however your book-telling cute and lovable creatures, in Folklore their rage war and fight 
 for their land while trying to make their own plans that don't seem to share the same thought of 
 humans.
  
  The gorgeous wolds of Folkore will make you stop and look around, it truly is a easy on the eyes 
 and beautiful created scenery. A true work of an art. 
  
  The gameplay of Folklore can be descried as Action/Role-Playing standpoint. You level, gather folks 
 "Ids" and use them as your weapons. You can make them stronger and use them as your strategy versus 
 different encounters. 
  The real threat of a battle are "Folklores". The bosses of each stage. They are all unique and 
 not really that hard until you learn their patterns and how to battle them. To help you in that 
 aspect each world contains a book which is given to you as you uncover pages for that realm.
  The book will give you a drawn example of how to defeat those folks that you're having trouble 
 with.
  They are many Folks out there to collect and use and they have their own abilities, from different 
 elements of range, melee, defense, natural forces use, etc..
  
  Some folks are only accessible to Ellen, while Keats has some that Ellen doesn't. 
  Ellen will 
 summon a full folk to fight, while the style of Keats is more of a close and personal fighter, 
 when he uses his folks they don't appear in full size but instead "bind" and became one with Keats 
 for some cool effects. He is also able to call upon inner power for a short period of time which 
 makes his very powerful.
  It takes time to gather the inner strength again, so to use it wisely is a good idea.
  Ellen 
 can collect different Cloaks around each of the worlds, aside from really beautiful and unique 
 looks, each cloak will give her different permanent ability. For example, some worlds are pretty 
 heavy on folks that like to root or sleep their enemies, while others are heavy on close combat 
 action. 
  You can change cloaks at any save point in the game for more suitable one, they statistic will 
 be displayed for appropriate use that you can benefit from.
  
  The way the story is progressed is played by chapters, the ideal way is to play one chapter with 
 Ellen and they follow it with Keats as later on to progress further you will have to catch up with 
 one character to gain access to the rest of the game.
  This creates a bit of a annoyance as you have to re-visit each world that Ellen did with Keats, 
 but it's not a game-breaking feature.
  
  Keats does receive different folks to use, his approach to fighting them is also different then 
 Ellen's requiring you to use different methods, some of the boss battles are also in different 
 scenery, and each boss battle requires different folks to use.
  Alas, the idea is pretty much the same one, and once you beat the boss with Ellen, with a little 
 strategy difference Keats can pull it off as well on easier basic.
  Even though we re-visit the places with Keats, his story goes parallel with Ellen but he is distinguished 
 by his own. Who was the woman that called him, why was he contacted, what happened in the village 
 17th years ago amongst others question. Curious newspaper writer will go along with for a good 
 article.
  While Ellen is following in search for her long lost mother, they collide with each other and their 
 stories move along on steady pace always making you more intrigued: "what will happen next" 
  
  A lot of questions come up and lots of people are involved, only by finishing the game will 
 you find all the answers with many brought up to the light as the game progresses.
  
  The unique and fun use of PS3 sixaxis is well done, sometimes the game will require you to mix 
 its use for more challenging battles, but nothing overly impossible to pull, it's actually quite 
 easy once you get a hang of it. 
  
  There is also a options to do side-quests and download more from online store which are pretty 
 much the same worlds you visited but with user created missions.
  Nothing special to be honest, Folklore is all about single player story experience, but the options 
 are welcome if you want to spend more time. The PSN also offers new packs which will make coming 
 back for a bit more actions.
  
  Unless you're a totally consumed by pure actions games, you should not miss this excellent PS3 
 Action/RPG title.

Review:  Folklore for the Playstation 3
  
  Good- Amazing Graphics, Interesting storyline, Characters are very likeable, lots of attacks to 
 collect
  
  Bad- Repeating levels for both characters can be a pain to complete the main story
  
  Gameplay 
 10/10 This game offers you the power to suck the souls out of your enemies and use them in battle. 
 You have control of Kethes and Ellen and both have a different way of fighting, and with some many 
 folks to collect and use theres no complaing on that issue. You also use your remote to do actually 
 movement actions to suck souls out in many different ways. Using the folks in right ways to defeat 
 enemies and bosses, this game is sharp and just pure amazing.
  
  Graphics 9/10- This game is very sharp looking and cut scenes are so sharp its just amazing. The 
 game could of been a bit sharper in some area's but the overall presentation is just amazing. Sound 
 9/10 From creepy noises, to growling folks this games music is top notch. The only downside to 
 it, is certain moments don't fit 100% with the music, its a minor flaw and is easly not going to 
 ruin anything this game can offer for you.
  
  Storyline 10/10 This murder mystery and journey to the dead and so forth is something I have not 
 seen in any game. Its an amazing story from beginning to end and theres nothing quiet like it out 
 there. If theres any reason to pick this game up its this 1 of a kind storyline. Extra and Reply 
 Value 9/10 The game offers some online play and such but the real extra's lie in collecting all 
 the folks in the game and doing all the side quests along with extra costumes and extra battle 
 outfits. I am not sure what else this game could of offered to make it a 10 but I just felt something 
 was just missing that could of made this side quest a bit more interesting then they were.
  
  Overall 95 out of 100 or 9.5/10 check my other reviews for the reason for the score if you 
 care
  This game is the bomb! Most PS3 owners won't even notice this game, but its one of the best this 
 systems got and the main reason I picked up a PS3. From a one of a kind storyline to interesting 
 gameplay this game is an amazing adventure and will leave you wanting more.

Review:  I'm a big RPG fan, always have been. My RPG days date back to final fantasy 7, but this to me lacks 
 one simple thing that all RPG's desperatly need to appeal to me... a good story, or at least a decent 
 one. I didn't beat the game, but I definetly gave it time to improve on the story, and it just 
 didn't seem to be going in an interesting direction. I will be fair and say that the graphics, 
 gameplay, and overall design of the game was unique and fun. However if I want unique and fun I 
 can go play rock band, or guitar hero. I hesitate to classify this game as an RPG because it seems 
 to lack the feel of one. Don't go with my review on this one if your thinking about playing this 
 game, but definetly take my advice and rent it, don't buy it. I say that because I don't want you 
 to spend $60 and be as dissapointed as I was. I just enjoy the classic RPG setup, and this is definetly 
 an example of a step into a new direction for RPG's.

Review:  Well I got this game the day that it came out, and I must say that it's one of the best games I've 
 ever played, there are some weak spots but the pros definatley outweigh the cons here.
  
  pros: 
  great graphics
  an amazing story
  fun gameplay
  great music
  and will eat up 
 alot of time on boring weekends or weekdays.
  
  cons:
  comic book cut-sences might be tedious to some
  ocasional fast text during comic book sences
 
  ocasionally tedious levels but this is very rare
  extreme jump in difficulty towards the end of the game
  
  over all folklore is a very fun game 
 and worth buying for people that like action adventure games that think outside the box, or RPG/action 
 RPG fans. This game has one of the best stories I've ever seen in a video game if it wasn't for 
 the story this game would definatley be more of a 7 or lower but it does all the little things 
 right and with a solid story backing it and over all fun gameplay it's worth buying. Also absorbing 
 souls with the sixaxxis controler is great one of the few games I've encountered that uses the 
 motion sensing in the controler well.

Review:  This game was great. I hade my eyes on it for a couple of months. It's one of the games I enjoy 
 most. I mean come on! Riping the souls of you enemy. Instan classic.^^ 
  Sure it has its flaws. Like it could've been more fast paced or voice in the comic book style story 
 flow. But I don't really mind that, though it would've been alot better.
  Folklore is still one of my favorit games on the PS3 and since i live in europe I get downloadable 
 content so that is a plus for me. Hope there will be a sequal someday.:)
  Me and my friends have been whating for a game like this for a long time.

Review:  Folklore is the closest to living in a fairy tale you'll ever get. Everything that you can see 
 oozes magic which immerses you into the fairy tale-esque world of Folklore, while avoiding the 
 general clichs that most fairy tales suffer from.
  
  After recieving a letter from her supposedly dead mother, Ellen travels to the Irish village of 
 Doolin in search of her. But there is more to the story than once thought, as every resident in 
 the village is hiding a dark secret that somehow connects to Ellen's mysterious past.
  
  At the same time, Keats, a journalist on the paranormal, is sitting at his desk as he recieves 
 a phone call from a woman screaming for help and telling him to come to Doolin. Hoping to get a 
 good story for his magazine, Keats heads to the village of Doolin.
  
  These two strangers soon meet, and after some unexpected circumstances, they travel to the Netherworld. 
 The Netherworld is an afterlife based on Celtic mythology, where supposedly, the living can meet 
 the dead.
  
  You can tell from the start that Folklore isn't the heavily clichd happy-happy type that is present 
 in most fairy tales. And as the story is the star of the show, this is a refreshing tale to hear.
 
  
  While the story is the best part about Folklore, this doesn't mean that the gameplay has been set 
 aside for second best. You'll spend most of your time fighting magical creatures, called folks, 
 that are littered throughout the Netherworld, and the rest of your time doing detective work in 
 the village of Doolin.
  
  Combat consits of mapping previously defeated folk to one of the face buttons and then summoning 
 it to fight for you in battle. Every time you attack a folk, a blue "id" pops out of it. When the 
 folk is near death, the id turns red. When this happens, you can suck the souls right out of the 
 folk thanks to some ingenious motion sensitive work. Once the folk's id is yours, you can now summon 
 it in battle.
  
  To suck the folks soul, you hold R1, which lets your character grab ahold of the id, and then flick 
 the SIXAXIS controlller upwards to suck it in. Some of the tougher folk make it harder to suck 
 their id, so you'll need to weaken it, by using the SIXAXIS to bash it against the ground, for 
 example. This makes action very fast paced, and it never breaks up the fluidity of the combat.
 
  
  You'll need to experiment with your folks if you wish to succeed in Folklore because some of the 
 creatures you'll face are tough, and some folks will be more effective than others.
  
  You can play as both Ellen and Keats, who are seperated by chapters. For example, you can play 
 chapter 1 as Ellen, and if you wanted to, you can go back and play it as Keats to get another side 
 of the story. The two characters don't differ too much gameplay wise. The main difference is that 
 Ellen summons the folk, while Keats takes on the physical form of the folk. This does make repeating 
 the same dungeons twice tedious, but each character has different folk to collect, which breaks 
 up the repetition.
  
  Technically, it isn't pushing the limits of the PlayStation 3, but artistically, it is absolutely 
 gorgeous. Colourful worlds just ooze charm and magic, while the creatures are inventive and look 
 deadly. Doolin looks very mysterious, and actually feels like you're traversing a normal Irish 
 village. It all adds to an immersive experience.
  
  The main quest is heaps of fun to play, and will take you around 10 hours to complete. There are 
 plenty of sidequests which will add around 5 hours to the game. Unfortunately there is little reason 
 to go through the game a second time, unless you want to soak up the tremendous story again.
  
  This means that if you don't want a story heavy game, then Folklore isn't the best choice for 
 you, as long cutscenes and lots of dialogue are riddled throughout each chapter. But for those 
 that want to hear a wonderfully detailed story, while kicking the dust out of Folkloric creatures 
 and using very fluid and fun uses of the motion sensing capablities, then this is the perfect game 
 for you.

Review:  I was a little leary about buying this game at first. I read a couple good reviews and a couple 
 mixed ones. Let me tell you, I am still enjoying Folklore, and very happy I bought it.
  
  Folklore's a Fantasy murder mystery action adventure RPG..... seriously. And all done beautifully. 
 Graphically it's gorgeous. You'll never get tired of looking at the game. From the town of Doolin 
 to any of the netherworld realms you'll be impressed. FMV's, in game sequences, Character conversations 
 and the storyboards all look great too. The characters of the world all show an impressive imagination, 
 and all have their own personalities.
  
  Musically, great. The score sounds good and fits the mood in pretty much every situation, while 
 the voice overs and sound effects fill the gaps nicely.
  
  As far as gameplay goes, it's just old fashioned fun, with a few quirks thrown in for good measure. 
 You pretty much work out of the town and traverse to different netherworld's where you do your 
 fighting and Id collecting. All the Id's you collect have different attributes and you can waste 
 hours just trying to release Karma. And fighting for souls is fun. It was a great way to use the 
 six axis controller, and really helped immerse you in the game.
  
  There are a couple bad points though. For one, you pretty much have to play through the whole game, 
 doing the same levels at least twice, with both characters. There's a lot of differences though, 
 both in storyline, play styles, and folk's, so it's not that bad. Also, when you switch your folks, 
 there's a slight delay, every time. I stopped noticing it after awhile, it really didn't bother 
 me that much.
  
  If you're out to try something new and interesting, with a great story, go ahead and pick up Folklore.

 the viuals in the game is amazing and the use of the six axis is really cool. I mean u use the 
 six axis for sucking up folk whis is awesome by the way. And did i ever mention that the visuals 
 are amazing. If you are not into wierd rpgs then dont get this but if you are waiting for another 
 rpg to hit the ps3 then this is it. This game will give enough time of play hours to wait for Shiver 
 Isle for oblivion. Overall this is a realy great game and this is a must have game for the PS3.

Review:  If your into Fantasy, or Murder or fiction you'll find Folklore brillient alot of fantasy and imaginative.
 
  They story is about a young girl called Ellen who is looking for her mother and her past so she 
 goes to the village Doolin find some answers, Also there is a man called Keats who is a jounalist 
 who writes a magazine called Unknowen Realm and gets a phone call from the village to and finding 
 out whats going on. But at night time there are thses portals to the Netherworld, you travel to 
 realms beyond our own, seeking the knowledge of the dead, there is alot of ghost's, spirits, and 
 creatures some that kinda look like out of Harry Potter films. Your mostly thinking of dreams world 
 but there is alot of murder investing and mysterys to find out about the past and who is the murder 
 in the village.
  Gameplay is very fun you are capturing creatures that yuou can use there powers to fight other 
 monsters and bosses it can be abit tricky trying to kill a boss but there is a tip if you collect 
 book pages when you are travelling through realms which will help you beat them. Graphics are perfect 
 your mostly thinking of a really good fantasy book coming to life with alot imagination, dreams 
 and fantasy all put togethor, sounding not bad but you'll be enjoying sucking up there souls thats 
 you get abiltys and attacks and ranking up as well, when the souls pops out on red you need to 
 press R1 and tilit the Controller up or down or sideways to suck up there souls.
  I really enjoyed playing this game once you have beaten the game you'll never get tired of it there 
 is also quest that you can do in the pub to earn rare items, also has online features where you 
 can buy and download more quests or clouthing, there is also dungeon trails where you can make 
 your own dungeon or play someone esle's which can be fun becuase if you get points for them the 
 more you get and be on the top of the leaderboard.
  This is one game not to be missed if you enjoyed reading Harry Potter or Northen Lights or Tokyo 
 Babylon or any other book you like reading Folklore is worth playing over and over with lots of 
 wired stuff happening it could happen to you.

Review:  this was a wonderful experience, the style permeates every bit of the game, from beginning to end, 
 making for a beautiful experience, but it doesn't end there!
  the two main characters, Ellen and Keats, are both wonderfully well-developed, and you honestly 
 care about them, which really speaks to the games story, and the way it tells it. you also get 
 a chance to get to know the other characters fairly well too. I haven't been so attached to the 
 characters in a game in a very long while.
  beyond that, the music is wonderful, emotional and epic. it serves to enhance everything else about 
 the game.
  and on to gameplay mechanics, yes, it kind of feels like any old action game, but even freshens 
 that up some with the ability, and necessity to change your attacks. it also features a wonderful 
 use of the SIXAXIS that serves to provide a somewhat deeper immersion since you are to an extent 
 mimicking the actions of the character on screen.
  the game is only as long as it needs to be to tell it's story, if you are only playing through 
 for the story, however there is more there, although less than I would have liked... still, since 
 most people only play a given game all the way through once, it isn't unreasonably little. all 
 in all you'll probably be through it in about 14 hours if you don't do the side quests.
  still, a wonderful plot, well-developed characters, a beautiful style, and some inovative new ways 
 to use the SIXAXIS add up to a wonderful experience that can easily be recommended to anyone.

Review:  After the mediocre Genji: Days of the Blade, Japanese developer Game Republic tries again with 
 their second PlayStation 3 title, Folklore. And while they still struggle with many issues in gameplay 
 and presentation, the end result remains enjoyable for anyone interested in an engaging action-adventure 
 with a story deep enough to question the very meaning of death.
  
  The game follows the young Ellen and journalist Keats who are both lured into the mysterious village 
 of Doolin, said to be a bridge between the world of the living and the dead. As you explore various 
 fantastically beautiful realms as both Ellen and Keats, the two not only unravel a series of murders 
 lying 17 years in the past but also see themselves in the middle of a war between the beings of 
 the netherworld.
  
  While the story is incredibly engaging, the same can not always be said about the game's art of 
 story-telling however. Dialogs are usually presented in a comic-style fashion of still photos of 
 the 3D environments and characters, but often lack convincing expressiveness and are rather sterile 
 and lifeless. On contrast, the rarely occurring cutscenes are a breath of fresh air and the voice 
 acting is mostly solid.
  
  The meat of the game is the combat however. As you walk around in the many different realms of 
 the netherworld, you'll encounter about a dozen different folks per realm, each with specific strengths 
 and weaknesses. Since weapons are of little use in the lands of the dead, the two protagonists 
 soon learn to absorb the souls of their enemies and use their abilities against their former comrades. 
 This allows for a ton of variation on how the game can be played, although you'll probably stick 
 with a few key attacks for the most part. Some folks and particularly each realm's end boss, the 
 so called folklores, will require specific combinations of attacks however and since given hints 
 in form of collectible scratches don't always help to figure out which strategy works, you'll often 
 find yourself shuffling through the list of collected folks. Luckily, the list is well organized 
 and accessible, although brief pauses after each switch can get annoying after a while.
  
  Sucking out a folks ID is done entirely with the Sixaxis's tilty-control and not only works surprisingly 
 well but is also a great deal of fun, especially after a hard battle against an especially tough 
 opponent. A quick yank with the controller is enough for most folks, some however hang onto their 
 life quite a bit and need a little convincing in form of a short minigame before giving up. These 
 range from timing-based thrusts and wild shaking to banging the IDs to the ground repeatedly or 
 balancing them for a period of time.
  
  Since Keats and Ellen will stride through the same environments for the most part, the game can 
 get a bit repetitive after a while, but Folklore tries to mix it up in many small but noticeable 
 ways. Some of the folks change depending on the character played and while Keats is more of a brawler 
 and can transform himself for a short time for higher damage, Ellen's attacks are often less risky 
 as you don't have to get too close, but require a bit more preparation time.
  
  If you stick to the main plot, you can expect the game to take you around 15-20 hours, but of course 
 the game encourages you to collect and level up each and every single one of your pokemans by following 
 a number of side quests for special items and other goodies. There's also an online mode complete 
 with a simple but restrictive level editor allowing you to create and share your own monster-filled 
 dungeons and play others' creations for leader board points. This component is rather underdeveloped 
 though and lacks a bunch of options one would expect the game to have.
  
  Folklore is, for the most part, a great-looking game thanks to the imaginative and diverse environments 
 and fantastic monster designs, as well as the often impressive texture quality. Some aspects however, 
 like some of the side-characters and areas don't look quite as good as the rest of the game and 
 drag the overall impression down. Same can be said for the rather confined levels which not only 
 make navigation in narrow spaces in a pack of monsters a challenge but also often forces the camera 
 into confusing positions.
  
  Same can be said about the audio, specifically the music. While later levels feature some marvelous 
 pieces of engaging music, the early realms' tunes are so short and loop over and over that you'll 
 find yourself annoyed very quickly. As mentioned, the voice acting is solid for the most part, 
 although some of the characters' voices and lines are rather forgettable.
  
  At the end of the day, Folklore is a game of mixed feelings. You'll find yourself often amazed 
 by the game's beautiful environments and deep storyline, but at the same time, you'll be irritated 
 by minor but noticeable flaws that show in almost every aspect in the game. Luckily, the good parts 
 manage to overshadow most of these issues and you'll most definitely have a good time if you enjoy 
 this type of game.

Review:  Folklore is an RPG where you control two characters on divergent yet parallel paths surrounding 
 a murder mystery in a small Irish town named Doolin. Ellen lost her mother 17 years ago and recieved 
 a letter from her telling her to come to Doolin, while a very objective reporter working for an 
 occult magazine named Keats recieves a prank call about a murder from what he believes is a dead 
 woman. While slow to start as the mystery builds, the game gets rolling in the intrigue and mystery.
 
  
  Gameplay : Now if you've played the demo, you might not say this is an RPG, but I'd say it is. 
 The combat is reminiscent of Kameo in that you have the ability to use many Folks (the spirits 
 you absorb, more on that later) which are assigned to the square, circle, X and triangle buttons 
 (By the way, there are literally 100+ folks in the game with more coming later) . The main part 
 of the game related to combat has to do with capturing folks that can defeat other folks later 
 on. As I said, assign up to 4 folks per pallete and go around and start abusing more as you progress 
 through the various worlds. The more you beat on a folk, the more its soul pops out. When it turns 
 red, you can absorb the soul by pressing the R1 button and then yanking back on the SixAxis controller, 
 sort of like hooking a fish. Bigger stronger folks require some more complicated motions like pulling 
 when the soul turns red, miss and the gauge lowers, or wave it back and forth as if you are slamming 
 it on the ground. Anyways, it's like a big game of tug of war and is an excellent use of the SixAxis 
 controller for once.
  
  While fighting folk, you can dodge with R2, lock on with L1 and L2 swaps folk out (you can save 
 various sets of folk for quick access later if you like that setup) . The folk, which are tremendously 
 varied in size and shape also come in many flavors of attack types. Some are melee, some are ranged, 
 some are... hard to describe, some are defensive, others inflict status ailments on enemies. There 
 are elemental types, like fire, lightning, destroy and such which while an enemy may do regular 
 type melee damage, another might do fire type, another might do destroy, etc.
  
  Some folks are completely impervious to certain folk attacks and elements, so you have to take 
 advantage of using the diverse array of helpers you collect. In the game you can pickup a folklore 
 book for each area which through pictures describes what folks beat other folks (including bosses) . 
 They don't always give you the exact order in which to attack or what folk to hit a boss with first, 
 but the pictures give you a clue to interpret (don't bother with reading, the characters are weird 
 runes) . Bosses have a very Zelda feel to them (when it was good) . They are challenging, but not 
 unreasonably so. Don't get complacent though because you start off doing well, they often change 
 attack pattern and weakness through the fight.
  
  Beyond that, the game has RPG elements where the more folks you either absorb (Steal their soul) 
 you can gain experience to get more HP, increase karma (Power up folks) , get items etc
  
  Releasing Karma can be achieved through defeating other folks with the type you have, absorbing 
 that kind of folk, defeating any folk, or using karma releasing items. The increased abilities 
 include more damage, more folk of that one type able to be used at once, reduced magic consumption, 
 etc. From various quests you run for people in town you can get more karma releasing items, different 
 clothing or other such rewards.
  
  That pretty much explains most of the gameplay. In town you run around, talk to NPCs, advance the 
 story.
  
  However, since there are two characters, and beyond storyline (more on that later) , they play slightly 
 different. Ellen regenerates magic. I. E. you can use attacks more frequently once low. Keats on 
 the other hand uses all his magic until he stops attacking for 3 or so seconds, then it instantly 
 refills. So while pretty similar and there is no major unbalancing, the two characters play somewhat 
 different. Keats also has a transformation attack where once he absorbs enough souls, he can transform 
 into some zombie/demon thing where he is invincible and can do MASSIVE DAMAGE to enemy weak spots.... 
 err my bad, massive amounts of damage quite quickly. Too bad it lasts only 5 or so seconds. Ellen 
 gets different cloaks that add to her powers.
  
  The biggest drawback though in gameplay is that you absorb the same folk for the most part (they 
 are somewhat different in each characters hands) , you absorb them and play through the game in 
 both characters in the exact same way, it tells the story differently, but the areas are the same 
 through both characters, you fight the same bosses, etc. This brings down the gameplay value a 
 bit, not enough to take away from it being amazing, but it does get somewhat repetetive, but then 
 a lot of RPGs are.
  
  Gameplay = 8/10
  
  Graphics : This game is an amazing visual feast. From the first full motion cutscene, which rivals 
 anything Square or Namco puts out, to the ingame engine to the particle effects, this game has 
 it all.
  
  Let me highlight some of the game's strong points (which are many) .
  
  - Excellent dynamic lighting. Walking past a lightsource will give you realistic shadows. Shadows 
 just don't come from howhere here, but are affected by the light source. Additionally, shadows 
 cast by overhead objects realistically translate into the game. You stand under clouds then walk 
 into the sun, your character will illuminate properly.
  - Walking through grasses and flowers disturbs them, sending little particles into the air. Same 
 for dusty ground. Little things like this are nice.
  - The folk themselves are very diverse and representative of the themes of their area. For instance, 
 in the Faery Realm, you get little pixie elfin creatures, giant giraffes with hammers on their 
 heads, huge bear/owl half breeds, while in the Warcadia zone, you get devilish military gnomes, 
 mechanized war machines, airplanes with faces, etc. Their attacks are all varied and their appearances 
 are all varied. Quite a diverse array of models.
  - The particle effects are out of this world. The flying butterflies, sprites, wisps of light, 
 enemy explosions, flame and lighting attacks, everything is very magical and ethereal. Translucent 
 lighting effects, vibrant colors, you name it this has it. The greatest feature in this regard 
 is the soul stealing aspect. The game has a deformation engine that is reminiscent of ghost busters, 
 where you have the enemy trapped and you are tugging at their gossamer soul strings. It's just 
 beautiful.
  - Clothing and the main character modeling, specifically Ellen and Keats are on par with anything 
 seen in Gears of War or Heavenly Sword (although the skin and facial expressions aren't quite up 
 to those levels) . The clothing flops and flows in the wind and with movement. The characters move 
 seamlessly and diferently. Keats has an disinterested quality to him, while Ellen has a very protective 
 withdrawn nature to her, clutching her arm to her side. This is even reflected in battle in how 
 the stand and attack. Ellen is more magical, graceful and feminine, Keats is more masculine and 
 overt.
  - The levels range from a virtual acid trip of pastel colors, flowering fields, dark forests to 
 bombed out fantastical European settings in WW2.
  - Individual AI scripts run for even birds in the background. Some might be picking at a dead body, 
 another flaps wings, another is just sitting there, others may be in flight. The point is that 
 there is no detail unnoticed by the programmers.
  
  The whole game is so diverse and so visually enthralling. The only exception to the amazing graphical 
 features is that there aren't enough FMV cutscenes, a lot of the game is played out through comic 
 book stylized static in game engine cutscenes. While they are very nice and another varied art 
 medium, they don't quite hit home as well as the in game engine or FMVs. Nice, but still wishing 
 for a little more.
  
  Graphics = 9 out of 10
  
  Sound : The sound in this game only adds to the immersion level. The voice over actors are great. 
 One of my complaints about Heavenly Sword for instance was Asian looking people with Asian names 
 sounding English took away from the immersive qualities. This game is set in Ireland and people 
 have Irish, or at least English accents that fit better. I'm from the USA, so I wouldn't be able 
 to tell if they are 100% spot on with the local dialect, but it's quite convincing. Again, Ellen 
 is meek and timid, but determined, Keats has an always optimistic and openminded rational air to 
 his voice, as if he is always in charge even if he knows he isn't. The folk's voices are delightful. 
 From the traditional elfin high pitched voice to ... well what does a talking tree sound like or 
 a two headed robot?
  
  More impressive sound effects and musical numbers are outlined as above:
  
  - Walking on different 
 surfaces, I. E. Grass vs. dirt road vs. stone vs. wood and such all make different footfall noises 
 in accompanying the different graphical effects.
  - In town at night you hear crickets, owls, frogs and other creatures of the night surrounding 
 you. This is extremely immersive especially in surround sound mode. Similarly, in the Netherworld 
 regions you hear all sorts of background noise like the owls in the forest, fluttering of butterflies, 
 chimes and other magical sounds from nearby magical creatures. Everything adds to the ambiance 
 that just draws you right in. The same goes for other realms. In the Warcadia zone, giant bombs 
 are being dropped, planes flying over, sounds of gunfire in the distance.
  - Each folk also has a distinct sound when they attack you, or they are attacking under your command 
 and what not. Same as before, graphics and sounds are very diverse.
  - The musical score ranges from a haunting piano tune in the middle of the day in town. Reminds 
 me of Silent Hill/Resident Evil or something like that with the whole mysterious vibe. The Faery 
 Realm battle music is some demented circus music that you might hear in a Tim Burton feature film, 
 the Warcadia music is a thumping marching hymn that sounds straight out of WW2. Again, the only 
 lacking feature is that there is very little of the voice over dialogue, only reserved for FMV 
 cutscenes rather than NPC conversations in game engine and comic cutscene engine. If there was 
 more voice work, this game would have a perfect sound score.
  
  Sound = 9 out of 10
  
  Value : While I've been playing for 10+ hours now, and I'm only in chapter 2 for each character. 
 I've done many quests, upgraded and captured almost all my folks and I still probably have another 
 good 20 or so hours.
  
  Another intriguing fact about this game is that the creators have already expressed interest in 
 releasing additional folks, downloadable dungeons and the ability to create your own dungeons for 
 time trials and difficulty tests to upload and let other players try. While not in full swing, 
 this aspect should merely add to the replayability of this game. I can't wait to see what happens 
 in the future. Since this feature isn't realized in reality yet, I can't give this a full 10 value 
 since it's not 100% implemented.
  
  Value = 9 out of 10
  
  Tilt : What can I say? This game has solid gameplay taking elements from Pokemon, Kameo, Zelda 
 and making them all work into a solid game. The graphics and sound are amazing and highly immersive. 
 Trust me, play the game, you will be drawn into an amazing and fantastical alternate world that 
 seems as real as ours. This game fully feels next gen in almost every way. While the repetition 
 of the gameplay hurts the gameplay score somewhat, an interesting thing to note is that while you 
 tread the same ground throughout the game in both characters. They story told is distinct, yet 
 interrelated. Keats sees things Ellen doesn't and vice versa. Both are working to the same goal 
 and with each other, but in reality the forces they deal with are on opposing sides. The two characters 
 are so polar in mannerisms and behavior and beliefs it's like two completely different games that 
 somehow fit together perfectly. Hell, the game explains to you even why if you play as Keats that 
 even if what Ellen did already or vice versa didn't and yet did happen at the same time. In otherwords, 
 the game tells you the flow of time is different in the Netherworld and it makes the whole chronology 
 of the game make sense. Little touches like this are quite nice.
  
  Again, besides the lack of a lot of FMV cutscenes and more use of voice overs, the game has a bit 
 of a loading fetish, and it fulfills its desires frequently. Every scene or locale change is a 
 3 or 4 second loading screen, even with the paltry 35 mb install file. Still, a lot of games nowadays 
 have loading screens, some hide it better than others. In reality it won't ruin your experience, 
 just it sticks out.
  
  Overall this is one of those amazing games that the PS3 is taking a chance on a new intellectual 
 property and I believe it paid off. One of the most immersive games with high quality production 
 values and solid gameplay you can get this generation or otherwise.
  
  Tilt = 10 out of 10
  
  Recap
  
  Gameplay = 8 out of 10
  Graphics = 9 out of 10
  Sound 
 = 9 out of 10
  Value = 9 out of 10
  Tilt = 10 out of 10
  
  Overall = 9 out of 10
  
  Pros:
  + Incredible graphics and sound. On par with anything Square or Namco or Epic puts forth. 
 Amazingly immersive.
  + Epic story told from two fronts with two likeable characters.
  + Diversity of characters, monsters, and realms makes this game very unique. Very next generation. 
 Must be experienced.
  
  Cons :
  - Some issues with loading can be annoying
  - Dearth of voice overs and cutscenes kind of hurts, especially with supposed Next gen media storage 
 AKA Blu-Ray.
  - Sometimes repetetive, even if telling a different aspect of the story. Too bad the paths that 
 the two took weren't different at least.

Review:  The story is engaging, gameplay elements such as the capturing folk ids is interesting and fun, 
 but the game falls short on taking full advantage of the concept to make a refreshing and non repetitive 
 game. Graphic is great, story is engaging, game concept is unique and solid, but the folk ids lack 
 variety. This game could have been so much better with the right combination of ids, but in the 
 current state, the different ids are not unique enough. Basically they have their attack type (wind, 
 fire, ice, water, slash, etc) and save for the minor variations such as web, charm, and aoe attacks, 
 they are just the same simple attack with different animations. And once you realize it, the game 
 gets boring.
  
  The story is great at the beginning, but as it progresses, I can't help but get the feeling that 
 it is being dragged out. Folklore is a good game with fresh ideas that falls a little bit short 
 in its implementation.

Review:  I learned long ago that reviews should not be taken seriously and decide whether a person should 
 purchase or not. This is one of those times where I'm glad I took my own advice because Gamespot's 
 review bordered on insane. This is a game that provides an innovative and enjoyable method of game 
 play through the Sixaxis, with which other have not fared so well, and provides an engaging, well-crafted 
 story. The story (in a spoiler-free description) tells of a reporter named Keats and a woman named 
 Ellen who is searching for her mother. In the process of their own stories they will come across 
 creatures called Folks that they have the ability to absorb and use against other Folks. There 
 are many, many different Folks throughout the game and a good number of these Folks can not simply 
 be bashed away at until they are ready to be captured- strategies of sorts need to be used on some. 
 Upon successfully beating the spirit of the creature out of its body the character needs to latch 
 onto the spirit and wrestle it the rest of the way out of the body. Each creature will only have 
 one function to use once it has been absorbed- some will use quick focused slashes, some will have 
 wide powerful swipes, others will use elements such as water, ice, earth and several others. Boss 
 battles can be especially interesting as they usually can't just be bashed away at with just one 
 Folk- they need to be dealt with more strategically, by using different Folks abilities in succession. 
 These wouldn't be so easy to guess at but as sort of a fun little puzzle element, each realm has 
 its own picture book that will tell you how to take down different creatures- deciphering these 
 isn't always easy but it can be very rewarding to figure it out on your own. Ellen and Keats do 
 go through the same basic areas in their respective stories but each time is different- different 
 Folks, different events and a different story. Overall, this is a very, very enjoyable game. It 
 may be short in length at around 20 or so hours (that is if you don't rush through it) but it doesn't 
 feel short at all; the pacing is done very well. This is a rental at the least but I'm proud to 
 own it.

Review:  This game is something yanked right out of Tim Burton's imagination. The art direction is amazing 
 and charming, the character/monster designs are interesting, and the Netherworld realms themselves 
 never fail to impress. The color palette used in the game is vivid and bright, and the soundtrack 
 does an excellent job of enhancing the mood of the story and locales.
  
  The story follows Ellen and Keats, and though it seems to be convoluted and slow-moving at first, 
 the mysteries will keep you guessing and coming back for more. The story will grab hold of you 
 and not let go. And despite what some may say, the storybook-like dialogue scenes are NOT devoid 
 of life. The whole game itself is like an interactive storybook.
  
  The use of the Sixaxis controller is well implemented (there's just something fun about beating 
 the soul out of a monster before yanking it out of them) .
  
  The game does, however, feature a lot of backtracking and at times the camera angles can become 
 a pain, even when the player has complete control over them.
  
  That aside, Folklore is extremely charming and addictive, and is truly a treat for the eyes and 
 imagination.

 RPG for the ps3!!!!! Folklore is an enchanting game with spectacular grapics and storyline. I give 
 this game a 10/10 because it is something no gaming industry has ever done before. I am used to 
 games like; Final Fantasy and Atelier Iris. Plus my Husband likes to play first person shooters 
 and football and we both happen to LOVE this game. I think it will appeal to all. Playing is believing

Review:  The first time i saw the pics and videos for this game... i wasnt that interested in it until I 
 got my hands on the demo. My interest changed dramatically. The big boss/environment was what got 
 me mesmerized and I was curious about the outcome of the full version. Chapter 1 will start off 
 slow and a bit easy. Chapter 2 is where all hell breaks loose. This is where the battle is mild 
 to hard and will draw you deeper into the game. Sucking the life out of the folks feels rewarding 
 and at the same time eyecandy. I was suprised how amazing this game turned out. The mysterious/artistic 
 visuals and sounds are what makes it enchanting. Everything looks and feels unique. If they were 
 to use more full motion/voice cgi, this game would have been very solid. Those who hates to read 
 will hate the comic part of this game. If they had AT LEAST implemented the voice to the comic, 
 it would have balanced out. There wouldn't be too many people complaining about it. This is not 
 one of those turn-base type RPG games. All the battles are in real-time and enjoyable to play. 
 It's a sleeper hit !

Review:  I loooove this game, BEST PS3 RPG! even thought there arent many of them. The story is great, so 
 many twists and exitement in every chapter! The graphics are pretty good and the game is fun to 
 play, sucking up souls, tryign to find out there weaknesses.
  
  The main story lasts about 14 hours, and there are alot of quests you can complete. There is dungeon 
 trial mode, were you create your own dungeon and upload it onto the internet, then other people 
 can play it. You can play other peopels dungeons, and all the points you get from beating dungeons 
 gives you more folks to use in your own dungeon.
  
  The worst part of the game is having to play the same chapter twice. You have to play it as Ellen 
 and Keats. It was very annoying to have to complete it twice and would have been much better if 
 they each had there own realms.

Review:  Though folklore might not be for everyone its a game that offer a complex dark story with murders 
 to solve.
  
  The game feels a bit goth in nature, it reminded me a lot about the first shadow hearts for the 
 PS2.
  
  The sixaxis feature was incorporated pretty well, it offers different ways to catch the many folks 
 you can catch in the game.
  
  If you are looking for a game that offers long gameplay and great story and specially if you love 
 what true gaming is about. (Japanese games.) and not just some generic reskinned first person shooter 
 I think folklore is for you.

Review:  I'm really amazed at some of the low scores Gamespot tends to give to fresh new orignal games such 
 as Folklore. It's not a 10, but for a gamer like me that can't be bothered with games like Oblivion... (I 
 HAVE other things to do! lol) and for more casual gamers, Folklore is incredibly addicting and 
 immersive. Great visuals, music, voice acting.. and FUN to play. I'd give this one a chance. For 
 the hardcore gamers that like Oblivion and don't have full time jobs, maybe renting this game would 
 be best since it's shorter than games like this. ... but still worth the money with the game editor 
 options. 9.0

Review:  When I first played the Folklore demo a while ago I was impressed by the color pallet and the visual 
 design and after I purchased the full game I still find the game visually impressive.
  
  If you like lush, color rich worlds then the Netherworld will certainly be a winner for you. Every 
 realm of the Netherworld is just a testament to how well thought out color schemes and pallets 
 were.
  
  If you're like me you will find the village of Doolin to be quite impressive. The detail of the 
 building and the grass just really made me say wow at times. The water isn't too impressive though 
 and probably could have been done last gen.
  
  Also, there is some slow down and the water patterns and textures repeat when overlooking the ocean.
 
  
  The gameplay is fun for the most part. You essentially capture folks throughout each realm and 
 use them to defeat the folklore at the end of the a realm. Now this all sound silly if you don't 
 know the story.
  
  *Possible Spoiler*
  
  The general concept of the story is: two strangers, Ellen and Keats, have been summoned to the 
 down of Doolin by a mysterious letter and phone call respectively. Shortly after arriving the woman 
 who summoned them is murdered. Ellen believes the woman to be her mom and Keats is interested in 
 solving the murder and writing a story on it. Both goals can only be attained by traveling to the 
 Netherworld.
  
  *End spoiler*
  
  Each folklore releases a memory that either character may be searching for.
  
  The main problem, 
 with the game is that you get stuck in some tight areas fight large or numerous folks and it can 
 get extremely frustrating when some of the more annoying folks offset your whole attack scheme.
 
  
  Sometimes you'll feel like it is near impossible to clear an area of enemies and just run through 
 it rather than have half your health depleted because of annoying folks.
  
  Folklore battles can also feel like punishment due to the obscure instructions in your picture 
 book.
  
  Overall, Folklore is a fun game that is just right for the upcoming holiday. With this and Jericho 
 you'll be set for a good night of Halloween gaming.

Review:  Folklore (PS3)
  Now i am writing this review has sort of a Apologie to Sony, Having let my PS3 gather dust ever 
 since it's launch i have had nearly no use to use the system has a games machine, mearly a Blu 
 ray player which has got lots of use.
  The Ps3 lacked games, resistance and Motorstorm to me where a mear let down which didnt really 
 get my hopes build up on the Ps3, Now 7 Months on since it's UK launch i can now, safely say, Sony, 
 you done good.
  Sony made a rather brave desicion, release the game soon after the Halo 3 craze and of course that 
 wouldnt of been a good time to release folklore, but sony did it anyway and hey, it worked
  This game is selling a lot and has builded up a decent support group, after GameSpot's rather dissapointing 
 Review, 7.0 i decided to buy it and see for myself, 10min's into it i am hooked, literally i was 
 Hooked, absoutley beautful looking game and delivered a rather great RPG plot.
  Pure sony, if your into RPG's, get it you wont be dissapointed
  
  Sorry about the Spelling 
 and rather shortness of the review, but it is 05:45am in the morning and the orange ox comes out 
 tomorrow and i wont have time to do this review so i am doing it now, Please if you have a ps3 
 and Like RPG's get it!

Review:  Folklore is all in all a great game. It has a slow start, but quickly becomes really involved as 
 you advance yourself through the story. The more folk you get, the more possibilities open up. 
 The folk capturing is well thought out and imo this game has the best use of the sixaxis control 
 scheme to date. I recommend this game for anyone who's into adventure gaming. If you enjoy light 
 leveling based games with real-time action then definitely give this game a go. One of the bonuses 
 in addition to leveling yourself is the fact that you get to improve your captured folk (releasing 
 karma) , which makes them stronger and more useful. I also like how you have to use one folk against 
 another in order to beat and capture them. All boss battles require at least 3 specific folks in 
 order to take them down. This game is often referred to as a RPG, but it's missing a few things 
 that would give it that level of authenticity. Its halfway there, but not quite. In any case, 
 Folklore is a very well done game with extras like map building and rare folk collecting that will 
 keep gamers playing it for a while after they've completed it.

Review:  I downloaded the demo available on playstation network, and instantly fell in love with the look 
 of this game. Deep rich colors with colorful characters. I'm planning on purchasing this one, it 
 was very interesting to play and grabbed me right away.
  
  The only flaw I can see with the demo was the camera was a little awkward to use, but it's probably 
 a change from a fixed camera and the movement the camera has in Folklore.
  
  I think but what the demo has to offer this is a game worth trying. It's not going to be an Oblivion 
 , but there arent many that can hold a candle to it!!

Review:  I'll admit I've been looking forward to folklore for quiet some time now, I loved the JPN demo, 
 and i loved the US demo. Its hard to describe some of the intricacies that make it so wonderful 
 to play. Its a very well done game with few flaws.
  
  Graphics: Seeing as what seems to be most important to alot of people in this generation of console 
 is graphics i'll start with that first. Now some reviews have said that they're very average and 
 nothing special, which is true to some extent. Although they're not Heavenly Sword or Lair level 
 graphics they are unique and beautiful in their own right. From the little sparkles and twinkles 
 that emanate forth from the blackness, to fields full of flowers in vibrant colors that simply 
 look stunning to say in the least. The NPC's and Folks in the game are fairly well done, and they 
 are quite believable, i've not yet met one that looked shabby or out of place.
  In my honest opinion the main characters facial models are a little underwhelming, but you don't 
 see too much of them so its really not a problem. The battle animations are excellently done, and 
 with a large number of different attacks that is probably very important that they mostly all look 
 good.
  Graphics i would give a 9 overall.
  
  Sound: I would say that the sound and music is what really brings this game to life, from the enchanting 
 almost bouncy tracks, to the cold and chilling tracks that rely almost solely on a single piano. 
 The musics is both enchanting and enthralling, and if they ever released a soundtrack I would pick 
 it up in an instant. The attack noises and environmental background noise all sounds superb, and 
 offer up to 7.1 surround. My one complaint is that there was not enough voice work in the game, 
 which is a shame because when there is speech in the game it is done convincingly and conveys just 
 the right tones. Sound I would give a 10, because its a rare treat to have such an amazing sounding 
 game such as this.
  
  Gameplay: A number of people have stated that the gameplay, or at least the battle parts of it 
 is overly repetitive and boring. To a small degree this is true, but with over 100 folks to capture, 
 and level, it really doesn't get all that repetitive. The battle is fast paced and really makes 
 you feel like you have a sense of power over your opponent, especially with the large arsenal of 
 folks at hand to deal with whatever shall cross your path. Now when your not in battle you'll just 
 be walking around and talking to people, now it has you're typicall RPG borders around every area 
 so don't expect to go wandering off, the areas are linear, but most of them have little nooks and 
 crannies that have hidden items that restore your Mana or Life. It has your standard RPG leveling 
 system, which works perfectly fine. Other than that there are no surprises but it is just a lot 
 of fun to play. The boss battles in particular are some of the coolest most inventive I've seen 
 since SoTC.
  I would give the gameplay an 8, mostly due to some pacing issues that might discourage some players 
 rather early in the game.
  
  Story: The story is what originally drew me to the game, there are dual story lines that dovetail 
 into each other at every twist in and turn. Even though most of the story is done through text 
 (in nicely done and quite stylish comic book style cut scenes) i really felt attached to the characters, 
 Ellen's story especially was filled with emotion and twists in all the right places, Keats story 
 is almost as good, but he just felt to detached from the situation to me.
  
  Overall: you could easily waste a week traversing the paths of the netherworld. With lots of downloadable 
 content planned, user created dungeons, and tons of things to do and unlock in the game already, 
 replay value is fairly good. If you're an action or shooter junkie this game is simply not for 
 you, but anyone who enjoys a good story with at times somber gameplay that is otherwise a load 
 of fun, i would recommend you pick this one up.

Review:  Great game with good graphics. Intriguing story but just a little too short. But sucking the souls 
 of your ennemies....... whoa so very cool!!!! Took me like 5 minutes to learn how to play..... ain't 
 very difficult. But I finished it in 12 hours, too short for me.....20 hours minimum is a must for 
 me. But I must admit that it was 12 hours of fun...... can't tell the same thing for many games for 
 the PS3 at this point. A wide variety of attacks are available in this game and you must use almost 
 all of them to beat some bosses. If you ask me if you must buy or rent this game I'd have to say 
 go and buy it....... I know I'll finish it more than once.

Review:  Folklore is a great game for anyone interested in RPG's or action adventure. It takes good elements 
 of both generes and creates an interesting game. The gameplay can be summed up with one gameplay 
 video. You put monsters souls on you face button and press that button to do that attack. To get 
 more souls you suck them out of enemys using the sixaxis. It works and its fun. The flaw of the 
 game is its sometimes boring, repetitive and uninteresting. If you start to think these things 
 you will be put into an action scene soon after so it isnt a big deal. The game seems to have has 
 a small budget but that doesnt keep it from being a great game. If your interested in Action RPGs 
 pick up this game. Its aamwoseomes.

Review:  Folklore is a surprising treat. The way a simple murder mystery can transform into a rich and complex 
 action-RPG is another example of what the PS3 can do. The graphics are beautiful and colorful. 
 The story of Ellen, Keats and how the village is linked to the Netherworld is unique and refreshing 
 from today's trend in games. Combat is clean and full of a variety of different attacks. Music 
 and sound effects isn't top-notch, but it's still nice to listen to and easy on the ears. The uniqueness 
 and charm of Folklore is definitely its strongest point. Not to mention the use of the Sixaxis 
 adds a twist into the gameplay when collecting Ids and taking down the big bosses.
  
  On a side note, both characters play the same levels, however they have slightly different play 
 styles to make up for a feeling of repetitive-ness. The majority of the cutscenes won't be appreciated 
 by many, because they aren't full motion and no voices, almost like a graphic novel. The full cutscenes 
 however are amazing. Personally, that just makes the game feel even more charming and unique to 
 me. I would recommand this to anyone who likes action-RPGs, but I warn you that I can see where 
 it wouldn't be for everyone.

Review:  Give me a moment to vent. Since when is a deep story a bad thing? Did we forget the hours we spent 
 reading lines of text in 'Zelda' and 'Final Fantasy'? And when did weird become such a bad word? 
 Did we forget the goofy characters from 'Dragon Quest'? Have cinematic, realistic war games turned 
 us into a bunch of mindless action seekers? Can game makers no longer tell a story without voice 
 overs and fast-panning 3-D scenes? Have we become that shallow as gamers?
  
  I feel better. Nothing wrong with mindless action, by the way. I love a good run and gun as much 
 as the next guy.
  
  Maybe I'm weird (my friends would confirm this) , but I found in 'Folklore' a beautiful soundtrack, 
 an intelligent story, characters I actually care about, a witty sense of humor, and a creative 
 surrealism. Playing 'Folklore', for me, was akin to reading a good novel. When I put my controller 
 down, I found myself thinking about its worlds, characters, and developing story.
  
  Imagine a mix of old-school seek-and-find adventure with third-person action and you have an idea 
 of what 'Folklore' is all about. The pacing goes from dialog and mystery in the town of Doolin 
 to control controller whipping action in fantasy-laden dungeons. While this may come off as uneven 
 to some, I found it a nice change of pace. Playing this 'Folklore' felt as if I was playing two 
 games in one.
  
  'Folklore' has you play through a deep paranormal mystery, broken up into chapters, as two characters. 
 One, a young woman seeking personal answers in her life, plays like a rogue. The other, a jaded 
 journalist, is your classic fight brawler. You can choose to play each character's story from beginning 
 to end, but I chose to do a chapter as one character followed by the other in order to keep recent 
 events fresh in my mind. This may come off as repetitive to some, but to me, it was a fascinating 
 exercise in alternative perspectives as the characters' stories developed and intertwined.
  
  Control is unique here, as well. As you finish off enemies, you capture their Ids by yanking 
 the SIXAXIS motion controller -- like hooking a fish. It's a satisfying end to fights, and a welcome 
 use of the PS3's motion controls after some failed attempts in 'Lair'. As you capture Ids, you 
 also gain their fighting techniques for use later on. By the end of the game, you are managing 
 dozens of Ids that do unique things to different enemies. This nets out in a fun spin on the traditional 
 role playing game party system.
  
  In the end, I loved 'Folklore'. But then again, I was a bit of a strange child. I didn't like 'Rambo' 
 -- I would have rather watched 'The Goonies'. If you're all about shoot 'em ups and constant action, 
 you may want to move on. If you're turned off by surrealism and fantasy, move on. Then again, if 
 you're looking for something different, spooky, and novelesque, 'Folklore' is for you. Join me 
 at the geek table while the other kids play 'Halo'.

Review:  This review is only for Keats, and up until Hellrealm. I love all of the possibilities already. 
 You have to complete Chapter 5 with both chars. before you can play Chapter 6 with either.
  Gameplay: The combat is amazing, it really shines. You assign up to four folks to the face buttons, 
 which you use to attack. Some folks attacks, not always forward, and others defend or cause status 
 effects. Keats can Transcend , a state similar to DT in DMC, except he doesn't regen health, he's 
 invincible, and he attacks not only faster, but more times per attack. I've read that Ellen can 
 change her abilities by altering her cloak. Once you weaken a folk, you absob it's Id (Spirit) 
 and can then use it to attack. You can strengthen your folks by meeting certain requirements. These 
 upgrades include increased attack power, more hits in the combo, or decrease in MP consumption. 
 There is a boss called a Folklore at the end of each of the many realms, called Netherworlds , 
 which is absorbed, but not able to be used in attacks.
  Story: The story puts you in the role (keep in my, I've only used Keats) of a reporter who finds 
 a girl that fell from a cliff. As you investigate, you discover that there have been a series of 
 murders in the village of Doolin over the last 17 or so years, some of which may or may not have 
 a connection. Futher in your findings, you eventually go to a corresponding Netherworld, which 
 is where the game really picks up, and combat begins.
  Graphics: The graphics are easily next-gen. , but the comicbook-based cinemas don't do it justice. 
 There are many beautiful environments, but they just don't jump out at you. They could be taken 
 to life, but it just isn't there.
  Audio: The music is excellent, suiting the current situation almost perfectly (for the most part) . 
 The main theme especially stays around in my head, addicting in a good way. It's mysterious and 
 cryptic, yet awesome all at the same time. The sound effects empower the player (at least when 
 using Keats) . When Keats attacks, he has an evil-esque grunt, which gives the player a maniacal 
 sensation of power. The folks beating your opponents down drive you to keep going. The audio is 
 superb.
  Overall: I recommend Folklore to anyone who enjoys RPG's. It's very fun, but it takes a certain 
 person to like it. It's not for everyone, but only to those who will embrace it.

Review:  Now I've only played this for a few hours, but I am overall happy with my purchase. There aren't 
 many notable games for the PS3 yet and I truly believe that this deserves some recognition. This 
 review is subject to change If i run over enough speed bumps causing my vehicle's suspension system 
 to become a precedence to my downfall. Well actually I'll update this review after I beat the game, 
 but do I have what it takes to bake the cakes?!
  
  Gameplay &amp; Controls:
  I cant think of a better control scheme than what game has already. The sixxaxis works very well, 
 and it doesn't require much movement, so +10 awesome points for lazy gamers who often rant about 
 the Wii's demanding of physical contributions to make intercourse to its gaming glory. You basically 
 only use the sixxaxis motion when you absorb things, and all you do is jolt the control pad a bit. 
 Camera is GOOD, when your in a place where you cant fight (like a town) you can't adjust the camera, 
 but that isn't a big deal. My only little complaint is that the camera is a bit slow, I'm probably 
 just too used to Ninja Gaiden's camera (which pans really fast when you need it) . Graphics:
  Not exactly pushing the PS3's hardware to the limits (runs at 720p) , but it looks beautiful. Walking 
 around the Netherworld stages as Ellian is a treat for the eyes, it truly defines the word fantasy 
 . The vibrant color mixtures and lighting really grace the environment. After playing this game, 
 it makes me want to lower the score for other games I've reviewed, graphically speaking that is. 
 I think Disney should do a full CG movie of this game because Folklore's concept and inspiration 
 can really stretch the imagination, also because most Video Game movies suck basketballs. Sound:
 
  The musical score for this game is nearly perfect, play this game with the lights off and some 
 decent speakers will really get the mood going. Not only the musical score is good, but the SFX 
 also please me to the power of 10. The voice acting, well they should have just made the entire 
 game voice acted. Well actually when you hear some of the voice acting, maybe you'll decide that 
 its a good idea that it isn't... It's not that the character's voices sound bad, but at times I 
 feel that there should be much more emotion at certain parts.
  
  Content &amp; Replay Value
  Well this is usually the biggest part of my review, but I've only 
 put in a few hours into the game. Big woop wanna fight about it? I've gotta hit more balls at this 
 fat kid. The storyline is a bit fast paced, it kinda jumps into everything. But there is a lot 
 of content, there are 2 storylines to play, and each storyline has different levels and a different 
 character. Basically you go to the Netherworld for a certain amount of time to do things , man 
 I'm detailed arent it? I've gotta hit more balls at this fat kid. I've only played the girl so 
 far, but basically you're looking for your mother, and she isn't in the kitchen making lasagna 
 either. Perhaps shes in the kitchen of the netherworld cooking food for all the dead @ssholes floating 
 around. You can even go online and download new maps or something. Let me talk about the fighting 
 for a bit, man this is important. Well basically you get A LOT of different monsters to fight with, 
 like 50 or something, thats like Link having 50 different weapons. And all of these monsters level 
 up, and do new things, and you have 4 selected at a time. It's is REALLLY cool how some of these 
 monsters attack, like if you have the sabertooth tiger looking monster, assign it to triangle perhaps, 
 hit triangle and a sabtertooth tiger pounces from you to slash at the enemy, how cool is that??? 
 Absorbing things never gets old, it feels awesome whenever you absorb something, and you can absorb 
 every monster for experience points (or in some cases, the monster itself compete with its abilities) . 
 You absorb with by jolting your control pad slightly, like I mentioned earlier, and the sound and 
 animation is perfect and brief! This is an RPG game, so you will spend a lot of time, exploring 
 towns and talking to people or mysterious beings to gather information. The storyline is decent 
 enough to keep me interested, and there are plenty of other elements of this game that will keep 
 you going also. Well I've gotta hit more balls at this fat kid.
