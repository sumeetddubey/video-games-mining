:::Review:::
Wall-E is overflowing with charm, but the simple gameplay makes the experience fall flat. 

  The main reason Pixar movies are so revered is that they are able to appeal to both adults and 
 children at the same time. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the games based on these 
 movies. Wall-E follows in the path of many cartoon adaptations before it -- taking the wholesome 
 aesthetic and crafting a trivial game around it while ignoring a large part of the film's audience 
 in the process. The mechanics in Wall-E are accessible enough that children eager to spend more 
 time with the lovable robot will find an inviting world, but the end result is too short and predictable 
 to provide value for any platforming veterans.          The cutscenes add some life to these electric 
 beings.      

  The story in Wall-E is about friendship and flowers. Like in the movie, you start off as a lone 
 robot on a dirty planet, left to clean up the trash of thoughtless generations after the humans 
 bolted for cleaner pastures. The first level is quiet and desolate. It's not often that platformers 
 present a world without any enemies in sight, but the early parts of Wall-E exist to highlight 
 his severe loneliness -- and that weight comes across quite powerfully. Wall-E eventually meets up 
 with a flying robot named Eve and gets to experience space travel firsthand. The cutscenes are 
 well done, telling most of the tale through gestures and robot groans that give a lot of personality 
 to the mechanical beings. Though the cinematics were not taken directly from the film, they are 
 still carefully crafted to express the subtleties of Wall-E and Eve's wide range of emotions. The 
 environments are inviting and eye-pleasing, though they are sometimes too sparse, especially in 
 the space station levels.  

  The quiet energy of the first few levels doesn't lead to action packed gameplay, but it still provides 
 a few thrills. Your time on Earth is spent navigating through elaborate obstacle courses. As Wall-E, 
 you can jump and make tiny cubes of trash that you can hurl at targets. There is a variety of different 
 garbage types -- heavy, magnetic, and explosive -- but the puzzle solving is extremely light. The key 
 is always next to the locked door, so navigating this filthy world is very straightforward. The 
 platforming elements are a little more complex, forcing you to climb walls vertically and even 
 upside down with your magnetic bottom, but the paths are always linear so any sort of directional 
 acumen is left by the wayside.  

  The Eve sections follow the accessible path displayed in the Wall-E portions, but they spice up 
 the action a bit. Eve is able to fly around the environment at will, which turns out to be surprisingly 
 fun. There are two types of flying sections: open air and tunnel races. In the open air, you have 
 to search for plant life and other collectables hidden on the surface. The freedom of flight works 
 well here because the controls are so responsive. It's easy to fly through pipes and under bridges, 
 but the lack of imagination in these objectives is disappointing. The levels are ultrastreamlined 
 so it removes any challenge from the scavenger hunts and the space is too confined to make racing 
 interesting for long. It's a shame the developers couldn't have expanded on this section because 
 the act of flight is really well done.  

  The shooting sections make up the final gameplay type, which occur late in the game. Once in the 
 spaceship, you have to fight your way through a small army of robots. The hectic pace and destructive 
 violence seems out of place here compared to the rest of the game. You can pull the camera in over 
 your shoulder and mow down robots with quick aiming, or you can let the game auto-target anyone 
 who walks in front of you. The lock-on is too responsive, making quick work of your enemies before 
 you have time to worry about your health dropping. The sheer number of foes you'll have to face 
 here make these sections too long and repetitive. When the simple joy of platforming and flying 
 is replaced by nonstop shooting, the game loses much of its charm.  

           Flying around as Eve is freeing.      

  There are a number of movie related unlockables, 
 but the rewards aren't compelling enough to demand a second play-through. The multiplayer mode 
 is only good for a quick taste before it loses its appeal. There is just something unsettling about 
 taking part in a deathmatch with four happy Wall-Es wheeling around with laser guns. The main adventure 
 can be finished in less than 10 hours, and after you play through the story once, there just isn't 
 much reason to go back again.  

  The presentation is the only part of Wall-E that separates it from the glut of other platformers 
 out there. The different gameplay mechanics offered by Eve and Wall-E provide some variety in this 
 adventure, but the ideas are never fully fleshed out. This is still a fun game for anyone anxious 
 to spend more time with the garbage-making robot, but there isn't enough depth or replay value 
 to raise this above similar movie-licensed offerings.

Review:  Regardless of the reviews I like this game. Here is the reason... I have a 3 and 4 year old and 
 it seems that all of the games that they would like are always too hard and more "adult geared." 
 This game is actually simple enough for my 4 year old to play, although he does require my help 
 at times. Also, I like the gameplay in that it reminds me of the old Mario games from the first 
 nintendos. You have to jump from platform to platform, throw things and targets, and even jump 
 down recycle tubes to travel from here to there. I would definitely recommend that you rent this 
 game first. I completely understand that it will not appeal to everyone and reviews will most likely 
 be split 50/50. If you're an adult that plays games then this may not be the one for you, but if 
 your an adult that plays games with your kids then A+

Review:  When it come to 3d platformers or Movie games THQ dosent do it right not even for once and now 
 we ended with a meduim game. WALL-E is one of the upcoming movies that a robot must save the entire 
 universe and man he is curios. The quiet energy of the first few levels doesn't lead to action 
 packed times but its kinda fun when you start because you dont know what game really offers so 
 thats the last thrill you will expierincvw in the game. you will play as the tar of the movie wall-e 
 and a white flying robot called EVE. As Wall-E, you can jump and make tiny cubes of trash and throw 
 them in the enemt to eliminate them. thats one stupid thought to kill an enemy. The platforming 
 elements are a little more complex, that it makes a bit diffrent from other platforming titles. 
 Overall wal-e cant be really enjoyed by teens but only by 7-year old kids. Game Vortex 65 / 100 
 Worth Playing 8 / 10 1UP D- Da GameBoyz 6.7 / 10 Game Revolution C- GameSpy 2 / 5 Code Central 
 3.9 / 5 PSX Extreme as a greati give it a C
