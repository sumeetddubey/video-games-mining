:::Review:::
SingStar Vol. 3 adds only 30 new tracks to the karaoke series, but it remains the benchmark for 
 the genre. 

  In many ways, playing SingStar Vol. 3 is a lot like having last night's leftovers. It looks exactly 
 as you remember, and while you lose some of the freshness, it's still a tasty experience. Your 
 enjoyment of SingStar Vol. 3 depends entirely on your love of karaoke or other games in the series, 
 and judged against those, Vol. 3 fares well. It has a great mix of songs, slick presentation, and 
 superb online support -- just don't expect anything new or innovative.  

           Vol. 3 has a good range of tracks including the Ting Tings' popular hit "Shut Up and Let 
 Me Go.      

  No matter what your musical tastes, you should find something of interest in Singstar Vol. 3. The 
 tracklist comes as no surprise to anyone who's played SingStar before, with a familiar mix of pop, 
 rock, alternative, rap, and R&amp; B. Like its PlayStation 3 predecessors, Vol. 3 includes 30 songs 
 on the disc, as well as access to hundreds of downloadable tracks on the SingStore which sell for 
 0.99 each. The tracklist runs the gamut of popular songs -- from Queen to Fergie and even the Smashing 
 Pumpkins. But while the songs on offer are fun and diverse, those looking for new options or modes 
 will be disappointed, as the game matches Volume 2 feature for feature.  

  The harmony mode is back, although it's a shame that it only features in Paul McCartney and Stevie 
 Wonder's "Ebony and Ivory" duet. If you're used to singing the melody it might take you a bit to 
 get used to harmonies, and you might even feel as if you're singing out of tune, but with a bit 
 of practice you can start to pick it up. It's also a shame that SingStar's microphones are still 
 wired and need to be plugged into the USB port on the front of your PS3, and there's no trophy 
 support. Despite these omissions, however, what SingStar does, it does well. The core gameplay 
 is identical to previous versions' and is plenty of fun to play, especially when you're accompanied 
 by a few friends. If you connect a PlayStation Eye or EyeToy, the game will take a series of snapshots 
 and a short video during each song for you to cringe, laugh, or cry at afterward. You can also 
 save these to the PS3 hard drive and, if you're bold enough, upload them to My SingStar Online 
 for others to watch.  

           With classic artists like Michael Jackson and Lionel Ritchie included, you'll be singing 
 All Night Long.      

  All of the regular modes return, including Sing Solo, Battle, Duet, Practice, and Pass the Mic, 
 which support up two teams of four battling against each other. There's still no online play, but 
 the community features in My SingStar Online make a great addition to the offline experience. With 
 a community of thousands of karaoke fans you can easily waste hours browsing through submitted 
 photos and videos with often hilarious results.  

  SingStar Vol. 3 represents good value for your money, with a budget price of 24.99 in the UK without 
 mics, which is actually less than just buying 30 tracks from the online store. It's worth bearing 
 in mind, however, that you could cherry-pick a lot of the songs on Vol. 3 from the SingStore at 
 99p each, although not all are available at the time of review. Whether you're considering it as 
 an addition to your existing SingStar collection or as your first foray to the series, you're guaranteed 
 a fun night in. That said, it's still a shame that Sony has failed to add any new features this 
 time around, especially online play which would definitely be a huge plus to the series.

Review:  While the interface is about as slick as they come the guts of the game, which I consider to be 
 the selection of songs, is about as weak as music games come. 
  
  Upon loading up the game I was blown away by the high-res graphics, soft, animated transitions 
 and well polished interface. But the lack of online content after all this time was nothing but 
 raw disappointment.
  
  When games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band get updated every week with current material as well 
 as exclusive content why is SingStar seem to be living in the past as well as in an alternative 
 universe where people want updates every 2 months?
  
  While not a total deal-breaker why must I shut down the game before connecting the 2nd microphone? 
 I tried to get my mother and wife to sing a duet but after connecting and reconnecting the mics 
 realized that the only way to get the second mic to be recognized was to reboot the game. A minor 
 gripe to some but just a pain in the butt overall.
  
  Anyway, beyond the sucky online offerings my other problem with the game is the latency issue with 
 the mic. My wife is no Celine Dion but she can certainly hold her own and when singing into the 
 SingStar mics it was clear that the sound wasn't registering at the same rate she was singing with 
 her vocals almost always trailing the game.
  
  One would think with a traditional corded mic that the transfer would be practically instantaneous 
 but no. Even after calibrating the vocals were still always late. 
  
  Overall, I think the product is great. A great interface with tons of potential but with such a 
 stale (and violently slow) online store it's hard to love or even like this game unless you're 
 just desperate for a karaoke game. 
  
  Oh yeah, speaking of online content where are the Abba songs and Queen songs on the online store? 
 Is Sony expecting me to purchase yet another Blu-ray disc just to get access to these songs? It 
 just seems silly that they don't offer at least SOME of the songs from the disc! 
  
  That's all I say other than "DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!"

Review:  Surely by having a download option for this they could save money for them and us! It drives me 
 crazy. I don't want all these songs, but I would pay for some of them. 
  
  I won't get Vol. 3. I got Vol. 2 only because my Vol. 1 disc cracked (?!?) . 
  
  Oh well, they 
 are obviously hell bent on irritating us karaoke heroes, and destroying the environment with it. 
 
  
  If it is your first forage into the series, you are in for a delight. Great game, great party fun. 
 We actually just have singstar parties (sad or what?) and they are great great fun. Abba and Disney 
 are new highlights. 
  
  
  PLEASE SONY LET US JUST DOWNLOAD THEM.
  
  Also if they would put all the previous PS2 songs onto the singstar store, I would spend at least 
 40-50. Surely it can't be that hard. There are still some great classics that elude my collection.
 
  
  Thank you.... *sigh*
