:::Review:::
SingStar Abba is a good addition to the series and a heap of fun to play, provided you like singing 
 as a female Swede. 

  SingStar is back for a fourth instalment on the PlayStation 3, and the series gets its first artist-exclusive 
 title in the form of SingStar Abba. Agnetha, Bjorn, Benny, and Anni-Frid require no introduction 
 in SingStar's heartland of Europe and Australia, where they have endured as one of the most successful 
 pop acts of all time. The Swedish group has also received a revival in recent years thanks to the 
  Mamma Mia!  musical, penned by Bjorn and Benny. Your enjoyment of SingStar Abba depends entirely 
 on your love of the band, and of karaoke; if you love Abba you'll be in for hours of disco-tastic 
 fun belting out their classics in your living room. It has a great mix of songs (all in English) , 
 cheesy video clips from the '70s, slick presentation, and superb online support -- just don't expect 
 anything new or innovative.  

           With SingStar Abba you  are  the Dancing Queen.      

  Given the series' heavy slant 
 toward pop, an Abba title makes perfect sense. SingStar Abba includes 25 tracks -- five less than 
 the other PS3 titles -- as well as access to hundreds of downloadable tracks on the SingStore which 
 sell for around 0.99 ($1.52) each. SingStar Abba features a strong lineup including all of their 
 UK, US, and Australian chart toppers. Classics on the disc include "Dancing Queen," "Fernando," 
 "Mamma Mia," "Money, Money, Money," "Ring Ring," "Super Trouper," "Take a Chance on Me," "Waterloo," 
 and many more. Given that the girls were the lead vocalists on all of the tracks, you'll have to 
 feel comfortable singing as a Swedish songstress.  

  The harmony mode that debuted in SingStar Vol. 2 is back, although it only features in "Does Your 
 Mother Know" and "Super Trouper." If you're used to singing the melody it might take you a bit 
 to get used to singing harmonies, and you might even feel as if you're singing out of tune, but 
 with a bit of practice you should be able to pick it up. Unfortunately, SingStar's microphones 
 are still wired and need to be plugged into the USB port on the front of your PS3 via the included 
 adaptor, and trophies are completely absent from the game. Given the exclusive deal Sony has struck 
 with Abba, it's also a shame there's no bonus content included for diehard Abba fans, such as behind-the-scenes 
 videos or documentaries on the band.  

  Despite those few omissions, however, what SingStar does, it does well. The core gameplay is identical 
 to previous versions and is plenty of fun to play, especially when you're accompanied by a few 
 friends. If you connect a PlayStation Eye or EyeToy, the game will take a series of snapshots and 
 a short video during each song for you to cringe, laugh, or cry at afterwards. You can also save 
 these to the PS3 hard drive and, if you're bold enough, upload to My SingStar Online for others 
 to watch online.  

           SingStar Abba is great, provided you can sing like a Swedish girl.      

  All of the 
 regular modes return, including Sing Solo, Battle, Duet, Practice, and Pass the Mic, which support 
 up two teams of four battling against each other. There's still no online play, but the community 
 features in My SingStar Online make a great addition to the offline experience. With a community 
 of thousands of karaoke fans you can easily waste hours browsing through submitted photos and videos 
 with often hilarious results.  

  While SingStar Abba receives a budget price of 24.99 in the UK without mics -- roughly equivalent 
 to 25 songs from the SingStore -- Americans are lumped with a hefty $39.99 pricetag. It's also worth 
 bearing in mind that while you can cherry-pick individual songs from the SingStore at 99p each, 
 Abba's library is only available on disc for now. Whether you're considering it as an addition 
 to your existing SingStar collection or as your first foray to the series, you'll be guaranteed 
 a fun night if you like Abba. That said, it's a shame the game offers nothing new to fans of the 
 series, especially in the way of online play.

Review:  This is the long-awaited sequel to the brilliant game, Trauma Center: New Blood. However, don't 
 let this review fool you. This game was actually made for the original Game Boy. But they don't 
 have a forum on this site for that, so the makers of this game wisely released a dumbed-down port 
 for the PS3. This is a spin-off from the usual game play of the Zero Wing series. This time around 
 it is a fighting game. Again you play as Morshu , this time around he is fighting for his shop. 
 Evil people have taken Morshu's supply of lamp oil and ropes, specifically Dr. Robotnik, Saruman, 
 Harry Potter, and the evil, evil Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. ( Two very good friends from what I heard.) 
 However, Morshu finds his old friend, Dr. Octagonapus  Tricked 
 you. As a matter of fact Morshu has NOBODY on his side. It's him versus the world, as he storms 
 the villians' hideout, the Ratatoing. There are no actual cutscenes. Instead this game comes with 
 a book for you to read. So after you beat a level, the game tells you to read a certain part. (Great, 
 you defeated Charlie Brown. Refer to page 37 in the enclosed book for the next cutscene.) The music 
 in this game is Beethoven's 7.908 Symphony, Movement 9 3/8, Part 17 gajillion. I haven't actually 
 played the game yet because I was to busy reading the book to find out what happens after Mama 
 Luigi reveals to Morshu that he is his 8th cousin 3 times removed by marriage, so I can't
  tell you anything about the gameplay. I may update this review later when I found out why Morshu's 
 bombs were used against him. In the meantime I'll be playing Super Mario Halo: Mushrooms Evolved 
 for the WiiBox 360
