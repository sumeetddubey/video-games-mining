:::Review:::
You say you want a revolution? Be careful what you ask for. 

  Thanks to its Bemani series of games, Konami was  the  name in rhythm and music games for many 
 years, especially in Japan. These games include: Dance Dance Revolution, Karaoke Revolution, Guitar 
 Freaks, Drummania, and Beatmania. But times have changed; the genre is now dominated by SingStar, 
 Guitar Hero, and Rock Band. Not content to sit on the sidelines and watch, Konami's response is 
 Rock Revolution. It's too bad that the game, which lets you play guitar, bass, or drums (but not 
 sing) , doesn't rock and certainly isn't a revolution.  

           There's a singer onstage, but the game doesn't let you sing.      

  Rock Revolution 
 can be purchased with a drum kit or as a stand-alone game -- there are no game-specific guitars available. 
 Fortunately, it's compatible with both Guitar Hero and Rock Band hardware. This is good because 
 not only are you able to use peripherals you probably already own, but also because the included 
 drum kit, which has six pads and a foot pedal, is lousy. The pads are small and loud, plus the 
 ones in the back are only slightly angled and raised so they're difficult to hit. And, really, 
 having seven inputs is too much for people without bona fide drumming skills. It seems that Konami 
 realized this because you'll go entire songs using just four pads (and sometimes not even touching 
 the pedal for songs at a time) until you get to the hard difficulty setting.  

  Questionable drums are the least of Rock Revolutions problems, though. The soundtrack includes 
 just over 30 songs -- a paltry number when compared to the 80 or so songs in both Guitar Hero World 
 Tour and Rock Band 2. There are tunes from Metallica, Foo Fighters, Ratt, The Ramones, Fall Out 
 Boy, Twisted Sister, Avril Lavigne, and more. This wouldn't be a bad list if not for the fact that 
 all of the songs are covers. Some of them are decent, but the competition uses nothing but master 
 tracks these days, so this ends up being just another way in which Rock Revolution fails to measure 
 up.  

  Substandard gameplay and an underwhelming Career mode compound Rock Revolution's issues. The Career 
 mode is nothing more than playing a list of songs; there's no way to embark on a career as anything 
 other than a solo act, no character customization, and nobody is playing the paltry online modes. 
 The game can't even get the genre's established gameplay down right. The note highway that displays 
 upcoming notes is vertical and displayed on a 2D plane. As a result, it only shows a few notes 
 at a time, which makes fast sections very difficult because you can't anticipate what's coming 
 next. This problem is further exacerbated by an unusually small window in which to play the correct 
 note, questionable note recognition, note patterns that don't match the music, and stringent requirements 
 for passing songs. Not only is it easy to fail the average song, but frequent additional requirements, 
 such as not playing "poison" notes, achieving a certain score, or passing a song despite the difficulty 
 increasing midtune, also conspire to block your rock.  

           The music studio is kind of fun, but it's not enough to warrant buying the game.      
 

  Rock Revolution's one redeeming mode lets you create your own music by first choosing a style or 
 sound for your instrument and then mapping chords, riffs, or beats to the frets or drum pads. It's 
 highly unlikely you're going to make any sort of masterpiece with the limited tools available; 
 you can't add your created works to the game's set list or share them online, but it is mildly 
 amusing to see what you and a few friends can come up with by mashing fret buttons and banging 
 on the drums.  

  If Rock Revolution came out two or three years ago, it might have been revolutionary, but in 2008, 
 it's not even relevant. Uninspired presentation, a tiny tracklist that includes no master tracks, 
 a complete lack of vocal support, uninteresting gameplay, and a barebones Career mode are just 
 a few of the many ways in with Rock Revolution fails. In fact, it fails to live up to its name, 
 Konami's past, and, most importantly, the competition.

Review:  No wonder Konami tried to sue Harmonix and get Rock Band recalled. The only way possible for them 
 to sell this POS game would be to have the competition removed from retail. This game is decidedly 
 sub-standard. However many miles Guitar Hero World Tour or Rock Band decide to walk, Rock Revolution 
 walks 10 miles less. "Oh, the competition is using all cover songs? We'll use NO cover songs!" 
 "Oh, they're having 80 tracks? We'll have 30 tracks!" "They have 4 instruments? We'll have two!"
 
  
  Basically, this game is like one of those Soviet Russia jokes. "In Rock Band, you get to have fun 
 with the game. But in Rock Revolution, the game has fun with you!" This game has sold about 3,000 
 copies, and IMO that's 3,000 copies too many. Let's make sure it does not sell any more! This is 
 a freaking peripheral-based rock game, and yet they didn't even make their own guitar peripheral! 
 If you're going to imitate another game, at least have the decency not to leech off your competitors' 
 peripherals.

Review:  Konami, just let it go. You came in the next-gen rhythm game race a tad too late.
  
  There's a lot of things wrong with this game. Not that there were any noticeable glitches, it just 
 felt WRONG.
  
  First, there's the awkwardly positioned note chart (which makes you wanna move your head closer 
 to the TV and tilt up your chin so that it would look right) . It's one of those things that give 
 you a migraine and make you say "Ugh, this thing's painful to look at" Then, there's the drum set. 
 Rock Band's drum set already looks like something Fisher-Price would make for a toddler. Imagine 
 how unrealistic the drumset feels...
  
  As for how the game's set up, it's the same as Guitar Hero and Rock Band, except imagine those 
 2 franchises as one big beach bully on 'roids, and Rock Revolution as that stereotypical Jewish 
 geek (don't mean to offend) with geeky shorts
  
  The setlist? So-so. They're all covers, so you'll be missing out on some excellent classics like 
 YYZ or Roxanne or Cliffs of Dover, of which all of the aforementioned songs belong to the Rock 
 Band and Guitar Hero franchises...
  
  Now, why did I give this game a 2.5 instead of a flat-out 1? Well, there's an extra .5 for the 
 effort, and the 1.0 for the only part of the game where I actually had some (though somewhat still 
 brain-numbing) fun: The Studio. You might get some enjoyment from meddling with the studio, but 
 I don't guarantee anything.
  
  The Bottom Line: If you still haven't been enlightened by the greatnesses that are Rock Band and 
 Guitar Hero, buy this game. But you'll be missing out on a lot.
