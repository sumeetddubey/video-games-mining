:::Review:::
Double Time gives you double the frustration for half the price. 

  Despite arriving on shelves the same day, Brothers in Arms: Double Time has nothing to do with 
 the new Brothers in Arms game released on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. It might have a new 
 name, but the games inside the box -- Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 and Brothers in Arms: Earned 
 in Blood -- are more than three years old. Though they're dated, being able to pick up two excellent 
 last-generation shooters for the price of one should be great, which is why it's a shame that these 
 ports are terrible.  

           The terrible frame rate makes running through the war-torn countryside feel like a slideshow. 

  For those unfamiliar with the series, Brothers in Arms is about two things: historically accurate, 
 emotionally compelling storytelling, and tactical gunplay. The stories in both games are similar 
 in that they follow two men and their squads as they learn the cost of war. In the grand scheme 
 of World War II games, the stories aren't unique. What sets them apart is their realistic and mature 
 take on the brutality of war. Like in the  Band of Brothers  series of movies, well-acted voice-overs 
 and poignant music give way to hellish depictions of battlefields. Overall, it's a serious and 
 gritty presentation of war, or at least it was in 2005 when it was originally released. Now, a 
 number of frustrating technical problems overshadow the somber plot.  

  Brothers in Arms takes a tactical approach to gunplay, forcing you to think and strategize before 
 taking on a group of enemies. Using the Wii Remote as your cursor, you can order your squads to 
 move around the map, suppress enemies, or charge with an assault. Though it had its missteps, the 
 AI in the original games usually did what you wanted it to do, making you feel as if you were really 
 commanding intelligent troops. In this port, your squadmates are as reliable as a rusty pistol. 
 If they can manage to navigate the environment and join you in battle, you'll be lucky if they 
 survive, considering that they have a knack for standing in the line of enemy fire. Your incapable 
 allies will be a constant point of frustration against the tenacious enemies, who have a tendency 
 to pop up out of nowhere and flank you at every opportunity.  

  The controls do little to ease the frustration of being stuck with idiots for teammates. The setup 
 works adequately for shooting, with the remote handling aiming and looking, and the Nunchuk handling 
 movement, but in hectic battles with flanking enemies, they aren't responsive enough. You can turn 
 up the sensitivity and turn speed, but it never quite clicks together like a shooter should. You 
 spend a lot of time thinking about and fussing with the controls, and it really pulls you out of 
 the experience. A few motion-controlled gestures have been added, but most of them -- such as grenade 
 throwing and melee attacks -- are hard to control and can leave you disoriented.  

  Visually, Brothers in Arms was at the top of its class in 2005, but you wouldn't know it from this 
 port. Nearly every texture has a blurred, muddy look. If it weren't for the big red circles that 
 appear over their heads, you wouldn't be able to tell a Nazi from a bush. The frame rate isn't 
 good, and the game will frequently freeze for two or three seconds to catch its breath, giving 
 you ample time to soak in the blurry countryside. The plodding frame rate and sluggish controls 
 destroy the pace, making you feel like you're playing in slow motion.  

           Your squadmates will frequently get stuck on low rock walls and shrubs. Aren't you glad 
 they've got your back?      

  The sound fares a bit better, though some of the gunfire is a little underwhelming. The voice acting 
 is appropriately grim and laced with expletives. The music isn't showcased often, given that the 
 game prefers to let the jarring sounds of battle take the forefront, but what is there is orchestral 
 and heroic.  

  If you're looking for a WWII shooter for your Wii, don't be fooled by this "deal." Stripped of 
 their multiplayer modes and loaded with technical issues, these two games aren't even worth the 
 asking price of one.

Review:  Brothers in Arms Wii is an attempt to make money from Wii owners while they release Hell's Highway 
 for all other consoles.
  
  This game was good on xbox and ps2 and is the same 2 games.
  
  But there is a huge issue that turns this potentially revolutionary game to a god awful game, 
 IT IS THE FRAME RATE!
  
  I'm not too sure why it plays the way it does, but it is just lame. I think it actually runs at 
 such a low frame rate that it is almost seconds per frame instead of frames per second.
  
  If it ran fluidly, it would be just as good as it was years ago. But, with a very low frame rate, 
 it is just almost torturous to play.
  
  I can believe I spent $50 on this game, don't buy.
  
  FarCry Vengence is a better game than 
 this, I know, I played both. Regret ever doing so.
  
  Other than that, everything else is in tact, the story is awsome, the visuals decent, and a large 
 number of missions.
  
  This is a MUST AVOID type of game.

Review:  Brother in Arms is a ww2 fps that lets you command your squad throughout Normandy. The game comes 
 with the 2 previvous games in the seris, Road to Hill 30 and Earned in Blood. They were realeased 
 on the orignial XBOX in 2005. The game can be fun sometimes and bad in others. hers why.
  
  Good: I like the fact that its a totally differnt game than MOH and CoD. You control a squad and 
 you need them to survive, unlike MOH and CoD where oyu are a 1 man army. Wii motion controls are 
 used somewhat for some squad commands, aiming, and throwing grenades. 
  
  Bad: The big problem i have is that it is 3 years old. Hells Highway just came out and why are 
 we playing a 3 year old game than a very recent. Frame rate is pretty annoying. Grahpics are bad. 
 They are worse than the XBOX ones. And by now, they shouldve at least improved. But they havent.
 
  
  Other wise i liked this game. This is my first BIA game so i like the squad control. Like i said 
 earlier, it is totally differnet and i like different. I would reccomond renting this or if you 
 are a die-hard ww2 fps fan or want something differnet, get this game.

Review:  I agree with most of the criticisms of this game; frame rate trouble, dated, and questionable graphics 
 by today's standards. The game is fun to play however because it offers things you're not going 
 to see in MOH of COD.
  
  This game combines strategy with tactics more than others. The difficultly is increased because 
 your health is very limited. You can't just charge a MG 42 with a couple of health packs at the 
 ready. You have to preserve your health in a more realistic way.
  
  The combat awareness feature, which allows you to pause the action and view the positions of your 
 squad and the enemy. is also pretty cool. It helps because the game is rather difficult and you 
 have to think about how you're going to approach the objectives. I enjoy this kind of challenge 
 and think it adds to the replay value. I can even be a bit addictive.
  
  Another positive is the grittyness of the game. You get the feeling of desperation for survival 
 throughout. This is probably due to the lack of health packs.
  
  All of these positives are brought down a notch by the flaws everyone is talking about. The frame 
 rate issue is particularly bad at times, and probably the worst I've ever seen. Fortunately it 
 doesn't happen that often.

Review:  Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood and Road to Hill 30 are my two favorite games for the original 
 XBOX. I've played both games through a number of times. Unfortunately, the games were never made 
 backwards compatible for the 360, so I decided to try out Double Time for my Wii as my original 
 XBOX is packed away.
  
  Sadly, the graphics are hard to ignore. I still think both games look excellent on the XBOX and 
 was disheartened to find the Wii's graphics are a big step backward for games released 3 years 
 ago. The textures are jagged and blurred, and the game slows down often. Another large negative 
 is that the Skirmish Mode (in which you can play scenarios as either Americans or Germans) has 
 been removed from Earned in Blood. This was one of the main features that added longevity to the 
 second game.
  
  On the plus side, I enjoy the controls. Flanking and taking dead aim with the Wii remote is a lot 
 of fun. 
  
  Overall, however, I cannot escape the feeling that I am playing an unpolished version of the game. 
 You'd be better served dusting off your XBOX and playing the games on that old console - the experience 
 is just better overall.
