:::Review:::
The biggest draw of this skateboard simulation is the unique controls, which are intuitive but disappointing. 
 

  Last year, EA released Skate on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and the game revitalized the skateboarding 
 genre with its unique control scheme and freeform goals. This year, the Wii is finally getting 
 in on the party, and it's got a unique control scheme of its own. If you've ever been tempted to 
 skateboard in your living room only to be thwarted by your lack of half-pipe (or actual skateboarding 
 skills) , EA's Skate It for the Wii does an adequate job of re-creating the experience.  

           The controls are like a grab bag -- you never know what trick will come out of your next 
 upward flick.      

  The story in Skate It is your typical rags-to-riches sports story; it's forgettable, but it gets 
 the job done filling in the gaps between Skate and its sequel. Much of your time in the career 
 mode is spent in San Vanelona, the city from Skate on the PS3 and Xbox 360. Destroyed by some unnamed 
 disaster, San Vanelona is in rough shape, and you and your trusty cameraman appear to be the only 
 two residents left. Instead of giving you the open world of Skate, each section is split into fairly 
 large stages that must be traveled to via a map and load screen. Like Skate, your goal is to complete 
 challenges, get sponsors, and win skater of the year.  

  The career mode is functional and will keep you busy for around eight hours, but it lacks the open 
 world that you were able to explore at your leisure in Skate. The game briskly pushes you from 
 task to task, making career progression quick and easy. While you can certainly cruise around each 
 stage and find the challenges that await you, it's easier to just bring up the menu screen and 
 zip to your next challenge. The lack of cohesion makes the game feel less organic and more like 
 a list of challenges and tasks.  

  Not all of your challenges take place in the remnants of San Vanelona; there are a number of European 
 venues as well. Some of the overseas stages are just skate parks that wouldn't look any different 
 if they were in San Vanelona. Others, like Shanghai and Barcelona, offer small towns with distinct 
 styles and plenty of skate opportunities, and these are the most fun to play. Strangely, you'll 
 never see another skater or pedestrian anywhere. This makes sense in the deserted ruins of San 
 Vanelona but not in the other venues, especially when the intro cutscenes show densely populated 
 streets. The lonely levels don't affect the gameplay, but they add to the soulless feel of the 
 overall package.  

  As was the case with Skate, the big draw of Skate It is the unique controls. There are three different 
 control schemes for you to take advantage of: The Wii Remote alone, the remote and Nunchuk, and 
 the remote and balance board. Unfortunately, none of the control schemes are as reliable as they 
 should be. Whether it's flipping the remote or gyrating on the balance board, repeating the same 
 motion twice will almost always result in two different tricks. The developer seemed to know this, 
 because very few goals ask you to perform a specific trick. Instead, you'll get a lot of challenges 
 asking you to "Do four flip tricks" or "Do a 180 grab." So you likely won't fail too many goals 
 because of the controls, but it's still frustrating to feel so disconnected from your skater. Of 
 the three control schemes, the remote and Nunchuk are the most precise, while the remote and balance 
 board are the least. Skating around on the balance board is fun for a while, but steering your 
 skater can be tricky, and playing through the whole game like that is just asking for a backache. 

  The multiplayer in Skate It comes in the form of a pass-the-controller-style party mode. There 
 are a number of games like highest score, best trick, and best line, but the inconsistent controls 
 add too much luck to the affair. You might be hoping for a high-scoring 180 pop shuvit, but instead 
 you'll get a worthless ollie.  

  Skate It makes a great first impression with its slick menus and home-movie style, but that style 
 doesn't carry over to the actual game. The in-game graphics are impressive, though everything does 
 look a little blurry. There are plenty of name-brand clothes to dress your skater in, but there 
 are few customization options when it comes to his or her physical appearance. Facial options, 
 for example, range from ugly to horrifying to what looks like Andy Samberg in drag. At least your 
 attractiveness-challenged skater animates well, realistically flipping the board and shifting weight. 
 Despite their dull appearance, most of the levels are set up well, and many have sections that 
 let you move objects to construct your own sweet lines. Those familiar with Skate will recognize 
 the city, but it's been changed in some interesting ways. The destruction in San Vanelona has affected 
 almost every landmark, leaving skateable debris and rubble everywhere. Even if you've put hours 
 into Skate already, you'll find enough changes to make the city worth visiting again.  

           San Vanelona was destroyed, and the ruins make for great skating spots.      

  The 
 music offers an eclectic selection including Judas Priest, LL Cool J, and variety of lesser-known 
 artists. There are a few duds in the tracklist, but most of it is great skating music. The voice 
 work from your cameraman and various pro skaters is good and often encouraging, but sometimes it 
 comes through sounding muffled. The skating sound effects are terrific, with every texture and 
 surface emitting a different sound.  

  It's not saying much, but despite its disappointments, Skate It is still the best skateboarding 
 game on the Wii. It's a step in the right direction in delivering a satisfying living-room skateboarding 
 experience, but ultimately, it's not worth the cash in this crowded holiday season.

Review:  Through the years of playing skateboarding games I have yet to be satisfies as much as this game 
 did. Skate It blows the "Tony Hawk" series out of business. Just think of doing tricks by flipping 
 your Wii remote in certain positions and allowing you to do certain tricks is just crazy. What's 
 the most addicting part about this game? Of course you can throw your Wii remote around and nail 
 many impressive trick but it is even more impressive if you actually know how to shake the remote 
 in order to do such a trick. This game truly requires finessing your Wii remote skills. It took 
 me about a week to learn all of the tricks in the game. usually in Tony Hawk it would take a few 
 hours because it's all buttons. Skate it does have its flaws however, the lack of some tricks such 
 as impossible and most grabs is disappointing, but you also got to think that making different 
 grabs would be pretty difficult to do. Hopefully they will make a sequel and enhance most flaws 
 making it the best skate game ever!

Review:  So, we basically entered part 2 of the first skate with San Van being destroyed by natural disasters. 
 Reda, the silly camera dude, sees a skater shredding in San Van and has the idea to film you skating 
 spots and sending to the world. Your mission is to get noticed, get sponsered and become skater 
 of the year. Skate it has pretty much alot things close to EA skate, but somethings seem missing.
 
  
  Gameplay is great. The way it plays is really realistic compared to the Tony Hawk series. Like 
 grinding, jump on a ledge and the rest speaks for itself. One thing they should've done was have 
 online play.
  
  Controls are pretty innovative, but the way the wiimote works, timing ollies becomes a pain like 
 if your about to jump over a rail, sometimes you'll fall, and it often makes goals harder.
  
  Like in any skateboarding game, the story is like it should be. Your a random skater trying 
 to become #1. Career mode is pretty long and goals are fun to do. One problem though, if you start 
 a new career in the same file, you'll lose the levels you unlocked. Telling you, i was not happy 
 with that.
  
  Graphics, i gotta say, are really good even for the Wii. Looks just like EA skate on the Xbox.
 
  
  Songlist? eeehhhh..... honestly, not that good. The only songs I like on there is WAR's "low rider" 
 and Judas Priest's "Freewheel burning." And for some reason, music only starts when you start a 
 goal.
  
  OVERALL:
  While somethings in this game may disappoint you, Skate it is definatly worth playing

Review:  Skate It is just plain fun. Tons of levels, being able to edit the world around you to your liking, 
 great multiplayer, and an overall stunning presentation all add up to one of the best skating games 
 I've played in years. The controls, however, are tough to rate. (It should be noted that I'm reffering 
 to the wii remote+nunchuck controls. I don't have a balance board, so my review won't include it) 
 They're intuitive and smart, but they can also be unresponsive and frustrating. They are the best 
 and worst part about the game. About 90% of they time they work just fine and provide an immersive 
 and fun experience, but it's really the other 10% that can at times make the game frustrating. 
 Surprisingly, that doesn't completely ruin the game, because I actually really love the control 
 scheme, I just wish they would've included classic controller support. Skate for the X360 is perhaps 
 my favorite skating game of all time, and Skate It is a great follow-up.
  
  If you don't already know, the Skate franchise, unlike Tony Hawk, centers on realism. Being a huge 
 Tony Hawk fan I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about a more realistic take on a skate boarding 
 game (as the Hawk series is crazy and unrealistic) but I must say that it works quite well. The 
 physics are really impressive, which leads to some absolutly hillarious wipe outs. The wipe-outs 
 are so awsome and realistic that there is a whole multiplayer game that centers on seeing what 
 player can rack up the highest medical bill. This involves trying to wreck yourself as painfully 
 as possible. To be honest, its worth giving Skate it a shot based on this multiplayer game alone. 
 Its some of the most addicting multiplayer I've ever played.
  
  Bottom Line: Buy it. If you own multiple systems wait for Skate 2, but if you're a wii only owner 
 this comes highly recommended. There's quite a learning curve, but it pays off in the end. I dropped 
 $50 on this puppy and wasn't dissapointed. If you are at all interested in the extreme sports genre 
 you should at least try Skate It.

Review:  The Best part about the Skate series is it doesn't have the name Tony Hawk on it. The other great 
 thing is it's fairly close to real skateboard trust me I know what I'm talking about I'm a skater 
 myself. What really gets me though is if you're using the balance board its next to impossible 
 to control the direction you're moving in and without the balance board its next to impossible 
 to do tricks. The places you go and the things you do all depend on the sponsors you chose like 
 Almost, Blind, Chile, Alien Workshop, thing like that. My favorite part is it doesn't stop there. 
 You get board sponsors, trucks, wheels, shoes. All the sponsors you would really get if you could 
 skate like a beast. If your into skating and conveniently have a wii that Skate It is a must have! 
 
  O and don't jump on the balance board... You'll get it when you get the game! LOL

Review:  personaly i am really into street skateing and i think they did a pretty good job with the game. 
 i personaly think they should have improved the career mode so it would go for a bit longer. although 
 it was short in most game modes it had a great range of challenges. some were hard and took me 
 several trys while some were easy and i could smash it straight away.
  
  the great thing about skate it is his has a great range of combo's and trick. even if you play 
 for many hours you can always find a combo of your choice. One of the coolest combos would be a 
 flip trick to grind or a back/front flip 1 footed grab.
  
  the controls are prety simple but yet it can be a bit hard to learn what direction to flick the 
 remote for which flip trick you do. but once you get used to the controls it is very basic to do 
 the trick you want.
  
  multiplayer mode is prety dissapointing due to having to swap remote from one person to another 
 where as in other games you can all skate at the same time. the modes are pretty good because they 
 range in different styles of game play. e. g you have every thing from best trick and who can get 
 the biggest hospital bill. i think they went over the top with the hall of meat mode in multiplayer 
 because you see who can break the most bones and who can get the biggest bill but others think 
 its kinda amusing.
  
  personaly i think they stuffed it up with the skaters in the game. basicaly i am realy into skaters 
 and the only 2 of them i know is danny way and jake brown. i think they should have added in more 
 famous skates such as ryan sheckler and rodney mullen. i also think they should have spent more 
 time on the graphics for the skaters. because if you look at jake brown and danny way and many 
 others look eather fatter or older than they realy are.
  
  i think they did a prety good job with the my spot zone. the my spot zone is a area where you can 
 move ramps and rail and other objects to turn it into your own style. i think it would be good 
 if you could use my spot zone in more area's.
  
  one more thing in the game is called hall of meat. hall of meat is where if you have a nasty fall 
 it will come up with a pop up called hall of meat. it will show a diagram of a skeleton and if 
 a bone on it is blue it is fine, if it is green it is bruised, if it is yellow it is sprained and 
 if it is red it is broken.
  
  another good feature is the camera man. he follows you everywhere and says stuff when you do somthing 
 cool or if you stack. he can be quite amusing to listen to because alot of the things he says are 
 funny but sometimes he repeats phrases he has already said recently.
  
  overall this is a very adicting and very fun for people who love to skate. but may be abit disappointing 
 if you want to play as your favourite skaters. but i do highly recomend this game for skateboard 
 lovers everywhere.

Review:  Skate It for the Wii is a spin-off of the original Skate (on PS3/360) in which the fictional town 
 of San Vanelona is destroyed by several disasters. Your skater stays behind and skates the weathered 
 city alone (with your cameraman tagging along :P) as you two beat missions and gain respect in 
 the industry in skateboarding. The career is very in depth and takes you to several real world 
 locations (France, London, etc) .
  
  The Good
  1. The controls (contrary to many reviews) are decent. The motions may need some great getting 
 used too, but once you do, you'll be enjoying the mellow feel of "skating".
  2. The destroyed city closed some lines, but new ones have emerged...
  3. The real world locations 
 are nice add-ons.
  4. The Hall of Meat mini game is a cool breakdown to see how bad you slammed.
  5. Great skaters 
 are in the game (D-Way, Haslam?!?!?! c'mon!!!!)
  6. Great physics
  7. Fantastic soundtrack!!! Gaslight Anthem???? Thank You EA!!!
  
  The Bad
  1. The cameraman 
 can not shut up whenever you break some bones (ex: WHOOOOOOOAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!! THAT IS TOOOOOOOTALLLLLLYYY 
 GOING ON THRASHER'S HALL A MEAT RIGHT THERE!!!!!)
  2. The real world locations are just parts of the Old San Van that were left out of this game, 
 themed after the city (ex: Paris and Barcelona or closely similar to Old Town)
  3. The controls are of key, making it that when you ollie on the remote, it ollies half a second 
 too late in the game
  4. Limited selection of clothing options.
  5. The in-game environment is very lonely (in the deserted San Van it's ok cause it is part of 
 the plot, but when you travel to real world locations, it is eriely empty, I mean they can have 
 some people walking around and a few cars driving around
  
  Amidst all this, it is definitely a great game...

Review:  I've almost had the Wii Balance Board on 2 pads as i get so carried away with this game! I use 
 the Wii Balance Board and i have to say it's pretty damn accurate to the real thing. I miss the 
 concave feel under my feet and the feeling you can turn / pivot in an instant which you don't get 
 with this game. This leads me to my only issue; turning, but this can be rectified by stepping 
 off / stepping back on and re calibrating.
  I found the Paris downhill challenges annoying with the balance board but so what... it's a game 
 - it's supposed to be challenging. Had to plug in the nunchuck to crack that one. EA have everything 
 covered.
  
  For me gameplay is rad. Flips are a pleasure and grabs work well too. I'm so engrossed with the 
 challenges i've yet to plain ole mosey around and find some lines of my own.
  
  I'm 70% complete and i'm hooked. It's superb. Longevity of the game with be forever for me, i'll 
 always be back for more. 100% worth my money.

Review:  I bought this game simply because i didnt have a 360 or ps3, the day i got it i was drawn in this 
 game, the controls are great, they are about 95% accurate when u do the correct gesture for a trick, 
 the gameplay is great, it just never gets boring. i dont have a balance board, but the wiimote 
 and nunchuck are really realistic, flick the hand up to do a ollie, then tilt it down on a rail 
 to do a nosegrind, pretty fun i highly reccomend this game, dont believe the reviews that says 
 it sux, ull like it . of course the graphics are not as good as the 360 but i dont think they are 
 bad, i think they are pretty good for the wii and it has pretty good ragdoll effects, me and my 
 friends always play in freeskate after a skate session outside, so i highly reccomend this game 
 if u wanna have fun and love the ea skate games

Review:  My mate pre-ordered this game cos we loved the original SKATE for the PS3 and the day we got it 
 we were playing for at least 2 hours straight and managed to get a good feel of it but after that, 
 it went downhill, I mean, the great thing about SKATE for the ps3 was how real life it was like 
 but this one isnt as real as the other one cos the skaters are much more faster moving and always 
 seem to land perfectly and straight, also, where is everyone? I mean, there were disasters and 
 everyone left, how stupid is that? So you and this other dude are the only dudes left and that 
 means no one to crash into and stuff. Another bad thing about this game is how expensive it is, 
 i mean we payed $80 for wii fit and the board then another $40 for the game, but I must say, the 
 bails look better on this than on SKATE cos on SKATE all the guys are all stiff on this theres 
 more of a ragdoll which makes it look cooler although the graphics are of course no where near 
 as good as the PS3's so thats a downer. The balance board is pretty cool how you lean to turn and 
 stuff but they were going to make you jump and stuff to do tricks but they seemed to have taken 
 that out. So this game isn't as real as SKATE and pretty bad setting but there is the odd cool 
 thing.

Review:  i have been looking forward to skaing on the balance board for a long time now, but as fun as wii 
 controls can be a lot of games have turned out to lose their appeal as you furiously swing your 
 remote through 20 levels of "fun". i wanted to let people who are holding off on skate it to see 
 if the controls sucked can wit no more.
  
  skate its balance board controls arent perfect, but more than enough to have fun and get the real 
 skateboarding feel. it may be hard to pull of the exact move you wanted at first, but it is fairly 
 easy to hop on and start doing tricks. i havent tried the other control schemes yet, but i soon 
 may have to as after hours of playing my legs are getting tired. overall well worth it for fans 
 of skateboarding, and and the skate franchise, as well as everyone who ever dreamed of skating 
 but were too afraid. ill review better after ive played more, i just wanted to let people know 
 that they didnt botch the balance board controls in this game.
