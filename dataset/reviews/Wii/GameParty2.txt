:::Review:::
Game Party 2 is a completely unoriginal minigame collection just waiting to take advantage of uninformed 
 casual gamers. 

  Let's just get this out of the way now: Game Party 2 is not a fun game. From its generic title 
 to its recycled collection of minigames, everything about it screams cash-in. Its poorly Photoshopped 
 box sits on shelves waiting for unsuspecting grandparents and casual game players. Do not be fooled: 
 There is nothing that sets this game apart from the dozens of other minigame collections on the 
 Wii. There are better games out there that are more deserving of your money.  

           Play beanbag toss by making an underhand-throwing gesture; you know, just like lawn darts, 
 horseshoes, or skill ball.      

  As the title implies, Game Party 2 is the follow-up to the original, which was released less than 
 a year ago. Of the 11 minigames present in the sequel, only five of them are new; the rest are 
 recycled from the first game. These minigames include such things as darts, shuffleboard, trivia, 
 skill ball, ping cup, beanbag toss, quarterback challenge, and more. Most of the games are slowly 
 paced, with only one person playing at a time. A customizable Tournament mode allows up to 16 players 
 to compete, so if you've got 15 friends and would like to ruin their night, invite them over for 
 a round of uninteresting games. Playing through with a created profile will unlock new modes, playing 
 surfaces, and other extras, but investing that much time in this game is a lot to ask.  

  When you first turn on Game Party 2, it might seem like there is a wide variety of moderately exciting 
 minigames, but lazy controls make most of them blur together. During a play-through of all 11 games, 
 you'll make a total of three different gestures. Skill ball, beanbag toss, horseshoes, and lawn 
 darts all require the same underhand-throwing gesture, making them feel more like skin swaps than 
 different games. The trivia game features a wide variety of questions in a bunch of different categories, 
 but the question difficulty is too erratic, ranging from extremely obscure to ridiculously easy. 
 Some of the minigames, such as darts and hoops shoot, offer a few minutes of fun, but none of them 
 are worth playing more than a couple of times.  

  Though they've been improved since the original Game Party, the controls don't do much to make 
 you feel like you're really playing the games. Most of them don't recognize slight variations, 
 such as twisting the remote. Many of them also have problems registering and interpreting your 
 gestures accurately. The few games that do work well, such as darts or shuffleboard, have been 
 done before in better packages.  

  Like everything else in the game, the presentation is completely generic. You can set up a profile 
 and create a player, but the options are limited. The character design is uninspired, with stiffly 
 animated Mii look-alikes. Games take place in backyards and funky '70s-style basements. The environments 
 and game pieces do an adequate job of re-creating the real games, but they lack any kind of appealing 
 flash or effects. The menus are the best part of the visuals. They're easy to navigate and feature 
 large buttons, as well as a nice polished shine. The music consists of forgettable waiting-room 
 music that does a good job of tying off the whole generic package.  

           Ping cup, the nonalcoholic beer pong.      

  The last Game Party was released at a 
 budget price, which kind of made up for the low quality. Game Party 2 costs $10 more than the first 
 game, but it includes only a handful of new minigames and middling improvements. It's very hard 
 to justify purchasing this game when the minigame collection packed in with the system is more 
 fun. Don't let this game take advantage of your casual-game-playing friends.

Review:  it is too easy. though the controls sometimes dont work on my brand new wii that i just got this 
 chrismas. very boring after just a few minutes. if you want to try it rent it first and if you 
 like it which i do not think you will, then you can buy it. but everyone in my family tried it 
 and really did not like it. horse shoes you just stay in one spot after you get a point and you 
 will get a point every time, darts i can not even figure out how to throw the dart. basketball 
 is pretty much the same thing as horse shoes, so the point is it sucks do not be like me and buy 
 it frist because chances are you will not like it. now i am just talking to take up as many characters 
 as i can so i can submit this. so you do not have to read this because i am not talking about the 
 game. so again do not read this because this has nothing to do with the game.

Review:  Similarly to Wii Play, though, there are only a few good, or at least passable games, and the replay 
 value is almost non-existent. It's a simple game, but it works. Skill-ball, however, is the worst 
 game. The controls are so janky and unpredictable that it is practically broken. You setup like 
 in Wii Bowling, but the comparisons stop there. I tried swinging to the left, and the ball went 
 right. Spin is not calculated, and, like in air hockey, the camera is set just a little too far 
 back.
  
  OK its Game Party 2, I purchased thinking they would be the darts right. I was wrong, this is a 
 series of mini games very much like the games that came with the console. This is a great product 
 if you have younger children around. For the adults save your $30.00 wait for a used copy at no 
 more then $15.00 or rent it some weekend.
  
  The controls on most of the games are tipical Wii fashinon. The most difficult game to pick up 
 was the bean bag toss. My character just would not let go..
