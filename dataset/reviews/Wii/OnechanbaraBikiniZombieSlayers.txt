:::Review:::
Onechanbara makes zombie-slaying women boring. 

  As you may have been able to figure out from the title, Onechanbara: Bikini Zombie Slayers is more 
 concerned with parading an endless stream of undead monsters and women in revealing clothing than 
 delivering a meaty and thought-provoking experience. And that is not necessarily a bad thing. But 
 Onechanbara is so mindless, the combat so repetitive, the levels so monotonous, that even the inherent 
 joy of dicing legions of zombies into tiny cubes does not conjure even a tiny flash of excitement. 
 You might think that an array of scantily clad heroines dismembering an endless horde of creatures 
 would elicit some thrill, possibly on a primal level, but you would be mistaken. The excessive 
 gore and extreme objectification in Onechanbara are not able to mask the simple gameplay for even 
 a few minutes, which makes this a boring and repetitive hack-and-slash with no redeeming qualities. 

           What a precious prom photo.      

  A story is buried beneath the layers of zombie blood, but it is so inexpertly told that it's impossible 
 to make out what is actually happening. Before each level, a wall of text against a darkened background 
 will attempt to convey your motivations for chopping up hundreds of enemies, but it serves only 
 to muddle what should be a basic quest fueled by bloodlust. Instead of using a conventional narrative 
 to reveal the tale, the story segments resemble poorly composed poems with a choppy structure that 
 makes it extremely difficult to understand the purpose of your journey. Obviously, people should 
 not expect the story of a zombie-murder simulator to change their worldview, but these interludes 
 in Onechanbara suck the personality from an already boring action game.  

  However, the action is the real source for your boredom. You will be able to plow through the vast 
 majority of the game by lazily shaking the Wii Remote to unleash your sword strike. Without exaggeration, 
 you can tear through wave after wave of enemies by walking around the levels and shaking your arm 
 like a madman as you cut a legion of zombies into tiny bits. A couple of enemy types will require 
 a more restrained approach, but the level of strategy needed to conquer even these higher-level 
 foes is insultingly low. For example, mudmen require a more rhythmic method, forcing you to time 
 three consecutive attacks to rip their hearts from their filthy bodies. Zombie cops will hold up 
 their hands to block, making you wait a beat before you can cut them apart. And that is the extent 
 of the resistance that you'll face from your apathetic attackers.  

  The levels are just as bland as the combat. You'll travel from sparse city streets to indistinct 
 office buildings without any landmarks to make these locations memorable. When you complete the 
 story mode (which takes not much longer than an hour) , you'll unlock one of the four characters 
 and have the option to play through the same set of levels with a different persona. These characters 
 have slightly different attacks -- Misery has an extendable sword and Saki can throw her foes -- but 
 your strategy will never vary. Even the option to upgrade your abilities at the end of each section 
 does nothing to make this game more compelling. Putting more points into your strength or weapon 
 reach has little effect on the action, so the combat feels identical from the moment you first 
 start playing until you're finished and throw down the controller in disgust. There isn't any gameplay 
 variety thrown in to mix things up, either. Every level has you walking around, chopping up zombies 
 indiscriminately, until you mercifully reach the end.  

           That zombie cop sure is indifferent to his impending demise.      

  You'll encounter 
 bosses from time to time, but while these enemies offer more challenge than the standard swarm, 
 the battles are still excruciatingly bland. There are four heroines total in the game, and the 
 bosses are whichever three characters you are not controlling. They have the same attacks as you 
 do and will employ the same strategy as well. Get ready for thrilling battles between two barely 
 clothed women mindlessly swinging their oversized swords until one of them dies. Given that your 
 counterpart will slash away with her sword as if the Wii is frantically shaking a controller of 
 its own, you'll have to use defensive rolls to win these battles. There isn't much depth to these 
 encounters, but having to employ a few defensive techniques in addition to rapidly swinging the 
 remote makes them slightly more tolerable than the usual combat.  

  Onechanbara: Bikini Zombie Slayers is a lousy game. It isn't aggravating or frustrating, it's just 
 boring. The story is incomprehensible, the levels all feel the same, and the simplistic combat 
 never evolves. With so much wanton dismemberment onscreen, it's hard to imagine that it could be 
 so utterly bland, but Onechanbara is never able to make this exceedingly simple experience the 
 least bit engaging. Even at a budget price, Onechanbara is not worth your money or time.

Review:  I've written about this game elsewhere and have been participating in the discussion taking place 
 within the game's associated forums, but I feel compelled to do a little, reader review. It's not 
 at all surprising to see the game receive less-than-stellar reviews from professional sites. It's 
 definitely a low-budget production, and it speaks to gamers' basest urges. That said, the fact 
 of the matter is the Wii version of Onechanbara is undeniably fun. And there's just no getting 
 around that.
  
  When I was first faced with the prospect of having to play a game that featured full-on waggle 
 combat, I was none too enthusiastic. I've played other games that attempted that -- Soul Calibur 
 Legends for one -- and none of them were fun or satisfying. So, I was greatly surprised when I 
 started playing Bikini Zombie Slayers.
  
  There are two main components that make Onechanbara successful in my eyes. One, the feedback you 
 receive when attacking enemies. Rather than hearing a swooshing sound when waving your sword, you 
 instead get a hard-hitting, slashing sound whenever your weapon impacts with an enemy. A slight 
 difference perhaps, but it greatly affects the level of satisfaction you get out of the game's 
 combat.
  
  The most important element, however -- that which makes the combat here enjoyable -- is that you 
 don't have to swing the Wii Remote with great force. Basic combos are performed by simple up-and-down 
 gestures, and when matched with the forced feedback coming from the controller, it makes for combat 
 that's so incredibly satisfying on a visceral level.
  
  The Nunchuk, too, plays into combat (aside from the obvious character movement with the analog 
 stick) , but it's simple and makes sense. If enemies guard, you can shake the Nunchuk to kick, which 
 will break them out of their stance and then allow you to complete your combo. It's also used for 
 Saki (one of the four playable characters) to perform her Beat Mode techniques, which are amazingly 
 fun to pull off and watch.
  
  Here's the thing, though -- Onechanbara doesn't do much outside of offering mindless hack-n-slash. 
 But it doesn't really have to, either. The game is modeled after arcade action games of the past, 
 and to that end, it really is a wonderful diversion. You're not going to get even a decent story 
 from the game; there are only a couple of bosses, and they're very easy; there are no puzzles, 
 no platforming... it's just straight-up zombie killing. 
  
  Here's the other thing, though -- it's so damn fun! It's sexy, it's stupid, and it's almost everything 
 you want when what you want is instant gratification. It's also a pretty fat package, with four 
 separate story modes; a survival mode and free play; cooperative, split-screen multiplayer; and 
 tons of quests and unlockables.
  
  Don't let others decide for you if you're contemplating getting this game. For $30, you get what 
 you pay for. It's a good value if you're in the mood for shameless exploits, but no, it's not Devil 
 May Cry. It's an arcade game for Wii, and so long as you don't attach high expectations to it, 
 you should have a great time with the game.

Review:  this game has all the elements of a 16 year olds favourite game. weapon scantily clad with 2 sets 
 of big guns, and enough targets for them to kill to put dead rising to shame. Its gameplay is challenging 
 and requires time to get decent at. but once u have it mastered this game is worth all you pay 
 for it. the 3.0 from gamespot is bunk and they know it. 
  If you come here expecting stereotypes you will find this game to be worth its 3.0 but if you come 
 here expecting too see an anime style slash/shoot -em up you will find solid gold. its replay is 
 good, its story is solid if a little along the side of cheesy. and you will probably go take a 
 cold shower regularly after playing this game.
  im not one to ruin stories so i wont but its worth every second of it. its pure uncensored fun 
 with lots of unique gameplay. its one flaw is rehashed environments. but if i needed to have background 
 to play a good game i guess crysis is worth is 9.0 or better .

Review:  First off you are going to see seriously mixed reviews on this title everywhere you look and honestly 
 the most accurate I've been able to find, that fit my opinions most mind you, was from "Play" magazine 
 and can be viewed on thier site currently. This game is truly a fun game to play and requires less 
 hardcore swinging of your Wii-mote than expected from a hack and slash title but the fact that 
 pulling off some of the insanely elaborate combo moves takes above the norm skills is going to 
 frustrate alot of players. The story can be more passe' than you may want from the hack and slash 
 survival horror genre but that comes primarilly because it is a direct sequel to the Xbox "Onechanbara: 
 Samurai Squad" game that holds the original chapter to these characters stories and introductions. 
 Basically you WILL feel lost when the main character starts talking about her past and events may 
 even seem out of place but that is seriously the main flaw in this games story telling and otherwise 
 it's a basicly rudementary, straight forward story of characters who gain powers and use those 
 powers to slay the undead while searching for answers to the unravelling events. I honestly do 
 agree that the game is shorter than I would have preferred but at the same time my choice to agree 
 is because I would have enjoyed continuing my zombie slashing. The thing is though that you also 
 do get to restart and go through again w/ newly strengthened abilities or you choose another character 
 and learn thier story arc and not spend immense ammounts of time going over and over through the 
 game. It's relatively easy to level a characterm easy to distribute skill points, and once you 
 start getting into it the controls will grow on you and by the end of your first run through you 
 will be able to pull off some pretty sweet moves and decimate entire hordes of the undead. So in 
 my honest opinion I do recommend this game to someone looking for a very cool, indepth zombie slasher 
 w/ a high ammount of replay and reward value.... oh and on the Wii the ability to co-op play is 
 such a sweet feature because you and your zombie killer partner will be an unstoppable duo and 
 it will definitely push the game value way up. Have fun, play like a true samurai, and always, 
 always aim for the head people!!

Review:  First thing is that i bought that game expecting an average game with zombies but ended up falling 
 in love with a deep game
  
  gameplay
  yes there is wiggle controls but with learning the cool combination attack then theres less waggle 
 and more timing your attacks for better damage, and with blood sword/ rage it also has different 
 gameplay, i love the blood sword idea the more zombies you kill the more blood gets on it and if 
 you don't wipe the blood off after a while the sword will start to stick in the zombies.
  
  Graphics
  i find them damn impressive the model's of zombies and good and all the different kind 
 of enemy's and the stages look really good then theres the blood spots that come on the screen 
 when you are cutting at a group of zombies.
  
  Music
  i find it really good and setting perfect with the mood of the game.
  
  replay
  the main 
 game is around 5 hours or more for one of the main storys and with 4 girls that's just 20 hours 
 for main story then theirs the quests 160 in all and the hidden rings to find i am sure theres 
 at least 40 hours of gameplay if not more.
