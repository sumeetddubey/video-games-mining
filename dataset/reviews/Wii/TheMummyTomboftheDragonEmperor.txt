:::Review:::
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor has all the right elements, yet it still manages to do everything 
 wrong. 

  The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor for the Nintendo Wii and PlayStation 2 has all the ingredients 
 of a successful third-person adventure game. And at first glance, it seems to get the recipe right, 
 but the devil is in the details. As you venture further into this game, small and large issues 
 continue arising until ultimately, it becomes clear that this mummy has served up one truly rotten 
 dish.  

           Lock on. Fire. Kill. Lock on. Fire. Kill. Lock on. Fire. Kill.      

  The game faithfully follows the story of the third Mummy film, telling its tale with attractive 
 hand-drawn artwork and narration from the dignified voice of Michelle Yeoh. You'll play as Rick 
 O'Connell, as well as his son Alex, who must stop the evil Emperor Han from raising his Terracotta 
 Army and conquering the world. The adventure takes you from ancient tombs to the snowy Himalayas 
 and the Great Wall of China. Sadly, whatever joy may have been found in exploring these exotic 
 environments is hampered by the invisible walls you'll frequently run up against.  

  Rick and Alex are constantly being assailed by enemies -- human and ceramic. The O'Connells are brawlers, 
 so they have a host of quick and dirty melee attacks at their disposal to deal with their foes. 
 The variety of moves initially seems pretty cool. It's actually pointless, however, as the combat 
 in the game is so simple that it hardly matters what tactic you use. Your enemies will just stand 
 there and take it regardless. The O'Connells also have pistols, tommy guns, and shotguns, which 
 add another level of silliness to the action. Many of your assailants will come at you with swords 
 in hand, but they pose little threat. It's always a piece of cake to kill them from a safe distance 
 with one of your guns, and, after all, it's what Indiana Jones would do.  

  Like any adventurer worth his or her salt, you'll also spend some time shimmying along ledges and 
 making death-defying leaps, though these leaps place a little too much emphasis on death for their 
 own good. It's often hard to distinguish a usable ledge from the background. What's worse, the 
 camera, which you have no control over, doesn't give you a good view of what's ahead; thus, these 
 sequences are exercises in trial and error. You'll often blindly jump to a ledge only to find that 
 there's a spinning blade there with your name on it.  

  If the reason everyone really wanted to be an adventurer was for the thrill of pulling levers and 
 opening doors, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor might have been onto something. Each time 
 you encounter a door, lever, or other mechanism, you take control of your character's hands and 
 input a series of gestures. On the Wii, this is done by moving the Nunchuk and Wii Remote, while 
 on the PS2, you use the thumbsticks. Both methods work equally well. But these sequences are just 
 tedious exercises and happen so frequently that they really break up the flow of the action, making 
 the game feel more like a crank-turning simulator at times than a thrilling adventure.  

  The game also features a boss battle that is so unspeakably horrible that it alone would be reason 
 to stay away from this game. At the end of the game's fifth level, the shape-shifting emperor takes 
 on the form of a lionlike creature that frequently tries to pounce on you and emits shock waves 
 that must be leapt over. The problem with the battle is that you'll spend most of your time wrestling 
 with the game's controls, which are fine for taking on the soldiers the game throws at you but 
 are wholly inadequate for this kind of action. You need to lock on to the boss to fire at him effectively, 
 but then, you need to release the lock in order to jump over the shock waves, and if he chooses 
 that moment to leap behind you, you won't see the shock waves approaching. Furthermore, if you 
 happen to be reloading your gun when the shock waves approach, you won't be able to jump at all. 

  The Wii version is a bit sharper than its PS2 counterpart, but aside from that, the game looks 
 pretty much identical on both consoles. The environments are varied and nicely detailed, though 
 frequent collision-detection issues can be distracting. The music and sound effects are decent, 
 while the voice acting is actually pretty good, with Brendan Fraser delivering his lines with particular 
 enthusiasm. Unfortunately, though they may be good for a chuckle or two at first, these one-liners 
 repeat so frequently that they end up being more annoying than humorous.  

           The game captures the excitement of pulling levers pretty well.      

  Tomb of the 
 Dragon Emperor's six levels will take most players somewhere around five hours to complete. There 
 are a bunch of unlockables in the form of concept art and the like that you get for finding hidden 
 artifacts scattered throughout the levels, but it's hard to imagine anyone being compelled to go 
 after that stuff. There's something especially disappointing about failures like this. All the 
 elements are here. But every last one of them is handled so poorly that the end result is a game 
 even the bravest of adventurers should run from... screaming.

Review:  I was waitng for this game to go on sale, (if it was as bad as they said it should have gone to 
 the bargin bin long ago) and when it finally did i couldn't resist buying it, and it's actualy 
 pretty decant!
  The good: Lots of objectives and unlokables will keep you playing, combat is always excitng, inovative 
 puzzle system, has the actual voice actors from the movie, spectacular level desighn and variation, 
 YOU GET TO PLAY AS A YETI!!!!!
  The bad: levels are loooooooooong and you can't save mid level, trying to defeat enough enamies 
 to unlock new wepons is teadiouse, The last two levels are HARD, You can only play as the yeti 
 in one level, it reminds you of tomb raider...... perhaps a little too much.
  So oveall this is a good action game if you loved the movie, but rember, it's not worth paying 
 40$ for, unless you really must have it!
