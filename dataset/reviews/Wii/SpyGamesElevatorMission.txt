:::Review:::
Spy Games' abysmal gameplay is matched only by its flair for the generic. 

  By any standard, Spy Games: Elevator Mission is a remarkably awful title. Its shallow gameplay 
 feels better suited as a free online flash game, as opposed to a budget priced retail product. 
 For a Wii first-person shooter, the precision aiming gained from the remote is squandered by an 
 otherwise clunky control scheme. And worst of all, it's just plain boring. A game this bad should 
 offer at least  some  unintentional entertainment, but there's not a drop to be found here.  

 
  Spy Games' plot falls somewhere between sparse and nonexistent. According to the brief description 
 on the back of the box, you're playing the role of a secret agent sent to rescue vital documents 
 from a terrorist network. The game simply drops you onto a 50-story building and tells you to make 
 your way to ground level, shooting people and securing top-secret disks along the way. But in a 
 game this clumsy and haphazard, maybe expecting a bit of plot exposition was hoping for too much. 

           If hell's labyrinth were decorated by the guy who did the carpeting for the Circus Circus 
 casino, it would probably look a lot like this.      

  The game is, in essence, a rail shooter masquerading as something in the more free-roaming first-person 
 mold. You're given the ability to jump, crouch, and strafe, but the way these commands are mapped 
 to the Nunchuk (having to hold a particular button while simultaneously moving the joystick in 
 a specific direction) makes them far too clumsy to use in the heat of combat when most of your 
 attention is dedicated to pinpointing the onscreen enemies. What that leaves you with is the ability 
 to aim/shoot and move back and forth. With the entirety of the gameplay divided between these two 
 commands, the action gets incredibly stale after just a short while. Having only a few guns to 
 choose from certainly doesn't help, either.  

  There's little variety to be found in the visuals, as well. There are only a handful of enemies 
 in the game, and you'll often go several levels at a time while seeing only one type. Even when 
 new enemies show up, they share the exact same animation as the others -- which is to say, frequently 
 running into walls and not realizing you're there. The level design is just as uninspired: Each 
 floor blends into the next, with bland wall patterns repeated so often you'll feel like you're 
 in a rat maze. For example, eight floors in a row might look like a tacky Las Vegas hotel, or another 
 10 might look like an office complex, but there's absolutely no variety within those segments, 
 which makes for a very confusing navigation experience. Worse yet, the graphics could be mistaken 
 for an early-generation Dreamcast title, while the music and sound effects could easily have been 
 lifted from a system several generations prior to that.  

  All told, calling Spy Games a budget title would be an insult to other games that might actually 
 hold some value for their 20-or-so-dollar price tags. Spy Games' total avoidance of anything resembling 
 a creative risk, combined with its clunky controls and repetitive presentation, make it a game 
 that should never be considered at any price.

Review:  This game is utter crap. You are a secret spy from the Dung Eating Organization on a mission to 
 steal secret documents which contains crushed crap in 3 discs. You look like Link from Zelda and 
 your gun looks like a 2 year-olds toy. The levels look like a circus clown was the architect and 
 the enemies look like 1960 cowboys in suits. The timer makes the game even more frustrating. The 
 graphics make you vomit. Your eyes will start hurting if you don't shut off your TV. Your TV will 
 explode if you exceed the limit also. Even if you try playing with a blind fold, trust me it will 
 be the same. The only solution is to burn it to ashes and then send the ashes to space. Please 
 save the world by doing the proceedure above. Don't give it to your dog as a toy or as food or 
 else you will make its life miserable!

Review:  I got this game for Christmas, and I'm thinking "cool a spy game, I get to ninja around". So I 
 pop it into my Wii, grab the controller, and start to play. The first thing I realize is how craptastic 
 the graphics are. I mean come on, it's a remake of an old 80's arcade game but you could at least 
 add some punch to it. Then, after i hit "start game" I find out that the graphics arn't the only 
 thing wrong with this...
  
  1) Sound
  There is no variation in the way guys die
  2) Gun Position
  Fixed right in the middle of the screen
  3) Gameplay
  I find it impossible 
 to get down to the 39th floor
  
  So if you're reading this please... don't buy this game. It's not worth the money. Go out and watch 
 a movie, hang out with some friends, but DON'T buy this game. And for all of you that went out 
 and bought this willingly... ask yourself why...

Review:  If you have a Wii and you just wanna waste your money on a $20 game and you see Spy Games Elevator 
 Missions then just go to a drug and buy crack instead! This game is horrible and it just shows 
 people how really lazy these third party developers can be! This is just a pile of ugly, smelly 
 CRAP! You should never buy this game and if you do buy this stupid game then just hang yourself 
 because you dont deserve to be in this world if you are going to buy a load of crap like this! 
 Take my word for it. I just wanted to kill myself after i played this game. Wow. If you just imagine 
 those poor little kids out there looking to buy a game and they see this game and they buy it, 
 you are just gonna feel sorry for him and yourself for not telling him that game sucks ass and 
 tell him to his money on something other than that.

Review:  I have to be honest with you if you are reading this. I have not played the whole game. I have, 
 however played the game and from the small amount of time I spent on it, I'm thinking I'll turn 
 the disc into a coaster or Frisbee.
  
  Graphics are terrible, even for a Nintendo Wii game.
  
  Game-play is terrible. You start at 
 the top floor of some building that you need to infiltrate and steal something or the other. In 
 the meantime, you shoot some bad guys that come out of the rooms and look for elevator keys. That's 
 about all I've come across.
  
  Sound... I can't remember. Probably terrible just like everything else.
  
  Summary: This is 
 a game that never should have left the development stages. Thankfully for me, I received this "game" 
 as a gift during the past holiday season. I don't even think I would ever give this game to a mortal 
 enemy of mine because it would just be too mean. Stay away from it!

Review:  I mean the menu is terrible it just says spy games elevator mission and there is an option play 
 thats it! U select play and then they show subtitles detailing ure mission and then this guy who 
 has ears like Link in Zelda lands on a building and has a dart type gun in his hand. He then goes 
 inside the building through the 50th floor and all the floors that I played which are about 5 max 
 are all colored like a circus play room! Its so painful watching and in the game when u shoot the 
 agents they make disturbing noises like this, "UhhhhhhhAhhhh" when u kill them. I mean the developers 
 could have atleast done something with the game, its completely useless and an utter waste of time 
 and of 20$! The angents and the floors look like crap and anywayz the game is crap!
  
  I didn't buy this game it was a birthday present from my sister_in_law who doesn't know anything 
 about my taste and about any Wii games!
  I just thanked her and when she went I never ever touched this horrific, ugly, non creative game!
