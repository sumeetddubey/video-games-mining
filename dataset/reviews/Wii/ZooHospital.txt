:::Review:::
Cute critters fail to keep this medical-themed puzzler from flatlining. 

  Zoo Hospital for the Wii is a cuddly medical-themed puzzler in the style of Atlus' popular Trauma 
 Center franchise. Unfortunately, it has none of the puzzle variation, intensity, or replayability 
 of the Trauma Center games and presents very little challenge or depth. Its puzzles never increase 
 in difficulty, and you're often forced to repeatedly endure the same operation type, compounding 
 your sense of boredom. The sad reality of Zoo Hospital is that it boasts little more than cute 
 animals.  

  The game opens with you receiving a call from Aunt Lucy, who operates a floundering zoo that's 
 about to be bought out by a sinister businessman determined to replace it with a minigolf course. 
 Your objective, as a licensed veterinarian fresh out of school, is to treat the zoo's animals as 
 Lucy works to secure funding. The plot is rather uninteresting and disjointed, providing little 
 backdrop for the operations you'll perform, though occasionally you'll treat an animal that advances 
 the story.  

           Wage war in a petri dish by zapping infected cells with a laser.      

  The bulk of 
 the gameplay is extremely straightforward and easy to master; a map of the zoo is displayed, conveniently 
 marked with icons that let you know when an animal's health is in jeopardy. You merely click on 
 an icon to send a distressed animal to the hospital wing, where you examine it by keeping the cursor 
 inside the middle of a circle representing a magnifying glass. You're usually given five minutes 
 to complete the appropriate operation, which may involve suturing wounds, laser-zapping viruses, 
 applying antibacterial gel to rashes, or even pulling teeth. Each puzzle type requires simple movements 
 of the Wii Remote, such as when you smack giant lice by making a brief, slashing motion, but sometimes, 
 you'll have to shake the controller a little more forcibly to get it to register your movements. 
 You'll encounter a similar control problem in a puzzle in which you guide a Tetris-like object 
 through an animal's intestines because you'll find it difficult for the game to register that you've 
 grabbed the object whenever it has been pushed too close to an obstruction.  

  Though the operation types are initially varied, you'll soon find yourself performing the same 
 operation several times in a row or tackling the same infection with the same solution, which is 
 irksome because the procedures don't evolve. The operation puzzles are very simplistic; they require 
 almost no strategy and so quickly becoming tedious. For example, in the virus-zapping operation, 
 the goal is to kill the infected cells before they damage the healthy ones, but the infected cells 
 merely float around in no discernable pattern, encountering the healthy cells almost randomly. 

  Furthermore, most operations have very few stages and are purely external procedures, such as the 
 syringe "operation" that requires you to do nothing more than inject an animal with a vaccine to 
 successfully complete it. The game also fails to intensify with progression. The time element that 
 is supposed to apply constant pressure to the gameplay is practically useless because many operations 
 are completed in as little as 30 seconds; you shouldn't even breach the minute mark until you're 
 more than halfway through. Even if you should run out of time or have an animal wake in the middle 
 of an operation, there is no penalty for failure, which makes the gameplay even easier.  

  Aftercare opportunities are provided in an attempt to add depth, but they fail miserably. Following 
 a 15-second operation, you may revisit your patient to observe it in a limited viewing field with 
 a locked camera. You're sometimes asked to pet an animal's "sweet spot" until it rolls over in 
 fits of ecstasy, effectively raising its happiness meter; however, it's difficult to do so given 
 the game's frequent inability to correctly register the area of the animal you're petting. You 
 can pet the creature's leg, where the sweet spot is located, but the game will register its leg 
 as its stomach, which is irritating because you have to correctly pet some animals to proceed. 
 Animals also have a health meter that you can raise by feeding them the appropriate food, but both 
 gauges drain so slowly that they don't impact the gameplay, making animal monitoring a moot point. 

           Tired of simplistic, repetitive operations? Try feeding the birdy.      

  Though Zoo Hospital looks better than it did on the DS, it retained several visual blemishes. Its 
 greatest treat is its realistic, highly detailed portrayal of animals that all move fluidly in 
 front of a floral backdrop; however, the local plants feature sharp, jaggy edges, and even the 
 animals sport some very blurry fur. The operation screens have also been updated to feature more 
 accurate body elements under the knife, which match the greater realism of the animals. With 47 
 species included, you're very likely to find a good representation of your childhood favorite, 
 from its coloring pattern down to its usually accurate distress calls, though a few may have you 
 scratching your head in disbelief. The music is sufficiently low-key during operations and upbeat 
 after successful treatments, but only two primary songs are available, so don't expect any acoustic 
 variety.  

  The game is surprisingly short; you should be able to complete all of its seven chapters in about 
 five hours, though an epilogue that includes two baby animals and a famous mythological beast might 
 bump you up to six hours. Torus Games did make an effort to increase replayability by adding a 
 two-player cooperative mode to unlock, but the low amount of animal interaction, as well as operation 
 challenge, prevents the feature from really being any fun or useful.  

  Zoo Hospital is a very bare-bones medical-themed puzzler that is short and dull, focusing on heavily 
 repeated procedures, as well as simplistic operations that require almost no strategy at all. It's 
 a pathetic attempt to capitalize on the Trauma Center formula, which needs more than cuddly creatures 
 to succeed.
