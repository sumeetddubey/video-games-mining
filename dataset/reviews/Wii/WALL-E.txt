:::Review:::
Wall-E is overflowing with charm, but the simple gameplay makes the experience fall flat. 

  The main reason Pixar movies are so revered is that they are able to appeal to both adults and 
 children at the same time. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the games based on these 
 movies. Wall-E follows in the path of many cartoon adaptations before it -- taking the wholesome 
 aesthetic and crafting a trivial game around it while ignoring a large part of the film's audience 
 in the process. The mechanics in Wall-E are accessible enough that children eager to spend more 
 time with the lovable robot will find an inviting world, but the end result is too short and predictable 
 to provide value for any platforming veterans.          The cutscenes add some life to these electric 
 beings.      

  The story in Wall-E is about friendship and flowers. Like in the movie, you start off as a lone 
 robot on a dirty planet, left to clean up the trash of thoughtless generations after the humans 
 bolted for cleaner pastures. The first level is quiet and desolate. It's not often that platformers 
 present a world without any enemies in sight, but the early parts of Wall-E exist to highlight 
 his severe loneliness -- and that weight comes across quite powerfully. Wall-E eventually meets up 
 with a flying robot named Eve and gets to experience space travel first hand. The cutscenes are 
 well done, telling most of the tale through gestures and robot groans that give a lot of personality 
 to the mechanical beings. Though the cinematics were not taken directly from the film, they are 
 still carefully crafted to express the subtleties of Wall-E and Eve's wide range of emotions. The 
 environments are inviting and eye-pleasing, though they are sometimes too sparse, especially in 
 the space station levels.  

  The quiet energy of the first few levels doesn't lead to action packed gameplay, but it still provides 
 a few thrills. Your time on Earth is spent navigating through elaborate obstacle courses. As Wall-E, 
 you can jump and make tiny cubes of trash that you can hurl at targets. Shaking the Wii Remote 
 to pick up cubes isn't exactly intuitive, but it doesn't detract from the action. There is a variety 
 of different garbage types -- heavy, magnetic and explosive -- but the puzzle solving is extremely 
 light. The key is always next to the locked door, so navigating this filthy world is very straightforward. 
 The platforming elements are a little more complex, forcing you to climb walls vertically and even 
 upside down with your magnetic bottom, but the paths are always linear so any sort of directional 
 acumen is left by the wayside.  

  The Eve sections follow the accessible path displayed in the Wall-E portions, but they spice up 
 the action a bit. Eve is able to fly around the environment at will, which turns out to be surprisingly 
 fun. There are two types of flying sections: open air and tunnel races. In the open, you have to 
 search for plant life and other collectables hidden on the surface. The freedom of flight works 
 well here because the controls are so responsive. It's easy to fly through pipes and under bridges, 
 but the lack of imagination in these objectives is disappointing. The levels are ultra streamlined 
 so it removes any challenge from the scavenger hunts and the space is too confined to make racing 
 interesting for long. It's a shame the developers couldn't have expanded on this section because 
 the act of flight is really well done.  

  The shooting sections make up the final gameplay type, which occur late in the game. Once in the 
 spaceship, you have to fight your way through a small army of robots. The hectic pace and destructive 
 violence seems out of place here compared to the rest of the game. You can pull the camera in over 
 your shoulder and mow down robots with quick aiming, or you can point at the screen from your normal 
 viewpoint to nail baddies while running around. The targeting is ultra tight, making quick work 
 of your enemies before you have time to worry about your health dropping. The sheer number of foes 
 you'll have to face here make these sections too long and repetitive, though. When the simple joy 
 of platforming and flying is replaced by nonstop shooting, the game loses much of its charm.  

 
           Flying around as Eve is freeing.      

  There are a number of movie related unlockables, but the rewards aren't compelling enough to demand 
 a second play-through. The multiplayer mode is only good for a quick taste before it loses its 
 appeal. There is just something unsettling about taking part in a deathmatch with four happy Wall-Es 
 wheeling around with laser guns. The main adventure can be finished in less than 10 hours, and 
 after you play through the story once, there just isn't much reason to go back again.  

  The presentation is the only part of Wall-E that separates it from the glut of other platformers 
 out there. The different gameplay mechanics offered by Eve and Wall-E provide some variety in this 
 adventure, but the ideas are never fully fleshed out. This is still a fun game for anyone anxious 
 to spend more time with the garbage-making robot, but there isn't enough depth or replay value 
 to raise this above similar movie-licensed offerings.

Review:  Nice little game, short but quite amusing.
  
  Wall-E has become one of my favourite animated movie, displacing The Incredibles and Ratatouille. 
 I've wanted to play the game since it came out, but having been relatively burned by a similar 
 feeling for the Iron Man game, I've waited for the price to drop.
  
  It's a nice game, the graphics are good, better than some, worse than other. The game capture some 
 of the charm of the movie, but, and I can't quite put my finger on it, something seems to be missing.
 
  
  The game is enjoyable, if somewhat short; I've finished it in 4 hours 30 and something minutes, 
 and I'm not a fast player. I've not unlocked everything, and I've not searched all the items, but 
 I've got most.
  
  I've begun trying to complete at 100% every game I have, and this one will definitely be one of 
 the next I'll do.
  
  I would suggest renting it, or check the bargain bins.

Review:  For me this game is great. Lest start with the graphics, the graphics are good, not as good as 
 mario galaxy, but the game looks good. The thing that I love about this game is the gameplay, it 
 has the best gameplay that Ive seen on a movie-game. The story is really interesting and the enviroments 
 look good. Now lest check the controllers, the controllers are great, it is really nice to play 
 this game with the wii controllers. I loved the movie, and the game is also really good. For me 
 this game deserves a 9.5 because it has great gameplay but the graphics dont look as great as other 
 games, but for me the graphics and enviroments look good. I think this game is gonna be a little 
 to hard for kids but with some practice it will become easy. Also if you havent watch the movie 
 go watch it because it is the best animated film of the year. Really nice game. Lest play!
