:::Review:::
Fun hedgehog levels are enough to overshadow the uninspired werehog sections in this fast-paced 
 platformer. 

  Every new Sonic release carries a hope that Sega's blue hedgehog will be able to regain the form 
 that made him a star in the early '90s. And most every venture into the third dimension has resulted 
 in various degrees of failure. Sonic Unleashed is able to buck the trend started by previous Sonic 
 adventures and continued by the high-definition versions of this very same game. The Wii version 
 uses the same concepts as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 renditions, pairing Sonic's trademark 
 speed through loops and over collapsing bridges with slow-paced werehog levels that focus on precise 
 platforming and hand-to-hand combat. However, with entirely new levels and much more responsive 
 controls, the Wii version is a vastly superior experience. The combat is repetitive, and there 
 aren't enough levels that focus entirely on speed, but Unleashed is an ultimately fun adventure 
 that brings back fond memories of Sonic's heyday.  

           Rings let you pull off a super burst for even more speed.      

  The story begins 
 with Dr. Eggman shooting the world with a giant ray gun. Predictably, the planet breaks apart, 
 but there is an unexpected side effect as well. Innocuous Sonic gets transformed into a giant, 
 mean-looking creature called a werehog. This abomination emerges only when the sun goes down, and 
 the game lets you play stages during the day and at night to make full use of your dual personalities. 
 Even though there are an equal number of hedgehog and werehog stages, most of your time in Sonic 
 Unleashed will be spent at night, given that the shallow combat takes far longer than the sprint-to-the-finish-line 
 hedgehog races.  

  The traditional Sonic levels are a blast. You'll sprint across the land at top speeds, just like 
 Sonic is supposed to do, and tight controls make the whole thing very enjoyable. It's incredibly 
 easy to snatch precious rings as you sprint by, target enemies to leap to higher platforms, and 
 wall-jump up tight passageways, all without slowing down for even a second. The responsive controls 
 are the backbone of this adventure, making it fun and rewarding to sprint through these levels 
 as fast as possible, but the level design also deserves praise. Everything is intelligently laid 
 out, letting you see obstacles well in advance. You'll never find yourself running into an unseen 
 wall of spikes or falling down a pit because you couldn't see a platform located beneath you. Punishment 
 is also kept to a minimum. Often, if you miss an important jump, you'll merely fall to another 
 part of the level and continue on your way. When you do die, you are placed near where you fell 
 off, which encourages you to experiment with more-difficult paths through levels.  

  The biggest problem with the hedgehog levels is that there are not enough of them. Each of the 
 eight unique environments has only one hedgehog stage to run through. This isn't quite as bad as 
 it sounds, considering that the same levels can be replayed with different tasks, but it is disappointing 
 to have only a handful of different worlds to sprint through. Your main goal is always to get to 
 the finish line in whichever manner you choose, but the other goals add restrictions that offer 
 some variety. For instance, you'll be asked to collect a certain amount of rings or plow through 
 a level without being hit by an enemy. Each instance adds a few tweaks to the basic layout, but 
 the dearth of new worlds is grating after a while. Nevertheless, seeing as how the levels are so 
 fun to play, you'll still find yourself going back to set new records or search for branching paths 
 that you missed the first time.  

           Combat may be flashy, but it's also really boring.      

  The werehog levels are a 
 drastic change of pace from those of the hedgehog. These levels are split between mindless combat 
 and deliberate platforming, though you'll thankfully spend longer navigating the environment than 
 destroying forgettable enemies. You have a few standard platforming tricks up your sleeve, such 
 as double-jumping across treacherous pits and climbing up poles, but you also have stretchable 
 arms that let you reach distant platforms. This twist doesn't add a whole lot to the experience, 
 merely giving you more leeway when you're trying to leap across gaps. Camera control is taken out 
 of your hands, but the game almost always gives you an optimal view to traverse these environments. 
 The slower pace is pretty jarring after playing the superspeedy Sonic levels, but it can still 
 be satisfying to play as the werehog.  

  Jumping and grabbing is an enjoyable, if uninspired, experience, but the combat you'll have to 
 endure is anything but. It is mindless to a fault, forcing you to repeat the same attacks throughout 
 the entire game. Each arm is controlled independently, but there isn't a difference between your 
 right-hand and left-hand attacks. There is no strategy or skill needed; you simply rush headfirst 
 into battle and let your werehog limbs fly. You'll unlock more combos as you progress through the 
 game, but you won't have to worry about pulling off any specific moves in the heat of battle. Mashing 
 without thought is all you need to succeed, which makes these combat encounters awfully boring. 
 There are only a handful of battles in each level, and you can dispatch the enemies fairly quickly, 
 but these brawls make the werehog levels more tedious than they should be.  

           Sonic is just running away from his problems again.      

  The visuals are cheery 
 and inviting in Sonic Unleashed. The camera adjusts during loop runs and rail grinds to show a 
 cinematic angle, letting you enjoy the scenic vistas as Sonic speeds by. The frame rate stays high, 
 even when you're battling giant robots while sprinting along twisted paths. Sonic is at its best 
 when you're flying through the levels at top speeds, and Unleashed is able to capture that enjoyment 
 quite well. The responsive controls are easily adaptable depending on your preferences. You can 
 use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic, or GameCube controllers. Regardless of which controller 
 you use, the hedgehog sections rely on the analog stick and buttons to get by -- only sprinting requires 
 a sharp whack from your Wii Remote. In the werehog stages, you'll have to swing your arms to punch, 
 which gets exhausting after a while. Regardless, no matter which option you choose, the controls 
 are responsive.  

  Sonic Unleashed for the Wii is completely different from its high-definition counterparts, and 
 is all the stronger for it. The hedgehog's speed is captured quite well here, letting you fly through 
 levels with ease. The werehog sections are a bit too plodding, but the platforming sections are 
 still quite enjoyable. It's just a shame that you'll spend more of your time controlling the lumbering 
 werehog than the speedy hedgehog. Even if you have to endure a few too many boring werehog fights, 
 it's still worth playing through this adventure just to see Sonic sprint again.

Review:  Sonic Unleashed is great for it's running stages. It takes you back to the 90's where Sonic could 
 run really fast at speedy pate. There is no need to describe it's just classic Sonic speed. But the 
 Werhog is just a big dissapointment. Now here's the story. Sonic and Dr. Eggman are having a battle 
 as Sonic is about to kill Eggman. He then transforms Sonic into a Werhog and then he Shatters the 
 whole Earth plates. Making a creature known as the Dark Gaia come to life. As Sonic falls down to 
 Earth he meets a creature known as Chip. He said he lost his memory so Sonic agrees to help him 
 get it back. For the running stages you can move really fast like what Sonic used to be like and 
 that's awesome. Graphics are good and it just looks very detailed as well. But with the running stages 
 we get the dissapointing Werhog. They can last about almost an hour and Sonic moves to slow in them. Sonic 
 is now forced to Punch the emimeis and do some medicore platforming at a Snail's pace. Sure you 
 can level the Werhog but it's not even that fun anyway. We just run at high speed not play some 
 medicore beat'em up. Overall Sonic Unleashed is one part good game and one part dissapointment. The 
 running stages are a gaming Nirvana with very fast gameplay that takes you back to the classic 
 Sega Genesis days with very few flaws. While the Werhog is an uninspired beat'em up and I wish Sega 
 would have used it for another game not Sonic Unleashed. But still if your a die-hard Sonic fan 
 pick this one up!

Review:  The Good:
  -Superb seance of speed
  -Tight Controls
  -Awesome music
  -Mind blowing Graphics
  -Terrific Voice acting
  -Extreme Hedgehog Stages
  -Realistic Sound 
 Effects
  
  The Bad:
  -Too many Boring Werehog Stages
  -Hedgehog Stages only lasts for 4 minutes while the Werehog stages last an hour or 2
  
  I Wasn't 
 expecting much from this game, after playing Sonic and the secret rings (God it was awful) so I 
 rented it so I can see if it's good or not, but the truth is that it's really fun and it has exciting 
 hedgehog stages and I was entertained while playing the Hedgehog stages, but unfortunately, I spent 
 most of the time on the werehog stages which is fighting a bunch of enemy's endlessly which is 
 boring and not fun.
  
  Now Lets talk about the Graphics, They are FANTASTIC!!, everything is very detailed and realistic 
 and Gorgeous. I mean, They look even better than sonic the hedgehog back in 2006 and I couldn't 
 believe my eyes when I saw them (WOW!!)
  
  The Music and sound effects are just great, I can't resist listening to the music like I mean the 
 music is so kick-ass that they should make a CD of it instead of looking it up on the internet 
 and Downloading them. The sound effects are Realistic and Detailed as you would hear in real life.
 
  
  The story is about eggman collecting the chaos emerald and breaking the Planet earth apart and 
 for some reason (I don't know why) A reaction occurs to sonic that he transforms into a werehog 
 at night and back to hedgehog at daytime.
  
  The Game play Is Really fun at daytime like i said a little while ago because it's fast and it's 
 like a roller coaster (which is kick-ass) but the werehog stages just SUCK!! because like i said 
 you beat enemy's endlessly and you'll grow tired of it and start looking for another hedgehog stage 
 to entertain yourself.
  
  So I think I covered Everything in this game but it's hedgehog stages are great but most werehog 
 stages but although I think it's still worth buying and renting.

Review:  A Sonic game I had alot of high hopes for and I was expecting it to be good but it turned out the 
 same as the others dissapointing.
  
  The story starts out the evil Dr Eggman defeats Super Sonic and manages to split the planets apart. 
 He awakens Dark Gaia and Sonic ends up being a werehog and meets Chip who is annoying.
  
  The gameplay with Sonic is good nice fast amazing speed the problems are the levels don't last 
 long and you only do one full Sonic level whereas you play as the wereohg you get 3 or 4 levels 
 which are long and boring. The werehog is nothing special just seemed to be added to lengthen the 
 game out. I play a Sonic game to be one character Sonic the Hedgehog and he must have the most 
 play time in any Sonic game. The abilites for Sonic include speed boost, drift and homing attack 
 and it doesn't slow the game down and at times looks really amazing. Where as the werehog just 
 slows the pace down and it feels like you not playing a Sonic game. Sometimes it doesn't react 
 to the buttons you press. It seems its just button mashing and becomes tiresome and boring later 
 in the game that you just want to get the level over with but the annoying thing is in most parts 
 you have defeat every enemy as the werehog to progress further. Also chatting to people is annoying 
 and you can't skip cut scenes that end up long and boring.
  
  
  The game has an okay soundtrack but nothing spectacular. The Sonic sections look really nice but 
 the werehog sections don't look anywhere near as nice.
  
  It should take you at least either 10 or 20 hours to complete the game. The question is will you 
 go back and try to get all the medals. 
  
  
  Overall the game is worth renting before buying I would say. If you are a Sonic fan you will try 
 it and might like it but as a Sonic fan for 15 years I found this a dissapointment and the main 
 reason was the werehog levels are longer and the game makes you play as the werehog more than Sonic 
 and I don't really think thats what a Sonic game should be. Overall a bit of a dissapointment.

Review:  A big let down. What's with that little bird dude that follows you! But there is some good parts.
 
  
  The Good:
  You can only play as Sonic {becaThis game is not that good. What's with that little bird dude that 
 follows you! But there is some good parts.
  
  The Good:
  You can only play as Sonic [because in sonic next-gen you spent half of your time playing as other 
 characters] It's more like an original sonic game [but some parts are 3-D]
  
  There's one thing that's O. K about this game. and it's the 2 player. But I'm not stopping there. 
 We have a HUGE ways to go.
  
  The Bad:
  
  VERY disappointing. I was really let down by it, I had my hopes up REAL high. Poor controls. Bad 
 graphics [especially for Wii]
  
  So, as you can see I'm really disappointed about this game... I'll probably return it

Review:  the game is awesome. All i have heard a about this game has been good and what I have heard about 
 it is true. I think this is one of the game I have ever played. I love the theme the difference 
 is night and day. I think that is the best slogan I have ever heard. All I can say is that it is 
 a great game and that it was well deigned. All I can say seriously is that the game is awesome 
 and that it is probably one of the the best wii games
  ever made. Another thing is that it is challenging and that you can't just beat it in one day unless 
 you were up all day and night playing it.
  The game has great characters in it. The way the front cover looks makes you want to buy it the 
 minute you see it. For anybody that is reading this it is worth your money to buy this game. It 
 is my second favorite game of all time. I don't know About you but I think this was a great purchase!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 If I were you I would buy this game.

Review:  Well well sonic unlesed released like 3 months ago and i played it here is my review.
  
  controls- for this version controls are not a issue and sonic is easy to move at his top speed 
 which is good compared to the recent sonic games.
  
  difficulty- i would say its not to easy but not to hard in terms of levels the only level that 
 was stressing me out was eggman land which you can get a handle with after 5 to 6 tries.
  
  uniqueness- in this version sonic can use spin dash and home on enimes with the same button unlike 
 the other versions. 
  
  the only thing that was not that great was the wearhog but you can learn to enjoy him just don't 
 complain and you can jump to the hedgehog stages faster =D. 
  
  The only thing that this game lacks is not enough hedgehog stages and a little to short but still 
 fun to play.
  
  over all a pretty fun game the only thing i would suggest Sega to do is make a game just as sonic 
 kinda like secret rings but just sonic no gimmicks yes include characters to the story but just 
 make him playable and see what Sega could do with the game so this is jio-freed reviews signing 
 off and look out for my next one hopefully to be more improved then this one bye. have a nice day.

Review:  Sonic's rampage of terrible games seems to be on pause here. I mean, there's nothing I can complain 
 about - the graphics are quite spot-on, it controls fine and it's an awesome ride. The soundtrack 
 is tasteful and Sonic's voice doesn't drive you crazy.
  
  That's why I give Sonic a 4/4.
  
  Then here comes the werehog. Environments look quite good, but the Werehog itself is a dumb 
 idea - the platforming's boring (at times, broken) , the controls are awkward, etc. Tapping the 
 control stick twice in the same direction to dash... Isn't that something for 2D games, not 3D 
 platforming?
  
  And the soundtrack wants me to pull my hair out. You're presented at the beginning of the level 
 with some dumb four-second intro music before the tolerable sections play. But, the battle music 
 is the same between all levels - a loud, jazzy, unreasonably silly and annoying track.
  
  Since the Werehog levels are slower, and there are three acts per daytime level. Because the daytime 
 levels are so much better, I felt myself forcing my self through these levels.
  
  And Unleashed gets a 1/4, thanks to its partially effective atmosphere. At least it's not as bad 
 as Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing.
  
  Then there's the interface and the other junk they decided to throw at us. Aside from the new main 
 character, the Werehog, there's also a new "assistant" named Chip, a fairy-like character with 
 amnesia. He's another useless addition, and his voice pisses me off.
  
  Since SEGA saw this as a port from an xbox/ps3 game, the town map has also been transferred, but 
 instead of being interactive, it's a big menu. You just select highlighted areas of each village 
 to find people to talk to, and about a third of them end up with Chip telling you that nobody's 
 there. It's even more pointless than the original version, if that's possible.
  
  So the remainder of the game gets a 1/2, simply because the cutscenes have some quality to them.
 
  
  Sonic: 4/4
  Unleashed: 1/4
  Everything Else: 1/2
  Total: 6/10
  And an extra .5 for making the soundtrack half-tolerable: 6.5/10.
  
  Probably the best rating 
 I'd give to a Sonic game for a while, seeing the mess that Black Knight turned out to be. Why doesn't 
 SEGA just go back to what they originally were? Maybe make another Rez or Jet Set Radio while they're 
 at it?
  
  But right now, I guess the Daytime levels will do.

Review:  Sonic Unleashed is split into two sections, one section is played WAY more than the other. One 
 section are Sonic the Hedgehog stages, in which you speed through the level at high speeds through 
 loop-de-loops, spiringboards, dashborads, enemies, vehicles, and more. Sonic has now boosted his 
 speed limit with new moves such as Sonic Drift for sharp turns, Quick Step, which makes Sonic step 
 to the side without losing any speed, and Sonic Boost, which gives sonic a super boost while blasting 
 away everything inhis path (except for spikes) . All of his older moves are still here, such as the 
 Homing Attack, Light Dash, and the such. But what really seperates this game from the rest are 
 two things.1_New speed limits and abilities. 2_The new 3D to 2D camera changing. During the middle 
 of levels, the camera switches from behind-Sonic 3D gameplay, to beside-Sonic 2D running-sideways 
 gameplay, which allows SOnic to Wall Jump by the way. This gives the feel of the new game console 
 3D play, and also brings back the old and handheld 2D gameplay. Although with all this is in the 
 game, there is more in the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, such as skydiving, flying, and Sonic Boost 
 that lasts as long as you colloct rings to fill your boost bar, which in the Wii/PS2 version, you 
 can use Sonic Boost only a little at a time. Anyway, speeding through the levels is amazing fun! 
 Though it's not as cool as the Xbox 360/PS3 version, running thorugh the levels on Sonic's fast 
 feet never gets old, even if you've played the level a thousand times, and found all of it's different 
 pathways that lead to the end of the level, you can still run through them and have a blast! After 
 each level are a set of random missions such as collext X number of rings, or get to the finish 
 in time. Most other ones are unlockable, and some even unlock new areas in the level.
  
  The second section is the worst, and is the main flaw of Sonic Unleashed. It's called... Sonic 
 the (pauses for dramatic effect) WEREHOG!!!! (Thunder and lighting come from out of nowhere) In 
 Werehog form, Sonic grows fangs, claws, and fur. His arms grow and he gets spikes on his shoes. 
 He loses all of his speed abilities, and Sega thought that they would replace them with powerful 
 combat abilities. It didn't work. The Werehog has plenty of punches and jabs, but only two major 
 combos that deal high damage. After you unlock them, all you do is increase your health bar and 
 Unleashed bar, which makes you invincible and deal higher-damage attacks. When enemies arrive, 
 you cannot leave the area until they are defeated. Also, Sonic now has super strechy arms that 
 are used mainly for platforming by stretching out and grabbing grabbable objects, though usually, 
 even the most basic platforming become a rough challenge of survival. It`s all slow and way too 
 easy to finish a level, and takes four times longer than the sprint-to-the-finish Hedgehog levels.
 
  
  There are at least 26 Werehog stages, and only 7 Hedgehog stages, with a few missions here and 
 there. Hub worlds are boring but there are plenty of side-puzzles to help you pass the time, although 
 you have to do them mostly in Werehog form. Xbox 360 and PS3 versions are alot better and have 
 more content in them than the Wii and PS2. By the way, Sega waid they would make the game 60% Sonic 
 and 40% Werehog. Instead, they did 80% Werehog, and 20% Sonic. So my reccomendation is, if you 
 get this game get it for the PS3 or Xbox 360.
  
  Don`t blink, or you`ll end up with a Werehog...

Review:  Sonic Unleashed is a fun filled adventure through many different scenarios, before you think about 
 using ALL of your money to buy it, it is definitley worth it to read this
  
  
  
  *****STORYLINE*****
  This may be hard for many of you to believe but, Eggheads at it again, through 
 a very beautiful looking intro, he uses a magical beings power, named dark gaia, to morph our beloved 
 hedgehog into the hairy ugly being that he becomes to be at night fall. The were-hog falls out of 
 the sky and meets a... bunny.. squirrel thing named... nothing, he can't remember his name because 
 you LANDED on him, so cruel, but anyway through the tutorials you get to a town where you eat some 
 ice cream, some chocolate chip supreme, so since our little bunny friend likes it so much Sonic 
 names him Chip. The storyline is ok, you may get mixed up from time to time since it bounces between 
 Dark Gaia, Eggman, Sonic being a were-hog. Altogether its a good storyline, 6.2/10.0
  
  
  
  *******DIFFICULTY********
  The Daytime levels are amazing, its difficulty is just right, 
 from the beginning its like you would expect an amazing game, its difficulty is just right, but 
 as the night falls, the were-hog difficulty is out rageous, its like they took a jump component 
 out of mario, the fighting component out of Castlevania Lament of Innocence, and then they took 
 a WILD **** on it. The difficulty is cruel, levelling up is very hard unlike a good rpg game. You 
 will die an amazing number of times just because of how insane this can be, its like this. You 
 walk into an area, BRAWL, go over a bridge, BRAWL, jump a ledge, MINI BOSS BATTLE, beat the boss 
 BRAWL exit the level. And that's just a short summary.
  The difficulty with sonic is good but the were-hog is bad so I will split the two difficulties
 
  Daytime Difficulty: Excellent 9.0/10.0
  Nighttime Difficulty: Frustrating 4.6/10.0
  
  ***********CONTROLS*********
  Many people will favor the Daytime controls, running through levels 
 faster than ever before, Drifting and Sidesteps are welcome additions, with these new abilities 
 it is possible to run and never ever stop with enough practice, but the exact opposite is true 
 for the were-hog.
  The were-hog is all about slow clunky controlling. Many times you will press the control stick 
 forward to dash but you end up doing nothing at all. Wall Straddeling can be frustrating and climbing 
 up from hanging off a ledge will at least make you die twice in this game GUARENTEED. And don't 
 get me started on the fighting, if you play with the gamecube controller you will have a migraine 
 from the sound of your R and L buttons clicking so much so loud, you will think about buying a 
 silencer for them.
  Daytime Controls: 10.0/10.0
  Nighttime controls: 2.5/10.0
  
  
  ***********SOUNDS AND MUSIC*************
  
  The games soundtracks are amazing, each soundtrack 
 fits perfectly with the stage provided, Holoska (an ice stage) has a chilling rock soundtrack which 
 definitley gets you interested, even the nighttime levels which I have been insulting are well 
 composed. Shamar (the desert stage) at night as very nice arabian music to fit the mood. The voice 
 works are done perfectly, Sonic sounds better than ever, and the were-hog sounds exactly like you 
 would think a giant raging wolf/ beast thing would sound like. Gorgeous soundtracks will steal 
 your heart. And not to mention the games main theme Endless Possibilities which makes you want to 
 listen to it over and over again.
  Soundtrack: 10.5/10.0
  
  **********OVERALL*******
  
  Overall I think you should rent this game before you buy it, it might be just right for some 
 users but it might be just the wrong thing for others, if you can brave the night time levels you 
 will absoloutely adore the day time levels, I give Sonic Unleahsed for the Wii:

Review:  The good: Sega actually didn't screw up Sonic, Better than Sonic 06, great graphics and music, 
 fun daytime levels.
  The bad: Boring werehog levels.
  
  Gameplay: 7/10
  Graphics: 10/10
  Sound: 10/10
  Value: 8/10
  Tilt: 7/10
  Average Score: 8.4/10
  
  Sonic 
 Unleashed has Sonic being violently ripped to shreds by eggman (who should've gotten killed in 
 Shadow the Hedgehog) , and a beam from outher space (Eggman) causes the planet to divide into seven 
 pieces. Worse, Sonic has somehow turned into a werehog at night. So when he wants to makeout with 
 amy, she's going to see fangs come up her mouth (teeth, you know what I mean) .
  
  Sonic Unleashed is, in fact, a great idea. The intro plot is genius. Sega actually took their time 
 trying to make the game unbroken compared to Sonic '06. Although the werehog levels are tedious 
 and unnecessary, the rest are enough to prove how fun this game is.
  
  At daytime, you'll be fast but small Sonic. Sonic's daytime levels are a blast. The level design 
 is much better than the X Box 360 and PS3 versions, it is not confusing and/or tedious. The backgrounds 
 are beautiful and colorful. They provide a lot to wow for. 
  
  At Night, you'll become Sonic the werehog, a rediculiously slow but beastly baller. Unlike Sonic, 
 the werehog is slow, and, not, very, fun. You can at least stretch out your arms to get tp stuff 
 sonic couldn't do. The pain is that there are more werehog levels than daytime levels. Had their 
 been a lot more daytime levels, the werehog levels could've been a minor problem.
  
  Graphically, it's a beautiful and flawless display. The soundtrack, which is orchestrail, is beautifully 
 composed and an improvement to the stupid rock songs that are apparently Sega's favortite kind 
 of music.
  
  Overall, if not for the werehog levels, Sonic Unleashed could've been a flawless game. Although 
 this is the case; Sonic Unleashed is like a rollercoaster; it's a thrill worth the wait, but it's 
 werehog levels could shorten the line. Never the less, I am willing to go on this roller coaster 
 multiple times.

Review:  Well fans let's face the facts: Sonic's more recent 3D ventures have been craptacular adventures 
 with loose controls, horrendous cameras, glitches aplenty and overall no effort put into these 
 once classic gems. Heck even Sonic's voice actor Jason Griffith, could've put more effort into 
 that voce of his. It looked as though Sonic's future was bleak.
  
  Up until this point...
  
  Enter Sonic Unleashed, a surprisingly solid, fun and addicting game 
 that fires on all cylinders. It's fast, insane, and overall, an improvement from past 3D Sonic 
 titles...
  
  Gameplay and Control 8.5/10
  The gameplay is split into two parts: Daytime, where you control the speedy Sonic, and Nighttime 
 stages in which you play as the fist-a-cuff fighting werehog. Well Sega it's ABOUT TIME. You apparently 
 got the message that speed is what most of us fans want from a Sonic title. Not only that but you 
 decide to implement a 2D perspective to some sections of the daytime segments, whihc brought me 
 back to my days of sitting down and playing Sonic 3 on my genesis for hours on end. Indeed, Sonic 
 Unleashed's daytime stages are the icing on the cake. They're highly enjoyable with tons of speed. 
 The nighttime stages were actually... mildly enjoyable. I know there's more werehog stages than 
 daytime stages, but thankfully you can clear them in about 5-10 minutes tops. There are three different 
 controls hat will suit any player: The Wiimote and Nunchuck, the classic controller or the GC controller. 
 Each one has tight controls, handling Sonic has never been so easy. Whereareas in previous ventures, 
 I'd be slipping and sliding all over the place in games like Sonic '06 (shudders at the memory) , 
 Unleashed's controls found me handling turns and running like a dream. Though it's recommended 
 you use a classic controller if you have one, since the boost and homing attack are initiated to 
 two different buttons (Note that for the wiimote and nunchuck, the boost and homing attack are 
 set to shaking the wiimote which could lead to accidentally boosting when you wanted to home in 
 on the enemy, the GC controller just feels so unnatural, though it isn't a terrible choice, neither 
 is the nunchuck.) Either way Unleashed is a blast to play.
  
  Sound 8.0/10
  The music in this game is amazing! I was honestly starting to get sick of the rock soundtrack that 
 Sonic had and this was a nice departure from it. Not only was it original and catchy, but it made 
 it feel more like I was playing a 3D megadrive game than a Wii game, really it's that good. The 
 VA... FINALLY. It's actually bearable! Jason Griffith you finally learned from your many scoldings 
 from fans that you need to improve your voice acting or suffer our wrath and it shows. He no longer 
 sounds annoying, he sounds good... GOOD for pete's sake! Mike Pollock gave the performance of his 
 career as Dr. Eggman, I loved it better than any other Sonic game he was in. Everyone improved greatly... However 
 there's always ONE terrible voice actor in our midst... Chip. He's a likeable character, but Tony 
 Salerno was not a good choice of voice actor for him. Overall though great job.
  
  Graphics 7.5/10
  The graphics are colorful and pretty. Sonic himself has his old school look 
 back: The classic smile that I've been missing from his Genesis days can be seen on his face throughout 
 daytime stages. The FMVs are GORGEOUS. It should be noted the 360 version's ingame cutscenes are 
 considered FMVs in the Wii version (The fact these cutscenes can run so smoothly on the Wii is 
 rather amazing) . The REAL FMVs are even better, possibly rivalling a Pixar film. This is some of 
 the best graphics for a Wii Sonic game I've seen to date.
  
  Replay value 7.5/10
  The ranking system from past Sonic games return. For daytime stages, getting an S-rank involves 
 beating the clock in a fast-paced race to the goal, and Werehog segments involve doing three things: 
 Collect rings, defeat enemies, AND beat the alotted time. All these will give you 1-3 Sun or Moon 
 medals depending on the rank. If you get a C rank, no medal for you... that's where the replay value 
 comes in. You may not do so well your first time through, but then you come back later to get a 
 better rank. Simple enough right? There's more to it. Littered across the various stages are special 
 items. They vary from concept art, music, movies and secret documents which reveal the location 
 of items you may have missed... Collecting them all is a chore. There's also secret doors within 
 the Gaia gate that reveal puzzles where you'll earn secret missions and bonus lives. In other words, 
 SU's replay value is rather massive. However, a skilled collect-a-holic platformer can probably 
 grab everything in a matter of days... yep, I'm dead serious, it's actually rather easy.
  
  Overall score 8.5/10
  Really SU on the Wii is a superb game. It certainly beats the other Sonic 
 3D ventures and is the best one since SA2 hands down. If you're looking for a good, fun Sonic game 
 that brings you back to your heyday, look no further than Sonic Unleashed.
  
  Good: Fun daytime segments, mildly enjoyable nighttime segments, tons of replay value, gorgeous 
 cutscenes and good graphics
  
  Bad: I wish there were more daytime stages, collect-a-holic platform gamers will destory this game 
 in days, could've been a bit longer now that I think about it...

Review:  There was a time when the trailers and gameplay videos for this game were first coming out and 
 I am not going to lie I really liked the way it looked. But I am sure like a good amount of people 
 out there when they saw the Werehogmanthing for the first time they were just a little worried. 
 Never the less when this game out I ran over to Blockbuster and I rented myself a copy.
  
  Sonic Unleashed definitely had some promise when I got to play the first level of the game, it 
 was fast paced and it was definitely fun. The one thing I did however notice right away was the 
 fact that the cinematic and voice overs were pretty awful. But if you are playing a Sonic game 
 for either of those.. Well then you definitely are lost.
  
  Now after the first level was over I got to play another daytime level which was also fun. This 
 is where things started to really go weird for me. The nighttime levels play like a broken God 
 of war clone with an obsession of breaking purple gems and beating up the same enemies with no 
 variation of moves whatsoever. So I went through the level praying that this would be over soon, 
 and you know the gameplay is bad when you are actually looking forward to getting back to the map 
 screen. So the level ended and I was excited! Well to my horror I had to play 3 more straight levels 
 of this garbage, I mean Sonic Team I know you are excited about this new gameplay mechanic but 
 don't shove it down our throats so hard.
  
  Now the from what I have heard the map in the PS3 and Xbox360 versions are not Text based. I really 
 feel sorry for you if that is true, because the text base is painful enough with all of the useless 
 backtracking through screens with ugly drawn humans. But it gets the job done, I just do not see 
 the point of including this in a Sonic game
  
  The sound is almost what you should come to expect out of a sonic game by now, its not very good 
 anymore but thats what mute is for. The Voice acting is also pretty awful but again, its to be 
 expected. It is at least better than Sonic X.
  
  Over all I did not hate Sonic Unleashed, The Day time levels were a blast to play and I really 
 enjoyed myself. But the Nighttime levels were just awful, and they actually made me want to quit. 
 But the Daytime levels made me keep playing until the very end. Overall I would say rent it if 
 you can find it, because it is definitely not worth the purchase.

Review:  When i first played it i liked it. The grapics are good. Never play werewolf sonic with the wii 
 remote. You will not like it. But anyway i will tell you about it. I was hoping it was at least 
 two players but i was wrong. so -5. werewolf sonic is good but you just keep fighting and fighting 
 and fighting. so -5. Its addictive because you can go super fast with sonic and you can go back 
 to get ranks and stuff. You go all around the world. The ice stage reminds me of sonic dx (gc) which 
 is fun. Sonic and the secret rings is no where close to how good this sonic game is. Its the best 
 in the series. so if you want to rent, i not going to judge you, rent it. But i will worn you Do 
 not play with the wii remote when you are playing as werewolf sonic. play with a gc controller. 
 But if i were you i would so buy this game. Go to videos and pictures. But you need to buy it. 
 It is so worth its money. So go out and buy it. Another thing is that when you play you have to 
 go to the missions and it might confuse you for a while. Buy it.

Review:  Ever since the release of Sonic Heroes, the Sonic franchise, especially the 3D games, have gone 
 into a downward spiral, even though there are still a lot of people who like the poorly reviewed 
 games like Sonic the Hedgehog '06 and Shadow the Hedgehog, the corporate reviewers are the ones 
 who are counted in the games reception. But Sonic has begun a climb to success, begging with Secret 
 Rings, this game proves to be better, faster, and a whole lot easier than Secret Rings, with a 
 lot better controls too. While this game does have it's more than fair share of good things, it 
 does have some bad points too, such as the where-hog levels Wii controls, which may make your arm 
 exhausted after a while. And the fact that in where-hog levels there are some frame rate drop issues 
 here and there. The most praised things about this game are the faster than ever hedgehog levels, 
 and the flawless 3D-2D transitions. Overall, if you are a Sonic fan, or just like video games, 
 Sonic Unleashed for the Wii is a must buy. 
  *EDIT* Changed the review a little, now it's unless your Idea of a good game is a nearly impossible 
 experience of trial and error, stay away from the PS360 versions, get the Wii version! read more 
 in the future Sonic Unleashed 360 review.

Review:  I remember back maybe a year or a year and a half ago when the first details of this game came 
 about. Needless to say I was not impressed by the details. The game in detail seemed to lack any 
 fore thought, a werehog? Come on! However when the game was released I found it to be quite different, 
 amazingly everything came together quite well.
  
  The base story line didn't make much sense, but honestly I wasn't really looking for a good story 
 when I asked for this game for Christmas. All you need to know is you are about to defeat robotnik 
 when something goes wrong and sonic is launched to earth where it is broken into 7 pieces. In doing 
 so you seemingly fell on a poor lad named Chip who can't remember anything about himself, at the 
 same time you turn into a "werehog" at night.
  
  Anyways, forget all that it doesn't matter. The games sonic levels are stunningly reminiscent of 
 the original sonic games, at points I felt a bit nostalgic. You'll usually just run through the 
 levels collecting rings to stay alive and use a boost to finish the level faster, on occasions 
 you'll do a ring collection stage where you collect a certain amount of rings to move on and other 
 times it'll be more time attack. All in all, the levels are fast, fun and interesting to play. 
 
  
  After you are done with the sonic levels you usually move onto the "werehog" levels, and I played 
 the 360/PS3 version prior to the wii version so needless to say I figured I would be disappointed, 
 but everything turned out better than expected. The controls were easy to learn obviously, and 
 there are plenty of enemies to smack around. The stages usually finish up with a "grand finale" 
 style fight where you take on about 20 enemies or so to really rack up those skill points.
  
  The stages mesh a lot better than expected. While the regular sonic stages are great, the werehog 
 stages are a great way to break up the action.
  
  The bosses are a bit of a split, some you'll fight in werehog form and others you'll fight as sonic. 
 All the boss fights are fought in different ways and they are a whole lot of fun to watch and play. 
 
  
  The sound is pretty good, it would have been nice if the wii was equipped with optical so you could 
 experience true surround sound, but its not like this game has many gigantic explosions or war 
 zones to really require it, all in all the sound is good.
  
  The graphics for a wii game were quite well done. There will be edges I think could have been more 
 rounded and some textures that I think could have been better, but honestly I don't expect the 
 best graphics in any wii game. 
  
  All in all this wasn't the most perfect sonic game, but this definitely put sonic back on the map 
 for me. Sega seems to be making more of an effort to revamp their image, lets hope they keep it 
 up with more games like Sonic: Unleashed.
  
  Buy it.

Review:  Now you are proboaly wondering why I am doing another review for this game. If you have seen my 
 Xbox review, then I'm sorry. I wrote the wrong thing. Now I'm doing a proper review of it. 
  
  Anyway, the game starts in a space battle on eggman's ship. Sonic is lured into Eggman's most 
 devious trap yet, turns into a werehog at night, loses the power of the chaos emeralds and Eggman 
 splits the world into 7 continents, and unleashes a plague upon the planet to build eggmanland 
 once and for all.
  
  Day Stages:
  Day stages are a whopper. They have good speed, nice environments and the new boost guage. Now 
 I love this. Ever thought of trying to get the magical S rank? They have finally given you a chance. 
 But the bad thing: While boosting, you need to make sure the screen is lined up with the direction 
 you want to go, or bon voyage. Also, turning has been made easy, but wall jumping? SEGA, this is 
 your saddest attempt yet to make sonic look like mario.
  
  Night Stages:
  This is one of the badder bits. Night is okay, but combat sections can get a bit annoying and you 
 sometimes have dangers of falling of edges while dashing or dash jumping which can get frustrating. 
 Enemies aren't that easy though. Big bosses like titan a big mother (Not stage bosses) can deal 
 a lot of pain in a few seconds before you get away. But the good bit is you can get a break from 
 all that speed, and control yourself more easy.
  
  Other things:
  Gaia gates are a new way of going through stages, but I thought you can go on a course through 
 the village of each place. Cutscenes are beautiful, making it still like the Xbox 360 and PS3. 
 But 1 major diffrence: The time of day goes manually.
  
  What do I think?
  Although night stages are a bit sad, you can still pass them and feel good. And with over 30+ stages, 
 you would be playing this for over a month. Sonic fans will still enjoy this.

Review:  I rented Sonic Unleashed for the Wii, and the first 10 minutes I tested it, was far too long. Sonic 
 got transformed into a werewolf from a machine? Overated.
  
  Learning how to control sonic, is time consuming. He goes to fast, and even if you use the slide 
 dash control he still goes everywhere, unless you keep practicing. The best part about games is 
 learning the controls in an instant and from there you know how to play. That is not how Sonic 
 unleashed came acrossed in my opinion. 
  
  If you think this is a adventure game, think again. Its more like a racing game then anything. 
 It's just not Sonic the hedgehog. Developers love to take thier old games even further and turn 
 them into a generic 3d atmosphere with a bad storyline and false advertisment for labeling this 
 an adventure game. 
  
  Dont buy it. Rent it.

Review:  This is a really good Sonic game that gets a lot of hate it doesn't deserve. I had wanted this 
 game for quite a while and I was happy when I got it. The graphics are pretty good and the different 
 environments look amazing. The game has a great soundtrack like most Sonic games do. There are 
 exciting boss fights, both in Hedgehog and Werehog form. I find it fun to use the werehog, so night 
 stages are good. The combat does get a bit repetitive but besides that it is very fun. The day 
 stages are quite good as well and fans of the classic Sonic games will love them. There are seven 
 continents that Sonic must travel around to and help put back into place. Each continent has a 
 part of it that will be played in the daytime as Sonic and a nighttime part that will be played 
 as the Werehog. To do well in daytime stages, you must reach the goal as fast as you can, while 
 in nighttime stages, it depends on your time, the number of rings you collect and the amount of 
 Gaia force you get as well. Overall, I believe this game is very sound and is a great addition to 
 anyone's games.

Review:  The hedgehog levels are very fast. Without good reaction time, you will never get an S rank. The 
 faster you finish the level, the more metals you win. During the level, you will be running between 
 100mph to mach speed. You try seeing where you are going when you are running at that speed. Braking 
 is also a problem for Sonic; you will slide around before you completely stop. But if you use that 
 to your advantage, you can turn corners without losing speed. Remember, speed is important in these 
 levels. When you collect rings, you get a larger boost gauge. When you have a filled up boost gauge, 
 you can make a sonic boom, which will deplete some of the boost gauge to give you a huge increase 
 in speed. Sonic booms can destroy robots and harm bosses. You also have the ring dash and homing 
 attacks.
  
  The werehog levels are obviously slower. It involves finding gaia force (red orbs) , rings and finishing 
 the level on time. If you complete all three, you get all three metals. But say you don't make 
 it in time to get that last metal, replay the level and finish it in a short amount of time. You 
 don't need rings or gaia force orbs because you already done that. Werehog levels have a small 
 rpg element to them, for the more foes you defeat, the stronger you get. Though the constant beat 
 em ups and finding hidden objects can get boring, which is the negative part of the game.
  
  The songs, like all other sonic songs, are very impressive. Each level has the perfect song 
 to fit it. Though some songs are better than others. However, most, if not all songs have no lyrics.
 
  
  There are going to be new characters, but two look like they might be in future games. Professor 
 Pickle is a scientist who is so smart that Eggman fears his intelligence, though all he thinks 
 about is pickles and cucumbers. Next is Egro, a ball like robot who assists Eggman by informing 
 him on what is happening. However, Egro always tells the truth, so when Eggman is being an pathetic 
 idiot, he reminds him just that.
  
  Also, don't forget Chip, who is the omochao of the game. I don't want to give away more info about 
 him. However, there is a main villain called Dark Gaia, who seems to be an evil deity living under 
 the earth.
  
  I do not know why this game has an E10 rating. There is minimal swearing, if any. The rating system 
 mentions animated blood if there is any blood in the game, it isn't red or noticeable.
  
  This game is also the most recent Sonic game that has less than 10 main characters Knuckles and 
 Shadow do not appear in this game. Tails, Amy Eggman and Sonic are the only main characters that 
 were in previous games This story clearly focuses on Sonic and barely focuses on anyone else. 
 However, remember Tail's orange plane, the Tornado? Apparently, he still has it and will be using 
 it in this game.
  
  I must warn all wii owners, like other 3rd party games, the wii version is the worst. It's not 
 the graphics anyone should worry about; it's the lack of levels. In the Wii version, there are 
 7 countries plus a boss battle in another country. This country is based off of Africa and the 
 boss battle is the only level in the wii version, but it has about 10 levels in the PS3 and Xbox 
 version. The PS3 and Xbox also have another country left out of the wii version, a New York like 
 city. This means that PS3 and Xbox have about 20 more levels than the wii version. Also, the Wii 
 bosses are less complex and maybe even easier than the Xbox and PS3 versions.
  
  If you only have a wii, this game is worth the buy if you are a sonic fan. Apparently, the Xbox 
 and PS3 have more levels, but are not worth the buy compared to other Xbox and PS3 games.
  
  The Sonic levels prove that Sonic games might be getting better than before The Werehog levels 
 prove that whatever caused the Sonic games to become from famous to terrible is still scaring 
 Sonic's reputation, possibly for more years to come

Review:  Ok, well, I finally got my hands on this game. I must say, it is much better than expected. Anyways, 
 I'll leave the details down below as usual.
  
  The Good:
  The daytime levels capture a bit of the old and the new; they truly have an awesome feel to them 
 as you're running at high-speed with numerous routes and secrets on each stage. Though most of 
 the time the game is in 3D, there are small sections of 2-D gameplay in the levels that bring you 
 back. These transitions are smooth and well-done. The boss fights have the same kind of nice, epic 
 feel to them as well. The controls for the game are also-well done, and feel fluent and natural. 
 The graphics are well-done, and the stages have a very pleasing look.
  
  The Bad:
  Although the night time levels are a refreshing twist and are fun at first, by the end of the game 
 with a roughly 3:1 night to day level ratio, you'll be trying to cut through the night stages just 
 to reach the daytime levels (unless you're weird) . It's not so much that the levels aren't fun 
 or well-designed, but there's a definite lack in variety. The platforming on these levels can also 
 be tedious or frustrating. The dialogue and such are also written at the level of a five-year-old; 
 and to add to your misery, you can't skip the cutscenes to get on with playing.
  
  Overall, the game is highly enjoyable, but I still don't think that it has reached a level of awesomeness 
 that the old ones did. If they made a new Sonic game that had all levels like the daytime ones, 
 however... this game would pretty much be a perfect 10.

Review:  It's very hard nowadays to find someone who has no clue who the hell SONIC THE HEDGEHOG really 
 is. New gamers now would probably either know of him from Super Smash Bros. Brawl or Mario and 
 Sonic at the Olympics. Older gamers would remember the amount of times they spent navigating the 
 classic 2D games on the Sega Genesis (even though I had never played a game of Sonic until now) .
 
  
  But after that, Sonic's move to 3D has had a lot of rocky bumps to them, especially Sonic 2006. 
 Yet that hasn't stopped Sega for creating another Sonic game which has a lot of Sonic fanboys whining 
 (as if that's anything new) .
  
  Sonic Unleashed provided a brand new aspect to the franchise: the Werehog. Pretty much, when the 
 sun sets and the moon rises, Sonic turns into a werewolf version of himself. And you would HAVE 
 to get used to it since the game has a lot of werehog stages. Don't worry, Sonic Unleashed still 
 provides the fast-paced action that made him famous to begin with. Too bad they aren't enough of 
 them in the game to satisfy your taste.
  
  Though, what I like about the game is the combination of classic Sonic and beat-em-up scrolling. 
 The game is still easy to me yet obtaining S-ranks can be challenging.
  
  In all honesty, I don't get what Sonic fanboys are whining about. They finally got a decent game 
 out of their beloved Sega mascot, yet it doesn't have what they want so they complain. Some Sonic 
 fans I can understand their displeasure in the game, mostly due to the amount of night stages which 
 I agree with. They should have split the stages 50/50 instead of spending more time on the night 
 stages. Going from blinding speeds to snail pace is a nuisance at times, that part is agreeable. 
 Everything else that fanboys complain about, no.
  
  Sonic Unleashed is still a good game, underrated by many and what not. Give it a rental before 
 buying and making yourself disappointed at the same time.

Review:  The Good:
  
  Speed Missions Rule!- The speed missions are amazing. The creativity, the music, everything*! They 
 are truly the game's most redeeming qualities.
  Were-hog is not that bad: Just because it's by Sega and it isn't "Sonic" doesn't automatically 
 make it suck. Sega has other ideas other than Sonic you know.
  
  *See camera
  
  The Bad:
  Plot: I have to confess. I do not like what I've seen of the story-line thus far. It 
 is by far one of the lamer game ideas I've ever seen. However, this doesn't mean it can't be a 
 good game.
  Acrobatics in Were-hog: There are times during the Were-hog missions when I want to damn them. 
 We all know what I'm talking about, acrobatics. Whether it be swinging, climbing, or all those 
 in between, attempting acrobatic stunts while a Were-hog instead of just bashing things is certainly 
 a challenge sometimes.
  Camera: This is where, in my experience, most Sonic games, no matter how good in other areas, lack. 
 In missions throughout the game, Sonic as well as Were-hog (Though more common in Were-hog due 
 to the format, action vs. speed) , the auto-only camera can sometimes put you between a rock and 
 a hard place. However, for me, it has become a very familiar trademark of Sonic games and I have 
 begun to see it as an endearing quality
  
  Summary: This game is highly under-appreciated by those who call themselves fans. It is a good 
 game, but definitely not all it could have been. I am happy to have bought it, no matter what others 
 say. I would recommend to fans, but not to newcomers as it is very like to turn you off forever. 
 Sega, I appreciate your effort in making the game, but do it again and I'm highly likely to kill 
 somebody.

Review:  Sonic Unleashed is the latest addition to the Sonic franchise and honestly it could have been a 
 better game that it is. For all the people who played the original Sonic they wont be dissapointed 
 to know that the Hedgehog levels are by far the best in the 3d sonic games, the speed is great 
 and the graphics by Wii standard are gorgeous, also the speed boost is perfect for add more speed 
 to the hedgehog, the badside is that there arent alot of Hedgehog stages. Now if the Sonic Team 
 just had left the Hedgehog stages then this game would have been fine but no, they added the tedious 
 and mindless Werehog stages. Now why the werehog stages are so bad?. Well, the first reason is 
 that the battles are pretty stupid, you just have to move the wiimote and nunchuck and see how 
 the enemies die, also sometimes the controls arent so great and you will fall sometimes, oh by 
 the way you lose the speed that you have in the hedgehog stages.
  Now on the story, it is interesting will the whole dark gaia business but the new sidekick of Sonic, 
 Chip is kind of lame, at least they could have given him a better story, at least only Amy and 
 Tails appear in this game and of course Dr. Robotnick (refuse to call him Eggman) . 
  The music is bad, pretty bad perhaps except the orchestral version of Endless possibilites, believe 
 me the werehog fight music is bad and you have to listen always when you fight except with the 
 big guys.
  The final words will be that Sonic Unleashed is fun with the Hedgehog stages and bad with the Werehog 
 stages, bosses are kind of easy except the last one.

Review:  Let me just say that after playing "Sonic Next Gen" I think I have lowered my standards when it 
 comes to Sonic. In a weird way it's just better to be pessimisstic then if the game is good, then 
 great and if it's bad then you get the satisfaction of knowning you're smarter than a fanboy which 
 isn't hard though.
  
  
  Sonic Unleashed was Sega's newest attempt to "reinvent" Sonic and help correct mistakes of old 
 and much like "Secret Rings" before it, It makes two steps forward but one step back. After reading 
 IGN's warning article about the Wii version vs. the 360 version, I'm rather glad I decided to go 
 with the Wii version (though I may eventually rent the 360 version) . The Wii/PS2 version was made 
 by Dimps who of course made the excellent Sonic Rush series and when you can see the Sonic Rush 
 influence in this title.
  
  
  The story compared to past games, is a bit more stripped down. No more angsty emo hedgehog babbling 
 on about his tragic past and no more cross species love story. This time Eggman's newest plan involves 
 him blowing the world into pieces and releasing dark Gaia energy across the planet. Sonic shows 
 up at his space station to smash things up as he does and the opening scene is excellent. It just 
 would've been nice to have been able to PLAY this as a level. Don't you hate it when cutscenes 
 hog all the fun? Sonic smashes some robots, gets caught, turns into Super Sonic and when just when 
 Sonic thinks he's won, Eggman traps him in a machine that extracts the emeralds from Sonic, drains 
 their power in order to fire his Death Star like cannon. This defeat of Super Sonic causes the 
 werehog transformation. Sonic this time sets out to restore the Chaos Emeralds power and put the 
 Earth back together and cure himself.
  
  
  Despite the whole Dark Gaia thing the story does return to a more lighthearted feel no longer taking 
 itself so seriously like some bad anime. Also Sega finally got it through their heads that us old 
 school fans don't give a sh -- about every little furry Sonic friend. Shadow, Rouge and the rest 
 of the Care Bear colored carboard cutouts sit out this time. Only Tails and Amy appear as part 
 of the story though we are still force fed another useless new character in the form of Chip, who 
 is apparently the love child of Navi and a Chiuauah, though I feared he'd have a whiny high pitched 
 voice like Charmy or Bokun (Sonic X) , his voice is tolerable. Chip has lost his memory and Sonic, 
 being the nice guy he is offers to help.
  
  
  First of all, the part that Sega finally gets right is that this game has some of the best high 
 speed platforming stages to date. Finally playing Sonic in 3D feels right and fun. The camera stays 
 behind him. The controls are tight. When I nudge the left analog stick slightly to the left, Sonic 
 moves slightly to the left instead of kareening left off a cliff. Also moves like drifting, boosting 
 and quick step help to keep things going. The day stages are full of dash pads, bumpers, and multiple 
 paths and have nearly endless replay value. One thing that helps as well is this transistion between 
 3D and 2D because Sonic's always done best in 2D. The game even gives you a target time to get 
 the S rank. Honestly if Sega could do an entire game of this, we'd finally have the great 3D Sonic 
 game we old school fans dream of.
  
  
  However Sega has this crippling fear of if they just make a game with Sonic running fast it will 
 be too short so they had to throw in some "filler." In between stages you have to visit a village, 
 but unlike it's HD counterparts, it's more like the island in Sonic Rush Adventure. Select a location, 
 talk to someone, get an item then head to the Gaia Gate to open the next level. No aimlessly wandering 
 around a hub world.
  
  
  Now comes the werehog, Sonic's night form. Now I wasn't thrilled with this idea but it's not that 
 bad, but I could've done without it. Sonic's larger, slower form plays like Crash Bandicoot. Linear 
 platforming mixed in with mindless beat-em-up action. Honestly I liked the platforming though Sonic 
 doesn't handle as tightly as Mario and let's face it, there aren't a lot of decent 3D platformers 
 these days at least not based on a kid's cartoon. You run, jump, climb and every so often you have 
 to stop and take out some dark Gaia baddies. Using the Wii controls to punch and smash was fun 
 for me though I got annoyed with the fixed camera which wouldn't let me spin around to get a better 
 angle on things of course if you get tired of flailing, you can always switch to the Gamecube controller.
 
  
  
  The biggest complaint with the game is it would've been nice to have more Sonic levels because 
 not only do the werehog levels take longer, there seem to be more full levels with it as well.
 
  
  
  That aside though the graphics are excellent for a Wii third party game. Despite not having a "hedgehog 
 engine" the Wii stages are all well done with a lot of detail and compared to Next Gen, is nearly 
 free of the bugs and glitches. The music is also excellent. Gone is the Crush 40 butt rock of past 
 games replaced with tunes more reminscent of the Genesis era.
  
  
  In the end I still have had fun with Sonic Unleashed. It could still be way better and Sega still 
 needs to get it through their skulls that if they take the day stages from this and just make a 
 game with that, we'd all be happy.

Review:  This Sonic Game features a good sense of speed (for once) . But unlike it's 360/PS3 counterparts, 
 it SUCKS. First it may seem cool. But soon you will realise that there is a darker side to sonic, 
 The Werehog! The Werehog isn't awful, but his stages are too long, and the controls are unresponsive 
 at times (The control stick isn't responsive enough and to navigate tight spots you'll have to 
 tap it, which sends you flying over the edge in a dash) , and the combat is ****. All you have to 
 do is mash 2 buttons over and over again, you can pull off moves but the AI is so bad that there 
 is no point. The graphics are a slight update from the PS2 but not worth the extra cash. But the 
 worst thing about this version over the PS3/360 is that there are 25 full werehog levels and 8 
 full daytime levels (7 if you don't count a compilation of the tutorials to create a 1 minute level) . 
 This means that you will play the Day 25% of the time right? No, because the werehog levels are 
 longer then the day and most of the collectable items are in the night stages as well. So in the 
 end you'll end up playing the day about 15% of the time and the Night 85% of the time. The 360 
 has about 45% day and 55% night. Get 360 not Wii.

Review:  Sonic unleashed is a fun, fast good quality game for the wii. The story starts with sonic infiltrating 
 eggmans ships and destroying them. Eggman leads sonic into a trap, sucking the chaos emeralds out 
 of super sonic, firing a beam down to earth causing the world to break and turning sonic into a 
 werehog. sonic falls out of the ship and towards earth and the adventure begins.
  
  The gameplay in sonic unleashed is divided into two parts, Daytime levels and Nighttime levels. 
 The daytime levels will have you controlling sonic at a highspeed pace, while the nighttime levels 
 will have you controling werewolf sonic at a much slower pace.
  Controling sonic in the daytime levels are a load of fun you could go real fast, drift and battle 
 an occasional boss without slowing down. You could shift side to side real fast without slowing 
 down, drifting is alot of fun too for you could make a sharp turn without stopping. And for each 
 drift you do you get a drift bonus and your speedbosst meter will fill up. The controls for the 
 game are easy and youll have them down in no time. I reccomend using a gamecube controller for 
 the game. Day time levels will shift to 3D gameplay to 2D gameplay making the game alot more enjoyable 
 and fun.
  Nighttime levels arent as bad as people say. Werewolf sonic's controls are easy, but he could be 
 a little hard to control at times. Nighttime levels will involve combat and some minor puzzle solving. 
 Night time level are actually pretty cool since you could explore around and find unlockables for 
 your 
  extras. 
  The graphics in this game are AMAZING its one of the best wii looking titles out there. The buildings, 
 landscpaes, water, and sonic look AWESOME. This game has like 90% better graphics than sonic and 
 the secret rings.
  The sound track in the game is really cool and enjoyable. The night time levels also have cool 
 smooth music.
  
  This is one of the best wii titles out there and this is definitley sonic at his best. I reccomend 
 this game to any wii owner an definitely to any sonic fan.

Review:  Sonic games used to be a lot better (remember Sonic 2: Battle?) but they ran out of ideas. What's 
 this; Sonic riders?! Sonic and the Secret Rings?? I'm not saying it's easy to find ideas for a 
 game series that has been around for while, but I'm sure they could have done something a bit more 
 understandable and worthy.
  First of all, lets talk about the characters. Okay i know there are some of the old characters 
 in it and that's good, but seriously, Werehog sonic? that's stupid. And this stupid little weird 
 flying thing that follows you around in search of his memory, that's also dumb. That is NOT what 
 would be in a good sonic game and who cares about him, i want to have a real sonic game story. 
 Also, you have to be Werehog a lot. I HATE that! I don't want to be a stupid werehog, i want to 
 be the super-fast sonic with intense game play (and i do admit the real sonic levels are pretty 
 fun) . Werehog is stupid, hard to control and hard to aim at enemies.
  Okay now i have one last thing to say, and it's my least favorite part of the game; You have to 
 collect moon medals and sun medals to advance to the next levels. What ever happened to level after 
 level and mini movies in between?!!?! I can't stand games like that!!
  
  That is pretty much what i hate about it, i don't find the music THAT bad and the graphics are 
 pretty good but i really don't think it's worth buying, I even regret renting it! And this is all 
 just my opinion so if you really like it that much then go ahead, buy it, but i'm sure it will 
 get boring after beating it.

Review:  It's no surprise that sonic games up till Sonic Unleashed have either been okay or sucky ass and 
 we all know how Sonic next gen turned out. With Sonic Unleashed out I really think that Sega are 
 bringing Sonic back to full form in the way we all remembered him but let's go back abit when Sonic 
 Unleashed was still in production the stupid fanbrats of the Sonic fanbase didn't take long to 
 say "THIS GAME IS GONNA SUCK!!!" The obvious reason? The werehog ofcourse. I won't lie to you guys 
 I did think that the werehog idea for Sonic wasn't going to work but looking at it now I think 
 the werehog is cool but enough talk about the werehog onto the game already.
  
  Story:
  
  In this story Dr Eggman is on his fleet of battleships, Sonic then battles the bloated villain 
 in combat forcing Sonic to transform into Super Sonic this is actually the second time that we 
 see Super Sonic in the opening cutscene since Sonic 3, Eggman lures Super Sonic, captures him and 
 drains the power of the chaos emeralds and blasting the planet in pieces he then summons a final 
 fantasy-esque like demon known as Dark Gaia. Eggman then dismisses Sonic who's now a werehog and 
 sends him down to the broken planet who now has to restore the earth and restore the power of the 
 chaos emeralds. Sonic meets a dog-cat like creature or whatever the hell he is and names him Chip 
 seeing how "Chip" has a love for chocolate chip ice cream... ofcourse.
  
  This has got to be one of the best plots that Sega has come up with better than the older stories 
 that they came up with the story between Sonic and Chip is very well executed it's like they are 
 brothers on a world tour so the story is one of the best sonic plots if not done already a million 
 times it sure is quite amusing.
  
  Gameplay:
  
  Now the gameplay let's start with the daytime stages first and I got to say this: Oh my god what 
 an improvement I mean Sega have finally got the gears working in their heads for once. The daytime 
 stages handle a 2D and 3D perspectives kinda like Sonic and the secret rings and Sonic Rush. And 
 guess what? Sonic's finally running at his normal speed again! Yes thank you Sega! Anyways the 
 daytime stages offer brand new moves such as the side step which is really useful in the boss battles 
 and a shame that we can't spin dash anymore, the boss battles here are just stupid and simple because 
 all you have to do in the daytime stages with these bosses is just use a homing attack or just 
 Sonic boost it to hell. Now moving onto something that you all have been looking forward to: What 
 do I think of the werehog's stages? Well to be honest the werehog's stages are fun to play what 
 angers me is that the reviewers have been slamming this feature I mean I played through the werehog's 
 stages and I just don't see why they are complaining about this feature I mean as a fan of the 
 DBZ budokai games I really love the werehog's stages. Ya know why? Because I get to kick dark gaia 
 monster ass and beat the **** out of them. The main gripe that these reviewers tend to address 
 is that the werehog is slow I disagree on that statement on many levels because think about it 
 if Sonic were to pelt at full speed if he's in werehog form then he'd die during the stage which 
 I learnt the hard way while playing through the werehog's stages. At times the werehog's stages 
 do remind of Crash of the titans but a more opened version of it, moving aside from the werehog's 
 stages we have the bosses in the night time stages now these bosses are a lot different in terms 
 of the daytime bosses you actually get to do more than just run at them. Overall the gameplay is 
 one of the strongest parts of the game.
  
  Graphics:
  
  Not much to say about the graphics though other than it's cartoony and looks beautiful for a sonic 
 game especially how they animated the werehog's fur and how it's all detailed and all that but 
 I will say this graphics don't make a good game sure they are there to make the worlds you play 
 in enjoyable and wonderful but that's not the case when the game is **** But moving back on topic 
 Sonic unleashed's graphics are decent for a sonic game that we have seen for ages.
  
  Music:
  
  Anyways moving onto the music what Sega did now for this game is instead of modern 
 rock music in older Sonic games and they opt to go for an orchestra for this game. I think that 
 Sega got inspired by Koji Kondo's music in Super Mario Galaxy they thought maybe orchestra is better 
 than the music we already have let's put this into the game. And my god have they made a good choice 
 with this just like Super Mario Galaxy the stages especially the night time stages are cool the 
 soundtrack is decent enough for me to enjoy anyway.
  
  Voice acting:
  
  Now onto the voice acting once again the 4kids voice cast are in is this game like they have in 
 the previous sonic games but the main question is: How did Jason Griffith do in this game? He's 
 improved yeah from all the years I have been having a slight hatred for his Sonic voice he has 
 actually improved but only justly because there are some areas in which he sucks at, his werehog 
 voice is cool though so overall for Jason Griffith did an okay job as Sonic, Tails still sounds 
 like a girl, Eggman's voice is still great, Amy is squeaky but I think Lisa Ortiz does a slightly 
 good job as Amy but the biggest one who did a great job would have to be Dan Green he did a good 
 job in putting on a British accent for Professor Pickle! Seriously that name is stupid it would 
 make anyone laugh at it. Anyways the voice that sorta annoys me is Chip's I mean for godsakes he 
 sounds like a midget version of Silver! The voice acting is restricted to brief bits of Gameplay 
 and the cutscenes so overall the voice acting is sort of good in a good way.
  
  Final Verdict:
  
  For the most part Sonic unleashed is a great Sonic game I glad to say this 
 Sega are finally coming to their senses and are bringing back Sonic in the way we saw him in Sonic 
 1 so if your looking for a good Sonic game then check this one out. To be honest I think Sonic 
 and the black knight looks interesting but that's another review I'll do in the distant future.

Review:  To say that Sonic the Hedgehog has been having a bit of a decline in recent years is a bit of an 
 understatement. Post Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic has endured some questionable spin-offs such as 
 the Riders series and Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, as well as losing a lot of credibility 
 after Sonic Next-gen, having some wonder if the hedgehog is finally running his course. With the 
 release of Sonic Unleashed however, many consider this to be the blue blur's last chance to win 
 over the gaming audience. So to paraphrase Gametrailers, "Is this the final nail in the hedgehog's 
 coffin, or does he still have a few laps left in him?"
  
  The story in Sonic games after the Adventure series (Minus Sonic Chronicles) have usually ended 
 up in one of two categories, great setting but poor execution (Sonic Next-gen and Shadow the Hedgehog) 
 or just being downright cheesy and not having a chance at achieving greatness (Sonic Rivals and 
 Sonic Riders) . Sonic Unleashed while not downright terrible falls under the later category. The 
 story begins with Sonic storming Eggman's fleet in space and it seems like Sonic is once again 
 ready to kick Eggman into the next dimension. All of a sudden though, Eggman uses his new machines 
 to absorb Sonic's power as Super Sonic as well as the Chaos Emeralds and use it to split his world 
 into seven pieces while at the same time awakening a beast at the center of the planet called Dark 
 Gaia. A side effect of this is that Sonic is now transformed into a creature called a "Werehog," 
 a larger and more brutal version of himself but still maintaining his personality. When Eggman 
 is done with him, he casts Weresonic down to Earth with the Chaos Emeralds with him. When Weresonic 
 makes his touchdown, he finds the drained Chaos Emeralds and a creature known as Chip who has lost 
 his memory and has a great desire for deserts. Sonic now begins a journey as he attempts to reinvigorate 
 the Chaos Emeralds and discover what kind of creature Chip is. The story isn't head banging awful, 
 but won't win many fans especially considering Chip's presence, officially the worst and most annoying 
 character in a Sonic game.
  
  The graphics are both artistically different and technically higher than previous console iterations 
 of Sonic games. The artistic level in Sonic Unleashed is similar to that of Pixar's latest films 
 such as Ratatouille, which if you always thought Sonic would look better in, this is definitely 
 an answer to your desires, though some such as myself might miss the more realistic setting. The 
 graphics, considering this to be a Wii game, are of course going to be inferior to the HD versions, 
 but even that being the case, you probably wouldn't know that if you weren't told so. Whereas most 
 developers tend to make a graphically inferior PS2 version of their game and build the Wii version 
 up from that, Sega actually put in some effort in the Wii version, showing some bright stages and 
 a frame rate of 30 frames per second. When facing the character models up close and personal though, 
 polygons can be seen, but the game doesn't allow the graphics to destroy the game, such as frame 
 rate problems or texture loading.
  
  Sonic games have never failed to impress in the sound department, and while the same can be said 
 for Sonic Unleashed, it's not quite as strongly the case here. In terms of music, Unleashed takes 
 a new turn by replacing the 80's rock music with a more calming and more in synch with the levels 
 style. Some might miss this style, again such as myself, while some might enjoy this more. There 
 aren't quite as many memorable tunes in Unleashed as there were in previous games, with the exception 
 of Apostas's stage music, Spagonia's stage music, and Endless Possibility, but there's sadly no 
 Crush 40 main theme. Despite the absence of the music many enjoyed, the music overall fits Sonic 
 Unleashed in both the daytime stages and nighttime stages. I have a theory when it comes to the 
 sound factor in games when Sega is at the helm, Sega uses a scale that shows the quality of the 
 sound factor regarding voice acting and music. Usually Sega games either have excellent voice acting 
 but not too memorable music (Yakuza) or downright terrible voice acting but with awesome music 
 (Sonic Next-gen) . Even though some exceptions come to mind, Sonic Unleashed is in this balance 
 since while the music isn't quite that memorable, the voice acting has surprisingly improved from 
 the previous versions. That's right, Jason Griffith is no longer a terrible voice actor and has 
 actually improved! The rest of the voice acting is also pretty decent coming from the NPCs, and 
 Tails is just tolerable now since he's still missing his manhood. Of course there is still a big 
 blemish in the voice acting's decency, and that's Chip's voice actor. Despite this, the voice acting 
 is certainly overall better than most Sonic games prior and won't cause your ears to bleed anytime 
 soon.
  
  So Sega has the sound and graphics covered well, but how about the gameplay? Well this is where 
 we truly decide if the beloved hedgehog still has a pulse. The good news is that you can only play 
 as Sonic in this game, which is something that many have been hoping for in a long time from a 
 Sonic game. There are still Werehog levels which provide something different from usual Sonic gameplay, 
 but its not a broken as previous attempts at variety have been.
  
  Sonic's stages are ones that bring Sonic back to his speed going roots. They're quick and exhilarating 
 in terms of speed, and there's not much platforming to do, but that's something of an answer to 
 prayers that many have been sending. In Unleashed, you speed through the stages and attack robots 
 that get in your way, and a speed boost has been included to go even faster than you could imagine. 
 Sonic is able to drift to make sharp turns while maintaining current speed can do side steps to 
 quickly step out of the way of enemies. And if you're that big of a nostalgia freak, the 2-D perspective 
 that was promised in the trailers is brought in as well and seamlessly transits from 2-D to 3-D.
 
  
  The controls also manage to work when behind the blue blur's wheel and the moves always register 
 to your controller's commands. Just like other Sonic games though, the camera is certainly a bit 
 of a problem, but it's really more the case because Sonic Unleashed is meant to be played by having 
 Sonic constantly going in a forward motion, otherwise he'll feel odd to control. The Wii remote 
 and nunchuk control scheme is the initial setup when controlling the hedgehog, but unlike Secret 
 Rings prior, the controls feel gimmicky and wont feel like they work all that well. You can however 
 use the classic controller or the Gamecube controller if you find the initial setup problematic, 
 and these setups are recommended.
  
  Then of course there are the night time stages which stars Weresonic and the beat-um-up sections 
 that so many have despised from the start. Weresonic is slow when he walks, but you can run by 
 tapping the control stick twice. In general, the Werehog stages are just like any other beat-um-up 
 you've played but with some platforming sections. The nighttime stages aren't all that long though, 
 they're just frequently placed and will make you hope that more daytime stages come soon. You travel 
 through the stages to beat up strange enemies and reach the goal ring to progress to the next level 
 while some enemies are stronger than others. There's also a decent amount of depth to the fighting 
 since gathering orbs called "Dark Gaia Energy" will help improve your power and bring out longer 
 combos to make the beat-um-up sections feel more worthwhile. All in all, the stages aren't very 
 inventive and some control issues can get in the way, but these stages alone are better than most 
 shallow beat-um-ups you can play on the Wii (Looking at Dragon Blade: Wrath of Fire and Soulcalibur 
 Legends) .
  
  And of course in tradition since Sonic Adventure 1, the final boss Dark Gaia is fought by going 
 through a speed section and facing him one on one with Super Sonic. This is a great final boss 
 and the remix of Endless Possibilities is truly the highlight of the music in the game. The boss 
 is pretty tough, but it won't be too hard to beat him after a few tries.
  
  So the final question is, is this game worth the purchase? If you're a Sonic fan whose been looking 
 for a good Sonic game after many weak attempts, the good news is Sonic Unleashed is the answer 
 to everything you could have wanted as long as you're willing to fight your way through the Werehog 
 levels which aren't really all that bad as some haters have labeled it. If you haven't been following 
 the blue blur for the last some years, you wont be making a mistake in checking this game out, 
 but it might be more worth a rental to see if you like it first, then buy if you don't manage to 
 beat it before the time given to you. Overall though, Unleashed is worlds better than previous 
 Sonic games have been, and it's a sign that Sega might just be digging its way out of its mediocrity 
 and making a comeback in the gaming world. Let's hope we can expect even more with the release 
 of Sonic and the Black Knight in March next year.

Review:  Sega doesn't seem to have him on a short leash they just seemed to let him be unleashed. Was that 
 a good thing? Sort of. Let's start with the good. Real fun fast stages which really trend back 
 into the ol school sonic games, you know when they were good, and hard.... god I could never beat 
 them. Anyways the speed Sonic goes at makes it for a some what intense feel but feels a bit numbed 
 down controls. Shake my wii remote for a speed boost? Not really the kind of action I was going 
 for since that's how you'll attack some peeps and some times it won't register and you'll get the 
 biggest sigh ever cause you end up just watching your self fall to the ground and trying to bring 
 your speed back up. But that's there the game really shines. If only they were only and the stages 
 they play on weren't so repetitive. They show the same stage for every level it seems but they 
 are very pretty are very detailed. Then the downfall. The werehog. They should have just called 
 it a werewolf and be done with it. It's just another lame attempt at sounding funny and stupid 
 on SEGA's part. They really should put controls in reviews cause if I knew you had to swing your 
 arms like an idiot just to punch, I would not have got this game. So here's how it goes. You got 
 the Wii remote and nunchuck in your hand and you to a left punch you swing the nunchuck and then 
 to continue that combo you have to swing the wii remote. AND you must do so to keep that combo 
 going otherwise you swing left again you get a slow clunky combat system. It's not so bad with 
 the classic controller or the GC controller with alternating X and Y on the classic and R and L 
 on the GC. Here is where the two things really get to me though. When fighting there is no lock 
 on. Thats right, I said it. No lock on. In this day and age you would think there was a lock on 
 system with a combat system like this. In crowds it's ok and somewhat fun cause your bound to hit 
 everyone. When theres one monster thing your bound to miss and miss alot. The monsters are faster 
 than normal Sonic and your slower than Ike in Brawl yes I went there. The other thing is the swinging, 
 I can't seem to "grasp" the concept of this cause you have to hold on the button or jump off or 
 something and It's just weird and you end up falling to your death because of it. So this game 
 is by no means worth a buy. Maybe you can rent it and beat it and satisfy some nostalgia within 
 a week. I'm giving Sonic one last try. You hear me Sonic! Sonic and the Black Knight better be 
 good.

Review:  Being a fan of the sonic series I had to buy this game. I'm use to the series getting low scores 
 from websites like this, but I never agree with them. I find most of the sonic games to be pretty 
 good... unfortunately this game is not as good as the other sonic games. 
  
  After playing Sonic and The Secret Rings I finally thought they were doing something right with 
 the sonic series. They managed to bring speed and fast paced action to a 3D sonic game. And in 
 some respect they did in this game, but they fell short with the "night" levels. 
  
  At the beginning of the game Sonic is cursed and he turns into a werehog at night. During the day 
 he is regular sonic, and the "day" levels are very fun and classic sonic gameplay. It was similar 
 to the Secret Rings gameplay. You have face paced action and speed with beautiful scenery surrounding 
 you. There are also other missions where you must collect a certain amount of rings or finish the 
 level without getting hit. This part of the game is fun, while the "night" levels are not.
  
  At night sonic turns into a werehog and everything changes. Instead of fast paced levels and 
 speed, you are left with a slow character, boring level design, and button mashing. As a werehog 
 you go through multiple levels beating up enemies, collecting rings, and finding items. There were 
 very few levels that were actually fun. It almost felt like a chore going through these levels. 
 In order to obtain all the "medals" in the game you had to get a S rank in all levels. In order 
 to get an S rank in the "night" levels, you have to beat it under a certain time limit, grab enough 
 rings, and obtain enough red orbs from the enemies you defeat. It got boring very easily, and every 
 level felt the same. And its a shame that there are more "night" levels than "day" levels. 
  
  As you play through the game you collect items. These items unlock artwork, movies, and music. 
 Looking through the artwork, I was blown away. They had some really good ideas, but it looks like 
 they got lost along the way. Before you can start playing through a "day" stage you need to go 
 to towns and talk to people to find out where to go. This sounds like an ok idea, but in the game 
 you can't go into the village and explore. Your limited to three or four people that you can talk 
 to, to find clues. The unlockable artwork had detailed versions of these villages you visited in 
 the game, but the final product was a disappointment. 
  
  This game should only be played by true Sonic fans. Other people will be turned off, by the boring 
 night stages. Sonic fans, like myself, will get sucked in and enjoy the story and the Sonic environment. 
 I feel like the creators of the game put a lot of thought and time into this game, but the actual 
 presentation of the game was a disappointment. Now lets hope they don't disappoint with Sonic and 
 the Black Knight, it looks like a real winner to me! I cant wait to see what it has to offer.

Review:  The best part about this game is what I'm going to review first, the day stages. These stages are 
 extremely well done. The sense of speed you get as you blast through the enimies and the entire 
 stage is amazing. The only problem I had with this part was the controls. If you ever need to turn 
 back or turn to the side quickly (albeit, drifting helps) , the controls are not tight enough to 
 make it easy, like in Sonic Adventure. It sure is alot easier to go back than in Sonic and the 
 Secret Rings, but it still is pretty bad.
  
  Now, here is the part that cuts the score in half. The night sections. This was the lamest gimmick 
 in any sonic game I have ever played. The fighting is just lame, repetitive and downright pointless. 
 The platforming feels like pulling off Mario Galaxy jumps with a cement cow, and I felt I was restarting 
 the level ten times for one act. If they made the Werehog and the regular Sonic stages seperate 
 games, the werehog would get 1 and the Sonic one would get a 9.5.
  
  Well, thats all there really is. That was the whole game. No extra modes, no playing as Super Sonic 
 (get on it SEGA! You know what we want!) , but I do think this game was alot better than Sonic '06.
 
  
  P. S. Eggman Land is a horrible stage that is too long, too difficult and glitch killed me after 
 the mini-boss!

Review:  Hey everybody. First of all, this game is suppose to be good (according to Sega) but i see VERY 
 LITTLE of the classic 2D style gameplay.
  
  Why is Megaman 9 better than this disaster? CLASSIC
  2D
  GAMEPLAY!
  
  And don't get my 
 started on the werehog levels. Disastrous. Terrible.
  Waste of time. The XBOX 360 AND PS3 VERSION, have waaay more Day sonic levels (and for a good reason 
 too, Werehog sucks.) And thats the point, too. Sega realized int he first few days (Almost all 
 werehog fans said: OH MY GOODNESS! WHAT A TERRIBLE CHARACTER) and decreased the werehog levels 
 inside the PS3 and Xbox 360.
  
  i got the PS3 version, and was very much pleased. The sonic we knew was alive and well again, and 
 i mean come on, we can suffer through 1 or 2 werehog levels, now and then.
  
  SO THE BOTTOM LINE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GET THE PS3 OR XBOX 360 VERSION. DON'T BE A CRYBABY OVER 
 THE FREAKING CAMERA. ITS JUST A GAME.

Review:  Let's start off by saying that Sonic Unleashed is a brilliant game, because it is, but there are 
 parts that make you thinkwhat the hell do i have to do that for? E. g. You race through an 
 icy level as Sonic, and when you've done that level, you have to go through it all again without 
 touching any ice, why do we need to do that? Apart from the stupid cock-ups Sega has given us, 
 it's overall a brilliant game and dosent have Shadow in it. :]
  Now to the Werehog, Urghh, i don't really like the werehog levels, but i'll do one if i want to, 
 they are quite fun. BUT the werehog's combat controls really suck, you swing the remote for a right 
 punch, and the nunchuk for a left punch, this sucks because sometimes the wii doesn't pick up the 
 controls and you end up getting owned by the enemies. I reccomend that you only buy this game if 
 you get bored with hardcore games really quickly, this is the kind of game you want to play if 
 it's a rainy, boring day, and hell, you'll have a lot of fun with it.

Review:  Gamespot just doesn't understand the excellence of this game.
  
  Graphics:10/10. Sonic never looked better. Enemies and environment alike.
  
  Gameplay:10/10. 
 The gamecube controller option is a nice choice. Daytime: All controls are all easy for usage. Nighttime: 
 Though it may take time, the werehog controls are fun.
  
  Music:10/10. Well what would you expect? All sonic music sound great.
  
  Replay value:9/10. 
 replay all your favorite bosses, daytime levels and nighttime levels whenever you wish.
  
  (Actual) Difficulty: I have to split this one up. Daytime:8/10. As you progress, those missions 
 get hard. Nightime:9/10. like in daytime, progression increases difficulty. Though nighttime seems 
 a tad bit more difficult.
  
  Boss/enemy fights:9/10. While they may get challenging, they are a joy to fight.
  
  Story:9/10. 
 You as Sonic must restore the planet and stop Dark Gaia from maturity.
  
  That sums up the underappreciated game that is Sonic Unleashed. Though people may call me crazy, 
 I like both day AND night stages.

Review:  Sonic Unleashed is the tenth installment in the main Sonic series which is a combination of fast 
 2.5D action and fully-3D hack-n-slash combat.
  
  The game starts out when Dr. Ivo Robotnik (a. k. a. Dr. Eggman) awakens an evil god named Dark Gaia 
 to help accomplish his dreams of world conquest by draining the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds 
 and using a giant laser to split the world into seven pieces. Dark Gaia's power spreads around 
 the world, infecting millions of people with its dark influence - including Sonic the Hedgehog 
 himself, giving him a new persona known as "Sonic the Werehog." With the help of a new character, 
 Chip, as well as other unplayable characters, Tails, Amy and Professor Pickles, it is your job 
 to help Sonic find the seven Gaia Temples around the world and restore the Emeralds' power.
  
  The game has two kind of stages: day-time and night-time stages. Day-time stages consists fast-paced 
 platforming stages with seamless transitions between third-person platforming and 2D side-scrolling 
 platforming. During these stages, players can use certain abilities (e. g. Speed Drift and Quick 
 Step) to overcome obstacles.
  
  Night-time stages consists on fully-3D platforming and combat. During these stages, Sonic is slowed 
 down, but in return, is granted with great strength and the ability to stretch his arms. Players 
 can use a variety of attacks against enemies, as well as Sonic's elastic abilites to solve various 
 puzzles. By defeating more enemies, Sonic can gain new abilities as well as improve his status.
 
  
  Completing levels and additional missions gives Sonic some Sun and Moon Coins which are then used 
 to unlock additional puzzles which hold bonus artwork, music, cutscenes and hints.
  
  Despite the lack of features which are included in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 (e. g. Mazuri 
 and Empire City stages) , Sonic Unleashed can still appeal to gamers who enjoy combinations of action 
 stages and button-mashers.

Review:  When Sonic Unleashed was first announced, there was the inevitable hope that this game would finally 
 herald in Sonic's return to form of the lost days of the Sega Genesis. Thus, it's probably a good 
 place to begin this review to say that it isn't that. That aside, however, its inability to recapture 
 the magic of legends past doesn't stop it from being a good game in its own right, and it's certainly 
 a solid Sonic experience for anyone desiring such a thing.
  
  It should also be noted that this is addressing the Wii version specifically; the author has not 
 played the other versions, but has been assured that there are significant differences between 
 them. Thus, prospective buyers of the other versions should take caution before applying anything 
 said here to them.
  
  Sonic Unleashed begins with Sonic attacking Eggman's space base as Super Sonic, blazing through 
 its defenses with the usual invincible ease associated with one who has collected all seven Chaos 
 Emeralds. Eggman is prepared for this onslaught, however, and manages to trap Sonic in a field 
 in which he strips the Chaos Emeralds of all their power. As a byproduct of this event, Super Sonic 
 is no more, and Sonic has lycanthropy infused in him, turning him into a slower but more powerful 
 "werehog" whenever nighttime falls. In addition, the world splits apart and Eggman's true plot 
 is laid bare: he wants to harness the power of Dark Gaia for his own purposes of conquering the 
 world. Meanwhile, Sonic is sent careening towards Earth, his Super-Sonic power of flight stripped 
 from his body, and he must find a way to stop Eggman's schemes once more with his newfound mysterious 
 friend Chip.
  
  Over the course of the game, Sonic must travel to many different locations, including Greece, Egypt, 
 and China (although all names are changed to fictional variants such as Apotos, Shamar, and Chun-Nan) . 
 The sequence of events is pretty straightforward - Sonic must first talk to people in the town 
 to gain necessary information or items, and can then proceed to the "Gaia Gate", through which 
 Sonic enters into the gameplay section of the game. There are daytime levels, during which Sonic 
 is his usual speedy self, and nighttime levels, during which Sonic turns into his werehog alter 
 ego and has to rough up some dark baddies.
  
  With regards to the story, however, probably one of my biggest complaints about Sonic Unleashed 
 - this is as good a segue as any into that topic - is a problem that has plagued many of the recent 
 Sonic games, including his last Wii endeavor in Sonic and the Secret Rings. That complaint is simple: 
 I can't help but get the sense that the folks at Sega are really not quite sure what they want 
 their Sonic games to be.
  
  On one hand, there is quite a clearly established story that plays out throughout the game. But, 
 on the other hand, the actual events during the gameplay itself really have little to no bearing 
 on the gameplay, being instead bite-sized levels in which the sole goal is to get from point A 
 to point B as best as possible. The game feels quite fragmented as a result; it feels as though 
 over here there is the story, and over there is the gameplay, and they don't really speak to each 
 other. It really just feels restrictive and confining, and I can't help but feel that Sega could 
 have a much better game on their hands if they'd only drop the arcade aspects and make a completely 
 integrated game.
  
  But, the author's personal complaints and suggestions aside, however, the gameplay itself is quite 
 solid. The daytime levels as speedy Sonic in particular can be quite a rush, and are quite a faithful 
 rendition of the quickness and style for which Sonic is famous. The controls are very similar to 
 Sonic and the Secret Rings with the welcome exception that Sonic is now completely controllable 
 with the nunchuck instead of moving on his own. Sonic runs, jumps, dashes, and slides, and that's 
 pretty much the full extent of his repertoire, but not much else is really needed.
  
  The level design is quite well-done in the daytime levels, as well, offering the player many obstacles 
 and alternate time-saving paths that skilled players can take in an effort to improve their completion 
 time and letter grade. Most world locations have one main daytime level during which the only objective 
 is to get to the goal as fast as humanly (well, hedgehogly) possible. Like in Sonic and the Secret 
 Rings, there are also many mission-style levels, in which Sonic must do things such as collection 
 a certain number of rings within a time limit, reach the goal without breaking any objects, or 
 such like. These add a certain level of replay value for arcade-style enthusiasts, but for anyone 
 hoping for a more in-depth story, these will probably detract from the experience overall.
  
  Nighttime levels are, as has been said, not quite as good as the daytime levels, but in the 
 author's opinion they also aren't as bad as some say. They're certainly decent, and the controls 
 work well enough. The only huge complaint that I had about them was the atrocious decision to map 
 the "dash" command to a double-tap of the control stick on the nunchuck. This has the unfortunate 
 effect of making it impossible to edge Sonic nearer to a ledge by simply slightly tapping the control 
 stick again and again. This can very easily cause Sonic to launch into a dash, which is the responsible 
 party in at least 95% of my untimely deaths in the nighttime levels.
  
  But, beyond that, there are no other major complaints in the gameplay itself. Sonic beats up the 
 bad guys pretty darn well, and as he gains power from collecting items and defeating enemies, he 
 powers up both with new moves and with stat increases (the three stats being health, attack power, 
 and his "unleashed" gauge, which allows him to temporarily go into "unleashed" mode whereby he 
 can bring an extra helping of pain to his enemies) . They're fairly standard platforming segments, 
 and they work pretty well.
  
  The only more pervasive complaint I would have here, however, is what I said above: the nighttime 
 levels seem kind of aimless, and can be a little boring as a result. One comment I made to myself 
 while playing them was that they seemed kind of like Twilight Princess, only without any real point 
 driving the gameplay: Sonic is ostensibly advancing the story, but in reality his only real goal 
 in the context of the game is to just get to the finish line. This loses a great deal of the appeal 
 to these segments for me; I think that they could have been greatly improved if they had a deeper, 
 stronger connection to the story at large. But, nonetheless, that's water under the bridge, and 
 I won't dwell any further on the subject.
  
  Additionally, when Sonic does well in daytime stages, he acquires moon medals, and similarly he 
 receives sun medals for doing well in the nighttime stages. These can be used to open doors in 
 the Gaia Gates in each world location, which contain short (and surprisingly entertaining) puzzles 
 that can be solved for items, including the very helpful 1-up item, which grants Sonic an extra 
 life at the beginning of each level (he starts with only two, and goes up from there) . The author 
 found these to be a neat diversion, and something that he'd have liked to see more of, in fact.
 
  
  The gameplay and plot aside, other aspects of Sonic Unleashed were quite well done as well. The 
 graphics were top-notch for a Wii game, and indeed the game contained in the author's opinion the 
 best cutscenes in any Wii game to date, although Sega has always been known for excellent cutscenes.
 
  
  The soundtrack was also well done as well, the nighttime levels having particularly nice music. 
 The one complaint that I might level is the way in which an encounter with enemies in the nighttime 
 levels transitioned off of the level music and into the "battle" music - this was kind of annoying, 
 as the level music always tended to be more enjoyable, and the constant back and forth switching 
 ended up killing any attempt to really get into the music.
  
  All in all, Sonic Unleashed is not the one giant leap for hedgehogkind that Sonic devotees were 
 hoping for, but at the same time it's not the disaster that Sonic detractors were predicting, either. 
 It's a solid game - not the best game of the year - but certainly worth the entrance fee if you're 
 either a Sonic fan or a Wii owner on the hunt for a fun time-killer. Beyond that, however, I can 
 only hold out my (likely futile) hope that Sega will hear what I have to say. I quite think there's 
 a lot of potential to be had, but Sega still seems to cling to the old fractured arcade-style gameplay, 
 which in my humble opinion is one of the things that absolutely must go for Sonic to receive a 
 truly great game.

Review:  Make sure you do not play this game with the wii mote and nunchuck. It is confusing and is not 
 very responsive especially on the werehog stages.
  
  As you probally know this game plays in both day and night. During the day you play as sonic. It 
 is fast and fun the way a sonic game should be. During the night you play as the werehog. He is 
 quite slower and focuses more on platforming and combat.
  
  The day stages are just perfect. But the night stages are very very frusterating. While balancing 
 across something you will dash outa nowhere and run of the edge and die. Basicly you will swing 
 across some polls then fight a ton of enemys and thats basicly all you will do over and over again.
 
  The combat is very boring too. You only use 2 buttons for your combat limiting the amount of combos 
 you can do. There are barley any combos. Also you can button mash threw all the enemys, it takes 
 no skill at all.
  
  The bosses in this game are very boring and easy. Even the end boss with super sonic is easy boring 
 and slow.
  
  In this game there are 7 worlds. In each world you play 1 sonic stage and 3 werehog stages. Also 
 the sonic stages are about 4 mins long and the werehog stages are about 8 mins long. So you only 
 get to play as sonic about 15% of the time.
  
  Also in between these stages you must talk to towns ppl. it is very annoying and pointless.
  
 
  In the end this was not the sonic game I was hoping for. But at least it wasn't a diaster like 
 sonic nex gen.

Review:  Sonic Unleashed was just a flat out, very enjoyable game. The day sections where you run around 
 as Sonic are a blast and the night time sections, despite what most say, is quite fun.
  
  Story = 8
  The story is well thought out and quite enjoyable but there are not many bits that 
 actualy relate to the story and talking to the people in the hub-world has nothing to do with anything. 
 Other than that, it's great.
  
  Gameplay
  (Sonic) = 10
  There are very few problems/glitches when running around as Sonic through the high speed day stages. 
 All the controls work fine, the new abilities are fun to use and the game uses the right times 
 for each of these abilities. The controls would hae been great for the entire game, if not for 
 the werehog.
  
  (Werehog) = 9
  I actualy like the werehog in this game, he isn't too slow and his fighting techniques are enjoyable 
 but there are 2 problems. For one, the jumping is very slippery when dashing, if you jump in that 
 direction, you fly off in that direction, this is a big problem. Second of all is that when trying 
 to be precise you will tap the control stick a few times, and instead of tipping aroung, you will 
 dash off a ledge and die. Sometimes you may dash even without meaning to. It's the combat and obstacles 
 in the game that makes me give it a 9.
  
  Presentation = 10
  The levels are just really well done, the day stages stretch on with 2D/3D parts which is very 
 fun and the werehog areas are well thought out too and could have 1 or 2 improvements on them.
 
  
  Lasting appeal = 8
  This game's original time is about 10-15 hours long and it leaves you asking for more, I thought 
 that a new console like this would have longer games but I was clearly mistaken. This game is not 
 worth it's RRP because it doesn't last that long, so get about 5-10 off. There is plenty more 
 to go back for (missions, art work, movies, etc,) which isn't AS fun as the story mode but it can 
 be fun for some of it, also new missions can be in new areas.
  
  (the rest of this review does not count towards the final score)
  
  Graphics = 9.5
  These 
 aren't the best graphics on the Wii, possibly the 2nd or 3rd best, but are still very good, especially 
 on some of the cutscenes. I you love games for their graphics, then you must get this.
  
  Music = 10
  The music is just superb, mostly on the day stages (Spagonia) . You will have to listen 
 to it yourself to see, go on youtube and listen to one of the tracks.
  
  Overall = 9
  This is one of my favourite games to come out in 2008 and it is surely a must-have for each Sonic 
 fan, even the old ones, they will love the 2D sections.

Review:  Let me put this short. I'm not that good at classic games. Basically any games that came out before 
 the Playstation era I'm abysmal at, including the original Sonic. However, face me at any modern 
 games, I'll hold out quite fine (I never say I'm the best because there's always someone better 
 than me) . However, even though I suck at classical games, I love the Sonic series especially my 
 favourite character in the series is Tails.
  
  Anyways, after spending mindless hours of watching Sonic X and reading about Sonic Unleashed, I 
 set out to buy it since it looks promising. To my surprise, it's miles ahead of the never to be 
 spoken again Sonic The Hedgehog (2006) . Now, that game was abysmal. 
  
  What I liked about Sonic Unleashed is that it puts Sonic into a modern game engine, the 2D to 3D 
 transition made the game quite exhilarating, just what a Sonic game should be. That's where the 
 Werehog smashes into the party and ruins it. It's great to see their attempt at doing it. I don't 
 mind the combat system because I never expected Sonic to be a combat game in the first place. I 
 just treat it like Dynasty Warriors, hack and slash, not much thinking required. I just don't like 
 how the levels are laid out in the night versions. It can get confusing even for a occasional platformer 
 like me. 
  
  I think Gametrailers summed it up for me in its review of the game " [Sega] takes two steps forward 
 and one step back". I'm sure if they just refine their Sonic day levels and drop the Werehog, it 
 would become one of the best franchise revitalization in ages.
  
  The daytime levels is why the game is rated 8/10. The night areas, just pulls it from a 9.
  
 
  Long story short:
  
  Pro
  - daytime stages are second-to-none
  - lives up to when I played the originals (albeit not good at it)
  
  Cons
  - slightly confusing 
 night stages
  - Werehog looks cool but should be cut from the game.
  - maybe the graphics could be done a bit better. Even Super Mario Galaxy looks better. It needs 
 to get rid of its PS2-esque graphics.

Review:  One day in the Sonic Team room, they were figuring out more gimmicks to pair Sonic up with. Then 
 one person said, "HOW BOUT A WEREWOLF YA'LL?!!!!" And they all bowed down to his ideas and this 
 game comes up. But they actually did something smart too! They decided to make Sonic have good 
 old speed stages too where he really does go at the speed of light. Put those two things together 
 with a little helper named Chip, and a classic story of defeating Eggman, and you get Sonic Unleashed.
 
  
  I think classic fans will actually appreciate the story. Because Eggman acts like that goofy fat 
 villain just like the old days. Not like that thing in 06. The story is basically starting with 
 Sonic trying to stop Eggman. He gets in super form right away. BUT, Eggman predicted he would do 
 that and Sonic falls right into his trap. OH THE EXCITEMENT. Note the sarcasm. Eggman then awakens 
 the Dark Gaia by splitting the Earth into seven continents. But, this also causes Sonic to turn 
 into a werewolf. Excuse me "Werehog." And then Sonic goes crashing down to Earth and meets a little 
 guy named Chip, who lost his memory. Sonic think it's his fault, will try to help Chip find his 
 memory as he tries to put the seven continents back in place and defeat the Dark Gaia.
  
  Now, the game is divided into two really different types of gameplay. So I'll go with the better 
 one of the two first. The daytime stages. In these stages, you're just controlling the good old 
 Sonic and actually going at the speed of light. I'm not kidding, it really seems like you are. 
 Yet, you feel like you are actually going that fast, because the game asks you to do quite a few 
 things in these stages. Sonic controls almost perfectly. I would think it'd be impossible to control 
 such a fast character looking at those vids, but it actually is very easy. You'll get used to it 
 and actually have loads of fun! These stages perfectly combine the elements of the classic Sonic 
 games with modern Sonic elements to make some pretty darn fun stages. This is the game's highlight. 
 It is really that fun. The stage designs are wide and vast. To those fans who wanted some more 
 freedom when playing Sonic, you finally got it here.
  
  BUT, there is another gameplay type. I said earlier that Sonic turns into a Werehog. He's not gonna 
 be going fast with a few differences like you think. No, playing the Werehog is like playing a 
 totally different game. Are you a fan of beat-em-ups? You're going to love this. The night gameplay 
 has Sonic beating up millions and millions of enemies with those cool looking attacks of his. The 
 bigger your combo chain is, the more experience points you earn. But, it isn't just beat-em-ups 
 otherwise it'd be a little boring. You also do some good old Crash Bandicoot platforming. Using 
 those stretchy arms to grab on polls and ledges of walls. It really is quite fun and is a nice 
 break from beating up countless amounts of enemies. Overall, the Werehog ain't as good as the good 
 old daylight stages, but it is a nice change of pace and it is fun.
  
  You might expect the graphics to be dumbed down from the 360 and PS3 versions. But nope. The graphics 
 are some of the best I've seen on the Wii actually. It has a very kiddish presentation overall. 
 Which I prefer on Sonic over that very failed attempt on a mature look in 06. It's very colorful 
 and it all looks great. It actually looks like it could be on the 360/PS3. Especially in those 
 cutscenes. The Sonic gang are looking better then ever in this colorful style.
  
  The sound is so multi-cultural. You basically have good old Sonic music influenced by the many 
 cultures that this game represents. And it gives us a very awesome soundtrack that fits perfectly 
 with the game. The voice work is actually improving if I'm being honest. I don't find myself saying 
 how corny a line is at all in this game. Plus, the script is hilarious. My favorite in particular 
 are the cutscenes involving the big fat Eggman.
  
  There is quite alot of things to unlock in this game. Like movies, music, art, and more. But you 
 know, when you finish the story, I never really felt the motivation to unlock everything else. 
 Sucks too because the story doesn't take long to beat either. But here's why I wouldn't feel that 
 motivated. You would think it'd be 50% day and 50% night. Nope. It's more like 90% Night and 10% 
 Day. You know what sucks? The day stages are the highlight of the game, and you only get short 
 bursts of them. There are like 3x more Werehog levels then there are hedgehog levels. Werehog is 
 still fun, but it is just too much. I'd rather it be 50% of each because this is just not fair. 
 I don't feel the motivation to replay Werehog levels like I do with the day stages. But with only 
 7 stages, you won't be playing for a long time.
  
  Overall, it is a nice game and I think it's one of the best Sonic titles to come in years. They 
 just put to much focus on their gimmick and not enough on our favorite hedgehog. Hopefully, Sega 
 learns that Sonic   Gimmick. Oh well, it's still a great game nonetheless and I totally recommend 
 a buy. It's worth the price.

Review:  Some super-fast blue hedgehog's saving the world from an incredibly stupid "genius" with the help 
 of sacred jewelry; however, a conflict occurs, friendly folk learn valuable lessons, the blue hedgehog 
 begins the realization of the belief in oneself, eventually turning into a super-powered, golden 
 savior, and earth is saved until next year. Sounds a bit "blah" now, doesn't it? Sure, people could 
 always nitpick what is put into these stories, but that's never been the point of what makes a 
 good, old, traditional Sonic the Hedgehog game for what it is, even though that's not what it lately 
 seems. However, story progression seems to take a somewhat important role in Sega and Sonic Team's 
 latest Sonic title for the consoles (this particular version being for the Nintendo Wii) , dubbed 
 Sonic Unleashed. This version in particular has you searching over broken fragments of the world 
 in order to find a temple to put that certain region back into place. To do so, however, you need 
 to go through a whole mess of mostly pointless conversations with a majority of random people that 
 live around the area before you reach the actual "game" part. This wouldn't seem so bad, but when, 
 say, that whole adventure aspect is torn away, then it becomes much more apparent that Unleashed 
 just doesn't offer as much to itself as it should. The reason why it should is because, quite honestly, 
 there are good ideas here that work.
  
  Still, there's some sort of point to the narrative, as embarrassingly dumb as it can be, and that's 
 to explain Sonic Team's latest experiment to the hedgehog. This time, the anthropomorphic creature 
 is going through a sort of alter-ego phase. He's his regular self by day; however, at night, he 
 turns into a brutish, stretchy-armed wolf-hedgehog crossover. Such a concept is usually used to 
 experience two different design points in one package: in this case, a fast, typically "Sonic" 
 platform game, and a more "hack-n-slash"-heavy action-adventure take. 
  
  The most redeeming quality in the entire game is actually what the animal does best: running around 
 really fast, making hilly, unleveled grounds seem like a roller-coaster ride. As far as the Wii 
 version of the game is concerned, three-dimensional Sonic hasn't been done this well before. It 
 recycles the behind-the-back camera presented in last year's Sonic and the Secret Rings, the difference 
 being that the camera has backed off noticeably more than what the Secret Rings installment had 
 shown. Sonic also brings back a few maneuvers that dates back around the Sonic Adventure series-such 
 as dashing through a trail of rings or using his whole body like a sort of homing bullet-that varies 
 up a few of the obstacles with a flick of the Wii remote (though Gamecube and Classic Controllers 
 are also welcome) . Add sliding under crevices, a smooth engine that can keep up with Sonic without 
 any sort of chugs, the brilliant mechanics to drift around corners and sidestep around objects 
 to avoid the loss of momentum, a few appropriately timed button presses, some two-dimensional segments 
 in each level, and pretty decent level design to tie it all together. It works well, and could 
 be reason enough to check it out.
  
  But that is just the thing: this game could very well be worth the time, but it lacks some sort 
 of polish and ends up being too shallow, a common flaw that plagues a lot of recent Sonic games. 
 Those daytime stages are pretty enjoyable, for example, but there are only eight stages. Granted, 
 all of those levels are pretty fun, but it's not likely that you would want to replay those levels 
 constantly. In fact, Unleashed encourages you to play the same level again by forcing you to complete 
 some objectives after you completely go through that level. This is also similar to the Secret 
 Rings, as you'll be required to go through a part of the aforementioned level without breaking 
 pots for some reason, collecting an x amount of rings for some reason, going through the whole 
 level again with a time limit for some reason, etc. It's a bit heartbreaking when all's said and 
 done because, as said, these levels end up being a real blast, and could be even more enjoyable 
 if the designers would just add even more than what's brought out.
  
  And yet, for every five to ten minutes you would spend playing those daytime levels, you'll have 
 to alter through thirty to possibly almost fifty minutes of Sonic the "Werehog" and his nighttime 
 levels (in case if dialogue, cutscenes, or boss battles are involved in between) . These are much 
 more slow in pace, and provide different obstacles to endure and beating up a lot of stuff in certain 
 areas. The combat, which has you swinging the Wii remote and "nunchuck" combination like fists 
 (or the shoulder buttons for other controllers) , is a bit of a bore, never being as over-the-top 
 or deep as what made games from the same style of genre so fun. The obstacle courses that link 
 these fights together until the goal is reached offer more variety and arguably more amusement, 
 but even these trials, despite how frustrating it can end up being, feel like there should be more 
 excitement pumped into its imaginary veins.
  
  Every time we're introduced with a Sonic the Hedgehog game, there's always something appealing 
 toward every release; why else would you still care about Sonic and his 3D releases? Unleashed 
 may be as right on the track as things can be in this case. The welcoming worldly music is better 
 suited than the cheesy metal anthems that followed the edgy hedgehog since the Dreamcast era, but 
 it's more than that. This time, the traditional levels show more signs of enjoyment, and could 
 be well worth a rent just for those that are curious. However, less interesting experimentations 
 take up too much of the material in the game, and it becomes a common disappointment that should 
 be all too predictable by now. And really, no one's going to care for a meaningful story from Sonic, 
 and no one cares about different types of Sonic. Those that still care about Sonic only care about 
 one thing: his traditional platform genre roots. If Sonic Team still wants to attempt to blow people's 
 minds of anything else he may be capable of, then whatever.

Review:  What Sonic lacks in adaptive qualities, he makes up in persistence. Once known as one of the greatest 
 platformer characters in gaming history, Sonic's record in the modern market has slipped. Despite 
 starring in game after game, Sonic has yet to find that perfect formula that recreates the speed 
 and action seen in his 2-D adventures. Though his handheld record has been excellent, Sonic's 3-D 
 adventures have definitely been disputable in terms of quality. Though it's been nearly ten years 
 since Sonic Adventure, Sega is still after that shining example of Sonic perfection. Sonic Unleashed 
 is Sonic's latest attempt at revitalizing his franchise. Is it Sonic's crowning moment?
  
  The story begins with Sonic and Eggman in one of their traditional battles in space, with Sonic 
 laying waste to Eggman's most recent army of enemy robots. Locked in combat, the transformed Super 
 Sonic looks to be the victor, but Eggman unleashes his newest plan. This time around Eggman is 
 after the essence of the planet, the power of the energy creature Dark Gaia, tearing apart the 
 planet in the process. After Eggman absorbs part of the Dark Gaia essence, Sonic is exposed to 
 the energy, causing him to undergo a transformation from regular hedgehog to Were-hedgehog, generally 
 called the Werehog. The Dark Gaia energy also drains the power of the Chaos Emeralds, which along 
 with Sonic, are hurled back to Earth. After waking up, Sonic joins forces with a weird flying stuffed-animal-like 
 creature who he aptly names Chip. Chip, surprisingly, has no memory, so the two begin their journey 
 to save the world. Chip could well be the most unnecessary character to the Sonic universe since 
 Big the Cat. In fact, the Werehog itself doesn't really make a ton of sense in the storyline either. 
 The whole storyline feels all too familiar in the wrong places: an ancient creature whose power 
 Eggman is trying to harness? Check out the Sonic Adventure games. Overall, however, it's an excuse 
 for Sonic to run all over the world and explore different lands, and to that degree, the storyline 
 keeps itself together.
  
  During the day, Sonic is free to explore the world at high speeds, which is exactly what he should 
 be doing. Sonic Unleashed is easily the best translation of Sonic's 2-D romps since the Sonic Adventure 
 days. The game mixes the behind-the-back camera of past Sonic games like Sonic and the Secret Rings, 
 with some clever camera angles, similar to those of Sonic Rivals. By collecting rings throughout 
 the different levels, Sonic can earn Ring Energy, which can be spent on speed boosts. Sonic's levels 
 are full of moments that will challenge your skill and reflexes. Gameplay aspects like quick-time 
 events and multiple paths are common, as is the ability to find secret items throughout. The result 
 is some of the most intense and enjoyable moments seen in a Sonic game in a long, long time. It's 
 exactly what Sonic should be in 3-D.
  
  However, the developers weren't content with simply revitalizing a struggling franchise. Why not 
 put in something else? The most recent twist on the Sonic the Hedgehog formula is the Werehog. 
 At night, Sonic goes all lycanthropic and the game slows down immensely because of it. You'll focus 
 more on beating up enemies and conservative platforming than the high-speed reflex testing of the 
 Sonic levels. Like the Sonic levels, these are reach-the-goal sequences. Instead of running through 
 huge environments, the Werehog must blast through waves of generic enemies and go through some 
 platforming in between the brawls. These sequences do have some interesting ideas; the Werehog's 
 stretching arms are reminiscent of the classic Sega game Ristar, with grabbing ledges and climbing 
 poles being mapped to holding down a single button. You can also earn ranks by collecting rings 
 and Dark Gaia energy, along with reaching the end within a certain amount of time. These ideas 
 are pretty experimental, but generally work well in giving the Werehog levels some longevity.
 
  
  Sadly, the Werehog levels have some bad ideas as well. First off is that there's no camera control. 
 Making jumps can be a serious pain when only relying on the set view, especially due to the high 
 amounts of bottomless pits. Second is that the combat is shallow. The few combos that you can earn 
 throughout the levels are mapped to the punch buttons (or in the case of the Wii Remote + Nunchuk 
 controls, shaking either the Wii Remote or Nunchuk) but simply attacking with the same two commands 
 usually gets the job done. Finally, despite having spikes on his shoes, the Werehog possesses movements 
 that are far too sensitive. You'll see the Werehog sliding across platforms, especially when dashing. 
 What's even worse is that these Werehog levels appear much more often than the Sonic levels, and 
 usually last much longer. After three or four Werehog stages in a row, you'll no doubt long for 
 a fast-paced Sonic stage. In all honesty, the Werehog sequences aren't as bad as I originally had 
 assumed, but the end result still feels gimmicky and unpolished in a Sonic game.
  
  The controls in Sonic Unleashed are different for the Sonic and Werehog levels. In the daytime, 
 the controls are typical platformer fare. Sonic can jump and crouch with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk's 
 buttons and triggers, with motion mapped to the Nunchuk's analog stick. By shaking the Wii Remote, 
 Sonic can boost using Ring Energy or use a homing attack in mid-air. There's a ton of nuances and 
 tricks that Sonic can do in the different levels, which adds plenty of variety to the stages. As 
 the Werehog, Sonic can punch by swinging the Wii Remote or Nunchuk, with the buttons being used 
 for jumping, climbing, and guarding. Though the over-sensitivity of the Werehog's movements hurt 
 the game, the daytime controls are pretty tight. The game also supports Classic and Gamecube controllers. 
 I found myself using the Gamecube controller for the most part, but the Wii controls are definitely 
 an improvement over past Sonic games. You may get a little tired swinging your arms around when 
 faced with enemies, but the controls overall generally work well.
  
  Sonic Unleashed is a great looking Wii game. Although it doesn't reach the graphical caliber of 
 games like Super Mario Galaxy, the game moves at a strong clip. Slowdown is extremely rare, even 
 when facing a slew of enemies as the Werehog or exploring over-the-top architecture as Sonic. There 
 are some great cutscenes throughout, though these are mostly overshadowed by scrolling text and 
 still-screens of characters. Once Sonic Unleashed really gets going, however, it moves extremely 
 fluidly and the entire world comes to life in brilliant detail. The sound design is pretty standard 
 for Sonic games; you get the voice acting you expect from Sonic and crew, though the writing this 
 time around will probably get on your nerves more than usual. An interesting change-up is the new 
 orchestral themes that have replaced the hard rock of past games. This does give the game a larger 
 scope, and while I personally longed for some intense guitar riffs during the different stages, 
 the overall sound design manages to produce a truly epic set of themes. The presentation is actually 
 quite impressive for a Wii game, both graphically and sound-wise.
  
  Pros
  + Sonic sequences recapture a lot of what made Sonic games great
  + Werehog beat-em-up sequences 
 aren't awful
  + Nice presentation
  + Solid controls
  
  Cons
  - Werehog platforming controls are too sensitive
  - Werehog platforming has no controllable camera
 
  - Strict imbalance between Sonic and Werehog sequences
  - Some levels' designs aren't as strong as others
  
  Sonic Unleashed is definitely a step in 
 the right direction, but with each great improvement that the Sonic stages introduce, the Werehog 
 comes in and creates a new problem. The Sonic stages are remarkably improved from past Sonic titles; 
 the clever balance of speed and abilities makes them some of the best stages seen in a Sonic title 
 since Sonic Adventure itself. The Werehog stages, on the other hand, feel tired and sloppy. The 
 sensitive controls and non-existent camera are bad enough, but being that you have to play through 
 so many of the nighttime levels to get to the daytime levels is just plain annoying. Deep down 
 in the gameplay of Sonic Unleashed is a refreshing new world for Sonic to explore, speedy antics 
 and all. If you can put up with stage after stage of the Werehog, you'll find some excellent high-speed 
 action in Sonic's stages. Overall, Sonic Unleashed is basically two games in one: the excellent 
 daytime levels and the average nighttime levels. This is easily one of the best 3-D representations 
 of the hedgehog hero ever, though the Werehog levels will no doubt sour the end result. Sonic fans 
 should buy it for the excellent daytime levels; anyone else should best rent it.

Review:  
  Sonic last few years of gaming have not been so great then expected. While I personally didn't 
 have much problem with titles like Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic and the Secret Rings or Sonic the 
 Hedgehog 06, they were certainly not for everyone like the sonic adventure series on the dreamcast 
 and Gamecube. That's when Sega decides to change things by bringing us a Sonic RPG on the DS and 
 a new adventure of sonic for all consoles that promises to deliver the sonic old school style we 
 know and love. Yet, when Sega announced that Sonic was going to transform in a wolf named werehog, 
 many started to doubt again. So, does Sonic Unleashed really brings an incredible sonic adventure 
 we been looking forward to or is it just another sonic game that does not reach expectations?
 
  
  The story for the most part is very traditional sonic, once again Dr. Eggman is up to no good. 
 This time around Dr. Eggman is successful at the beginning of the story by using a special beam 
 to break apart the earth and at the same time he is transforming sonic into werehog, then he launches 
 sonic with the chaos emeralds into space. In the end, Sonic must now stop Eggman by finding the 
 chaos emeralds scattered around the different continents of the world but with a twist, at night 
 he will transform into werehog. 
  
  The story overall is not something really that interesting to get excited about, and is a shame 
 because they have been other sonic games that have pull off a well developed story. Plus, if you 
 enjoyed the presence of other sonic characters, then you are going to be disappointed because you 
 only get a new character named Chip and the traditional Tails & Amy, that don't do much in the 
 game besides talking non-sense. Plus, you also get some human characters around the different continents 
 that simply make the story uninteresting.
  
  Like mentioned before, the game features many human characters because you get to explore a city 
 of each continent to find out where to go next. Apparently, Sega thinks the people enjoyed exploring 
 Soleanna on Sonic the Hedgehog 06, and going through Station Square and other places in the first 
 Sonic Adventure, so they included this city section in Unleashed as well. On the other consoles, 
 you will go in 3-D mode exploring the city like done in previous games. Luckily, the Wii version 
 is all point and click to figure out where is the person you need to get to so he can then take 
 you to the next level. Still, it feels very pointless when you just want to simply go and run through 
 the next stage.
  
  The game kicks off with Sonic stages that only take place in the day, which are pretty impressive 
 with great sense of speed, on the 3-D sections. The 3-D sections of Sonic's levels consist mostly 
 of running fast while avoid different obstacles and performing special tricks along the way. The 
 camera's point of view in these sections is like Sonic and the Secret Rings except you can control 
 Sonic freely. Yet, if you are going to go backwards, the camera is quite a big mess. Still, these 
 sections are the best part of the entire game and that should have been the entire game not just 
 parts.
  
  Unfortunately, Sega decided to somehow bring back some old school sonic spirit by putting the other 
 sections of a Sonic level in 2-D. Which is not a bad idea, but these sections make Sonic run slower 
 instead of making him go faster. Also, these sections are the ones with most obstacles and traps 
 on the way, that you can only know their presence by falling into them for the first time. The 
 2-D sections that were suppose to give more energy to this game does the complete opposite, not 
 to mention they share similar aspects in every level. 
  
  Even with those flaws mentioned before, Unleashed could have been a nice game to play for everyone 
 with the Sonic levels alone. Yet, they decided to give some variety to the game by turning Sonic 
 in a wolf named Werehog at night, to deliver slower-paced platforming levels. They also decided 
 to include a lot of combat in these levels as well, in which most of the time you can't progress 
 in the level until you have beaten all the enemies. The combat is pretty random by just moving 
 the controllers around to make Werehog punch the enemies, even though it features some combos, 
 they don't make much a difference. Not to mention the controls are sometimes unresponsive in these 
 battles.
  
  Other times where the controls are unresponsive with werehog is when you are going to grab a pole, 
 you must press and hold the B button to make the werehog's arms stretch to grab the pole and then 
 start swinging by still holding the B button, and once you are ready to jump, then you release 
 the B button. It would have been better if you only had to press the B button but not to hold it. 
 That's not to say the werehog part is awful, it has some really great platforming moments with 
 some nice tricks and challenges but they are usually interrupted by obligated combat or unresponsive 
 controls.
  
  The boss fights during the day with Sonic are some of the most impressive in a Sonic game. The 
 boss fights with Sonic involves Sonic running forward, chasing Eggman inside one of his robots 
 avoiding all of his attacks and then doing a homing attack in the cockpit where he seats. The part 
 that makes this boss fights really exciting is that they are in high speed non-stop. On the werehog, 
 you get a more traditional platforming boss battle in which you must find the boss' weakness and 
 attack it; these boss fights are pretty decent even if sometimes the camera gets on the way.
  
  In terms of the visuals, Sonic Unleashed is probably one of the best looking games on the Wii 
 and of Sonic as well. When there is a lot of speed in the 3-D sections, the graphics are really 
 great and rarely cause any framerate slowdowns. The character design looks great in both cut-scenes 
 and during the game, including some great detailed fur of the werehog. The levels are also well 
 designed in detail with many objects and interesting backgrounds that relate to each continent 
 you visited, such as the Great Wall of China in a werehog stage. It even opens with a stunning 
 cut-scene that shows the potential that Sonic has to be on the big screen.
  
  Sadly, on the audio department, they decided to change the style of music used in previous sonic 
 games. During the stages, the music is more normal to hear but not inspiring enough with the fast 
 action going on. In some stages it is, but in most of them it really isn't or just sounds very 
 similar. When you are going to go in combat on the werehog stages it changes to a particular song 
 that always plays when there is a battle in werehog except in boss fights, and it gets really annoying 
 as you progress. The voiceovers are even disappointing on this game; Sonic's voice in werehog is 
 really weird, not deep enough for a wolf and sometimes even hard to understand. Why did they have 
 to change it? Sonic does not speak like a hedgehog; Rouge doesn't talk like a bat, so why make 
 sonic talk like a wolf when he is werehog, now that makes no sense at all, they should have just 
 made it deeper but it isn't either.
  
  The single player experience is not too long or short but it features some extra missions for you 
 to do that will help you unlock a few more things like cut-scenes, picture artworks, combos for 
 werehog etc. But beyond that, there is no multiplayer experience at all; neither offline nor online 
 multiplayer is featured in the game. And is a shame considering that just about every sonic game 
 does feature some multiplayer. The sonic stages are good enough that you will want to play them 
 again but not the werehog stages.
  
  Overall, Sonic Unleashed offers some fun and exciting sonic levels despite a few issues here and 
 there that prevent them to truly shine, but it also features werehog that offers some decent platforming 
 levels that definitely give some variety to the game but also weakens what sonic is all about. 
 The main problem with Sonic Unleashed is the idea to transform Sonic in werehog that feels unnecessary, 
 if the werehog stages were done by another character and were less in the game, they wouldn't bother 
 much. Sonic Unleashed is still a good game despite his issues, but it just does not deliver quite 
 enough sonic thrills to recommend it for the fans. The only safe way to go is to rent the game 
 first and see if you can tolerate the werehog stages because they are more of them instead of more 
 Sonic stages.

Review:  It's quite fitting that Sonic Unleashed sees Sonic turning into a werewolf, because it's pretty 
 much a game of two halves. One half is, in our opinion, the best 3D Sonic game we've ever played. 
 The other half however is a generic, repetitive action platformer.
  
  Sonic's history in 3D gaming has had more ups and downs than the National Press-Up League, mainly 
 due to two reasons: speed and glitches. If it wasn't bad enough that many 3D Sonic games are simply 
 far too fast to be controllable (and therefore enjoyable) , it's even worse when dodgy coding means 
 you randomly miss the trigger for an important set-piece, often chucking you down a hole as a result 
 or - even worse - glitching you through the scenery and making you die as you fall off the edge 
 of the level. It's happened since Sonic's first three-dimensional adventure (Sonic Adventure on 
 the Dreamcast) , and has been an irritating bug in pretty much every one since. Except this one.
 
  
  Yes, there are times when you'll miss a jump and fall down a hole. But this time around 99% of 
 the time it will be your fault, not the game's. It's a test of your ability to navigate the game's 
 obstacles, not your ability to dodge glitches. Simply put, developer Dimps (who was responsible 
 for the Sonic Rush games on the DS) has created a near-flawless game engine with almost no room 
 for bugs. It's pure Sonic gameplay without the frustration of unpreventable deaths.
  
  2D Or Not 2D
  Not only are these levels fun to play as a result, playing through them is also 
 a complete feast for the eyes. As Sonic zips round each stage, flipping from 3D to 2D and back 
 again, there's no denying that it's impressive stuff and some of the best-looking action you'll 
 see on the Wii. More importantly, it never affects the gameplay negatively: those 2D-to-3D switches 
 could have been a nightmare to control but we never had any problems any time they occurred.
  
  We'd go so far as to say that the normal Sonic levels in Sonic Unleashed are the best 3D Sonic 
 levels we've ever played in a game. Had the game been comprised solely of this type of level then 
 it'd be well into Gold Award territory. Unfortunately, as we all know, there's the matter of those 
 werehog levels to deal with.
  
  Simply put, they're dull. That's not to say they're broken or anything like that: the control system 
 is fine and everything works as it should. It's just that all you do is wander from one place to 
 the next and beat up loads of characterless, generic enemies. Once they're all dead the barrier 
 blocking your progress is removed and you move on. Sometimes you get a different barrier which 
 can only be removed by collecting three objects. Other times you'll have to climb poles or swing 
 over gaps to get to the next fighting section. And that's pretty much all that happens throughout 
 all 25 different werehog stages. 
  
  
  It's so repetitive that even the music that plays when enemies appear is exactly the same whether 
 you're on the first or last level. The enemies aren't particularly taxing either: the vast majority 
 can be defeated by simply alternating left and right punches.
  
  Were Not Amused
  We can understand why the werewolf levels have been put in there: we'd imagine it was both to add 
 a bit of variety and to extend the game's length. After all, the normal Sonic levels can take around 
 four or five minutes to complete each, and given that you're ploughing through them at top speed 
 this means they're pretty huge levels which must have taken ages to create. In total though there 
 are only seven of these levels, meaning you can have them all licked in less than hour. As a result, 
 the 25 werehog levels (which can take anything up to eight or nine minutes each to complete) make 
 up the majority of the gameplay.
  
  The game attempts to make up for this by offering different challenges for each of the seven normal 
 Sonic levels, but these challenges are pretty basic (collect a number of rings before time runs 
 out, finish the level in a certain time, finish the level without taking damage) and still take 
 place within the same seven levels.
  
  Also annoying are the world map sections, which are completely pointless. Whereas other versions 
 of the game see Sonic running about various hub levels talking to people in order to find each 
 country's shrine, the Wii version simply gives you a list of areas which you choose to view static 
 text screens where Sonic talks to people. One of them will reveal the shrine, and then you can 
 start playing again. 
  It's a complete waste of time and only delays things when all you'll want to do is get into the 
 action.
  
  
  Feeling Blue
  We realise this review seems mainly negative, but that's only because we're so disappointed at 
 what this could have been. It's extremely important to realise that we think the normal Sonic sections, 
 limited as they are, offer the best 3D Sonic platforming action we've ever played: we can't stress 
 that enough. The game even allows players to ditch the Wii Remote and Nunchuk setup (which is quite 
 fiddly at times) and play with the Classic Controller or even the GameCube controller. We'd recommend 
 the Classic Controller since it offers the most comfortable set-up and splits the speed boost and 
 attack controls (whereas the Remote makes you do both by flicking the Remote, which can be confusing) .
 
  
  There's no doubt that if you're already a fan of past 3D Sonic games you'll love Sonic Unleashed, 
 and may even think it's the best so far, despite the werehog sections. After all, the rest of the 
 game is classic Sonic: the voice acting is embarrassingly cheesy, the usual crew pop up (Tails, 
 Amy, Eggman and the like) , the music is the same love-it-or-hate-it rock stuff and Super Sonic 
 even makes an appearance. There's even the necessary 'new character you might like but will probably 
 hate' in the shape of Chip, an admittedly cute flying creature with an annoying voice.
  
  Simply put, the Sonic stages are the best we've played since the Mega Drive days. It's just a shame 
 that had it focused more on these levels and had less werehog stuff in it, it could have been absolutely 
 essential. As it is, it's only half awesome.

Review:  A classic occasion of a good idea gone bad... It was a great idea to do something new to Sonic, 
 but... A WEREHOG?!! It's the most idiotic-concerning animal I've EVER heard of. Sega could have 
 done way better. The transitions to 2D environments are great for Day Stages, and the speed is 
 tremendous. HOWEVER, soon comes sloppy Werehog. C'mon, Sega. When we asked to play as only Sonic, 
 we meant Sonic the HEDGEHOG... What a big letdown... The overall gameplay is good and controls 
 are perfectly responsive. Story is great with what they worked with, however, although we may not 
 like the Werehog, it's what made the story so great. Music is amazingly addictive and graphics 
 are up to capacity. I'd give an 8... just for overall design. I hope Sega reads this. Maybe it'll 
 give a good idea toward the game AFTER Black Knight... (which may also suck, but only time will 
 tell)

Review:  This Wii version is Bad! The Levels are far too short, the gameplay has much to be desired, and 
 difficulty is much too easy. This is killing Sonic and killing me as a Sonic fan.
  
  Sonic is so slow in this game. It looks like he going for a jog when running normally. The Speed 
 boost is good but not by a lot. It only helps so much. The fact that he can spindash when boosting 
 and hitting a dash panel is a plus. It actually makes him look fast, but overall he's still slow. 
 In comparision with 360 version the Wii Sonic would have been left in the dust.
  
  Content wise, this game is missing a lot of content that the 360 version has. Which is very disappointing 
 for me and other hardcore Sonic fans. We don't even get a hub to explore around. Just a dark, dank 
 castle or temple. We don't get a level up system for Sonic where we can bring up his speed and 
 boost, and we don't get to search and find new item or power ups. There just given to him from 
 the start. This adds to the problem of the game being easy.
  
  The difficulty of this game is sad. Any dedicated gamer could beat this game in less than a day. 
 Which is really sad. Also from what I've noticed between the two versions, the tails levels are 
 missing from this game. Those were actually enjoyable to some extent. 
  One thing that really bothered me with this game is that the final boss fight sucked! It was too 
 easy to beat. I felt so angery about that. It was barly worth playing at all. One final thing that 
 is missing from this game that would have made it good was the buttom comand squence that they 
 gave for the warehog and the insane combo system. It would have been nice to more than just 2 combos 
 on an enemy.
  
  The level designs are nice and beautiful to look at but doesn't leave much to the imagination, 
 and I know my eyes aren't playing tricks on me but I swear on Spangolia when Sonic is coming down 
 from the tower, in the background with the houses, they look like cardboard backgrounds used on 
 old movie sets. It appears to me someone at SEGA Got lazy. Another thing about the levels is there 
 are not that many different paths to the finish which in turn means not that much exploration of 
 the level. One thing that pissed me off about this game was no Mazuri and no Empire City, and me 
 and other Sonic fans really wanted Empire City. Probably the best level in the 360 version. That 
 was a major let down.
  
  All I can say about the werehog is this. JUST DON'T DO IT. The werehog in this game is pointless. 
 The levels are bad and tiring. It gets very boring after a long time. There are potenially no combos 
 at all in this game, specials are virtually useless, and the guard system is trash. The controls 
 are bad and choppy. When I make sonic move he runs and when I make him run he walks. Every werehog 
 board I've played I've died on because of the bad controls. Activating the werehog mode makes it 
 crazy easy to beat boss' and enemy's. The werehog gameplay is just overall bad. Also a noted graphical 
 difference between the two version. 360 = Awesome looking werehog. Wii = Wet werehog that looks 
 like it was make out of clay, or maybe Sonic was using Super thick hair jell to put his fur back 
 with. All I can say is that he just looks bad. SEGA = Lazy. 
  
  One final thing that I for one have found very retarded is the 2 life limited they give you. Instead 
 of collecting 100 rings to be rewarded with an extra life, you get ................. NOTHING!
 
  Whose bright idea was this. Continuely dying on the same board and getting a game over and having 
 the start the whole level over really gets boring and repetitive to the point where you don't want 
 play the game no more. Why they would give us a 2 life limit I don't know, but for future reference 
 they better put back the extra life system or I'm just not gonna buy anymore Sonic games, Because 
 this is rediculous.
  
  All in all, I really wish I had a 360 because this game was an epic fail for me and friends.
 
  
  I don't know where people are getting this idea that the Wii version is better than the 360 version, 
 but all I can say is you better start taking your medication in double douses.
  
  Unless you people like simple Sonic games where Sonic moves slow, is easy to beat, and has no depth 
 with barely any content or gameplay then stick to this, because you people don't know what a good 
 Sonic game is.
  
  I can only assume that the softcore fans are rating this game.

Review:  Sonic's big come back has finally arrived again! The game is simply amazing!! The daytime stages 
 are addicting for some reason. The werehog well I really liked the werehog. But I really think 
 daytime stages are the best in the game. This game has no frame rate problems at all. The werehog 
 it's really fun you can smash enemies, do puzzles, etc. This game won't disappoint you at all! 
 I haven't played the PS3 version yet so I can't really compare it to the two systems. The bad thing 
 is that the werehog stages can be hard at times. It is challenging but that's the one I like about 
 the werehog. I wish the controls of the dash button wouldn't have to be tap the stick twice. You 
 might fall off the cliff if you do. Sonic on the other hand I can't really think of anything bad 
 about it really. Except that it can be a little improved by the Sega team. I mean I like it and 
 all but it could use a little more platforms like SA2. This is all I have to say about this game 
 it is the BEST sonic game EVER!!

Review:  This game is just awesome. You all know the story, so I'll just get to the gaming review. The daytime 
 levels are simply amazing. while your speeding through the level, you will feel the game was worth 
 every penny. Even though they get really frustrating when you try to get an S or beat someone's 
 score, it all comes out really well. Also, the frame rate and the graphics are so high, its a wonder 
 this came to the Wii. The controls feel natural, especially the homing attack, which you shake 
 when the targeting aims at a robot. The change from 2-D to 3-D view is also really great, it happens 
 at great times, and it gives the game a cinematic view so you and others would just want to watch 
 as you speed through the level.
  In the nighttime levels, the not-so-fast werehog has a different way of playing; the beat-um-up 
 way. You go through the levels and beat up all the fools who dare stand in your way (all of them, 
 since you have to beat them to keep going) . The nunchuk is your left hand, while the WiiMote is 
 your right hand (sorry lefties) , and the result is fantstic. SSBB veterans should quickly catch 
 on, and the enemies are fun to beat up. My only complaint here is a very big one, and that is that 
 even though the nighttime stages are extremely fun, the daytime stages are so fun that you just 
 want to get through them to reach the next daytime level. Sega should have made a better reason 
 to play the nighttime levels.
  All in all, the game is awesome and highly addictive, and I think it is the right balance of speed 
 and fists.

Review:  Thanks to the fast paced levels and many other new add ins, the Sonic Unleashed is by far the most 
 entertaining and side missions keep you busy. Compared to old Sonic games where you need rings 
 as your life, there is a life gauge that fills up as many rings you get. The best part is that 
 the rings like SA2 (Probably SA also but I don't remember much) can be used as money to buy stuff. 
 One of the things that I seen comeback is the upgrades like the ones you would get in SA and SA2) 
 and there is couple that you will love. Look forward to another new character (Chip) who will kind 
 of cheer you up and tends to be one of the most funniest characters I have met by far. The professor 
 sounds like your average one-of-a-kind character that you will kind of go to for hints, info and 
 other secrets but he will only give you that in exchange for your souvenirs that you will collect 
 throughout the game. 
  
  To all the hardcore Sonic fans. You will not regret buying this.

Review:  Lately I have been quite bored and looking for a new game to play. I was excitedly anticipating 
 the release of Sonic Unleashed for a while once I had heard about it, but as I am never one to 
 go out and buy a game immediately upon release, (except on rare occasions when I already know I 
 am going to love the game) , I waited for a while to see what kind of reviews the game would get.
 
  
  I became disappointed when I started seeing mixed reviews about the game, and I was especially 
 appalled when I saw the 3.0 rating that was given to the Xbox version. Luckily, however, my brother 
 recently started working at GameStop and he is able to rent games for a few days for free, so he 
 was able to bring it home for me to try.
  
  I began playing it, and played it for probably just over 2 hours. Here is roughly how my experience 
 went:
  
  Cool opening. Neat. ... Cutscene, cutscene, cutscene, cutscene... Tutorial, tutorial, tutorial, 
 tutorial, tutorial, tutorial, tutorial... Text skipping, text skipping, text skipping... "Okay, 
 it's finally time to play for real!". About 5 minutes of decently fun Sonic stages. Cutscene, cutscene, 
 cutscene... Text skipping, text skipping text skipping... "Okay, time for Werehog stages, I'll 
 try to be open minded." ... 30 minutes of boring Werehog stages. "Okay, got that over with, now 
 I'll get to play as regular Sonic for a while, right?" WRONG. Cutscene, cutscene, cutscene... Text 
 skipping, text skipping, text skipping... MORE Werehog stages? "Okay, I'll buckle down and get 
 them over with". 30 minutes of boring Werehog stages. "Whew, okay, regular Sonic here I come!" 
 WRONG AGAIN. Cutscene, cutscene, cutscene, and don't forget the text skipping, and then it's time 
 for more Werehog levels! ...
  
  In summary, after just over 2 hours of gameplay, the MAJORITY of my time had been spent watching 
 relatively boring cutscenes, skipping through useless text information in the different "village" 
 areas, and playing through Werehog stages which, despite my effort to remain open-minded about 
 them, quickly became boring, slow, and repetitive. From reading other reviews about this game, 
 it seems to be the general consensus that there is WAY too much Werehog compared to the short amount 
 of time that you get to spend playing as regular Sonic during the daytime levels.
  
  This has pretty much extinguished my desire to play the game. I just don't feel the motivation 
 to get through the 'chore' of playing through the Werehog levels in order to have actual fun during 
 the regular Sonic levels which are way too few and far between, not to mention short. 
  
  Just as many other reviews have said, this game is a disappointment, made even more disappointing 
 by the fact that, if the Werehog element (as well as the cutscenes and text) were eliminated, it 
 would probably be great. I would definitely rent this game first. If, after two hours, like me, 
 you find yourself dreading the Werehog stages and wanting to shut the game off, this game is definitely 
 not for you. If you can get past the Werehog stages, you might have fun with the game.
  
  Rent it first. Don't risk wasting $50.

Review:  Sonic Unleashed is sonic comeback or is it. Keep reading to find out.
  
  Story: Eggman up to no good as usually. So are hero Sonic races into action. Eggman catches Sonic, sonic 
 changes to Super Sonic. Eggman traps Super Sonic (totally possible) . Eggman use the power of the chaos 
 emeralds to break the earth into pieces. Sonic absorbs the negative power of the chaos emeralds. Thus 
 creating the Werehog. Sonic fell too earth. Weird dog thing (Chip) saves him. Weird dog thing (Chip) 
 loses his memory. Sonic now must Return the earth to normal, and help his new friend (Chip) get his 
 memory back.
  
  Gameplay: Sonic Unleashed is separated into two gameplay types. Classic Sonic & Platforming/Beat'em 
 up (Werehog) .
  
  Sonic Gameplay: Sega/Dimps managed to give sonic something he hasn't had in a long time. A good sense 
 of speed. Which is always good. The controls are good and don't usually not respond. Overall it's 
 fast and doesn't take much skill.
  
  Werehog Gameplay: These is what I call Sega trying another project, with us as the test rats. Really 
 I like these stages. Though most of the time I was praying for night to end. It just Platforming. With 
 the gimmick of sonic having screechy arms (Monkey D. Luffy ripoff) . But it will save you in tight 
 spots, like falling. Beat up gameplay is basically about combos.
  
  Sounds: The music is great and matches every place you go to on earth.
  
  Voice acting:
  Sonic/Jason:8/10
 
  Eggman/Mike9/10
  Chip's voice:7/10 
  Tails's voice:7/10
  Amy's voice:7/10
  
  Presentation: Good graphics. Great level design. That is all.
  
  Overall: This is a good game. Pick 
 it up if you have the money. Or give it to somebody as a holiday gift.

Review:  The day this game came out, I was in London at the time, so I had to wait until I got home to play 
 it. This didn't leave me much time to play it that night, but I enjoyed myself so much that I never 
 went to the next continent until the next day. I spent my time playing through the Apotos stages 
 over & over, experiencing the thrilling speed of the daytime stages & the brute force of the night 
 time stages.
  
  The game doesn't give off very good first impressions when you see the awful hub-worlds that involve 
 moving the control stick around until the game finally decides to select the location you want 
 - At least on Sonic 06 you could jump up onto the rooftops & muck around - I don't see why they 
 couldn't make propper hubs. But thankfuly, the levels turned out superb!
  
  When you first play the daytime stages, you can't help but fall addicted to them. The speed is 
 intense, you start to feel like an unstoppable force - which you actually are, pretty much. Most 
 deaths tend to be comical ones as opposed to going wrong difficult areas. This makes the game too 
 easy, though. As fun as rocketting around at extreme speed is, it's missing the challenge. Sure 
 it can be a bit of a target to get a rank S on some of the more tedious stages, but it's still 
 missing harder parts of stages. The only hard daytime stage in the game is on the seventh continet, 
 but the way it's made makes it a stage you'd rather avoid.
  But after you beat the game, you still can't help but play some of these stages again with no particular 
 reason. They're just addictive. It's also nice to compare times with your records, or your records 
 with other poeples'. You might even play the stages with no particular will to beat your time, 
 but get excited when you find you've beaten your record in the end of stage results.
  
  The daytime stages involve a lot of speed, & when they put in shortcuts, you need to have a good 
 sense of awareness while focussing of maintaining a good time, so it's not really mindless running. 
 Some more tedious shortcuts require you to work them out, while others require a good eye. For 
 exsample, on Chun-Nan, when you take the first upper route of the level, you find yourself doing 
 an action chain (Homing attacking a line of enemies) , but if you let yourself fall instead of attacking 
 the last enemy, you can continue the attack on a lower line of enemies, which leads you to a hidden 
 section of the stage &, if you go through all the Light Dash sections (Most of you should know 
 that a Light Dash is a move that makes you fly or run - depending on what game you're playing, 
 on this game, he seems to fly through them - through a row of rings) , you will be rewarded with 
 Secret Illustration 2. This goes to show that keeping an eye out for shortcuts is rewarding, you 
 should also keep an eye out for stray item boxes to get more unlockables.
  Sadly, performing a Light slows you down in this game, unless you do one in the air, which isn't 
 very common.
  
  After the sheer speed & fun of the daytime stages, you then get the slow, combat-based night-time 
 stages with questionable controlls, gameplay & just about questionable everything.
  At night, due to the corruption of the Chaos Emeralds' power, Sonic turns into a feirce Werehog 
 with big (And stretchy) arms.
  Nobody will like the Werehog at first. The contolls seem hard to use & he's not easy to control. 
 Fighting feels like a choore. But after the first couple of stages, you'll get used to it & it 
 will then seem like a breeze. But you're either going to love the Werehog or hate him. The combat 
 system is simple: Beat all the enemies to a pulp & move on. This doesn't go over very well for 
 people who don't like the Werehog, as it involves the dodgey motion sensoring of the wii remote 
 & nunchuck, or bashing L & R like crazy with a GCN controller. Sometimes you vary between L & R 
 (Or wii remote & nunchuck) too quickly & do a special attack by accident, but it doesn't really 
 change the outcome of the fight - which is good since it can happen a lot unless you have a brilliant 
 sense of timing. The Werehog also features jumping glitches where he refuses to jump 8/10 times 
 you tell him to. It's like the daytime stages with the homing attacks (And boost if you're using 
 the wii remote) - it just doesn't respond 9/10 times.
  
  The Werehog's super-stertchy arms come in quite handy as they let you grab onto ledges, swing on 
 poles & deliver devistating atacks on your foes. If you like the Werehog, you'll be begging for 
 more Werehog stages by the end of the game - For people like that, they'll be please with the whopping 
 five Werehog stages on the seventh continet. For a lot of you, you'll rather not do those stages, 
 though.
  But the Werehog does get rather enjoyable once you aquire all te combat upgrades & get all four 
 of his stats to the highest level (That's level 5, by the way) , then you get a huge health bar 
 & deadly attack power, plus, Unleashed Mode (Where the Werehog goes hyper & can completely obliterate 
 most enemies in at most a couple of combos) is powerful on its own, combined with the attack, you 
 end up thrashing enemies with complete ease. Though the Werehog levels can seem hard at first, 
 you'll get used to them & find them a breeze late in the game.
  But the Werehog falls short on ease when it comes to platforming sections. These can be very cruel, 
 they can be from merely sliding against a wall to loads of tedious jumps. There's one stage in 
 the game where you have to jump accross moving logs with nothing but whirlpools beneath you, it 
 involves many tough leaps.
  
  In short, the quality of the Werehog's gameplay is yours to decide, as it appeals to some people, 
 but not others, so you can't really put an un-biast grade on them.
  
  The game's storyline is lightly told, there isn't much sense of acheivement as there should be 
 when you complete the game, but you can still understand hwat's going on. The music in the game 
 fits the stages, too. In the daytime, you have really fast-paced & enthusiastic music, to make 
 you want to go as fast as possible, & in the night-time you get music that helps you concentrate, 
 you can tell it's for night-time levels by hearing it alone without knowing the game it's from. 
 As soon as you enter a fight, you get music that encourages you to start mashing those buttons.
 
  
  The bosses are simple, but effective & easy to get an S-Rank on, but aren't must of a challenge, 
 as with most of the game. But there are only eight bosses in the game - Four Werehog bosses, three 
 daytime bosses & the last boss (Take a guess who with) .
  
  The game falls short on Daytime stages & bosses, & has way more Werehog stages, but also falls 
 short in general, you should be able to beat it in two-four days, but it's worth playing!
  
  Sonic Unleashed is by far the best Sonic game ever since he went 3D. It still doesn't beat 
 the classics, though.
  SEGA want to revive Sonic, this won't revive it, but it's still helping our favourite hedgehog 
 recover. If their next attempt is 100% consistant of our beloved daytime stages of Sonic Unleashed, 
 it might just revive Sonic completely.

Review:  The game is worth buying if you are good old fashion sonic fan thats been through everything but 
 if your new you might not like it as much. Its kind of cheesy but its well thought out and has 
 excellent graphics and story play. As all sonic games it stars sonic, tails, eggman, amy, and a 
 couple of new fellows. With sonic you run through the game like the normal sonic games of the century 
 but with a few adjustments added to make it more fun. But with dark sonic that is caused by dr. 
 eggman its more of a fighting game that kinda reminds me of kingdom hearts or god of war. Where 
 things just keep popping out of the ground. There's not much too it though its pretty easy if you 
 are a good wii controler. the story line is the intresting part it just makes the game all the 
 wow to play it. WOW

Review:  Those people complaning about the new sonic games new styles like shadow the hedgehog, sonic chronicles, 
 unleashed and the upcoming black knight should just stop whinging. If there was no change people 
 would get bored.... go home to your sega megadrive grannys. The new features are good and the graphics 
 speak for itself. Daytime levels let you speed through different continental themed areas without 
 skipping frames while in high speed. The night stages are what people are complaining about. Sure 
 hes not speeding through the streets but it is a new FUN (that was directed to all you baggers 
 out there.) way to play sonic. Sonic is as unstoppable with strengh now as he is with speed.
  
  This game has stunning backdrops even though its a bit of a blur at the speeds your flying 
 at which is a good thing. The gameplay is spectacular from a non-nintendo performer and standards 
 of games are catching up to Twilight princess and smb, the best games so far. Eggman actually looks 
 like a real person now. Poor Eggman now he has to fit in.
  
  Kudos to you SEGA,
  Zelda9696.

Review:  Pros: Daytime stages are fun.
  
  Cons: Everything else is a complete disaster.
  
  Sonic the Hedgehog has returned with his fun, fast-paced action. There's plenty of running, jumping 
 and smashing to go around. Unfortunately, Sonic has brought a friend this time. A friend whoes 
 only purpose is to absolutely destroy an otherwise great game. Incase you haven't guessed, this 
 friend is the Werehog - a hideous, disgusting beast whoes levels are so slow and terrible that 
 no matter how hard you try, you can't find any joy or excitement in. Platforming segments are terrible, 
 controls are unresponsive, the camera is frustrating, and combat is nothing more than tedious button 
 mashing.
  
  All of the games missions are boring. You're given absolutely no reason to want to complete them, 
 because they're nothing more than "get to the end". There aren't ever any twists in the levels 
 to make them special, it's all just running - or in the Werehog's case, walking - to the goal, 
 with a few awful platforming segments, and some truly random and poorly placed button matching 
 sequences thrown in between. And while Werehog segments are packed full to bursting with enemies 
 that never change, Sonic the Hedgehog's stages have very few enemies thrown in, most of which aren't 
 even threatening unless you're trying to die. 
  
  There's not even an equal number of Sonic and Werehog levels in the game. Sonic levels come in 
 very rarely and are short and only contain one real mission, where as Werehog levels take up the 
 rest of the game with long, boring missions that come in packs of at least 3. And everytime you 
 collect a tablet, you have to go back to see the Professor so that you can skip the terrible dialogue 
 and get on to the next level. But don't get you're hopes up, because it's probably just another 
 Werehog segment. 
  
  Speaking of terrible dialogue, there are these awful sequences between continents in which you 
 have to talk to civilians to gain information that's completely useless, because all that speaking 
 to people does is open up new worlds, meaning that you have no reason to even read the text. There 
 are also some terrible, blurry, long, boring, useless, unskippable cutscenes, which force you to 
 listen to the game's terrible voice acting. The worst part of all is that Werehog Sonic sounds 
 like a three-year-old trying to sound like a monster. Sonic's voice is different as well - and 
 it's for the worse. Other characters like Tails return to test your patience as well, with voices 
 so terrible that it's not worth muting just because you'll have these terrible dreams about what 
 the company was thinking when they hired these "voice actors". And even if you manage to save yourself 
 the pain of listening to the voice acting from the beginning by muting your television before you 
 begin, you still have to deal with the terrible dialogue thanks to the subtitles that the game 
 just has to have. 
  
  The only good thing about Sonic Unleashed is that little bit of joy you get when you finally get 
 to play as Sonic again. But that joy is immediately taken away 5 minutes after you begin the level 
 and you're back to playing as the Werehog again. You can go back to levels and try to collect all 
 the items, but since there's nothing to tell you how to get them, you'll have to play through the 
 levels over and over again to finally get more. Overall, Sonic Unleashed is a disappointment on 
 every level, and while daytime stages are fun while they last, Werehog stages manage to completely 
 ruin the game in ways you wouldn't believe. Sonic fans will be pleased - or otherwise pretend to 
 be, but for the rest of us, it's pretty much what you expected.

Review:  This game is a lot of fun. The daylight levels give you an accurate sense of speed (as accurate 
 as possible when playing as sonic...) , and the graphics look amazing, even on the Wii's less robust 
 graphics engine. I have been playing the game for a full 15 hours (without repeats) , and I only 
 have four continents saved. Night levels can be drag though. This game is a must own for Wii owners.
 
  
  The night levels, while interesting, take up to much time, and there are simply not enough daytime 
 levels to make up for it. On the flip-side, night levels offer you the chance to use some new powers 
 (like extendable arms...) You basically button mash enemies into the ground. This is cool. What 
 makes it cooler is the amount of puzzles you have to solve. I'm definitely a puzzle guy, and I 
 find that the puzzles generally help make the levels better by giving you something to do rather 
 than just smash wave after wave of enemies
  
  All-in-All, solid game. Reminds of Sonic Adventure for the
  Dreamcast.

Review:  Of all things sonic has to go through in order to stop Dr. Eggman schemes, this is the biggest 
 reason yet. Now with a strange ability to go to a werehog only during the night change the flow 
 of the game for all those that played sonic games. with the whole speeding around the level idea 
 to get your blood flowing in Daytime as sonic, to a battle happy maniac in the Nighttime. Interesting 
 things go on as you explore the world you go to, talking to people, wondering what's going on as 
 you slowly but surely connect the planet back together. Despite the fact that this is happening 
 you also are in another quest to recover your new found friends memories because of the fact that 
 sonic might have fell on him, and you have to restore the chaos emeralds to their natural state 
 with him tagging along hoping someone might know who he might be. overall if you like to play sonic 
 and be able to go about fighting during the night you should play this and consider the following.

Review:  This game made me so impressed. It's kind of like the Super Mario Galaxy of Sonic. Day stages are 
 fast paced. Almost everywhere, you have to be fast. Night stages are slow but involves extreme 
 fighting. If you like Tekken and Super Smash Bros. Brawl. You'll like the Night stages. If you 
 like Need for Speed Prostreet and Sonic and the Secret Rings. You'll like the Day stages. The controls 
 are good especially for night stages. If you want to punch to the right, swing the Wii remote. 
 If you want to punch to the left, swing the nunchuck. Swing both of them to do Were - Hammer. Swing 
 both of them while dashing, you will do Were - Wallop. Were - Wallop will make the enemies dizzy. 
 My favorite move in the Day Stages is Sonic Boost. Sonic Boost will let you move at mach speed 
 and desroy all enemies in the way. My favorite Night Stage move is the Were - Hammer. You have 
 to buy it as soon as possible! Want some chocolate?- Chip

Review:  Now, i don't like putting games down and i'll always find nice things to say about them. Although 
 there's an exception with Sonic Unleashed. Once we get passed ages of cut scenes and text based 
 exploration (you heard me right) and not forgetting repetitive fights. We actually get speed on!
 
  
  Let's start with the tutorial;
  For starters, each tutorial has it's own load screen e. g. first tutorial how to jump, then it loads. 
 How hard is it to include everything in one tutorial?
  After completing all of the tuts, we get to try out our newly found skills, and what an improvement 
 from previous games. You actually get a feel for how fast Sonic can travel, now with the ability 
 to drift corners.
  
  After going through the fist stages, we move onto *shudders* the 'Werehog' Stages. Sonic suddenly 
 loses his Fluffy blue coat for a black one with white tips (and all of a sudden is Dhalsim from 
 Street Fighter) . This feature is something the developers used to try and make the game different, 
 but let me tell you, it let it down. In a nutshell here are the faults with the 'Werehog';
  -The pace set from the 'Day' stages are suddenly slowed right down.
  - The fight music is something 
 from 'The Incredibles', the enemies don't pose a threat, and the only ones that do are the flying 
 enemies, (only because you can't hit them)
  - MORE LENGTHY TUTORIALS, and you better get used to the Werehog because there are a lot of stages.
 
  
  Now when you explore villages as Sonic,, everyone knows who you are and see's you as a good guy. 
 Now as the 'Werehog' people still somehow know it's sonic, and aren't afraid of him, Are you kidding 
 me?! If i saw that at the end of my bed i'd **** myself. (Also i want say who but there's one character 
 who doesn't know that your sonic, although he/she may as well)
  
  Overall i find the guy quite lack luster, although the fighting is ok (for about the first stage) 
 and Speed stages are great. The overall combination is poor.

Review:  Okay, I just got to admit that this game was fun. The graphics were very great. The levels were 
 very fun. They were very colorful and had many different routes to take. (I still wish that this 
 wii version had the same levels as the Xbox360 and Playstation 3) . I also liked the tense of speed. 
 Like Sonic and the Secret Rings, this game was very fast paced. Thats what make a Sonic game a 
 Sonic game. I've been waiting for this game to come out every since March, which was when I first 
 found out about this game. I knew that this game was going to be fun when I first saw screenshots 
 of it.
  
  Now... here comes the bad things about this game. Like every other game that has good things about 
 it there are some bad things about this game too and thats... THE WEREHOG, and... THE DIFFICULTY. 
 The werehog levels were very repetitive to me, and I was very ticked off when I found out that 
 there were more werehog levels than Sonic. I really got sick of being the werehog for 8 minutes 
 in the levels. Another bad thing about this game was the difficulty, I mean... C'mon sega, Alf Layla 
 wa Layla, Solaris, and even Biolizard was tougher than Dark Gaia. Also, I thought that this game 
 was riduclusly too short. I could've beaten this game with my eyes closed and my hands tied behind 
 my back... Naw: P I'm just kidding (if it wasn't for the werehog levels that will be possible for 
 me :P)
  
  Well... thats all I have to say. I've been waiting for this game all year and I knew that it would 
 be fun. Oh... and by the way, I think its cool how Sonic says HERE WE... GOOOOO. 
  
  That concludes my review... farewell folks :D

Review:  A Sonic game I had alot of high hopes for and I was expecting it to be good but it turned out the 
 same as the others dissapointing.
  
  The story starts out the evil Dr Eggman defeats Super Sonic and manages to split the planets apart. 
 He awakens Dark Gaia and Sonic ends up being a werehog and meets Chip who is annoying.
  
  The gameplay with Sonic is good nice fast amazing speed the problems are the levels don't last 
 long and you only do one full Sonic level whereas you play as the wereohg you get 3 or 4 levels 
 which are long and boring. The werehog is nothing special just seemed to be added to lengthen the 
 game out. I play a Sonic game to be one character Sonic the Hedgehog and he must have the most 
 play time in any Sonic game. The abilites for Sonic include speed boost, drift and homing attack 
 and it doesn't slow the game down and at times looks really amazing. Where as the werehog just 
 slows the pace down and it feels like you not playing a Sonic game. Sometimes it doesn't react 
 to the buttons you press. It seems its just button mashing and becomes tiresome and boring later 
 in the game that you just want to get the level over with but the annoying thing is in most parts 
 you have defeat every enemy as the werehog to progress further. Also chatting to people is annoying 
 and you can't skip cut scenes that end up long and boring.
  
  
  The game has an okay soundtrack but nothing spectacular. The Sonic sections look really nice but 
 the werehog sections don't look anywhere near as nice.
  
  It should take you at least either 10 or 20 hours to complete the game. The question is will you 
 go back and try to get all the medals. 
  
  
  Overall the game is worth renting before buying I would say. If you are a Sonic fan you will try 
 it and might like it but as a Sonic fan for 15 years I found this a dissapointment and the main 
 reason was the werehog levels are longer and the game makes you play as the werehog more than Sonic 
 and I don't really think thats what a Sonic game should be. Overall a bit of a dissapointment.

Review:  everyone, i invite you to play an epic game. its name is sonic adventure 2 battle and is out for 
 gamecube (so it works on wii) . it is mind blowing.
  unfortunately, since then, in terms of 3d, there has been the abismal sonic heroes, the confused 
 shadow the hedgehog and the broken sonic 06, man i hate that game but i hate heroes so much more. 
 we've also had secret rings but that's got a crazy control scheme which i couldn't be assed with
 
  
  so anyway, is this game good?
  yes
  just ignore the werehog, just put your head down and play through those levels because the sonic 
 levels are worth it. for once, they're not broken! *looks evily at heroes and 06* plus his gameplay 
 isn't hampered by other retarded characters for no good reason *looks back at heroes and the support 
 characters of 06*
  his levels are so close to perfect,
  plus werehog isn't THAT bad, he's just annoying. If the ratio had been 2:1 werehog to sonic, i 
 wouldn't have minded
  but 3:1 is ridiculous, plus at the end it increases
  on the last level there are 5 werehog levels, each at about 8 minutes to 1 sonic level which lasts 
 about 6 minutes
  
  if you're wondering whether it's better than the 360 version then yes and no
  the lack of pointless 
 hubs where you have to search and talk to EVERYONE to find out where to go and the boring tedious 
 tails minigame make the wii version look better
  but the 360 has better daytime levels and graphics, though the graphics are really good on wii
 
  however, the clincher is the last boss fight
  i won't ruin it, but let's just say the wii's is a LOT better
  
  so yeah, best 3d sonic since 
 adventure 2, though i doubt they'll ever get better than that almost perfect gem

Review:  Its simple. Sega needs to quit giving Sonic so many gimmicks. The games day time stages have you 
 playing as the original fast Sonic and you even get that Dash that was introduced in Sonic Rush. 
 The daytime stages are fast and furious and you will strive to get rank S on them. Night time, 
 this when you play as Sonic the Werehog, included is Monkey D Luffy stretch arms. Seriously since 
 most of the time you will be using melee combat the way Werehog Sonic grabs things is with his 
 amazing stretch arms. The game is totally unfair when it comes to the balance of night and day 
 since most of the time you will be playing as the Werehog then the Hedgehog. I mean the controls 
 overall are fine for the Werehog.... just that the stages themselves are redundant and repetitive. 
 You move, fight, jump, grab, repeat. Boss battles is another place where the game shines all of 
 them are fun Night and Day ones.
  
  If you are gonna get the game though I recommend the Ps2/Wii Version if you don't want framerate 
 issues. If you want more of a game get the 360/PS3 versions that actually have you walking around 
 towns rather than having a 2d conversations around a map. The stages are also better.
  
  If you can get past the Werehogs repetitive levels and easy difficulty going through the game the 
 first time (except for one level in particular) . You have a decent Sonic game

Review:  Sonic is finally back, he is faster than ever. There is finally a great sonic games but playing 
 as the werehog can be a bit frustrating but still a great game. Sonic had some really bad times 
 on sonic next-gen on the Xbox 360, but he is faster than ever, great graphics, and great levels. 
 Really fun. If one of you people isn't much of a sonic fan then you would like sonic unleashed. 
 The bad things about playing as the werehog is because its not really much about speed. Sega coulda 
 put a lot more speed while playing as the werehog. Also, another one that is really not that frustrating 
 is the controlls, there is too many attacks and others that you have to do. If your playing as 
 the werehog, you would be problably pressing buttons all the time. Then there is one fun thing 
 about playing as the werehog is picking up those boxes and throwing it at the ememys. Which i thought 
 was really fun. Now the best part about sonic unleashed is story mode. The story mode is like adventure, 
 but even better. Also, one of my favorites is the drift during sonic the hedgehog at day. In sharp 
 corners, you can do a drift more like a car racing game. Now i thought that drifting was really 
 fun.

Review:  The Good- Day time levels are really fun. They are so fast and just brings the game to life. Its 
 the only thing good in it. When ever i got stuck on a part, i just played the day time levels for 
 fun and i still do. The cutscenes are good graphics and are the same on all consoles.
  
  The Bad- The Werehog is horrible. The controls to tiring just swing it for so long. I used a gamecube 
 controller for all the levels but clicking L and R simultaneously starts to hurt your fingers. 
 Village people say nothing. And there are only about 7 day time levels and about 25 night time 
 levels. There are only like 10 cut-scenes and most of them are short.
  
  (Bad) Wii, PS2:
  You can't roam the villages. The levels aren't as good graphics as the PS3s and 360s gameplay graphics. 
 The werehog looks good in the cut-scenes but in gameplay he is all white and his fur looks draw 
 with pencil crayon.
  
  (Good) PS3, Xbox 360:
  You can room village. The gameplay graphics look good. Gameplay is different and i think longer. 
 Werehog looks like the on in the cut-scene.
  
  Other: I can't believe there wasn't online. They said it in on the spot before and there wasn't 
 online. Plus there wasn't even a 2,3,4 player mode. Sonic adventure battle 2 was the most best 
 game ever, it had everything (expect online but that was gamecube =P) . They should have put more 
 cutscenes. Most of them where like 10-20 seconds. The improvement i noticed is that there are like 
 5 high graphic cut-scenes. 1 is the opening. and the others are at the end. I am most definity 
 not going to get sonic and the black knight unless it gets at least a 8 or high rating on ign or 
 here.

Review:  Many people have shown digust in recent Sonic games after his transformation to 3D (Shadow the 
 Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog were not that bad... in fact, I quite enjoyed them (apart the violence 
 in Shadow the Hedgehog and the number of useless characters in Sonic the Hedgehog) ) but in my opinion, 
 they've all been good to the series (yes, including Sonic Heroes) but they all made the same mistake... 
 they created a new Sonic, adifferent Sonic to the one from the 'good old days'. Have Sonic Team 
 and Dimps, creators of the well-aclaimed Sonic Rush games, done the same with Sonic Unleashed, 
 the most anticipated Sonic game to date. The answer is Yes and No.
  
  The story doesn't involve the rubbish of time and space this time, but instead with the good old 
 plot of Eggman up to no good, nice and simple, with Sonic here to stop him.
  
  Graphics:
  
  The cutscenes are made fantastically and the gameplay graphics are well done, although they 
 do not utilize the Hedgehog Engine! Although the daytime stages lack some detail, you won't notice 
 them as you will be going lightning-fast anyway.
  
  Gameplay:
  
  The gameplay is a fresh start to the Sonic series. The controls are responsive, it is nice and 
 simple, and there is a nice learning curve. There are two types of stages, the daytime stages and 
 the nightime stages. The daytime stages bring back the classic 2D style of gameplay for veteran 
 fans, while seemlessly tansitioning to behind-the-back 3D gameplay. In the nightime stages, Sonic 
 transforms into the Werehog, leading to a dramatic change in gameplay. The Werehog is a fighter- 
 not a runner. While this may not please pure Sonic fans, it may interest those into action style 
 gameplay. I quite enjoy these stages, though I would rather have more daytime stages. On the contrary, 
 both day and night stages play very well. Even though the WiiMote and Nunchuk controls may feel 
 tacked on, you can still opt out and and use the Gamecube controller or classic controller. Sonic 
 Unleashed also features a levelling system.
  
  Sound:
  
  Although I quite enjoy the rock stuff, SEGA have changed there way of music and replaced it with 
 Different cuture style music according to the stage.
  
  Speed:
  
  You can expect to scream like you're on a rollercoaster ride in the daytime stages. Though they 
 tend to fly by, you can still come back for more unique challenges.
  
  Sonic's road to 3D has been slow, but with this game, it is now as fast as he is. The concept of 
 speed and fun is well shown in Sonic Unleashed. If you're looking for a Sonic game that is better 
 than the Adventure series, Sonic Unleashed is, and will always be the best 3D Sonic game their 
 is, and one of the best Sonic games ever, second only to Sonic Rush Adventure.

Review:  At first I wasn't too exited about Sonic Unleashed, But when I heard about the Werehog, I said, 
 I gotta try this.
  
  Tonight, Cloudkirby goes hyper-speed and then destroys everything in Sonic Unleashed.
  
  Story: 
 The story doesn't add anything new as far as the storyline goes.
  
  Once again, Fatty Mc Mustache Is trying to take over the world and its up to speedy boy blue to 
 stop him. This time, however, Robotnik (Not Freakin' EGGMAN) wins and zaps all of the energy from 
 the chaos emeralds and turns Sonic into some sort of werewolf hedgehog. Robotnik also does the 
 long thought impossible and blows up the planet. He blew up the PLANET!! WHAT THE HELL!!!!
  
  Then, Wolf boy gets flung to the planet below and meets some sort of imp thing, who turns out 
 to be Sonics newest ball-and-chain helpless victim and, to spice things up, the little guy has 
 amnesia. Go freakin' fig'.
  
  You meet the usual cast of useless side characters along the way, but do I really need to get into 
 that.
  
  Gameplay:
  Sonic:
  The gameplay is split up into two parts. The Sonic gameplay is very much improved over any other 
 3D Sonic game. And, even though it looks like it, the awful control style from The Secret Rings 
 is tossed out the window in favor for a normal control style. You can use 4 speed mechanics to 
 help you pass these levels. The boost, drift, homing attack, and slide. These will allow you to 
 progress faster. Also the seem-less transitions from 2D to 3D had me wondering where the hiccup 
 was going to be. I had a blast going through those levels.
  
  Werehog:
  At night things get slower, but a HELL of a lot more destructive. If you liked Wario World for 
 the gamecube, get ready to have a blast! The combo's you can use against these ghost-like enimies 
 is (to coin my latest catch-phrase) Freakin'-a (awsome) . The speed is still there, it's just not 
 as fast as most sonic fans think he should be going. I personally thought he moved just the right 
 speed for these. The platforming elements are Ok-ish but the combat is what I keep comeing back 
 to these levels for.
  
  Music:
  I don't often mention music but, DAYMN!! Freakin'-a! Instead of crappy metal music, we get treated 
 to ear pleasing orchestrals. I can't say anymore, you simply MUST hear this.
  
  The Bad: 
  Alright, I can't really take my Chainsaw to this game, more like a Hacksaw.
  The 
 first part of the game suffers from what I call, "Kingdom Hearts Syndrome" (KHS) AKA the tutorials 
 will be a grind for everyone.
  Slight graphical glitches (it is a Wii game) .
  Not enough boss battles.
  Thats it.
  
  So, Cloudkirby, you master of Review-Fu, Is this a 
 good game.
  With all the praise I gave it above, you are asking me this question? Yes! HELL YES!! Any sonic 
 fan would be pleased with this, especially when you can bypass the Wii controls with the gamecube 
 controller (which works great) .

Review:  Gameplay: 8
  Your first look at the game when playing it you have to learn all of Sonics daytime moves. Then 
 soon you test al of your new skills in a 2 Act blitz with High speeds and sharp turns. From ramps 
 to things to grind on you have all of the normal Sonic stuff. Then it become night time and you 
 are forced to play as this slow movign thing. The werehog isn't that bad at all but you have to 
 play alot of him before you get to the daytime stages. The funest thing in the game that I think 
 is the sub missions. you run around getting rings, trying to not get hit, or just having fun. They 
 try to make the game longer by putting in a map and you have to find all the pieces to get into 
 the gaia temple so you can play your next few stages. This becomes boring after the first 30 seconds. 
 Over all the game play is great and it would be better if they put in a few more day time stages.
 
  
  Graphics: 9
  For the Wii these are great graphics. Story clips or what ever you want to call them look the best 
 but they always look the best. In game I have one small problem and it is that when I look at Sonic 
 he looks a bit blocky but not much. Maybe I'm crazy but the graphic still look epic.
  
  Sound: 10
  Wait what the music has no singing? Yeah just like the old school games there is no 
 singing for the music. Though it's no just like the old games with your beeps and boops you have 
 nice feel to them. The daytime level feel happy to where the night time levels are dark and then 
 they throw in a little jazz in some of the stages and you got some of the best Sonic music out 
 of the new school games. Voice acting is also great. And Chip doesn't have this high pitched voice 
 like some of our past cast.
  
  Speed: 8
  You can't say this game isn't fast. If you do then you must be a very bad Sonic player. Every little 
 thing added to the daytime stages are put in so you go as fast as you can all the time with out 
 stopping till you get to the goal. Then you play the night time stages and you have to stop and 
 kill some people run some more do some climbing and jumping and some more fighting till you get 
 to the goal. This is why i only gave it an 8, night time is slow.
  
  Overall: 8.5
  
  OK and my last thoughts are this:
  Daytime: one word, FAST!
  Nightime: Slow buthas some great 
 parts to it, like the second act in China or whatever they call it.

Review:  I was looking forward to Sonic's latest platformer - but like the other "Sonic" games released 
 for the next gen systems, this game is largely a clutzy stinker. Let's be real - Sonic's original 
 adventures on the Genesis were fantastic. 1 was good, 2 blew the pants off 1... and 3 upped the 
 ante even more. So we're looking for a new game that brings us back to the days of yore. Sadly, 
 "Unleashed" isn't it. The graphics are great, but the gameplay is sloppy. I'm not a fan of the 
 Werehog levels at all... the controls are bland as is the fighting. And like many games of this 
 genre, haphazard camera work and little control makes for a dull ride. The third downer is the 
 town square hub, where you talk to odd characters to advance the story line. The feature is pointless 
 and annoying... more like watching a Sonic cartoon show then playing a speedy platformer.
  
  I wish Sega would rediscover the inspiration they had for Sonic 2 & 3.

Review:  When I first heard about this game I was crazy about it. When I got it the first day I played it 
 for 5-7 hours straight. The day time levels are so fun I love the speed also the new stuff like 
 sonic drift and boost. I like how there are a lot of shortcuts. Now the night time levels I think 
 you play to much of these. there is like 1 day time level and 3 night times. What I like about 
 it was the fighting. I unlocked all the moves the last on is the most fun to do. I don't really 
 like the platforming. I don't hate, but I don't like it. The bosses are okay I guess. Well that 
 is all for now. Sonic unleashed pulled Sega out of the bad games. Sonic unleashed is awesome!!!!!. Now 
 lets see how sonic and the black night go. Will it be good or bad. After sonic unleashed I hope 
 it is good. The clip looks real good.

Review:  Now, I was around in the early to mid nineties when Sonic was Sega's bread and butter. It was a 
 time when the little hedgehog could do no wrong with it's addicting fast gameplay and simple & 
 tight controls. Anyone who has played a Sonic game since the release of the Dreamcast way back 
 when can tell you that the old blue boy has never taken kindly to the whole 3D thing. I also marked 
 that as a time when Sonic started to become an anime sellout and he started to get some kind of 
 attitude problem where he just tries too hard to act cool. Which I can tell you that trying to 
 act cool, is the farthest thing from being cool. After the dreadful release of the last two Sonic 
 current gen console games (Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic & the Secret Rings) , it would seem that 
 Sonic was just not meant for the way games are today. OR IS HE?!
  
  When I first heard about the new Wii exclusive Sonic game "Unleashed" I was half hoping that it 
 would be a return to the good old days. Where it's just you, Sonic, and enough speed to potentially 
 outrun the game camera. And in a way, I got what I wanted, but in another way, I also got something 
 that I didn't.
  
  The catch is that the game's stages are divided up into two polar opposite experiences which I 
 like to call "Fast Sonic" and "Hulk Sonic". Each separated by day and night. During the daytime, 
 when you're good old fast Sonic, it's the kind of gameplay experience that I wish that I could 
 spend the entire game with. It's
  where fast reflexes and even faster thinking will reward you with better and faster paths through 
 the stage. There is a couple of new moves at Sonic's disposal, such as drifting and sliding, that 
 takes some getting used to but fits into that style of gameplay very well and makes it that much 
 more exciting. The only Wii motion sensing mechanic in this gameplay is that you flick the Wiimote 
 to do his mid-air homing attack or to give an enemy crushing boost of speed on the ground. And 
 the stages are designed well enough that you'll want to start over half way through a run just 
 to try and get to that higher path.
  
  Than there's the nighttime gameplay, there Sonic turns into the "werehog" and the game turns into 
 a brawler- taking fighting mechanics from Kingdom Hearts, Crash Bandicoot, and God of War. There's 
 no fast paced action here. In fact, you'll find yourself waiting around for a floating platform 
 to come back around more often than you'd like. It involves you hulking about the stage, breaking 
 creates and jars like you have a grudge against them and fighting off the hordes of rather uninspired 
 enemies (they're like if the Heartless were designed by someone with no imagination) . What kills 
 me most about these stages is that the fighting system boils down to shaking the wiimote and nunchuck 
 repeatedly like you're banging on a drum. And trust me, that gets really tiring after a while. 
 And if these stages weren't bad enough, you'll also be a victim of sudden-death-platforming. Apparently, 
 Sonic can no longer hold his breathe and water equals instant death. You only get 2 extra lives 
 per stage so if you miss that tricky platform more than twice, than it's game over. Which wouldn't 
 be a problem if these stages didn't feature the more unresponsive controls I've ever used. I'm 
 serious, there was actually a point where I was repeatedly mashing the jump button and Sonic just 
 strolled off the side of the cliff. It's very frustrating and it's very not Sonic. And the sad 
 thing is, you'll find yourself stuck playing the "Hulk Sonic" more often than the "Fast Sonic" 
 most times.
  
  That being said, I did find lots of things that are genuinely impressive about this game where 
 I truly felt that the developers made an effort to learn from past mistakes. The opening sequence 
 really grabbed me. I'm all up for a game where the villain wins right off the bat. The animation 
 and lip syncing in the cutscenes are extremely well done (compared to Sonic on the Dreamcast for 
 sure) and I really liked how all of the human character were noticeably NOT anime. I'd say they 
 were more Pixar inspired than anything else. Which is a very refreshing and welcomed change of 
 aesthetic. There is one gripe that I have about the characters while I'm on the subject. Sonic's 
 new spunky sidekick (You'll know who I'm talking about) is really not funny, he's just annoying 
 and is always stealing the spotlight. His design is just stupid and he's really only around to 
 point out the obvious (I'm pretty sure I could figure out how to pull a lever on my own) .
  
  In the end, if we weren't forced to play through those dreadful "werehog" stages, this would 
 have been the game to put Sonic back in the big leagues. Sega, if you're reading this. We only 
 want one good Sonic game. Like the good old days. Don't give us any more gimmicks or annoying side 
 kicks. We only want to run fast. But, since the next Sonic game will have him wielding a talking 
 magic sword, I'm afraid all hope is lost.

Review:  Finally! A Sonic game thats good and fun! Sonic Unleashed is a new Sonic game. The Wii version 
 is the one i got. Dimps was in charge of the day stages and SEGA and Sonicteam worked on everything 
 else. Now, the Wii version is slightly different from the HD (PS3 360) versions. The differences 
 are the day and night level designs, hubs are point and click gameplay, and some-what less features. 
 Here is how the story begins. Sonic is on Eggman's space base trying to spoil eggman's plans again. 
 Later, Sonic gets captured by Eggman. Sonic uses the chaos emeralds and is all "NOW I'LL SHOW YOU!" 
 on Eggman thus, turning into Super Sonic and destroying Eggman's base. But Super Sonic gets into 
 a trap and Eggman uses a machine to take the chaos emeralds away from Sonic. The chaos emeralds 
 power up a giantlazer while Sonic suffers the electricity. Dr. Eggman fires his LAZAR and splits 
 the world into 7 peices. With the world split to peices, a giant monster called the Dark Gaia is 
 awakened after a long sleep inside the earth. When Eggman starts cheering, some strange thing is 
 happening to Sonic. Suffering from all that electric, Sonic changes his form. His arms turn big, 
 fur grows all over, and Sonic the Hedgehog is now Sonic the Werehog. Dr. Eggman sends Sonic down 
 to space, making him fall down the destroyed earth. I gotta hand it to ya. This is one of Dr. Eggman's 
 greatest plans. As WereSonic falls down, he is saved by the chaos emeralds power and lands straight 
 on the ground. Then, he looks around and finds a new character in the game. A Chihuahua-like character 
 knocked out on the ground. When he wakes up... blah blah blah this is taking to long. Later in 
 the story Sonic calls the chihuahua character "Chip." Anyway, the story is very good and simple. 
 Some cutscenes will have humor also. Mostly the cutscenes with Chip. You will also see some other 
 characters like Amy, and Tails. So lets move on to gameplay.
  
  The gameplay of Sonic Unleashed is really good. There are 2 types. 1 is the normal Sonic the Hedgehog 
 gameplay. It's fast and awesome! And when you are playing as Sonic, the camera will move to the 
 side and you will be playing in a classic 2D mode. There are 2D and 3D transitions in Sonic gameplay. 
 Another thing is the controls are really good. It isn't like the Sonic 06 controls so don't worry. 
 Also, if you see gameplay videos and say "OMG! Not Sonic and the Secret Rings gameplay again!" 
 well it is not Sonic and the Secret rings gameplay. You can fully control Sonic. Now here is the 
 other type of gameplay. Werehog. Werehog only plays in the night stages. Sonic in the day Werehog 
 in the night. Werehog's gameplay is slow (But not super slow) and it's a "beat-em up" kind of gameplay. 
 Swing the Wiimote and nun-chuck to attack these night creatures. When I played werehog, it's like 
 i'm playing 2 games in 1. There are also some platforming elements. Oh and here is something fun. 
 Werehog's attacks have him stretch his arms! You can use those arms to reach poles or ledges. Also 
 try grabbing objects and enemies! When playing the game, your rank will be based on time. say for 
 example:
  1:20:00=S rank. You have to get to the goal before the S rank time in order to get that rank. One 
 more thing. If you complete a stage, you will get some sun and moon medals to unlock missions. 
 Now about the hubs. in the HD versions, the hubs are free roaming full 3D hubs. the Wii version 
 has a point and click gameplay. It was pretty boring. You have to select the icons to see what 
 happens. 
  
  Now I'm gonna talk about the sound in the game. First off, the music is really really good! Especially 
 the Endless Possibilities song from Jarret Reddick. And if you thought the voice acting would be 
 bad, it really is good! Jason griffith did Sonic really well! Especially the "WHOOOO!!" and "HURRAAAA!" 
 during the gameplay. When you are Werehog, normal music will be playing. But when enemies appear 
 and the music will change to an upbeat jazzy tune.
  
  Hey even great games have some flaws! Here are the bad things about Sonic Unleashed. One of them 
 is that there is too much Werehog. There are 3 acts for Werehog, 1 full stage for Sonic and 2-3 
 missions. yeah Werehog is fun but Sonic should atleast have some of the spotlight more than Werehog. 
 Another thing is the motion controls. With Sonic, I shake the Wiimote for 3 times and Sonic finally 
 boosts. Luckily there are Gamecube and classic controller options. So if you want you could use 
 those. Werehog can sometimes be difficult with the motion controls cause it involves lots of shaking.
 
  
  Anyway this is my review of the game. But i'm just glad SEGA finally did something good for Sonic! 
 Keep this up and Sonic will get back on top!

Review:  Sonic Unleashed is Sonic Team's latest full-fledged console Sonic game. This time around Dr. Robotnik 
 (or as everyone except me seems to say now, Eggman...) is harnessing the power of a dark god slumbering 
 beneath the Earth to build his own amusement park of sorts called Eggmanland and it's up to Sonic 
 to stop him. It's a bit of a twist on the classic Sonic storyline but it gets the job done. However 
 Sonic get's caught up in the beam which Robotnik uses to awaken the demon and the resulting effect 
 is that the Chaos Emeralds have lost their power and Sonic has been transformed into a Werehog. 
 The beautifully rendered opening cut scene plays this all out and sets up the premise of the game. 
 Something worth mentioning, the plot doesn't take itself too seriously either. It feels more like 
 a saturday morning cartoon that a failed attempt at melodrama.
  
  The graphical presentation on the Wii is great. The framerate is very solid. I haven't experienced 
 any dips in framerate during any of my play sessions so far and I've put around 15 hours into the 
 game. The textures are decent. The motion blur is doled out in copious amounts. This game does 
 push the Wii hardware harder than a vast majority of the titles available right now. The camera 
 does indeed seemlessly transition from a closely following 3D view to a 2D sidescrolling view a 
 few times during each of the day stages and follows from mostly from above at night. There were 
 times during the night stages where I would have liked to control the camera to line up a jump 
 better and couldn't, which is a bit of a bummer. 
  
  The level design for the daytime stages was developed by Dimps who is also the developer of the 
 Sonic Rush series for Nintendo DS. These guys have proven for the 3rd time now that they know how 
 design a Sonic level. Interestingly enough, these levels are completely different than most of 
 the preview videos released so it's like playing a totally different game than the PS3/360 version. 
 Everything is so fluid while going through them. There aren't many showstopping obstacles to break 
 up the nonstop pace of the day stages and if there are, they can be avoided. Multiple plays (you 
 will play the stages multiple times) will result in better completion times. The night stage level 
 design was done by Sonic Team and is fair but not necessarily compelling. The ratio of day levels 
 to night levels on the Wii is quite unbalanced with the day stages totaling 7 and the night stages 
 coming to a staggering 25! For every day stage you unlock, you play 3 or more night stages. This 
 isn't really an issue if you like beat-em-ups but if you're only in it for the day stages, be prepared 
 to be underwhelmed for a majority of the game.
  
  Now about the gameplay. There aren't many out of the ordinary things to do on the platforming side 
 of the werehog stages. Jump over this, grab that, swing here. Nothing spectacular. The combat, 
 which happens quite frequently and in a Devil May Cry "you can't pass this room until all the enemies 
 are gone" fashion, feels tight. The werehog is pretty underpowered at the beginning of the game 
 but as you defeat enemies you pick up "dark gaia energy" which is used to unlock new moves and 
 ability levels. This is all done in a linear, pre-determined fashion. The player does not have 
 control over which abilites to unlock but the sequence at which these do open up keeps the werehog 
 balanced for the most part.
  
  The day stages are truly amazing. Multiple paths, bumpers, speed pads, chained homing attacks, 
 rails to grind, loop-de-loops and chase sequences are some of what you contend with when the sun 
 is out. The speed is intense and requires lightning fast reflexes to get through them. Some have 
 said that the game looks like it almost plays itself. It only looks that way when you're watching 
 a skilled player. Believe me, some of my first runs were bad. You learn the courses and you improve. 
 The new drift mechanic works like it should. There are plenty of places in the levels when it can 
 be used to maintain the quick pace although it takes some spot on timing, like pretty much anything 
 when you're going so fast. The Sonic boost is the equivalent of a nitro button in a racing game 
 and is absolutely essential for getting S rank times. The spin dash of old is back but only before 
 the beginning of the stage. Just before the level starts and you see Sonic's back you can press 
 the boost button and he will spin dash off the line. Get the timing wrong and he falls on his face 
 however. 
  
  The music is nothing short of phenomenal, especially when put up against the soundtracks of pretty 
 much every console Sonic game since the Genesis. Gone is the horrible guitar rock. Gone are the 
 preteen lyrics about following rainbows. What we get in Unleahsed is a whole lot of classy tunes. 
 A good many of them feature some sort of breakbeat drum parts but a good many of them are big band 
 tunes. Horns and funky wah riffs set off the night stages in Spagonia. Ethnic drums and flutes 
 set to techno music drive the pace during the day in Adabat. Twinkly keyboards and catchy melodies 
 accent Holoska. The map screen and hub world have orchstration and/or remixes of the day stages 
 in the respective villages. High marks for class in the soundtrack department.
  
  The game has solid controls no matter which scheme you choose. The motion controls all work as 
 they should and make sense most of the time. I experienced no problems getting a homing attack 
 to recognize using the motion which I did have problems with in Sonic and the Secret Rings. What 
 I did have problems with however is the mechanic in which you can double tap on the control stick 
 to send the werehog off into a sprint. Some of the more difficult platforming sections, especially 
 in Adabat and the final area resulted in some very cheap deaths as these sections contain plenty 
 of high platforms and lining up a jump often ended up in death as Werehog ran off the edge of whatever 
 he was standing on because the game saw a double tap. This is one of the only real areas of beef 
 I have with the game. I personally prefer the feel of the Gamecube controller to play it as the 
 quick step is more intuitive compared to the Wiimote+nunchuck in my opinion.
  
  One particularly upsetting thing to note about the Wii version is that it's missing 2 entire areas 
 that were shown before the Game was released. These missing zones are Mazuri (present but contains 
 only a boss fight) and Empire City (completely left out) . This is a letdown as the PS3/360 version 
 contains these areas and 2/3rds less werehog levels. Expect another review of the PS3 version in 
 the coming months.
  
  Overall, Sonic Unleashed does a lot of things right. It's day stages are superb, the night stages 
 are great for beat-em-up fans, the soundtrack is top notch and the production values are through 
 the roof. However it falls short in the level balancing, it's missing entire stages and has some 
 twiddly controls in spots. If you're a Sonic fan, it's worth the money. If you think Sonic "should 
 just die", then you weren't going to be objective and try it out anyways.

Review:  I dont think i can explain my joy when i started up my wii and started to play the beginning daytime 
 missions. The gameplay for the daytime levels are just so perfect that you will feel like you just 
 have to play that daytime stage you just finished another ten times before you can continue the 
 game. This game truly shows what speed is all about, and is a great addition to the franchise, 
 well that is, until night falls...
  
  At night, you play as the werehog, a canine like version of Sonic. Hes not that fast, although 
 hes not terribly slow either. And its not that his gameplay isnt good, because it is, a nice, simple 
 button mashing "slice and dice" if you will, gameplay. But is it really Sonic?
  Most of the game consists of the nighttime stages, which are not too bad and pretty fun, although 
 the bottom line is youll only be playing the stages at night so that you can get some more of that 
 fresh, fun, perfect gameplay you get in the morning.
  
  The learning curve for this game is actually quite more difficult to achieve
  than most Sonic 
 games, although its just because theres so many great, new mechanics like sonic drift and quickstep.
 
  
  Overall the game is great and infact the werehog stages make a nice addition to the game although 
 after awhile youll see its the same thing over and over again, just in different environments. This 
 game is a great addition to any Wii gamers library, although I think its safe to say, (and i think 
 any sonic fan like me would agree) that sonic team should stop trying to find new ideas for our 
 speedy blue friend, because they've always had it right infront of them, and i think with this 
 title, they really exploiteed it and made it great, although on the other hand, i think they should 
 ditch the werehog before its too late.

Review:  This is a good made sonic game with great graphics, gameplay, and story. Also this game is very 
 funny on some videos. One of the most exciting things is that sonic transform in a creature in 
 the night called a werehog. One of the most exciting things of this game is the 2d to 3d levels 
 and the new so called from sega, the "Hedgehog engine" that is going to be used in this exciting 
 sonic new game. The bad one is eggman that is trying to used the power of dark gaia to conquer 
 the world. The music in the game is great and everything too. You can do extra missions like in 
 other sonic games and of course venture with tails. One of the best things in this game is that 
 you can us ethe new powers sonic have and you can do missions by talking around cities in the world

Review:  Gamers, Sonic Fans, and everyone else who reads this review, this message is for the people of 
 the world!
  
  Sonic should stick with Nintendo!!!!
  
  Not that the other console games are bad (exept for Sonic Next Gen) but haven't you noticed that 
 most of Sonic's truly great games were for the Wii, Gamecube, DS, and Gameboy (also the DreamCast) . 
 This review is for Sonic Unleashed exclusively for the Wii Version. I've heard how better it is 
 for the Wii and here's just some quick reasons why.
  1. The Wii version focused mainly on the control sceam of the game because graphics don't matter 
 a hole lot which made them make the controls as tight as possible even on the Wii's standard game 
 controls.
  2. The game in my opinion offers a much better sense of speed.
  3. Even GameInformer gave the Wii version a bette score and we all know that they flat out hate 
 Sonic.
  
  But now it's time for the review.
  
  Gmeplay: 10.0
  This Game offers a high speed change in the level design which makes the game a whole lot more 
 enjoyable. Although the night time levels slow it down but gets it back with exceptionally tight 
 combat and controls. But it's still not up to speed as the daytime levels. Overall I wasn't dissapointed 
 with anything.
  
  Graphics: 9.0
  Like I said the graphics don't matter alot. But there not as good as the previous Wii games, not 
 to say there bad, it's still one of the best looking Wii games. Just not the best looking.
  
  Sound: 10.0
  This game offer's an exceptionalyy better sound track much better than Secret 
 Rings. And the only thing I don't like is the ending of it's theme song "Endless Possibility", 
 it's a great song but at the end where the repeat in this high pitch voice it kinda hurts my ears.
 
  
  Speed: 9.0
  The speed fo the daytime level is much faster than you've ever seen him run. It has Sonic run of 
 speeds of about 300mph. But in night time it slows down, but it makes up for it's intensity, just 
 not all the points.

Review:  Sonic Unleashed is okay, but less then half of the game is the actually good gameplay, the werehog 
 gameplay gets repetitive and difficult, not to mention uninteresting.
  
  The only way you could actually like the game is if you worship and breathe Sonic, but sorry, this 
 is NOT a comeback, try again next year!
  
  First off, in this version, 100% Sonic, 100% of the time! =D No other character, Amy and Tails 
 serve very small roles. They barely do anything, and Chip's voice doesn't match him at all! Same 
 old Sonic X voice actors in English, Sonic Riders is funner then this to.
  
  Knuckles, Shadow, Cream, Rouge, all of those memorable characters don't even appear, which is sad 
 that Sega only use 2 other characters. YAWN! D:

Review:  I been a Sonic fan since I was five years old. I love nearly every Sonic game that was made even 
 Sonic '06. Sonic has been through many types of gameplays over the recent years and this time Sonic's 
 gameplay goes 2D and 3D. I have to say that this formula works. The day time stages are very fun. 
 Once you master the controls the game takes a alot of hand and eye coordination. Unlike Sonic '06, 
 Sonic's gameplay is really fast and his new moves allow gamers to stay on their toes when it come 
 time to use them through many obstacles. When it comes to the night stages when you play as werehog 
 Sonic it can be fun, but I wish it wasn't more night stages than day stages. Werehog Sonic's platforming 
 and beat-em up gameplay is fun but, my only complaint is that there's more of Werehog Sonic gameplay 
 than regular Sonic's gameplay. If there was a good balance between the two, than it would have 
 been a superb game in my opinion. As far as the controls, for day time Sonic I recommend using 
 the classic controller or gamecube controller. The Wii remote and nunchuk works well with werehog 
 Sonic's gameplay. Overall, this is a great game. Sonic fans may be a little upset that there is 
 more werehog Sonic gameplay than regular Sonic; but if you are into more platforming and beat-em 
 up gameplay than it may not disappoint fans or newcomers.

Review:  F*** what the reviewers who work for these so called expert opinion sites and magazines. Play the 
 dang game for yourself and stop listening to other people's opinions because that's all they are... opinions. 
 The game is fantastic in my own honest opinion and everyone who disagrees can die the sad and miserable 
 death that awaits them. You won't be missed.
  
  On a brighter note, the Wii version doesn't look too much different from the PS3 and 360 versions, 
 save a few textures and foliage models. But as far as lighting and character models go, they're 
 almost identical. Sonic Unleashed to me is like playing a combination of Sonic Rush on DS and the 
 original Sonic Adventure on Dreamcast. Makes sense since Dimps worked on this Wii version. Just 
 play the game. If you don't like Sonic and have been bashing him and all his followers as far back 
 as you can remember, just don't bother with it. You're waisting your time and everyone else's by 
 being immature about it and giving every reason under the sun why it's not a good game.

Review:  The Wii version of Sonic Unleashed exceeds acceptations with dazzling graphics, fluid controls, 
 beautiful soundtrack, and outstanding game play.
  
  Sonic Unleashed begins with an incredibly awesome CG cutscence where Sonic the Hedgehog attempts 
 to foil Robot-nik's latest plot for world domination. Right when Sonic has Robot-nik cornered, 
 the devious doctor springs a evil trap that shocks the emeralds power out of Sonic and uses it 
 to shatter the Earth into pieces. As result of the incident, every nightfall, Sonic transforms 
 into werehog but, not before Robot-nik decides to rid himself of Sonic once and for all by sending 
 the blue burr into space where he falls into the shattered Earth. The malicious Dark Gaia is released 
 from Earth's core and the adventure begins.
  
  As soon as the game starts, the graphics look surprisingly clear. As Sonic encounters his new friend 
 Chip, the characters interact smoothly with crisp backgrounds surrounding them. Once Sonic gets 
 to the actual levels, the graphics still manage to amaze. Enemies have believable animations and 
 Sonic animates quite well during game play. Smooth transitions between frames give the game a great 
 sense of speed that Sonic 06 couldn't handle. The presentation is top notch and fans should be 
 pleased to see the graphics hold up in comparison to the PS3/X360 versions of the game. Please 
 note that the Africa themed stage, Mazuri, is exclusive to the PS3/X360 versions. Other than that, 
 Wii/PS2 owners shouldn't fear their versions of Sonic Unleashed.
  
  The controls are rather solid. The Wii version offers the Wiimote, Wiimote/wNunchuk, Classic Controller, 
 and Gamecube Controller as options, giving players many play styles to choose from. Everything 
 runs smoothly and the new mechanics work wonders. Sonic's quick step, homing attack, sonic drift, 
 and sonic boost all function properly and no glitches or collision issues spoil the experience. 
 More often in the werehog levels, the Wiimote option offers moments of motion control where moving 
 the Wiimote interacts with the gameplay. It works well and makes the game feel more interactive.
 
  
  The game is blessed with a wonderful soundtrack. From the classic ring get tone, to the background 
 music of the Great China Wall, Sonic Unleashed will please the ears of fans. The voice actors from 
 the last adventure, Sonic 06, are here but, do a better job at bringing the characters life. Jason 
 Griffin as Sonic isn't as ear shattering as before and Mike Pollock plays a good Robot-nik, as 
 always. Sound effects range from classic to brilliant and the eerie themes of the night stages 
 give the feeling of a werehog on the prowl. 
  
  The gameplay is what seals the deal. The daytime stages are fast and furious as Sonic burns blazing 
 trails of speed, blasting through Bad-niks, grinding on rails, and gathering rings. The nighttime 
 stages slow things down a bit for a more combat focus on gameplay. As a werehog, Sonic can stretch 
 his arms to cross obstacles and fight enemies. He can also perform moves such as Were-wallop and 
 Were-hammer. Sonic can chain attacks and use smaller enemies as weapons. The ranking system is 
 back and the missions are back to being senseable. Racing the clock will thrill many fans of the 
 franchise.
  
  Sonic is back and better than ever. Running laps at day and taking names at night, Sonic Unleashed 
 is a Sonic fans dream come true.
