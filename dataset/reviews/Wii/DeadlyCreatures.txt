:::Review:::
Deadly Creatures is certainly creepy, but it's fun as well. 

  Arachnids have never been embraced by modern society. With their multitude of legs and their mysterious 
 nature, they create a healthy dose of fear in many unlucky enough to inadvertently cross their 
 paths. Deadly Creatures does little to alleviate the inherent creepiness these critters carry with 
 them. You'll alternate control between a scorpion and a tarantula, but there aren't any cartoon 
 nods to make these creatures more endearing; these are realistic depictions of the terrifying creatures 
 that have long haunted children's nightmares. Despite its vile protagonists, Deadly Creatures is 
 an interesting and strangely satisfying adventure. As you travel through dank caves below the arid 
 desert land, you won't find yourself growing any closer to these scream-inducers, but the twisted 
 combat and utterly bizarre situations you'll find yourself in make this an engaging game.  

           An airborne spider with eight hairy legs. Delicious.      

  The story is every bit 
 as unorthodox as the two main characters. As you travel around a bevy of uninviting, poorly lit 
 locales, you'll hear bits and pieces of conversations between two prospectors in search of buried 
 treasure. These gold diggers are the only two humans in the game, and while they don't carry a 
 particularly enticing backstory, they do add a little personality to these otherwise sterile environments. 
 Billy Bob Thornton and Dennis Hopper lend their voice talents, and they do a good job of adding 
 some comedic hijinks to the adventure. The biggest problem is how small their role is and how it 
 seems to tie in only loosely to the insects' objective. You'll go through most of the game without 
 any overall goal, and when you come to the chilly conclusion, it's unclear what the point of your 
 adventure actually was.  

  The game is broken up into 10 chapters. The environments don't change much through your journey -- you're 
 stuck in the desert throughout -- but there is still some variety thrown in. The arachnids are usually 
 in dusty crawl spaces populated by angry insects desperate to defend their turf, but you'll also 
 find yourself inside a dingy gas station, a beat-up car, and a terrifying spider's nest. The environments 
 are fairly linear, and you're carefully shepherded from one checkpoint to another, but there are 
 some branching paths that hide succulent grubs or health-raising grasshoppers. As a scorpion, your 
 movement is restricted; you can walk up walls but nothing more outrageous. The tarantula is much 
 more agile. He too can climb up walls, but can also walk across ceilings. The tarantula can also 
 leap over small obstacles and sling his web to grab onto objects far out of reach. You can call 
 up an arrow to guide you in the right direction whenever you get lost, which is a huge help, given 
 that it can be difficult to keep your bearings as you crawl around twisting 3D environments.  

 
  Deadly Creatures offers an even mix of navigation and combat. Although your battle moves are slightly 
 more over the top than what you'd expect from real arachnids, they seem close enough to reality 
 that they wouldn't feel out of place in a particularly aggressive nature video. As a scorpion, 
 you can swipe at enemies with your pinching claws, poison them with your stinger, and dash out 
 of the way to avoid a collision. If you flip the Wii Remote upside down, you can burrow underground 
 and let loose a surprise attack to some unaware creature. If you do enough damage, you can perform 
 an elaborate finishing move, which usually ends with a tail strike to some sensitive part of your 
 enemy's anatomy. There's a mix of traditional and motion controls, and though pulling off elaborate 
 motions in battle can be a little tricky, the controls do a good job of making you feel like you're 
 in the heart of these miniature battles.  

           Rats hate being stabbed in the brain.      

  As a spider, fights are based more on 
 your mobility than your sheer strength. You can leap around the battleground, and you'll have to 
 frequently hop around until your enemies open themselves up for attack. You can stun your foes 
 with web shots as well, which makes long-distance battles intense. You'll fight you way through 
 an array of hideous creatures, including jumping spiders, praying mantises, and rats, and every 
 enemy requires you to use a different technique to achieve victory. There are also some surprisingly 
 epic boss fights. A spider wouldn't be able to dispatch a rattle snake in solo combat, so instead 
 of trying to kill the giant reptile, you have to survive long enough to escape. There are only 
 a few major conflicts in the game, but they are the highlights of your journey, placing an emphasis 
 on your survival rather than on your opponent's death. It's disappointing that there aren't more 
 boss fights, though, because the events of the journey have a tendency to bleed together, and the 
 big encounters create more memorable moments.  

  The visuals in Deadly Creatures are as detailed as they can be without becoming gross. The arachnids 
 are creepily animated; their repulsive little legs move realistically enough to give you a serious 
 case of the heebie-jeebies. The sound effects are equally authentic, capturing the scurrying shuffle 
 of the insects' feet rushing across the dirty ground. The realistic depiction of these creatures 
 adds a lot to the experience, giving weight to their plight through these abandoned caves. Your 
 enemies will scream in battle, making fights intense and nerve-racking. Deadly Creatures always 
 keeps you focused on the protagonists, fully immersing you in this microscopic world filled with 
 hideous creatures.  

  There is nothing like Deadly Creatures. The stars of this game are completely vile, and there is 
 nothing done to make them the slightest bit endearing. However, despite presenting an unsettling 
 world, this well-made game provides plenty of hair-raising moments and memorable duels. If there 
 were a few more boss battles and more emphasis placed on the outlandish story, this could have 
 been something truly special. Even though the adventure is a little abrupt, the originality of 
 this journey makes it worth experiencing.

Review:  I love Nintendo and I love my Wii. I hate the fact that very bad games are on their systems. Rainbow 
 Studio's Deadly Creatures actually is a good game and most people will like it, but this child 
 of gaming doesn't seem to be too impressed...
  
  I give it up to creativity in this game. Play as a spider and scorpian thorugh a sprawling desert 
 with Action sytle combat. Cool concept! The story could have used something more than voice work 
 from Mr. Hopper and Mr.... uh, Thorton. I'd like to know why these to creatures are in conflict 
 with each other and what the have to do with this American Civil War treasure. Could the spider 
 want vengence on the scorpian for stealing her egg sack or something?
  
  The animals look cool and the envirionments look detailed. Expect to see lots of brown though, 
 which may or may not bother some gamers. I love to see both animals crawling around with their 
 legs...
  
  I don't argee with the controls though. As far as I know, the camera is mapped to one direction 
 on the D-Pad, where there's 3 more, and the Wiimote moving didn't always work...
  
  This is not a bad game, I find it to be not as gripping as other games for the Wii, but Rainbow 
 tried, which is good enough for me. It's still worth buying or renting....

Review:  When I bought my Wii at launch, I envisioned a system with some unique third-party titles, something 
 the Gamecube lacked. Two and a half years later, the strengths of the system are once again Nintendo 
 first-party games. Yeah the Mario's and the Zelda's are fun, but I want something different, like 
 "No More Heroes" and "World of Goo," which are both great mind you! Now we have another game, this 
 time by THQ, which is the subject of this review. 
  The objective of DC is to play through the game as a tarantula and a scorpion and overcome the 
 kind of challenges that would come from being such small, yet menacing, arachnids. This game reminds 
 me of another on the original Playstation known simply as "Spider: The Video Game." I never had 
 an opportunity to play that game, but I can imagine DC being similar to it. You alternate between 
 the tarantula and the scorpion after each level, and both have different abilities. The tarantula 
 is quick and can jump, but the scorpion is stronger and can block. Playing as both is entertaining, 
 but getting into combat with other animals can get a little frustrating since the controls aren't 
 always responsive.
  Graphically, DC is not much of a looker. But the creature models are good and the terrific level 
 design only helps to make you feel like you are living in their world. Unfortunately, the game's 
 frame rate is a little choppy at times and it even has to load when you get to a certain point 
 of each level, which kinda kills the flow. But where the game really shines is with it's use of 
 music and lighting. While you can't consider DC a survival horror by normal conventions, the game 
 is quite creepy and the sounds only help to put you in that atmosphere of uncertainty when trying 
 to traverse the game's many landscapes.
  The game is very short if you want to beat it straight through. But I recommend trying to collect 
 all the bonus items to add longevity since it doesn't have multiplayer, which is almost understandable 
 cause multiplayer may not be that great in a game like this. But the thing I love about DC is that 
 it is different and gives Wii owners something out of the norm. It's a good game that you should 
 enjoy given that you don't expect too much from it. We need more of these titles and I hope that 
 originality becomes an important factor when developing video games in the future.

Review:  Deadly Creatures is a genuinely novel idea during the period that we're in where the market is 
 flooded with generic first person shooters. The problem is, the game just lacks that certain fun-factor.
 
  
  Graphics- 7
  
  Compared to other 3rd party Wii games, Deadly creatures has good graphics. It's apparent that the 
 game designers put a lot of effort into the designs of the main characters, the spider and scorpion. 
 Where the game is lacking graphically, is the environments, and enemies. The environment that the 
 spider and scorpion traverse is very dull, with the same brown and gray color palette appearing 
 over and over again. When viewed up close most of the game is low resolution, which at this point 
 is almost unacceptable. The enemies designs are also a bit weak. You fight the same variations 
 of enemies again and again, but they appear in different colors. The humans appear to be the true 
 main characters but their models are poorly designed.
  
  Gameplay- 6
  
  The gameplay is full of motion controls, and the strange part is, the work very well. The motion 
 controls don't feel tacked on, but sadly there is little to no use of the IR pointer. Often times, 
 you'll find yourself trying to time your motions with what the character is doing onscreen. But 
 what brings the game down is the combat. It tends to be very repetitive and tedious. Even the weaker 
 enemies in the game require massive amounts of damage to kill, and even later in the game they 
 still require 3-4 hits to finish off. The game also suffers from making you traverse the same terrain 
 multiple times, but as different creatures, with nothing new added.
  
  Sound- 8.5
  
  The ambient sounds really stand out in this game. The creeping noises that bugs make, the chirping, 
 scraping, hissing fit almost perfectly into the game. The human characters that rarely appear throughout 
 the game are very well voiced by Dennis Hopper, and Billy-Bob Thornton. There isn't a real soundtrack 
 to the game, just many environmental noises which after a while repeat themselves and get boring 
 to listen to. It's a shame that the human characters don't have a larger part in the game.
  
  Replay Value- 2
  
  There is absolutely no reason to play this game once you've beaten the 
 main story, unless you are the type of person who compulsively unlocks everything in a game. This 
 game just isn't fun the second time around.

Review:  Deadly Creatures is an action game for the Wii that puts you in the body of both a tarantula and 
 a scorpion. You then battle other bugs and animals using your prounce or claw attacks. The way 
 both creatures battle are different from one another. The spider can jump out of the way while 
 the scorpion can defend himself from most attacks. Thoughout the levels, you will alternate between 
 the two. There are a total of 10 levels. The difficulty is variable, depending on whether you play 
 Easy mode or Deadly mode. I played through the game on Normal difficulty. The visuals are OK, but 
 that's not what I have a problem with. Sometimes, the creatures you fight will move in erratic 
 directions while you are on a wall. Other times, you will fall to your death only to realize that 
 you are still floating in mid-air while your creature "lands". It's got a lot of glitches in the 
 game design. Fortunately, they are not serious enough to the point where the game is unplayable. 
 The music gives the game a suspense kind of feel as you explore the desert, and the creatures growl 
 and grunt as they fight one another. The game can be beaten in less than 10 hours, as each level 
 themselves can be completed in under an hour. Unlockable artwork from grub collection, though, 
 was enough for me to give this game a second playthrough. Unfortunately, there are no multi-player 
 modes, so battles between the two creatures with you and your friend will have to wait until a 
 possible sequel comes out. I would advise renting this first before you buy.

Review:  Deadly Creatures is the most unique and amazing game to come to this console this year. Sure this 
 game has its ups and down but the end product makes you proud of yourself for buying this game.
 
  
  Deadly Creatures story is about 2 humans trying to look for gold in the desert and is told through 
 the view of the 2 of the most feared, creepy bugs; A Scorpion and a Tarantula. 
  
  Graphics of the game are the shine of the game. The textures are so detailed and thanks to motion 
 capture, the creatures look highly detailed. 
  
  Sound of this game is just as creepy as the game which in this case is good thing. The voice acting 
 is implemented very well and the mood of the game is captured through the music.
  
  Camera is not always perfect in this game. The story is also really short which will take about 
 10 hours to complete by most of you. But it will make you all play this game at least twice or 
 thrice. 
  
  Overall this game is a must have game for the Wii. Everything is excellent except for the camera 
 and the short story but that can be overlooked as this is the Game of the Month for me!

Review:  Deadly creatures is the most brutal action game with bugs that I have ever played, and anyone with 
 a wii should check it out.
  
  The game puts you in the skins of a tarantula and a scorpion. You will play as both of them as 
 you crawl though a sort of underworld that hasn't been seen by human eyes. You will fight other 
 creepy-crawlies, ranging from other insects to small mammals and other kinds of creatures. Combat 
 is a mixture of button mashing and swinging the wiimote, but you can also just swing the wiimote 
 for slower but more powerful attacks. You do, however, have to earn these abilities, but that isn't 
 much of a problem.
  
  Since both of them play differently, let's look at both of them individually.
  
  The tarantula 
 is a more agile character, his powers include being able to spit web at his enemies' faces, he 
 can also jump and crawl on walls and, while he's doing that, he can swing on webs. You can also 
 go into a first-person view and when you do, you may notice that the targeting icon is ripped right 
 off Predator! At first I was like "Wha ...?", but then I thought, how literal this is, I'm playing 
 a deadly predator who jumps around and kills its prey with no remorse.
  
  The scorpion is more combat heavy, in fact he is a heavy, he controls a lot differently than the 
 tarantula, but he's still fun to play. He starts off with a three-hit combo and he can also do 
 stuff like tail strike and dig holes to progress. But where his gameplay shines is in his cinematic 
 finishes that you can pull of when you do enough damage to an enemy, you press the C button and 
 then you move the wiimote and nunchuck in the correct way for really gruesome kills. The scorpion 
 is badass! You could compare this to scorpion from Mortal Kombat, "Scorpion wins ... BUGALLITY!"
 
  
  This is a fun game for anyone who is interested in the action genre, but i have to admit it has 
 its flaws, for one thing it's a little too short. If you're on easy difficulty, you will breeze 
 though the game, which is why i recommend playing it on normal difficulty. There also aren't that 
 many bosses, which is a shame since these bosses are actually quite good.
  
  Even so, this a fun game and it feels like the beginning of a new franchise, and I for one would 
 really like to see a sequel. Check it out when you get the chance.

Review:  Deadly Creatures: A game about a scorpion and a spider, the type of alliance you'd normally only 
 see in comics when the writer is running out of ideas.
  
  Story : Dennis Hopper and Billy Bob Thornton lend their voices to a pair of hillbillies looking 
 for treasure in the desert. Except you're not playing as Dennis Hopper and Billy Bob Thornton, 
 you're playing as a tarantula and a scorpion, who's own paths in life only briefly intersect with 
 that of said hicks. It's akin to a documentary having a pointless fake story to keep the kids from 
 falling asleep, except the dialogue isn't hilariously bad. I'm not too sure if the scorpion and 
 spider have their own motivations; the game has some kind of "don't **** with the desert" message 
 behind it so maybe they're trying to expel the humans, and since scorpion and spider will occasionally 
 spar with each other, they could have some kind of Ryu/Ken ancient rivalry, but otherwise their 
 intentions seem to consist of minding their own business.
  
  Though a lot of the intrigue that comes from Deadly Creatures may very well be from the nature 
 of your arachnid heroes. These aren't mystical animals with cartoonish voices, they're not some 
 Fly-like experiment where human brains are transplanted into animals, they don't have any personality 
 besides the mindset of "kill, eat, move on" in fact there's almost no attempt made to personify 
 them. They're justbugs, and the developers at Rainbow Studios were content to let the excellent 
 motion capture work alone establish the protagonists as the creepy crawlies they are. If you've 
 ever been mesmerized by how a spider moves from watching Discovery Channel or ever tapped on the 
 glass at a pet shop, you'll understand where I'm coming from. They walk like bugs, eat like bugs, 
 not really fight like bugs
  
  You'll have to suspend a bit of disbelief when it comes to certain aspects of combat. Tarantula, 
 for example, seems to be some kind of genetic hybrid of every species of spider you learned about 
 in school. He/she can leap in the air like a jumping spider, poison enemies like a black widow, 
 and web zip to certain areas like Spider Man. Combat consists of a combination of button presses 
 and Wiimote shakes, and even if you've never seen it, you have to believe that spiders can fight 
 by swinging their legs in tandem like clubs as well as jumping into enemies, spinning and holding 
 their legs out like a living ninja star. But spider combat is actually fairly enjoyable, being 
 that you can't block and thus have to jump around to evade attacks. And the game keeps things fresh 
 by consistently introducing new techniques (developed byeating your prey) . It's always satisfying 
 to leap two feet onto an unsuspecting enemy, web-trap them, charge up a poison bite, or knock them 
 on their back so you can feast on their stomach and recover health.
  
  On the flipside, scorpion is less reminiscent of alternate insect species than he is every action 
 game hero of the last three years. I've never seen a scorpion execute a three hit canned combo, 
 flinging him/herself around with this kind of agility, but this is a scorpion that enjoyed some 
 Devil May Cry. Scorpion has a block button like he's Mortal Kombat Scorpion, and has a series of 
 combos and finishing moves to keep things interesting. After beating on an enemy long enough, you're 
 given a button prompt, God of War-style, and have to execute a series of quick-time event Wiimote 
 waggles to finish off your foe. It's a bit of a struggle to get the game to recognize the motion 
 that you're trying to pull off, but it's hard not to smile when you're jabbing your stinger into 
 the skull of a rat, watching the pest screech in pain. I am a bad human being. Actually, the Wii 
 motion sensors are mostly responsive, but not always in the way you want. For example, to get scorpion 
 to burrow underground and try to ambush an enemy, you have to turn the remote upside-down, but 
 the game frequently mistakes this motion for the "ninja star spinning attack towards your enemy" 
 attack. 
  
  There's nothing complex about the game design; you move from point A to point B in a mostly linear 
 fashion, and along the way you thin out the pest population. There's almost no puzzle solving to 
 be had, not that I missed having puzzles. The spider has a bit of diversity in that he sometimes 
 has to web zip him/herself towards predetermined locations, while scorpion can dig through predetermined 
 walls (just another excuse to shake the remotes a lot.) 
  
  But in spite of this formulaic gameplay design, it's hard to not get lost in the miniature world 
 of Deadly Creatures. The levels, while linear, are clever in design, aiming for the same "small 
 objects become huge monuments of wonder" design that Shiguru Miyamoto tried to execute with Pikmin, 
 but with less charm and more intentional discomfort. Walking by a deserted motorcycle or the two 
 hillbillies produces something of an ominous vista. And being that your characters can walk on 
 walls, there's a sense of vertigo in climbing along ceilings or spiraling tunnels. I've never seen 
 a game get so much diverse and intriguing scenery out of a desert setting. And likewise, the game 
 taps into a primal urge to challenge any wild creatures that approach your way. Even though all 
 of the battles are forced, you'll never want to run away; rather you'll take offense to any rat, 
 lizard or fleet of spiders that has the audacity to block your way. 
  
  The game has some minor blemishes; the game occasionally stops to load the next part of the level. 
 Occasionally, enemies will fall through walls and either die or become trapped and lead to an easy 
 kill. But really, any complaints one can levy against Deadly Creatures will be negated by two facts. 
 
  
  One is that this is a game about a scorpion and a spider. Thus, there is nothing like it on the 
 market. Deadly Creatures is surprisingly immersive, a game that'll pull you in, consume your focus 
 and have you seeing critters in your sleep if you allow it. 
  
  Two is that it's a good Wii game, and depending on what you constitute to be a good Wii game, we 
 haven't gotten one in a long time. In particular, it's a good Wii game for males, and for the man 
 who's had to deal with his woman play Wii Fit or Wii Play, forcing her to watch you play Deadly 
 Creatures is satisfying revenge. 
  
  4 stars
  
  Suddenly, the Wii is getting good games again! This, House of the Dead, Madworld next monthnot 
 too surprisingly none of them are from Nintendo.

Review:  This game was plain out fun and it looked great. The texturing and everything in that game was 
 very realistic. Other then the graphics this is a great game to play, you get to learn more moves 
 as the game goes on and, trust me on this one, use ALL the ones you have!! Especially if you plan 
 to play on "Deadly mode." I tried that just to check it out because I was just playing on normal 
 and it was VERY difficult, but still fun to play don't get me wrong. 
  
  This is a game to either buy or rent, it's really good and I am sure you can beat it in the time 
 spent renting it. I myself bought it the first day it came out, just like i will when Disaster 
 comes out. WOOHOO!!! But I am not talking about Disaster. IT'S ALL ABOUT DEADLY CREATURES!!! So 
 take my advice and go play this game, just dont get TOO scared. LOL!

Review:  Deadly Creatures places you in the role of two small, creepy arachnids: A tarantula and a scorpion. 
 Through the game, you'll eat stuff smaller than yourself, kill stuff about the same size, or escape 
 from things that want to eat you. "Hunt or be hunted", the slogan of the game, often rings true. 
 The difficulty on normal should provide a bit of a challenge for most gamers, and for those of 
 us who like to really live on the edge, hard mode makes the game an even larger struggle for survival...
 
  
  The Good: The game offers a unique feel and is certainly unique in concept. The combat system is 
 well-done, and the scorpion's finishing moves are awesome (if somewhat twisted) and provide a sense 
 of satisfaction. The motion controls are also very responsive and accurate (at least, at my sensitivity 
 level - just slightly above normal) . The boss fights are a lot of fun, and are certainly humbling 
 to encounter. There are lots of secrets, nooks, and crannies to explore, and the visuals are very 
 nicely done. You certainly get the feel that you are, in fact, an arachnid fighting for survival. 
 The dark storyline also keeps you going until the end, though it is a little spread out...
  
  The bad: The game occasionally has drops in frame rate, but it's nothing major; more of a slight 
 irritation than anything. The game could use a few more of the epic boss fights and an improved 
 ending, as well.
  
  Overall, the game does very well as a Wii title. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan 
 of the action / adventure genre. It's not without its flaws, mind you, but the unique feel and 
 fun of the game make it one of the best titles I've purchased on the Wii.
