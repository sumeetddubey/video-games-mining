:::Review:::
This comically savage action game overcomes its frustrations with liberal doses of blood and guts. 
 

  The Black Baron. In MadWorld, this purveyor of carnal pleasures provokes your violent tendencies 
 time and again. After his recurring obscene tirades, a sultry gal clad in leather gear offers a 
 visual example of the violent challenge ahead by lopping his head off with a golf club, or impaling 
 him on a bed of spikes. She then strikes a sexy pose and slinks away, only to return when the resilient 
 Baron has somehow recovered and again arrives with even more foul-mouthed taunts. This scenario 
 is the essence of MadWorld: brutal, irreverent, and often hysterical. It's an overload of the senses 
 that wallows in both its tastelessness and its striking black-and-white visual design. More importantly, 
 this third-person action game is fun to play, though a number of gameplay frustrations hold it 
 back from greatness. Nevertheless, MadWorld provides an adrenaline rush, with all the sensory delights 
 and distresses that such excesses entail.  

           No amount of laundry detergent will be getting these stains out.      

  You're Jack -- just 
 Jack. You're the newest participant in Varrigan City's killing games, affectionately termed Death 
 Watch. At the outset, MadWorld's ultraviolent game-show narrative may remind you of a grosser, 
 grittier Smash TV, but during its short length, the story makes some curious twists. Jack is a 
 fascinating antihero, easy to root for yet not exactly likable, and a cutscene in which he cuffs 
 a smirking narcissist across the room is as shocking as any of the game's outrageous scenes of 
 dismemberment. The grittiness of the story is further enhanced by MadWorld's graphic-novel looks. 
 Aside from the copious spurts of red blood (or blue alien goo) , almost everything is rendered in 
 black and white, and for a while, it's hard not to be awed by this unusual presentation. Nevertheless, 
 that style comes at the occasional expense of visual clarity and comfort; in time, it becomes increasingly 
 difficult to see important items such as health drops within the busy environments. The game is 
 at its best when played in short chunks, if only because you'll need visual and emotional relief 
 from time to time.  

  Fortunately, developer PlatinumGames understands that overkill is best experienced in small bites, 
 and accordingly a time limit has been placed on levels, which are filled with an array of horrific, 
 murderous devices. The ShockTV viewers are a voracious bunch, and you'll earn a score based not 
 just on how many foes you kill, but also on how violently you do it. You can impale a thug on a 
 wall of spikes, but you'll garner more points by shoving a barrel onto his head, skewering him 
 with a traffic sign, smacking him around a few times, and  then  chucking him onto the spikes. 
 Every level is jam-packed with implements of destruction, and though you've always got a mighty 
 chainsaw available to you, you'll use other weapons over the course of the game. A barbed club 
 comes in handy for smashing foes around or launching them into the stratosphere; daggers afford 
 you a spinning attack that rewards you with nice, grisly sprays of blood.  

  It's a constant onslaught of comic-book sadism, and accomplishing specific tasks (affixing zombies 
 onto a fountain of blood; catching all of the alien grays) unlocks more tools of mayhem. To temper 
 all of this killing, MadWorld also provides a constant torrent of humor, not the least of which 
 comes from the hysterically perverse commentary provided by Greg Proops and John DiMaggio. Little 
 of this dialogue is fit to print, and much of it is repeated ad nauseam, but it's witty and profane, 
 so you may become red-faced both from laughter and the occasional blush. A terrific, pulsing hip-hop 
 soundtrack complements both the chatter and the gameplay, and the crunchy, squishy sound effects 
 are almost as gruesome as the sights. A game this violent is certainly inappropriate for kids to 
 watch and play, so if you have sensitive ears nearby, you may want to don a pair of headphones 
 while you shield their eyes.  

           You think this is violent? You don't know the half of it.      

  MadWorld's bloodbath 
 challenges, presided over by the aforementioned Baron, are also a hoot. These are minigames, but 
 not the ones you're used to seeing on the Wii. Rather, these brutal bits provide some of the game's 
 most explicit imagery, and many of them are funny in a macabre way. In one of them, you throw enemies 
 into a giant hand, which then squeezes blood from this handful as if juicing an orange. In another, 
 you stick your targets in barrels that then launch into the air, creating a bloody fireworks display. 
 Most of these are enjoyable for the limited time in which they occur, though some are better than 
 others (the imperfect targeting methods of Money Shot and Man Golf make them weaker entries) . You 
 can revisit them with a friend in a split-screen multiplayer mode in which you compete for high 
 scores, but out of context, these challenges are far less enjoyable and get real old, real fast. 

  As a rule, the game's control scheme uses the Wii's capabilities well, offering sensible doses 
 of button mashing and remote waving. As in Manhunt 2, the motion of the remote simulates the onscreen 
 action during a variety of finishing moves, from swinging your victim around by twirling the controller, 
 to cutting through enemies with your chainsaw by swiping with your wrist. Although most of these 
 motions hit the right notes, some sequences require a bit too much wild shaking, and a few of these 
 moments seem to wear on a bit too long. Nevertheless, most of MadWorld's control frustrations stem 
 from basic annoyances that often magnify each other. The visual design and camera troubles can 
 lead to slight disorientation, which in turn means occasionally grabbing thin air, rather than 
 the lamp post that you meant to snatch. The lock-on option is meant to alleviate these troubles, 
 but it doesn't always work when you need it to, especially in boss battles, where it should come 
 in most handy.  

           This is exactly what it looks like.      

  Those boss battles are a lot of fun once you discover their tricks and weaknesses, which shouldn't 
 take too long. Aside from aggravations like cheap attacks and the lingering camera problems, the 
 boss fights aren't often difficult and won't require you to mix up attacks for the most part. Rather, 
 contextual quick-time events normally do the most damage, so you'll want to keep a keen eye on 
 the screen, considering that the onscreen prompt flashes by almost too quickly. The ensuing scenes 
 are not only deliciously bloody, but can be rather comical as well (such as a brief instant when 
 Jack gets distracted by his female foe's abundant frontal assets) . However, should you lose in 
 battle, be prepared: MadWorld gives you limited lives to work with, though you can pick more up 
 within the level. Using up the last life means game over, and though the levels are short, it can 
 still be frustrating to repeat them all over again rather than start at the beginning of the battle. 
 That's especially true in the less consistent levels, such as one in which a couple of mechanical 
 monstrosities, a surplus of aliens, tight environments, and a difficult camera may conspire to 
 cause prolonged sequences of unavoidable damage.  

  Even if you need to replay certain sections, the experience is over in five hours or so. It's a 
 tempting repeat visit, however, not just to beat your high score or try the unlockable difficulty, 
 but to discover new and satisfying ways to fry your foes. Although MadWorld has its inconsistencies, 
 adrenaline junkies will relish its visual design and steady deluge of savage death and dismemberment.

Review:  Ever since the Wii's release, there has seemed to be a shortage of games for the mature audiences. 
 Well, Madworld just might be the solution. The main idea of Madworld is to give you a chainsaw, 
 a bunch of objects to smash into people's heads, give you innovate ways to do it, and then tell 
 you to have fun... which you will.
  
  As if it mattered, the story takes place in Jefferson City, a town which has been closed off by 
 the rest off the world by terrorists, which have forced all the civilians to kill one another for 
 mere sport. You play as Jack, a badass whose only intent is to... well, kill people.
  
  The rest of the plot really isn't that important, as the main focus of the game is killing people, 
 which is done very nicely. The controls of the gain work very nicely on the Wii, and while your 
 basic attacks require mere button pushing, the most brutal of kills require motion control, which 
 responds very well to the game.
  
  However, the point of the game is not just to kill people - it's to kill them with style. Since 
 you are on a show (called Death Watch) , you can't just always kill someone with a chainsaw - sometimes 
 you have to shove a tire over them, slam a signpost through their skull, and then bash them repeatedly 
 against a Rose Bush (believe me, it's much more awesome than it sounds) .
  
  Despite the fun of killing people this way, it does get a little repetitive after a long period 
 of time. That's why there are bloodbath challenges. These give the opportunity to kill people in 
 the most beautiful of ways - whether it be hitting them into a dartboard with a spiked bat or shoving 
 them into a pancake maker with spikes on it. Also, boss fights keep kill fresh, as the feeling 
 of killing one is oh so satisfying.
  
  However, not all is perfect. The game's is short, lasting no more than 10 hours, which is expected 
 since killing people can only be so innovative. The multiplayer is fun, but it would have been 
 nicer to see some online competitions. Also, the camera can sometimes be frustrating to center 
 on where Jack is aiming, which can frustrate the player at times.
  
  Overall, this is not a game for everyone. It is a game for the people who love throwing people 
 into trains, shoving daggers through contestants, and slicing through others with chainsaws. Madworld 
 sets out to bring a good mature game to the Wii, and Madworld does what it sets out to do.

Review:  The Graphics
  What's black and white and red all over. The graphics to
  Madworld. They surely are something. Everything is in black and white. Pretty much like the movie 
 Sin City. Actually it's a lot like the movie in terms of presentation. The only other color you 
 will see is red and there's a lot of it. It's a nice look to the game but sometimes it can interfere 
 with other things. Like everything blends in well and it's hard to see the enemies because they 
 look like the background. Still though everything is nicely put together.
  
  The Story
  I still don't know much about the story since at the start
  of it everything is shrouded in mystery. 
 I do know that someone has taken overthe city and from the looks of it Jack has been hired to stop 
 it working as a double agent. The premise is both like a comic book and a game show. They even 
 have hilarious commentary from two dudes one being a mainstay on who's line is it anyways, Greg 
 Proops and the other being the man who voiced Marcus Fenix, John Dimaggio Sometimes it gets repetitive 
 but you can't really hear it with all the destruction going on in the game. It usually fits in 
 very well
  and I end up laughing my ass off.
  
  The Game play
  Man is it child's play. The people want to get killed. They
  really don't care for their life 
 at all. There just waiting to get a pole in the head then a trashcan over it and to get stuffed 
 into a fire barrel. A mainstay combo in the game. Pretty much you have to earn more points by killing 
 the guys in more creative and gruesome ways. But there is a limit on what you can actually do. 
 There wasn't too much in a sense of creativity in the killing since depending on the locale of 
 the place it was just a tire, pole in the
  head, barrel then pit of fire. There is some sense of what there is to do to kill people but you 
 can rarely string something new into a combo, but the killing is nice and simple. That is because 
 it controls so simply. A to punch, B to swing the chainsaw. There is nothing hard about this game 
 cept for the repetitive kills, which ain't to hard either. The boss fights are something to be 
 a little more desired since they can also be simply put as just as easy. Sometimes it can be hard 
 but there is a simple pattern that you can repeat to make the boss
  fight mindlessly simple but all the time the killing of that boss leads to something simply outrageous 
 in a sense that makes it worth playing.
  
  Final Word
  No More Heroes is better. The game play is too easy, but it
  is cool to go "OOOO!" at every kill 
 because they usually aren't the same. There is variation in the killing but overall I wish it was 
 more of a challenge. I don't know maybe I haven't gotten too far into the game to make a real judge 
 at how hard the game is. You also have to count in that difficulty is also what makes the game 
 fun.

Review:  Even though the Wii is suppose to be a system for all ages, that doesn't mean that every game has 
 to be. Madworld took the step that was needed to get the Wii into the books of a hardcore system. 
 With easy to grasp gameplay and visuals that hypnotize you into it's simplicity, it's easy to see 
 why Madworld is simply a fun game. It can be all little on the short side, but it's also fun to 
 go back and replay some of the stages in the game just for the heck of it. There is a story to 
 the game though, it's not just a random beat-em-up. The boss fights though are probably the best 
 part of the game. Some can be on the easy side, and others on the extremely hard side, but every 
 one of them is still fun the fight. Each had different abilities and will keep you guessing until 
 their laying on the ground with or without a head or limbs, or a body for that matter. It is on 
 the really gory side, but that actually adds to the effect of the entire game and the fun of it. 
 At some points, you actually drag out the time you spend in a level to wait for more enemies just 
 to see if their is any other way to kill them, with or without a weapon, and practically everything 
 in the game is a weapon. Try it out if you're curious or looking for a hardcore game. Good hunting.

Review:  If you thought no more heroes was violent wait tell you play madworld.
  first all go over the story with no spoilers and then the gameplay and so on.
  
  the story- 
 your Jack, a 40ish government worker who went in deathwatch for motives unknown (untill about halfway 
 through the game) thats all you really get to know at the begenning. theres some interesting plot 
 twists and a better story then i thought there would be for a beat em up.
  
  the gameplay- its really fun and the enviormental kills are great! it can get repetive though. 
 but bustin out your chain saw and slicein and dicein enemys is always fun. but there are little 
 issues like the camera which can mess up at times but nothin major.
  
  Audio- the sounds sorta overrun each other. you have the announcers who are hillarious. the music 
 which fits the game very well and the sound of your chainsaw *#%$ someone up. it all mixes that 
 you cant really hear any of it and its just a mesh of sound. luckily you can turn the songs or 
 announcers or ingame sounds down. i prefered turnin the audio down to 7 and keelin the rest on 
 10 which makes that you can hear the announcers and have a good tune in the backround.
  
  Graphics- this game looks great. the black and white works for the wii. i honestly dont think this 
 game would look much better (if at all) on the ps3 or 360. the cutscenes are all in a comic type 
 style which fits the game. it really shows that great graphics dont always mean the highest polygon 
 count.
  
  lasting appeal- now this is where the game losses its marks. this game is short. around 7-8hrs 
 and the multiplayer is alright but nothing great. but goin into this genre (beat 'em up) you should 
 know the games are never very long.
  
  Final verdict- Madworld is a great game. and if your a fan of the genre or are lookin for a game 
 like no more heroes (which is also great) you will love madworld. it really grows on you.

Review:  Mad world is one of them games that is out there to make a point. It takes violence to the point 
 of stupidly funny. Kinda like Evil Dead, its just buckts and buckets of blood! You play as cliche 
 named "Jack" an undercover agent sent onto an island thats been taken over by terroists and is 
 being used as one big game. Think the 80's arnie film The Running Man.
  The general bases of the game is to kill and rack up the biggest style points you can, an example 
 is sticking a tyre round a goon, sticking a pole threw his head and impaling him on spikes, is 
 just one of the many ways to dispose of the opposition. After getting so far on a level a cutscene 
 is started and out trots a super pimp explaining one of the many mini games the game has to offer, 
 and it does break up the gameplay alot. One of the best things about the game, and its one of the 
 few games to have pulled it off outside nintendo, is the motion controls. They aren't just half 
 arsed gestures like most developers do, the motion controls feels really natural to do. 
  
  Graphics: Stricking is an understatement! these are really unique, its a mix of Killer 7, XIII 
 and Sin City. And its some of the best on Wii
  
  Sound: The music isn't my cup of tea but the commentary can be a howler, great one liners and defo 
 keep the atmosphere up beat.
  
  Gameplay: Kill, kill, kill! with a little bit of mini games that involve diffrent ways to kill!
 
  
  **** Box: No checkpoints!, Gameplay can get tiresome, can be insanly hard!
  
  Overall: One of the best things to come on the Wii in ages (bout time if you ask me!) Funny, visually 
 stricking, and is great fun to play.
  
  + Great graphics
  + Great commentary
  + A great pick up and play game
  + Supurb boss battles
  
  - Can get boring
  - Very hard 
 at times
  - Graphics can hurt the eyes after a while

Review:  Madworld is a hard game to judge because the few flaws it has are over-shadowed by it's shear awsomeness, 
 but not everyone will look past it's issues to the meat of this game that really is fantastic. 
 Madworld is a story of a city taken over by villains and all bridges that leave it (it's an island 
 city) have been destroyed and every citizen has been poisoned and the way to get the antidote is 
 to fight in gladitorial fights in a game-show called "death watch". The story isn't very original 
 (except or the whole game-show thing) but as the story progresses the story does become deeper 
 and deeper and ends up having a pretty awsome ending actually. Sound is spectacular for many reasons 
 from the great sound-effects themselves to the voice acting, which is absolutly top-notch and finaly 
 the music, which if you are into rap or hip-hop/rap there are a dozen or so tracks from different 
 artists. I enjoyed the music itself and I actually usually hate rap, so thats saying something. 
 Gameplay is tight and responsive, you will never feel a motion was shown and you did it because 
 it didn't register, it just dosen't happen, it worked EVERY time I did a motion and it always did 
 the motion I intended. Madworld is a bloody game, very very bloody. You are jack, who has entered 
 the games with a chainsaw connected to his arm, this chainsaw never gets old and you can also do 
 standard punches and shoulder bashed, there are about a half-dozen or so weapons that will pop-up 
 on the levels for getting a set amaout of points. All the weapons are fantastic and all have two 
 different finishers not to mention the dozens upon dozens of environmental finishers and some unlockable 
 weapons after you beat the game. The game encourages you to get creative with your kills because 
 if you just run through and cut everyone in half with your chainsaw you will get less and less 
 points for repeating the same kills, like doing tricks in tony-hawk games, you need to mix it up 
 to get high scores. Which comes to my first gripe with the game, there are no leader-boards for 
 your high-scores, this is small but should have been included in a game that thrives on repeating 
 levels for high scores. Visuals in madworld are either fantastic or coma-inducing depending on 
 if you get sick watching 3D movies, I was fine watching the sweet black and white visuals, but 
 I have heard of people complaining of everything from blurry vision to headaches all the way to 
 vomiting while playting this game for extended amounts of time. This is not because the visuals 
 are bad by any-means but rather because the visuals are just so unique, viseral and well, black 
 and white, you have to play or at least watch the game in motion to see for yourself. But madworld 
 is quite an impresive technical power-house as it is a work of bloody art. The black and white 
 art-style works great for the type of game and story they want to tell as it shows off the blood 
 effects. The levels will be filled to the brim at times with a few dozen enemies, some levels are 
 quite big, lots of geometry, particles, smoke, fire effects, chainsaws reving, blood everywhere, 
 it uses the havok physics engine which you will be impressed with a time or two, but isn't put 
 into full effect due to wii's visual limitations but animations are silky-smooth and it stays at 
 the steady frame-rate... during the single-player (I'll talk about that later) madworld really is 
 a fantastic and fatasticly unique looking game. You will be dazzeled. Bosses are a big draw for 
 me and I often don't find enough of them in games lately, well madworld fixes that. Madworld has 
 five worlds, four of the worlds have two-levels with bosses at the end of them and a final seperate 
 boss level that is only a boss and no standard level before it. And the final fifth world has two 
 levels and at the end of the second level there is the final boss, but no boss after the first 
 level (only level without a boss) So all in all you get 10 levels and 13 bosses and each level 
 (besides the boss only levels) has a mini-game in the middle of each level which are all creative 
 and fun and mix up the action. Story as I mentioned, which is quite good, will unfold just a little 
 bit with about a 3 or so minute story segment before and after each level. This comes to my biggest 
 problem with the game, madworld is short, not extremely short, but if all you want is a single-playthough 
 and don't care about multi-player than you will only get about 5-6 hours of gamepley, but if you 
 play the single-player though you get two new weapons and hard mode, so say you play though on 
 both normal and hard mode or just normal mode twice and you play the mulit-player a bit, you will 
 get 5-6 hours though the normal mode, hard mode is insanely hard and you probably won't beat it 
 ever, but say you play through the single player again, to check out the new weapons and just because 
 it is just sooo insanely fun the first time, and you play the multi-player, (which is you and someone 
 else competeing for points on any of the single-player mini-games) for an hour or two, you will 
 get a sizable experience running in at about 11-14 hours, it isn't long by any means and thats 
 the games biggest fault. Multi-player is a fun and bloody divergion that might entertain you and 
 it might not, but the frame-rate does take a hit from time to time in this mode. Overall madworld 
 is quality over quantity and if you are ok with that than just go and buy this game because madworld 
 really is a gem and if it were twice as long, I would feel very comfortable giving madworld a 9.5, 
 it's that great. You really do owe it to yourself to buy this game. Really fantastic.

Review:  MadWorld is one crazy game. It is more violent than anything I have played in a long time. For 
 a console that prides itself in cutesy games for everyone, MadWorld is the ultimate cute, the ultimate 
 family fun game. I am kidding, MadWorld is definately for the most hard core gamers.
  
  I have not beaten it, because it is hard as hell. After killing hundreds of people in brutally 
 violent ways, you get a boss fight, which usually ends in an over the top death scene.
  
  I personally enjoyed some of the deaths, never have I been more satisfied then when I pulled a 
 dude back so far, that his back breaks in half.
  
  I also find some real problems with this game.
  
  First of all, the commentators are funny 
 at first, but they really get annoying after while. I am sick of hearing about injecting drugs 
 up a scrotum. It was funny once, but doing it repeatedly really annoys.
  
  Next, the blood. It could have definately been toned down. This is one of those games that thrive 
 on the violence to get an audience because without it, this game would never sell.
  
  It has a great narrative, but between the cutscenes is a continuous stream of bloody mayhem. Most 
 of it is way to over the top for even someone obsessed with games full of brutal violence.
  
  One of the over the top moments is when you fight a cowboy. You beat him up, then grab his 
 guns and shoot him until he is nothing but a skeleton. What? How does that even make sense?
  
  Then, there is a boss fight with a little Asian lady.
  
  Beat her up, and then throw her 
 at a billboard of a shogun that picks her up with chopsticks and eats her? WHAT? Use a catapult 
 to throw people at the moon, throw people into a plane turbine, smack people with a baseball bat 
 into a dart board. Sure it was sounded cool, but when you play it, it is way to crazy to even enjoy.
 
  
  Wow, look at all that blood! That is how every enemy dies, in a giant torrent of blood. It gets 
 really boring after while. Yes new weapons open up, and new ways to murder people, but it's mostly 
 limited to decapatation, stuffing something through a dudes head, impaling someone, chainsawing 
 them in half. It's all pretty much the same.
  
  Overall, this is the kind of game you play when you have so much anger, you need to take it out 
 on someone. It's story is really good, but I think it is hindered by the over the top violence. 
 The graphics are really pretty and highly detailed. The pimp provides some funny moments, but other 
 than that, it is way to over the top for me.

Review:  At first sight, you know this game will kick ass. The over-the-top gore and violence is just what 
 Wii owners need. In the game you'll be finding different ways to kill your enemys, (sign posts, 
 fire crackers, meat grinders) . The animations are pretty funny, and the announcers crack alot jokes, 
 (one of the announcers is the voice of Bender from Futurama.) The finishers are awsome too. There 
 are finishers that you'll come across that you didnt know where there, (uppercut, then chainsaw 
 finish I missed untill well into the game.) Boss battles in this game are sweet. The only thing 
 that sucks about bosses is that if you lose all of your lives, then you must redo the entire level 
 over again. The music in the game fits it just right. At first, it will seem like it doesnt, but 
 you'll soon accept it. There are a couple of issues through. The camera can get on your nerves, 
 the announces repeat too much, and you'll be killing your enemys the same way too many times. aside 
 from all that, this game shines in alot of the right places, and gives Wii-owners hope for whats 
 to come.

Review:  MadWorld is a celebration of violence. It pervades the entire game. The only colors in the game 
 are the blood of your enemies and sound effect accentuating the chaos you create. Your character 
 is a hardened killer, with a motorcycle and a prosthetic chainsaw on his right arm. He fights in 
 Varrigan City, which has been seized by a mysterious organization to stage a last-man-standing 
 carnival of chaos for the entertainment of the world. The story hides more than one would expect 
 from a tale in this genre, but it's the only thing in the game that holds up under examination. 
 Luckily, the surface of this title is polished and accessible, a no-holds-barred playground where 
 the only limits to the amounts of gore you can achieve are your patience and imagination. 
  
  The game does a great job taking advantage of the Wii's capabilities. The unique black-and-white 
 art style makes the game stand out, even if the lack of contrast sometimes makes environments seem 
 a little flatter than they are. It's the motion controls that steal the show here, though. The 
 Wii's sparse amount of buttons limit your combat options, but the gestures give the game a visceral 
 feeling that can't be matched. For instance, an upward motion with the Wii remote can knock a hapless 
 foe straight into the air, and after tapping a button to activate a finisher, another slashing 
 motion will leave your expired enemy in pieces from your chainsaw. 
  
  That chainsaw makes it pretty simple for you to slay your enemies, but it won't get you the most 
 points, essential to progress. Levels in MadWorld play out like fairly open playgrounds. When you 
 achieve different point thresholds, new obstacles, enemies, weapons, and minigame challenges open 
 up, culminating in the ability to activate a level-ending boss fight. All kills are not created 
 equal in MadWorld, and the more elaborate your death-dealing, the more you will be rewarded for 
 it. Punching an enemy to death will only give you a few points, but stabbing your foe through the 
 head with a few different street signs, and ending it with a toss into a dumpster that chops your 
 foe in half, will result in a substantially greater reward. This can tempt players to look only 
 for super-high-scoring kills, but it's easy enough to go through the level like a whirling dervish 
 of destruction, tossing foes into spikes and slicing them up without reservation. It's just as 
 satisfying. 
  
  One might gather that the game isn't one to play around small children or the elderly. This doesn't 
 even take into account the continual commentary provided by the announcers of this game show, whose 
 contributions are lewd, vulgar, and frequently hilarious. Unfortunately, their comments repeat 
 very often, and start to wear thin after lots of play. 
  
  A lot of the game can feel that way. Since the game isn't super-challenging (it gets harder about 
 half-way through, but enemies generally stand around and help facilitate your wanton death-dealing) , 
 the combat options aren't incredibly diverse, and there are only so many ways you can impale or 
 dismember a person, you'll start to go through the same kinds of motions pretty early on. The presentation 
 and motion controls make this cycle entertaining, but there aren't a ton of surprises. In that 
 respect, perhaps it is fortunate that a straight run through the main story only lasts about five 
 hours. Extra challenges in each level, and an unlocked hard mode (much more difficult) lend incentive 
 to replay if you haven't had your fill. 
  
  The story is a pleasant surprise on this front, though. Hardened protagonist Jack Cayman hides 
 a number of surprises about his origin, and the games themselves have a purpose behind them more 
 elaborate than simple entertainment. In a genre where stories are usually entirely disposable, 
 the well-presented and efficient cutscenes (punctuated with comic-style panels and stills) keep 
 you moving forward even when the game itself doesn't perfectly hold up. 
  
  If you're a frequent gamer considering the purchase of a game whose box art bears a grizzled man 
 bearing a blood-stained chainsaw, you've probably already killed many people virtually. The question 
 you ought to ask yourself before making a purchase, in that case, is, "Just how much DO I enjoy 
 creating absurd amounts of violence and death by killing people in a video game?"

Review:  What's Good:
  
  - It's fun. 
  MadWorld is a game unlike any other on the Wii. It's a brutal beat-'em-up that encourages you to 
 be as violent as possible. The game is divided into several stages in which you have 30 minutes 
 to rack up a certain amount of points. The more brutal your kills, the more points you get. Due 
 to this relatively simple setup, along with the over-the-top environmental and cinematic kills, 
 MadWorld excels in the most important department: fun.
  
  - The announcers are hilarious.
  Without delving too deep, MadWorld's plot revolves around a 
 fictional sporting event called DeathWatch, which has become one of the most popular sports in 
 the nation. As such, the game is narrated by two hilarious announcers that always have something 
 to say. Their jokes typically arouse smiles at the least, even though there are many repeats and 
 a couple of bombs. Without the announcers, MadWorld would not be half as fun as it is.
  
  - Most of the soundtrack is great.
  MadWorld features a soundtrack composed almost entirely of 
 original hip-hop by small-name artists. Many of the songs are really great, even better than most 
 mainstream songs. However, there are a few songs that just aren't very good. They're not bad by 
 any means, but they just don't stick with you as much as other songs in the bunch.
  
  What's bad:
  
  - It's short and overpriced.
  Even while playing at a moderately slow pace, 
 I finished MadWorld in under four hours. That wouldn't be much of a problem if its price were any 
 lower, but a full-priced game that's only about twice the length of a movie just isn't right. But 
 the length is understandable; any longer and it would become repetitive. Replay value is entirely 
 dependent on how much you care about beating your previous scores and replaying the game on a significantly 
 harder difficulty setting. So it's not really the length that bothers me, but the price instead.
 
  
  - It doesn't introduce enough variation.
  Even with its short length, MadWorld starts to get repetitive about midway through. This is simply 
 because it doesn't do enough to change up the gameplay. Sure, every level has a distinct "Bloodbath 
 Challenge" minigame, but that's not enough to shake things up. Enemies and weapons only get face 
 lifts from level to level rather than actual variation in terms of behavior and function.
  
  Final Verdict:
  
  Rent it, or get it on sale.
  In the end, most hardcore gamers will 
 enjoy MadWorld quite a bit. It's unique, crude, and just plain fun. Just be wary of the short length 
 and borderline repetition. A rental would be most recommended, unless you can pick it up for cheap.

Review:  Madworld is def a sick game, no doubt about it. I do see y Gamespot gave it a 7.5 but thats just 
 gamespot, they seem to hate most Nintendo games and they review harshly as is. But besides the 
 fact, it was OVERRATED due to the fact that the camera sucks but its not terrible and the game 
 is short. The game is then also UNDERRATED due to its unique style of gameplay. The killings, black 
 and white design, creativeness in general, is so good; so different from your typical Wii game. 
 Nintendo needs to make more like MadWorld; just longer and better taken care of (camera) . I gave 
 it an 8.5 because every time i play it I'm like, "this game is so sick, haha". If they fixes those 
 minor things i discussed before it would be worth a 9.0 or above. PS i could have done without 
 the commentary... it was funny at times but unnecessary, corny, and inappropriate most of the time.. so 
 i turned it off haha. The music is fitting and the sounds effects are great. Jack is def BA.

Review:  
  
  Even though it was a long time coming and the hype was quite substantial prior to its release, 
 this is one of the rare occasions where a game accually lives up to all that was promised... and 
 quite frankly, then some.
  
  The unique features about this game are quite clear from the get go. You play Jack, the man with 
 the plan, on an island city that has been over run by maniacs and you need to fight your way to 
 the top spot in a televised game show called Death Watch. This is all presented to you in a graphic 
 novel style with Black and White and Red all over. And believe me, the red is all over the place. 
 Yes, this is indeed not a game for the squirmish and enjoys some seriously violent gameplay which 
 you achieve by making fairly easy and intuitive gestures with your Wii remote and Nunchuck. In 
 a nutshell, the game does what it says on the tin.... Yes? Actually, no. It does more. You see, 
 for all its flash and glamour this game garnered before release, it didnt let you in to the fact 
 that the story was such a key eliment to this games addictiveness. Sure enough, at its heart it 
 is a 3rd person Adventure/Beat'em up, where you need execute your foes in ever more grisley and 
 debauche manners to achieve that almighty High Score. As well it throws in a few extras, like 'on 
 yer bike' stages and 'Bloodbath Challenges', to mix up the flow of gameplay every now and then. 
 However, as stated above, what really kept me going to the blood soaked end was the stories ability 
 to keep the player immersed in this comic book world. Each stage enlightens you just a little bit 
 more as to why these are events are happening and certainly leaves you believing there is a bigger 
 picture here, and hopefully will continue in a sequel. 
  
  In short, all the coolness of the features in this game are glued together by a solid story with 
 fluid and challenging gameplay. If you ever just want to pick up a game and kill something to get 
 your kicks, then this will do it. If you want to get properly stuck into what is surely the first 
 chapter to a possibly epic series, then this will do that to. So if your senses can stand all the 
 machoness and bloodshedm you need to get this game. Quality.

Review:  Review: MadWorld 
  Released: 20th March (UK) (Out Now)
  Platforms: Wii
  
  One of the most ultra violet beat-em-up has landed for the Nintendo Wii accurately entitled as 
 Madworld. Varrigan City has had its transportation and communication links cut off from the rest 
 of the world by a group of terrorists called the "The Organizers". This same group had also released 
 a virus among the population of Varrigan City with a vaccine only rewarded to those that will kill 
 another thus tuning the city into a recurring game show called Death Watch. The remaining citizens 
 of Varrigan City become the contestants of this ultra violet game with the hope of becoming the 
 top ranked fighter in the game and win a large cash prize. 
  
  In Madworld you will take control of a character called Jack Cayman, a contestant in the DeathWatch 
 games who also just happens to have a retractable chainsaw on his right arm ready to slice someone. 
 During the Death Watch games you pretty much have one main objective and that's to kill everyone 
 you see. However simply killing someone isn't enough you have to be creative in order to rack up 
 enough points to take on each boss character in order to rank up and become the top fighter. 
 
  
  There are many ways to kill someone pin them against a set of spikes or maybe you want to shove 
 a barrel over them first and then stab them with 1, 2 or 3 lampposts and then repeatedly smash 
 them against a set of spikes and watch as piles of blood spill from your opponents bodies. Yeah 
 it says gruesome but that's what MadWorld is all about over the top creative violence. Being a 
 Wii game it uses the motion control of the nunchuk and wiimote but don't worry no complex motions 
 required here in fact simple vertical and horizontal motions are what you'll be doing most of the 
 time. During most levels you will encounter BloodBath Challenges, which are minigames that have 
 you attempt to score kills in certain ways. One particular Bloodbath Challenge called "Man Darts", 
 has the player hit enemies onto a giant dartboard with a baseball bat to score points. Each BloodBath 
 challenge is introduced by the Black Baron who seems to get killed during each introduction. 
 
  
  MadWorld incorporates cel-shaded graphics with limited colour palette of high contrast black and 
 white in fact the only colour you'll see is red and there's a ton of it as you kill your opponents 
 over and over and over watching piles of blood spill. MadWorld has a fantastic soundtrack and some 
 great voice audio work. The game also manages to incorporate split screen co-op but this is limited 
 to the Bloodbath Challenges. 
  
  MadWorld is a fun game to play but there are number of criticisms. The black and white art style 
 is great but it can make it hard to see at times so sometimes you'll walk past objects such as 
 baseball bats and lampposts etc. The gameplay is entertaining at first, but it can grow old after 
 awhile as you'll find yourself following the same routine. You don't have control of the camera 
 in this game you can only centre it and it can be pretty frustrating when the camera is facing 
 the wrong way and you get blind sighted by an enemy. On top of that the games lock on system is 
 pretty weak as it takes while to lock on properly. Lastly the soundtrack, voice work and sound 
 effects are all just piled on top of each other and it's hard to hear everything properly some 
 adjusting of the sound levels is needed hear. 
  
  All in all I found MadWorld a fun and entertaining game to play. For most players this game will 
 last between 5  6 hours and those that like to take their time add a few more hours on top of 
 that. If you're not the type to play a game at least twice then I suggest renting otherwise I recommend 
 everyone that has a Wii try out MadWorld.

Review:  If you don't have a seriously violent game in your wii collection yet and you think you need one 
 (I know we all do) this is the best one I have played. Manhunt 2 and No More Heroes are the other 
 2 games in my collection that are full of blood and violence but I believe this one will offer 
 the most overall enjoyment
  
  This game is noticeably different right from the start. I mean when was the last time you played 
 a game almost entirely in black and white. The comic book graphics are probably the only thing 
 that saved this game from being censored severely, good marketing decision I say. The graphics 
 look good as it gives the impression that every aspect of the characters and the environment is 
 incredibly detailed. This does however cause some issues because everything looks the bloody same 
 (he he bloody, pun) and this does make it a bit difficult finding items as well as environmental 
 objects for death and destruction. The black and white appearance wears on you a bit but if you 
 get sick of it you can just go on a mass killing spree and paint the town red, literally.
  
  The gameplay in this is what makes it different from the other 2. I know in No More Heroes 
 all I felt like I was doing was mashing buttons and swinging the remote and well you kind of just 
 do the same thing in this but you don't tend to notice it as a chore. There is a good variety of 
 ways to kill people including your ridiculous chainsaw, the signs, the walls, bins, tires, picked 
 up weapons and pretty much anything else you can get your hands on or throw people near. It offers 
 enough variety to keep the game going and still being interested.
  
  I will admit I have only played for less than 30 min but that is just due to the lack of free time 
 I have for gaming these days but Mad World is my new game of choice when I have time to pick up 
 a wii controller. As the game progresses I'm sure it will reveal a more in depth storyline which 
 is evident by the comic book style intro at the beginning. 
  
  Bottom Line:
  It has blood, blood and more blood as well as interesting ways to kill, dismember and in general 
 run amuck downtown. Despite all this excessive use of violence it is backed up with a reasonable 
 control scheme, impressive (and different) graphics and to top it off a multiplayer option to share 
 the love.

Review:  For starters, the graphics are great, it fits well to the game, although I do not recommend to 
 stay in a colorful room, for this will just hurt your eyes, from my own experience. The black and 
 white visual really brings out the blood and sharpens the image of a sick-and-twisted world.
  
  While, I'm on the topic of the graphics, I'd like to add the camera situation, most of the 
 reviews I've read on the camera says the camera is annoying, but for in my humble opinion, it's 
 good, it's just like Resident Evil 4, over-the-shoulder, and brings you near the action.
  
  The controls, it fits well to the Wii, it really makes you feel that you're the one slicing and 
 dicing the enemies, especially if you have the volume and vibration of the Wiimote to high. The 
 controls here are not just "waggle 'till you win", it's in a different place, if you swing the 
 Wiimote incorrectly, especially in a power-struggle, things go wrong...
  
  
  Replay value, if you're just going for the storyline, you might be disappointed with the length 
 of the game. It's just at least 7 hours or less, of course, it's always fun to figure out how to 
 get the Ultra Violence kill, then post it on the internet.
  
  
  All in all, the game MadWorld has great graphics, gameplay, control. "Wii" recommend you to get 
 this game.
  
  
  (For those who don't know, defenestrate is the act of throwing someone or something out of a window.)

Review:  I can't believe all the positive reviews this is getting. I only played the game for about ... 
 1 to 2 hours. And i realize that not having been hooked i may not have gotten it.... AT LEAST that 
 is what all the reviews are telling me, but i have my doubts.
  
  1) this is supposed to be aimed at "adult" "players". Ok, yeah ... with the quotes that's probably 
 valid. Player's (drug dealer wannabes) who are deemed "mature" ... IQ roughly around their shoe 
 size may think this is classy entertainment. Adult gamers might get a chuckle out of it but it 
 fades quick ... real quick. The most standout thing i heard was "No means yes, and Yes means anal" 
 ... cute sure, but really, what is the relevance? It's there for shock value alone. It might be 
 mature in content, but not mature in nature.
  
  2) soundtrack / voice track... commentators are annoying, repetitive, and the music ... well if 
 you like RAP it might be great. I didn't check the soundtrack that came with the game but ... what 
 i heard in game meant i would not even use it for a drink coaster... that said, i'm not big on 
 rap even when it is good.
  
  3) controls - they aren't bad ... it's actually a little odd, on the one hand they are clearly 
 for the wii with plenty of motions that relate to relatively appropriate movements onscreen. On 
 the other hand, they feel like they just don't work on the Wii. Many things (like pickup) are out 
 of the way, and thus the flow of the game are interrupted. For that matter ... why do i need a 
 special button to pickup an extra life? I don't have the option of beating someone to death with 
 it ... incidentally ... THAT would be irony and awesome ... play the training and listen to the 
 commentators and you'll get it.
  
  Other things, that are annoying is that Jack (you) will happily wonder into an oncoming train when 
 you tell him to go somewhere else, and naturally occasionally inputs are misinterpreted (meh, it 
 happens) . My final beef though is like the pickup button. So you do all these motions with the 
 mote, but why ...? 
  
  4) game doesn't take itself serious ... ok, i do get that this is a satire of some sort ... or 
 a parody ... there are stacks of cliches ... more than there is blood (see mature players above) . 
 From the unknown agent with the east european accent, to the dumb cannon fodder enemies, via the 
 huge bosses ... there isn't anything here that is new. The things that are cute / newish (eg beat 
 a guy into a spick ladden wall) don't work well. Yeah they work, but you do the same move four 
 times and you're back to point three .... "why am i doing all this" and "why is it so much effort". 
 So that means i have a game that feels like it's making fun of itself, is boring about how it does 
 it, and me driving it forward makes me wonder if maybe there is some work i could do instead. I 
 think they overshot their goal
  
  5) Realism... closely related to 4, is just not there. Then again, if i wanted to do something 
 real i could do the dishes ... nevermind about this... i guess it is mute.
  
  6) on screen messages ... either they stay too long OR they blip by too quickly.... i gather my 
 A finish move wasn't quite right ... i never got to read the next part of the sentence which (presumably) 
 would have told me what to do to make it right. That said, i don't have a HD tv ... which raises 
 the question ... does HD really matter for a wii game that's black and white (and red)
  
  So what is good ... visual style is nice, Black and white and red with some yellow. Some of the 
 cliches are ... subtle. As a hunch though, people who thing the "no means yes..." is clever won't 
 get those or the references. Think about this: why are you throwing someone into a turbine, OR 
 why are there spikes on the train ... Both are references to something ... And on consideration 
 this works on multiple levels.
  
  So in conclusion, there is only one game i can compare it to in current memory and that is House 
 of the Dead: Overkill. That game has all the elements, but it is serious about it's execution. 
 Madworld lacks this seriousness and in a way that is really why i think a lot of reviewers like 
 this game: Madworld does not WANT to be serious, it wants to be ridiculous, over the top and out 
 there. I can respect that, but really... doesn't just mean this is a violent game that is violent 
 for violence sake?
  
  In which case, why ... bother?

Review:  It's A Mad World
  
  Part Running Man, part Sin City; part snuff film, part comic book noir. The guilty pleasures of 
 vicariously watching violence and bloodshed. MadWorld is all of this, and none of it. It is a concoction 
 so unholy the very grounds that soccer moms and conservative right-wings walk on was shaken. The 
 brainchild of some malicious, vile monster that seeks to ruin the image of the Wii and turn it 
 into the monstrosity that plagues homes world wide. MadWorld is a sinister trip into the abysmal 
 underbelly of gratuitousness, vulgarity, sex, and drugs - and that is why we love it. Thrust into 
 the hijacked Varrigan City - whose bridges and ports have been all but sealed off from the outside 
 world - you take on the role of Jack, a rogue Marine infiltrating the war zone with a personal 
 agenda. A deadly virus was released hours ago, threatening the lives of all those who called Varrigan 
 home. The promise of a cure was offered to anyone who willingly killed another person. So began 
 the Deathwatch Games.
  
  Born from the remnants of the former subsidiary of Capcom known as Clover Studios, Platinum Games 
 - consisting of a variety of minds responsible for such classics as Okami, Viewitful Joe, and the 
 Resident Evil series - have put forth one of their most remarkable, stunning, thrilling, and engrossing 
 tales yet. And Wii owners are all the better for it.
  
  A Rosebush By Any Other Name Would Not Hurt As Much.
  
  Perhaps second to the game's stunning 
 visual presentation is the advertisement of complete and total freedom of choice when killing someone. 
 And this is entirely the case. The world is your playground, and everything in it is waiting to 
 be used. See a wall of spikes off to the side? Why not first pick up a sign post and jam in through 
 the enemy's head. While you're at it, pick them up and drop them into a trash can. Then feel free 
 to make them holy. Or perhaps fire is more your style? Why, there's a conveniently placed jet engine 
 burning white-hot flames just for your vicarious-pleasure. Go on, roast some marshmallows. It's 
 alright.
  
  If the natural environment isn't your cup of tea, Jack is more than equipped to take care of business 
 himself. Furious punches and kicks from the A button will stun enemies into a state of dizziness, 
 prompting you to then perform a special move to finish them off. When the enemy becomes dazed, 
 you'll see a flashing icon on the screen; pressing the B button will cause Jack to use one of dozens 
 of moves to kill the enemy, which may require slight motion control from the remote and/or nunchuk. 
 If you press A in the dazed state, Jack will grab the enemy by his feet, and a circular-motion 
 icon will appear on screen prompting you to swing the remote in such a way that when you let go 
 of the button, Jack will toss the enemy in the corresponding direction. 
  
  If you choose to be lazy and want to cut through a slew of enemies in a hurry, hold down the B 
 button and let that chainsaw rip. Swinging the remote downward (with B still held) will cause Jack 
 to swing vertically, and likewise swinging the remote left or right for horizontally. This will 
 slice enemies in half appropriately to the direction you have swung. Take note that in some areas, 
 certain enemies will not be killed if sliced horizontally. Holding down the A button near an enemy 
 will pick them up, and giving the nunchuk a flick will cause Jack to give him a little head butt 
 to keep him under control. There is no proper block feature in the game; rather, Platinum Games 
 has opted to completely skip that step and simply include an evade feature. When not punching or 
 chainsawing, a twitch of the nunchuk will make Jack do a backflip. This can be bothersome, however, 
 since Jack will ONLY flip backwards - there is no side or forward evasive maneuver. All in all, 
 the combat is solid and intuitive. The motion controls blend beautifully with the simple presses 
 of the A and B buttons, and combat is very fluid.
  
  Noir In Motion
  
  MadWorld is nothing short of a unique visual triumph. And coming from the minds behind Viewitful 
 Joe and Okami, one would not expect anything less. The game is rendered entirely in black-and-white 
 comic book noir with splashes of yellow to signify certain in-game rewards, and red - for the obvious 
 bloodshed. Batches of red can also be seen covering various in-game methods of world-punishment 
 - covering a dumpster, the wall of spikes, a spinning steel fan - as if a giant flag was being 
 waved saying, "Hey, Jack! Toss the enemy into me!" Various cut scenes are in pre-rendered full 
 motion, but a good majority of the major dialogue conversations are in that very style I've mentioned 
 - comic book noir. Squared panels will slide on and off screen with still-motion facial expressions 
 of the characters as the expertly-delivered dialogue plays out.
  
  The game's overall presentation is spectacular; however, there is but one fault in all of this. 
 MadWorld runs at the lowest possible 480i resolution. The lack of a progressive scan option may 
 hurt those with larger high-definition TVs, resulting in an obviously more pixilated picture, but 
 the visual beauty of the game itself will allow you to easily forgive this oversight.
  
  Brought To You By Shock TV
  
  The game as a whole is presented in two distinct "modes," shall 
 we say - and one could argue that there is even a third mode. Firstly, and most importantly, this 
 game is classified as a beat-em-up. The primary focus of MadWorld is to kill as many people as 
 you can, in the most unique and violent ways, to rack up points. As your score increases, more 
 rewards are unlocked in the level, and eventually, the boss battle becomes available. It's this 
 simple formula that may turn off potential MadWorld-players, but that is where the monotony is 
 broken by the second mode. Within each level are very distinct, and for the most part, highly original 
 mini-games set within the game world and often utilizing one of that particular level's focal weapons. 
 These mini games, known within MadWorld as "Bloodbath Challenges," are not mandatory, they are 
 simply a one-time event per level and another means of increasing your score very quickly.
  
  The types of challenges you'll be presented with include the very family-friendly Man Golf, 
 wherein you will use a golf club to tee off the heads of attackers and attempt to get them through 
 floating targets in the distance, and Man Darts, in similar fashion, using human projectiles and 
 swinging at them with a bat in an effort to hit a grand slam and nail them into the giant dart 
 board. The variety of these Bloodbath Challenges serve as a means of breaking up the repetition 
 within each level. When Jack has reached a sufficient score, you'll be given a brief scene alerting 
 you that the boss battle is now open. Each boss offers a very different experience than the rest; 
 simple button mashing is likely to get you killed, which may lead to many a hair-pulling. MadWorld 
 runs on a traditional life-based system; Jack innately starts out with 2 lives every level. Collecting 
 special items called "Jack Balloons" (and they are literally balloons) will grant you an extra 
 life, while eating pills dropped from enemies restores partial health and the Happy Onion restores 
 full health. If you die during a boss battle on your last life, you must start the entire level 
 over again. A minor frustration, but one that can easily be overlooked considering no level should 
 generally last more than 10-15 minutes.
  
  As if the furious combat, intense mini-games, and thrilling boss battles weren't enough, the geniuses 
 at Platinum Games have included a trump card - a means by which all injustices of the in-game world 
 are settled through witty dialogue and hilarious bantering: the Deathwatch Announcers. They are 
 with you from beginning to end, making what could be a depressing and bleak game one of the most 
 entertaining and memorable experiences you will have this console generation. Voiced by the hilarious 
 Greg Proops (of "Whose Line Is It Anyway" notoriety) and the ever-popular John DiMaggio (made famous 
 for his roles as Marcus Fenix in Gears of War and Bender of "Futurama") the duo whip up some of 
 the best bantering to grace television sets since Abbot and Costello.
  
  From the tiniest actions performed by Jack in game to the grandest killing blows, the announcers 
 are ready and waiting to unleash a flurry of cynical, sarcastic comments with no regard for personal 
 decency or feelings. Kreese Kreely (DiMaggio) , a former Deathwatch challenger, speaks the voice 
 of strategy and insider knowledge about the games, while Howard "Buckshot" Holmes (Proops) is simply 
 the gratuitous, raunchy one. The two will often regard one of Jack's actions in game and then trail 
 off into random yet entertaining dialogue about Buckshot's wife and their sex life. One particular, 
 unrelated anecdote follows when Jack consumes a health pill; Buckshot comments that he likes to 
 wash his pills down with a little scotch, and Kreese replies, "I like to wash down my scotch with 
 a little scotch." The two then begin repeating "I love scotch" one after the other for a few seconds. 
 These are the moments that make you want to cease the bloodshed, if only for a moment, sit back 
 and just listen to the two go at it. The one fault with this is that far too often the dialogue 
 will be repeated; if you were to go and pick up another health pill a few minutes later, the announcers 
 would say the same exact thing. This is fine for the first hour or so of the game, but after a 
 while can get tedious. The only reason it remains somewhat enjoyable is the fact that it's still 
 so hilarious despite how many times it's said.
  
  The game is not terribly long and should take the average player 5-6 hours to complete. It consists 
 of 6 districts within Varrigan City with 2 to 3 sections for each district, and a boss battle within 
 each section. The game's standard difficulty level is "Normal," although this can be compared to 
 another game's "Easy." Enemies will often stand there waiting for your brutal onslaught, which 
 may or may not be enjoyable depending on the player. The real challenge, however, comes from "Hard" 
 mode: if Normal equals Easy, then Hard equals OH MY GOD WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? In addition, 
 several unlockable weapons become available after beating the game including a katana, a dual-bladed 
 chainsaw, and more. There is a simple local co-op featured, though the only mode of play is the 
 various Bloodbath Challenges with one other person. Perhaps this is for the better, because Deathwatch 
 would not seem at all the same if Jack had a buddy with him wreaking havoc across the desolate, 
 terrorist- overrun city.
  
  Jack, Jack, He's A Psychomaniac
  
  MadWorld boasts an eclectic soundtrack of mostly-unknown artists who worked specifically for the 
 game. Consisting entirely of rap/hip-hop tunes, the music in MadWorld is unique, to say the least 
 - but it is also perfectly fitting of the game's intense atmosphere and hectic gameplay. Each area 
 of the game has its own theme, as do every featured boss battle, culminating in 20 original, catchy 
 tunes. The voice acting in MadWorld is second-to-none. Superb casting all around, from Jack to 
 the various secondary-characters all throughout, and the especially brilliant work from John DiMaggio 
 and Greg Proops as the announcers. You may find yourself tuning out the game's music and sound 
 effects simply to hear the announcers in all their glory; although, this leads me to mention the 
 only fault in the game's otherwise-superb sound mixing.
  
  During the heat of reckless combat, the sounds of bone crushing/chainsaw revving, the blaring background 
 music, and the play-by-play commentary of the announcers meshes together in a jumbled, incoherent 
 mess. Far too often the three distinct sounds of the game will collide with each other resulting 
 in a very loud, likely very annoying experience - at least until one or two of the noises subside. 
 A simple lowering of the sound effects, music, or announcers can help remedy the situation - thereby 
 causing the louder sound to drown out the rest - but ultimately, when you have brilliant music 
 and brilliant voice acting, it becomes a difficult decision to lower either of them.
  
  And The Verdict Is
  
  MadWorld is in every way a thrilling, original adventure. Not only because 
 it takes its place on the throne among the Wii's mature crowd, but because it utilizes unconventional 
 methods of storytelling, gameplay, and visual presentation to create one of the most enjoyable 
 experiences on the console thus far. It boils down to this: MadWorld is primitive, juvenile, vulgar, 
 and violent - everything a starved Wii-owning sociopath could ask for.
  
  Pros: Breathtaking noir-inspired visuals; cathartic and exhilarating combat; flawless voice acting 
 and music all around; many twists within a seemingly-conventional story
  
  Cons: Short length at only 5-6 hours; poor camera controls can get frustrating in tight situations; 
 limited co-op could have included at least wifi for the Bloodbath Challenges; medley of sound effects, 
 music, and voices does not mesh well.
  
  The Final Verdict: 8.5/10
  Simply put, if you own a Wii and you're itching for a remarkable, albeit short, experience you're 
 not likely to forget for years to come, play MadWorld. There is absolutely nothing else quite like 
 it on any platform - ever.

Review:  In this game you are a huge guy that looks like a biker named Jack. The story in this game is really 
 awesome because you kill enemies for points and the more points you get the higher your score goes 
 up. The story is just about killing people and making your score go high up and there is a boss 
 battle after every single level. The story is about a game show called death watch where you versus 
 against the enimies. The story takes place on a island called Jefferson island where you save the 
 city from the enimies. 
  
  The graphics are black, white, and red but it is great graphics for a wii game. The gameplay is 
 really great cause when you use jacks weapon the chainsaw you have to hold down the B button and 
 then you can swing your wiimote and you attack the enimies. You can also get more weapons in the 
 game and use them to attack. The game will only take you about 6 hours to play but it is really 
 fun unless you play it for hours.
  
  During each level there is a few minigames called the blood bath challenge where you attack enimies 
 and get points but there is always different ways to kill the enimies in the blood bath challenges. 
 Like there is one where you throw them at an airplane wing and they get cut up. You can also kill 
 your enimies in different ways even without the blood bath challenge like you can put a stop sign 
 through their heads or put a trash can on them or put them in a dumpster and their head comes off. 
 There are so many different ways to kill your enimies. 
  
  The good of the game is that killing your enimies in different ways are really fun. The graphics 
 are really nice. There are plenty of weapons to use to kill enimies. The blood bath challenges 
 are really fun to play.
  
  The bad the game deos get boring if you play it a few hours straight.
  
  Overall this game 
 is a great game to get for anyone who likes violents and bloody videogames. I rate this game 9.0 
 outta 10.

Review:  My original review is below: I will add that after giving this game a different shot I enjoy it 
 a bit more. The Boss fights are epic but the in between can be frustrating. Overall I'll give it 
 an 8 now. But you REALLY have to learn to deal with some frustrating lock on/camera aspects. Its 
 strange because its not a total waggle game but you have to be pin point on when you do waggle 
 especially against end bosses. Anyways Just because I stink doesn't mean it should get a bad rating. 
 I'll give it an 8 for now:
  
  OLD REVIEW
  
  I really wanted to like this game. I'd been looking forward to it for a long time and I'll tell 
 you what. ITS NOT THAT GOOD. If it wasn't a WII game it would get a 6 or 7 across the board. Because 
 its a WII Game its getting positive press. I have to agree with Gamespot even though initially 
 I thought their score was low. Its a real bummer but this game kinda is painful to play in a bad 
 way.
  
  The lock on system really stinks, the camera is confusing and frustrating, and the controls feel 
 slow and boring.
  
  The end bosses are great but really its hard to figure out what to do against them. Movement is 
 clunky and things like swinging your chainsaw are much more frustrating they then should be.
  
  Overall I think this game is another WII game that gets overrated. I applaud what it tries 
 to do but concept does not equal success.
  
  BOO

Review:  Do you like violence? Taring your enemies a new one? Impaling punks on everything from meat hooks 
 to large metal spikes? Using peoples' heads as golf balls? Going midevil on zombies with baseball 
 bats, or maybe setting them on fire? How about blood? You like buckets and buckets of blood, right?
 
  
  If you answered any of the above questions "yes," then Madworld is probably the game for you, because 
 you will be able to all that, and more, to your adversaries throughout the course of the game. 
 So come expecting an absolutely hilarious, over-the-top, gore-fest when you start playing, and 
 don't expect it to stop until you've thrown your last enemy off a building.
  
  You'll play as Jack, a very popular contestant on the uber-violent show Deathwatch, who is working 
 his way through a diseased and violent city on his way to being the number one ranked contestant 
 on the show. And while in the beginning it seems like that is as much story as you're going to 
 get, it quickly becomes apparent that just about every person, including Jack, has some ulterior 
 motive. The entire story develops very well as a result, and it gives you real meaty backstory 
 to go with all of the heavy violence.
  
  Another aspect that starts slow is the graphics, which will take a little getting used to. It feels 
 like one big mess in the beginning, because there's so much black and white you'll think you're 
 looking at a picture of a zebra herd. This changes, however, and once your eyes adjust you'll appreciate 
 the style. Platinum Games did a beautiful job of giving the entire game a heavy graphic-novel feel 
 while keeping the game playable. So while you'll occasionally miss a power-up or a set of stairs, 
 it won't be a frequent problem.
  
  What you hear is just as important as what you see in Madworld, but not for the reasons you would 
 expect. Sure, they did an excellent job making sure that you hear every broken bone and the sound 
 of flesh being torn asunder, but it's the commentary that will have you rolling on the floor laughing. 
 Greg Proops and John DiMaggio's constant banter add the extra layer of comedy needed to keep things 
 on the lighter side.
  
  It's the comedy and variety that helps keep the whole experience novel and fresh. Sure, the first 
 time you grab a sign post, jam it through someone's eye, slam a barrel over their head, and then 
 toss them into a moving train, it's funny. The thirtieth time you do it, it isn't. But thanks to 
 the aforementioned banter, the art style, and constant variety of deathtraps in the environments, 
 it never really turns stale. It plays more like a constant highlight reel than it does a series 
 of repetitive motions, so you don't go on autopilot during gameplay.
  
  There's really only one serious issue here, and that's the game's length. Even with some restarts, 
 you'll be through the game in about five to seven hours, and this is where some gamers will be 
 thrown off the trail. Thankfully, there's some serious replay value to be had here in the form 
 of multiplayer, new weapons, hidden areas (that you will probably miss the first time) , and most 
 importantly, a higher difficulty level.
  
  Simply put, your first play through is going to be relatively easy. Your adversaries won't put 
 up much of fight in terms of you grabbing and tossing them wherever you want. They're not pushovers, 
 but it doesn't always feel like much of a fight, either. Once you unlock hard mode, they'll start 
 dodging, using more weapons, and just generally slapping you around every chance they get, so you 
 end up with a lot more challenge (and more fun) the second time around... not to mention the incredible 
 satisfaction of finding new ways to kill your opponents. 
  
  Anyone looking for an insanely funny, over-the-top, mature gaming experience will find it here, 
 no question. But gamers who only play a game through once, and those who adverse to large amounts 
 of blood, should stay away as it will be too short and violent for their tastes. Don't be put off 
 if this is a title you've been waiting for, though, as this one turned out to be everything that 
 was promised.

Review:  I don't know where to begin with this game, i mean the graphics are the thing that cought me first, i 
 mean black and white graphics just went to the top with this game. I don't care if it doesn't have 
 online it's still off the hook. 
  
  The graphics i believe is black and white.... and red (blood) . Yes this game does have blood.... a 
 Wii exclusive game from SEGA has blood. Although the graphics does have some cons too, for example 
 in some parts of the game the graphics seemed to throw me off a little bit and i died, but that 
 was nothing. Not counting the graphics of the game there seemed to be too much blood especially 
 when you're really doing those raw moves with enemies if you know what i'm talking about.
  
  The gameplay, all i have to say is marvelous. I don't know what to say much further after i 
 defeated one of those huge enemies. I was shocked and couldn't say a word.
  
  Overall i think this game would be good for the average hardcore Wii gamer like me. Trust me you 
 will be amazed about the facts.

 hours are filled with lots fo gore , slang, and the most important enterainment. That being said 
 i think 480p should have been included, also the camera sometimes gets in in some blind spots. 
 the Game i most but in the 7.5 range but wait im a old school gamer so a 7.5 for me is like 9.0 
 nowadays were everything with a big marketing budget gets a 9. So bottom line if you have the money 
 go pay the 50 bucks and support better games on Wii if ur tight on cash got rent it. Either way 
 ur in for old fashion fun.

Review:  MadWorld, is, in a word, mad. Everything in this game is over the top: characters, setting, weapons, 
 enemies, bosses, instruments of death, etc.
  
  MadWorld takes place in the fictional Varrigan City during an also (hopefully) fictional blood-sport 
 Game Show known as Death Watch in which willing (and some unwilling) participants compete to kill 
 eachother in the most extreme and exotic ways possible in order to get to the top and win fabulous 
 prizes. Its very similar to The Running Man, if you've read/seen it. The difference here is that 
 the sport/show/tournament/whatever isn't something voluntary. The city is taken over by terrorists 
 and plunged into its fate. Those who choose to compete must kill, and those who chose not to will 
 die via an airborne virus, the antidote going only those who "participate" (read: kill people) in 
 the competition.. When Jack arrives, most civilians have already been exterminated, be it by the 
 virus or the Killseekers (the name the game gives the competitors in the Death Watch Tournament) . 
 Without spoiling a surprisingly good story, you play as Jack, somewhat of an anti-hero who's motives 
 for entering Varrigan during Death Watch are somewhat unclear, and as you progress through the 
 kill-friendly environments the backstroy of the games begins to divulge itself to you.
  
  Its safe to say that MadWorld surprised me in the plot department. Not only is it not about mindless 
 killing, but it really brings up alot of interesting questions about violence in our own society, 
 and in the best and most enjoyable of ways -- in satire.
  
  MadWorld is crawling with satire. As you slice your way through the city's various locales, hysterical 
 announcers (played by John DiMaggio and Greg Proops, of Futurama and Whose Line? fame, respectively) 
 give Jack's play-by-play as he seeks to kill enemies in the most ridiculous ways possible. The 
 announcers lend alot of comedic and satirical value to this game, which by itself, could be almost 
 enough reason to play it. The dialogue is crisp and well acted, but story-driven cutscenes are 
 never long enough for boredom to seep in, they're placed well at the end or beginning of stages.
 
  
  Apart from the setting, plot, characters, and dialogue, the game itself is just damn fun to play. 
 Imagine yourself wielding chainsaw grafted to your right arm. Now imagine if I told you the chainsaw 
 is probably one of the least exciting ways to kill someone in this game. Yes, I said it. Every 
 stage has a multitude of "environmental weapons", from spikes to signs, tires to oil drums, and 
 everything few and far between. Jam a street-sign into your opponents head, then follow-up with 
 slamming an oil drum around their torso. Gram 'em, and move 'em towards a spiked wall and mercilessly, 
 slam their body into it until they die. And that's the tutorial level. You'll be throwing people 
 into garbage bins with spiked doors that close down on your enemies and cut them in half. You'll 
 impale them on giant spears, throw them into power conduits and watch them spark, mash them in 
 giant grinding-wheels, and even whack off their heads with golf clubs. Just to name a few. And 
 there's more. Every stage has its own unique enviromental hazard that you can utilize. You can 
 throw them into a piranha tank in one level, drop-kick their face on a giant gong, and catapult 
 them into the moon. The unique and stylish kill system in this game isn't just for show, its an 
 integral part of the gameplay. In each level you have 30 minutes to rack up as many points as possible 
 and battle the boss. Once you reach a certain amount, you unlock the boss battle. And you guessed 
 it, you get more points for the more elaborate kills. Imagine the possibilities when you combine 
 all the environmental kills with **** that explodes. Imagine jamming a sign post in each of five 
 guys, slamming a sixth into an exploding barrel, then chucking the barrel at the rest of the chumps 
 and watching half of them fly into a giant wall of spikes. Sometimes its just beautiful. Of course, 
 the game rewards you for setting up elaborate methods of taking care of business by having a clean 
 and simple combo system. The more **** you do to the guy (jamming stuff in his face, gouging his 
 eyes out with trumpets, slamming a tire around his waist) , the more points you get when he dies. 
 The more people that die at the same time, the bigger the score multiplier. It just makes it all 
 the more satisfying when it tells you how bad ass you are (there's "Routine", "hardcore", "super", 
 "extreme", and "ultra" kills -- and ultra are damn hard to get.) The more points you get, the faster 
 you'll get to the boss.
  
  This may seem formulaic in words, but every level is so different and there are so many different 
 ways to kill people that it never gets old. That, and each level has its own unique Bloodbath Challenge, 
 which is basically a fun minigame where you kill people in unique ways to score points. Like hitting 
 them with a bat into a giant dartboard, or seeing how many guys you can throw into an oncoming 
 train. Or -- one of my favorites -- stuffing guys in some fireworks tubes and watching them fly. All 
 these minigames are rewarding and fun, and they really boost your score.
  
  Aside from the kill system, you still have your basic attacks. Punching and some combos, the trusting 
 chainsaw that you control with flicks of the wiimote, and some side weapons you get along the way 
 for scoring enough points in each level. (You'll unlock temporary weapons each level when you rack 
 up enough points) . Some of these, like the spear, are flat-out awesome, as you can literally skewer 
 up to four guys on this, then hurl them into spikes all at once. On top of the basic combat, you 
 have "finishers" for each of the weapons you have, plus two for your fists. There's enough finishers 
 for them to be unique and delightful, and some enemies with unique finishers that utilize their 
 own weapons against them. On top of this, mini-bosses appear frequently, and sometimes initiate 
 "power struggles", which is basically a God of War button input battle that asks you to input commands 
 as they appear on screen. This may sound annoying, but its so much fun with the Wii controls, it'll 
 have you feel like you're actually kicking their ass.
  
  Each stage is finished with a boss battle. The boss battles, I have to say, are quite fun. Their 
 usually quite simple in nature, dodging, running, slashing -- but each boss is so unique that you'll 
 never mind. The unique thing about the bosses is that each boss has its own unique set of power 
 struggles that can really make you feel like your kicking their ass like Jack. Some are quite elaborate 
 and really fun to watch. At the end of each boss battle, is an over-the-top, usually awesome, interactive 
 "Finisher" which has Jack killing his opponent in some awesome way. The bosses are unique and fun, 
 and get more and more elaborate as you play on. You'll fight a giant, a roller-blading gunslinger, 
 a giant sumo, a robot, a frankenstein-like monster, and many, many more.
  
  Each stage is contained within an "area", basically a section of Varrigan City. You start in downtown, 
 where the city is pretty basic. You've got streetsigns, barrels, tires, but its also outfitted 
 with plenty of spikes, "rose bushes" (wallls of spikes) , spinning blades, and the like. You'll 
 also go through Asian Town with ninjas, a Austrian-type Castle with zombies, Area-66 with robots 
 and aliens, and finally a Casino. Varrigan city is diverse and fun, and each level offers its own 
 unique challenge.
  
  The game isn't perfect, though. It suffers from a weak camera that makes some boss battles and 
 unruly mobs hard to fight. This is a minor gripe, though, as most standard enemies are there just 
 for you to kick their ass and their not too challenging. The camera, for me, is really the only 
 major drawback to this game. There's really nothing else you can complain about apart from its 
 relatively short play-time (approx. 6-8 hours on first run) , but its unique style and insanely 
 challenging "Hard Mode" (unlocked after one completion) give it enough replay value for hardcore 
 gamers.
  
  Although the obviously different art-style and the insane amounts of gore aren't for everyone, 
 anyone who can appreciate a good, *clean* fun beat 'em-up with somewhat of a moral twist (or, should 
 I say, punch in the face) will appreciate this game. My only gripe is that they really could've 
 elaborated on more of the backstory, because they really do leave you wanting more, but entirely 
 in a good way.
  
  If you own a Wii and enjoy games that are just damn fun, and sometimes even make you think, you 
 owe it to yourself to pick this up.

Review:  Okay, wow. So I just completed MadWorld (SEGA, Platinum Games) and I can confidently say that was 
 the most enjoyable credits sequence I have ever experienced. So, the credits are amazing, buy, 
 play, and beat the game to see them and that would be worth it.
  
  But besides the hilarious credits, MadWorld brings a lot more to the table than the use of humor, 
 which it does so twistedly well. You are Jack, and you are one violent person. The gameplay is 
 fun, as games should be, with the point being: How violently and ridiculously can I kill this enemy? 
 And let the creativity and blood flow from there. The environments are highly accessible and fun 
 to use. Barrels, spikes, caution signs, windmills of blades, turbine engines... pretty much anything 
 can be used to kill enemies. So, this doesn't just sound like senseless violence, the Story should 
 make seem perhaps more appropriate within the given context.
  
  Jack enters a gameshow titled Death Watch, where the purpose is to kill people in extreme and over-the-top 
 ways. The reason for this show is that a terrorist organization released a virus onto the people 
 and whoever is the last one standing gets the antidote. The story delves deep into human nature, 
 justice, and greed. There could have been a few more characters, but with the few characters presented, 
 there were some good twists and turns along the way.
  
  My favorite part of the game was the ultra-stylized graphics. The black, white and red create quite 
 an experience. MadWorld kind of induces a sensory overload with the sound effect, commentators, 
 music all going at once, plus the crazy awesome art and graphics combine for what I could only 
 play in short doses.
  
  This game is short, and it could have been longer, but the gameplay did not get repetitive and 
 it always seemed there was something new popping up, either a new enemy, or minigame, or new environmental 
 death trap. The pace of the game was fantastic, but the cut scenes seem to slow it down a bit. 
 There is next to no action in the cut-scenes, but the this is, of course how the story progresses 
 and it is a good story at that.
  
  Besides a few camera issues MadWorld is fantastic. And certainly is a must-have for Wii owners, 
 no doubt. This kind of game needs to be supported. Go buy it and enjoy it thoroughly.

Review:  Perhaps I came into MadWorld with the wrong expectations. Although it's the first game to be released 
 by PlatinumGames, I had hope that it would be enjoyable given the developer's pedigree. After all, 
 many of the prominent members worked for Capcom's Clover Studio, who happened to produce several 
 games during the last generation I still happen to be fond of to this day. I thought that with 
 that experience behind it, MadWorld couldn't go especially wrong, even if it was experimental to 
 some extent. To its credit, it isn't a fiasco; the game itself is completely playable and there's 
 a good time to be had underneath it all. It's just unfortunate how many issues you have to sift 
 through in order to enjoy the humorously macabre underside.
  
  MadWorld's premise revolves around a morbid game show run by terrorists. Using the environment 
 to your advantage, the objective is to maim and kill your fellow competitors as gruesomely as you 
 possibly can. The more elaborately you improvise during that task, the more points you get allocated 
 to you. It all sounds like it has the potential to be great fun in theory. An interesting evocation 
 of No More Heroes' own absurdity combined with a seemingly Dead Rising-esque variety in the killing 
 methods in theory, MadWorld's gameplay seemingly resembles a lot of different familiar elements 
 without any blatant plagiarizations. It's enough to garner it at least some attention; if done 
 right, it has the trappings to be quite a spectacle, both to watch and to play.
  
  In practice, MadWorld's gameplay doesn't especially betray such philosophies. It does, however, 
 not live up to the grandeur it sets up for itself. The gameplay sounds like it offers a lot free-formed 
 killing and, indeed, save for some minigames and boss battles quick-time events, the way you take 
 out the enemies is up to you. Want to go put a guy in a flaming barrel and then have the next one 
 face the wrath of your a train? Nobody will stop you from doing so. The problem is that there's 
 not nearly enough variety to really hold your attention for long. The level aesthetics and interactive 
 objects change often enough, but it's mostly done for superficiality's sake; you're still essentially 
 doing the same sets of actions for the majority of the time. A street sign in one area might be 
 a miniature windmall fan in another, for example, but you're still jabbing it through your opponents' 
 heads in the exact same manner. It's gruesome, yes, but the repetition quickly saps your acts of 
 any visceral sense whatsoever. Similar games absolutely thrive on providing consistent adrenaline 
 as a motivational tool to keep playing from start to finish, but MadWorld is surprisingly lacking 
 in that. It doesn't reach the point of being anticlimactic, but it is nonetheless disappointing 
 you rarely get any thrill from the kills at all.
  
  The repetition's prevalence can probably be most attributed the game's controls. When an extremely 
 violent game like MadWorld lands on the Wii, I natureally expect to be using the remote at least 
 some of the time to virtually commit my inhumane acts. If it's done in moderation, it accents the 
 game in ways that normal control schemes cannot hope to achieve alone. MadWorld's gameplay, however, 
 relies on the motion capabilities of the Wii to the point of excessiveness. You might hit a button 
 or two to initiate the actions, but most of your time is going to spent waving the remote to achieve 
 your desired effect. Combined with the limitations of how much you really can interact with your 
 environment, it's easy to get the impression that the game would have probably benefitted from 
 employing more conventional controls in at least some areas. Even if the repetition wouldn't completely 
 disappear as a result, it would mitigate the potential of feeling as though you accomplish so little 
 after expending so much energy. But as it is, you're putting more energy into each level than is 
 necessary for the genre and, by the end of them, you get no real sense of fulfillment as a result.
 
  
  These are probably the biggest issues which the game has, although having an almost nonexistant 
 camera control and a broken targeting system on top of that don't help. That said, it's perhaps 
 a testament to the game itself that it still has enough good traits to not be completely derailed 
 by the issues. As already mentioned briefly, there are different minigames you play during each 
 of the levels which add some funny spins to the core gameplay. It's hard not to be entertained 
 by concepts such as using zombies for golf and turning ninjas into Japanese-style fireworks, among 
 others. Additionally, the color commentary you hear during your escapades is well-written and greatly 
 delivered, as it's meant to sound like a parody of sports commentary. The soundtrack should also 
 get its due credit; instead of stereotypically grim and melodramatic background music, MadWorld 
 employs hip-hop and, surprisingly, it works well. There aren't any tracks which especially stand 
 out, but none of it feels tacked on, which can be hard to avoid with that particular genre. It 
 does its job and you can't really ask much more out of it as a result.
  
  None of those things are bound to be discussed as much as the game's graphical style, though, the 
 area at which the game excels the most. The first thing to be noticed is the fact that it relies 
 on black and (off) white with only smatterings of other colors for blood and whatnot. Such a limited 
 palette thankfully doesn't result in levels becoming blurry or having objects visually blend into 
 each other. Everything is clearly rendered and easily found on the screen. Complimenting the coloration 
 is gruff, but pleasing character and environmental designs. The black and white already do enough 
 as it is to make MadWorlds's visuals stand out in comparison to other games, but the designs make 
 the distinctiveness even more vivid. If nothing else, MadWorld will probably be best remembered 
 for these aspects in particular because they are well-crafted. There are a few instances of low 
 resolution textures and other such issues, but these thankfully appear outside of the actual gameplay. 
 When you're actually at work, the only thing you have to worry about it are some semi-occasional 
 frame rate drops that aren't extremely dramatic. Otherwise the graphics are uniquely pristine and 
 a joy to view.
  
  Underneath it all, MadWorld's ultimate problem is that it doesn't take its underlying concept and 
 absolutely run with it to its very limits. After you get past the fact that you can kill enemies 
 in really unconvential ways, the reality sets in that there just isn't nearly enough variety or 
 depth to support the experience. Nothing is especially nuanced and what's there can be done with 
 ease over and over again without any hitches whatosever. Throw in some borderline arbirtrary motion 
 controls and the other previously-discussed problems and you have a game which, while not a train 
 wreck, had the potential to be so, so much more. In short, MadWorld is a game whose enjoyment is 
 completely dependent on how easily you can look past its problems. If you can, you've got an interesting 
 and sometimes hilarious ride in store for you. But if not, you can easily neglect the game and 
 not be missing out on a lot. It's an earnest attempt at something on the Wii, yet more often than 
 not, it falls flat on its face and to be kind, that's nothing short of unfortunate.

Review:  The Wii is a rather peculiar platform. Its general mass appeal is for the younger gamer, yet its 
 library contains some of the most violent, brutal, sadistic and gorey games of this generation. 
 Manhunt 2 and No More Heroes are just some of those titles that would make parents cringe if they 
 saw their children playing them. Madworld just so happens to be the lastest cringe-inducing title 
 that adds more mature gaming goodness to the Wii.
  
  The story is as follows. An island has been cut off from the rest of the world, and a virus has 
 been spread across the island's civilization. The virus slowly begins to kill those it effects 
 within 24 hours and the only way to survive is to kill someone and be granted a vaccine. To make 
 matters worse, the island has been turned into a stage for a live violent game show dubbed Deathwatch. 
 Jack, the game's protagonist, just so happens to be the latest contestant in this ultra-violent 
 game show, and he's got a chainsaw on his arm and a hidden agenda that will be revealed later on 
 in the game.
  
  The gameplay has you beating to a bloody pulp anyone you come across. It's more than just going 
 fisticuffs with your foes, though. You can pick up objects from tires to street signs and use them 
 on your foes before finishing them off with brutal melee fatalities or environmental executions. 
 Anything from spikes on a wall to rotating presses to giant woks can be used to dispatch your enemies 
 after you're finishing pummeling them to near death.
  
  There is a means to all this madness, however. It's not just pointless killing; you actually kill 
 for points. A point system governs the game, and it not only dictates how many points you need 
 to accumulate in order to reach the boss, but it also unlocks new weapons, items, environmental 
 hazards and Bloodbath Challenges. Most stages have a 30 minute time limit, so the more vicious 
 and creative you are with your slaughtering, the more points you'll rack up and the quicker you 
 can get to the boss and end the level before your time limit ends you. 30 minutes is more than 
 enough time, though. The time limit is just there to cull any unnecessary idling and keep the game 
 flowing.
  
  The Bloodbath Challenges are a terrific way to help you achieve your point goal. Bloodbath Challenges 
 are in essence killing mini-games. Cane sporting, bling rocking pimp the Black Baron introduces 
 these mini games to you. He explains to you how to play each game and ultimately dies a painful 
 death by the hands of his S&M assistant at the end of each introduction. The games vary from human 
 dart boards to golf to targets you shoot enemies at by cramming giant bottles of soda down their 
 throats. A couple of the games are very hard to score at, though, and you might become frustrated 
 because it's just impossible for you to get the high score you want. They also become repeated 
 later on in the game, which is a shame, because those are missed opportunities for more creative 
 carnage.
  
  The combat for the most part is pretty fun and satisfying. You press A for basic punches. Hold 
 A to grab enemies and fling the remote to throw the. Pick up objects with A, and cram or impale 
 them into enemies by swinging the remote down. You swing the remote sideways for a backhand, and 
 upwards for an uppercut. Holding down B deploys your chainsaw and swinging the remote to the side 
 does a lateral swipe, while swingng the remote down does a vertical slash. The chainsaw can only 
 be weilded for a short time, and then needs to be holstered so it can recharge. Flicking the nunchuck 
 has Jack backflipping out of danger. When you get an enemy worn down to near-death, you can finish 
 him by swinging the remote around in circles or back and forth depending on what move Jack is executing. 
 Z makes him jump, C centers the camera, and holding C locks on to a target. That's the gameplay's 
 major flaw, though. The lock on system just doesn't work very well, and that'll have you missing 
 your enemies a great deal. It would have been much more fun to play if only this one mechanic had 
 been tightened.
  
  The layout of the game's world is divided into five districts and except for the last district, 
 each one has two standard levels with a boss fight at the end and one level that's soley a boss 
 battle. Most of the levels just have you running around beating up baddies, but a couple of levels 
 have you battling it out on a motorcycle. You can swing your chainsaw to the right, or you can 
 grab enemies off their vehicles on the left and fling them front of you. You hit Z for turbo and 
 you can ram into vehicles, or launch yourself off ramps to land on top of them and destory them.
 
  
  The level designs for the most part are well done. They're peppered with environmental hazards 
 that Jack can use on his enemies. This alone is reason enough to explore the levels just to see 
 new ways to kill people. You're also given a rather handy map with a radar that shows not only 
 the location of your enemies, but where new weapons and items are unlocked as well as where to 
 find Bloodbath Challenges and the boss fight. Also, some levels will have you manuevering to hidden 
 locations in order to reveal items such as extra lives, so exploration of the levels are really 
 encouraged.
  
  The boss battles is where a good portion of the game's fun lies. Each boss is ridiculously designed 
 and of course has their own attack patterns that you have to analyze. During these boss fights, 
 you'll see a prompt as you're being attacked to flick the remote and nunchuck and a power struggle 
 will ensue. You'll have to follow the on-screen prompts to move the nunchuck and remote accordingly, 
 so Jack can overcome his adversary and deal loads of damage to them. Once these power struggles 
 end, it's back to fighting them the normal way until either another struggle begins, or you deplete 
 their last bit of energy. When this happens, you'll be prompted to finish them when another scene 
 begins and has you executing more movements to deliver a very brutal yet highly entertaining fatality. 
 The only downside to these boss fights is that they're really not that hard. They should be more 
 challenging than they are, so you don't really get that sense of satisfaction you would in other 
 games.
  
  The graphical style of the game is both very simplistic and very stylized. The first thing you'll 
 notice is the complete lack of color. Everything is dipicted in black and white, with the only 
 other colors being yellow for some item and prompt-related graphics, and of course red for the 
 blood. Having kept these colors so limited really puts an emphasis on just how bloody the game 
 is when red makes its appearance. The monochromatic color palette also serves to present the game's 
 visuals in a graphic novel/manga fashion. The cutscenes are also done using panels, and even the 
 sounds are accentuated with onomatopoeic words to further give it that comic book feel. Some might 
 actually prefer more color but at the game's end, it's hard to imagine Madworld any other way.
 
  
  Madworld is complimented admirably by its audio. The voice acting is very noteworthy. Every player, 
 especially Jack, voices their characters rather well. When actually playing the game, the carnage 
 carries through the speakers deliciously. Bashes sound bone-breaking, impalements sound painful 
 and there's nothing more satisfying than hearing a chainsaw start up and rip a body in two. There 
 is also a ton of swearing in the game, not just from the psychotic hoodlums and the Black Baron, 
 but also from the game's color commentators. They actually bring new meaning to the term "color" 
 commentators because the language they use is quite colorful. It's also pretty damn funny! 
  
  The soundtrack is also another terrific feature of Madworld. Just about every piece is a specially 
 composed rap song made for Madworld. All the artists are underground, so the game's soundtrack 
 doesn't have that "EA Trax" feel to it where it's nothing but licensed mainstream music. Having 
 nothing but underground rap as the game's soundtrack really helps to deliver that gritty, raw feel, 
 which is what Madworld is all about. 
  
  Aside from the loose lock-on system, the only other real drawback with Madworld is that it's incredibly 
 short. There is less than four hours of gameplay in the story mode, but you can play through it 
 again on Hard if you're extremely masochistic. On the upside, the story is actually really cool, 
 presented well and has wonderful voice acting. There is a multiplayer mode, so if you wish to beat 
 your friends to a blood pulp, you can do that as well.
  
  It really is a shame that the story mode had to be as short as it was, because you just can't help 
 but wonder what else they could have come up with. It also feels like a gip that the third area 
 you unlock in each district is only a boss fight with no actual level prefacing it; it makes the 
 game feel that much shorter. If there had also been a couple more districts, there could have been 
 even more boss battles, which is really the game's highlight, as easy as most of them are. Still, 
 as short as the game is, it's a solid over-the-top action game that provides loads and loads of 
 bloody thrills, a ton of laughs and a sense of "Wow, I am really screwed up to be enjoying the 
 game this much!" Definately check this game out and see the much more mature side of the Wii.

Review:  Madworld is a game that comes around only every so often. The concept of the story is simple, you 
 a contestant in Death Watch, a brutal game show where you must kill to survive. The story grows 
 in an interesting way, and what seems like a throw-away story becomes rather in-depth. The thing 
 most pleasing about Madworld is it's creativity. In a game market full of sequels and trilogies, 
 this is a fresh new game with killer gameplay.
  
  The graphics in Madworld are all black and white, save for the gallons of red blood you will spill 
 throughout the game. This approach is a love/hate relationship. While the argument may be formed 
 of "why would i play a black and white game in 2009?". The answer, simply put, is because it doesn't 
 feel like a dated game, not even in the slightest. The graphics are all style, not technical robustness 
 like Fallout 3 or Gears of War 2. The graphics do, however, make things like health, weapon storage 
 crates, and other items scattered around a bit difficult to see at times.
  
  The audio is one of the game's greatest compliments. The music playing in the background is mostly 
 all hip-hop, and while i myself am not a fan of the genre, it completely fits the game and i love 
 hearing it as i play. Though some variety in the music would have been appreciated, as some metal 
 music would have been the icing on the cake with the game's over-the-top violence.
  Beyond the music there are the Announcers. They are perfectly voiced and not once did anything 
 they say seemed force, and more often then not you will bust up laughing at their remarks on your 
 killing spree and their own random chatter.
  
  But in the end it's all about the gameplay, and Madworld completely delivers in almost every aspect. 
 The game is not an average beat-em-up, well not technically. While you can go around and chop people 
 with your chainsaw, the big points (which are required to advance through the game) come from chaining 
 together kills and violent acts. While you could just throw a zombie into a spike, why not stick 
 a barrel on him first? Then maybe a light post through his head? Then why not toss him in, hitting 
 another zombie, causing a double kill, added to the points you had already gained from previous 
 brutalities. 
  It's a genius concept, and often hilarious, and promotes getting the most creative kills as possible.
 
  
  Madworld is not without its problems though. The camera has been the talk of many complaints, and 
 it is at times tedious to control, especially on some boss fights, but other then those events, 
 the camera is not too much of a hindering factor. 
  
  Overall, Madworld is a game that everybody owning a Wii (if of age) should check out. It's creative, 
 fun, and often hilarious.

Review:  Since its announcement years ago, MadWorld, a secret project from videogame developer Platinum 
 Games (composed of members of the now-defunct Clover Studios, the makers of the famed Viewtiful 
 Joe and Okami games) grew into fruition slowly. Despite the Wii's success in the casual market, 
 hardcore gamers kept their eyes peeled towards a gory, over-the-top action game developed specifically 
 for Wii. Like the rev of a chainsaw, MadWorld was hard to ignore, especially on the family-friendly 
 Wii. Well, the release of the highly-anticipated original property has surfaced. In a nutshell, 
 MadWorld is a shockingly-violent, blatantly-vulgar, and insanely fun action game designed for the 
 Nintendo Wii, and for those who have even the slightest appeal towards action games, it will satisfy 
 that bloodlust that all of us have deep down inside.
  
  MadWorld takes place in the metropolis of Varrigan City. Once a bustling burg, the city has now 
 become a terrorist base. After spreading a dangerously lethal pathogen across the city, the citizens 
 are now at the will of the terrorist organization. So what do the terrorists want? They want to 
 play a game, or more specifically, watch the others fight to the death in a game aptly titled Death 
 Watch. In order to obtain the antidote to the pathogen (along with earning a hefty prize of $150 
 million) , the citizens must fight to the death and rise up the ranks to earn their prize and life. 
 Enter Jack, a tough guy with a hidden agenda. It's up to Jack to not only fight for freedom, but 
 also to uncover the secrets behind Death Watch. Led along by a mysterious sponsor, Agent XIII, 
 Jack must battle through waves of enemies to find the truth. An interesting mix of "Sin City" and 
 Stephen King's "The Running Man", the story in MadWorld is surprisingly well versed. Suspenseful 
 cutscenes illustrate the secrets behind the games well, and the overall narrative has an excellently 
 designed mood. It's not too complex, but it's entertaining enough and has plenty of unique twists 
 to keep the player interested.
  
  The most apparent factor in MadWorld is the graphic style, which follows a simple monochromatic 
 base with plenty of blood red to paint the town with. Many have compared this to a noir comic book 
 style, and while it does capture that idea, MadWorld mixes in plenty of violent bloodshed for good 
 measure. Cutscenes blend in comic-book-style panels with full-motion sequences, which add a clever 
 atmosphere to the game. The game's style follows in Clover Studios' footsteps with some great shading 
 and design effects, reminiscent of the wonderfully-stylized Viewtiful Joe series. Giant onomatopoeia 
 blast during action-packed sequences and subtle details like main character Jack's cigarette smoke 
 add a brilliant bit of unique essence to the game's incredible graphic design. The game animates 
 fluidly in action, and the cinematic kills flow together cleanly and smoothly. There was a small 
 notice of lag when things got too heavy, but overall, this is some of the best the Wii has done, 
 not just technically, but stylistically. Despite being named "underpowered," the Wii has shown 
 plenty of unique styles and aesthetics when it comes to graphics, and MadWorld is probably the 
 most ambitious presentation yet.
  
  Controls were a major concern before MadWorld's release, but fortunately, the game doesn't use 
 the overused Wii Remote waving that many other games have suffered from. Instead, basic attacks 
 are mapped to the Wii Remote's A button. Holding down the A button lets Jack grab, and holding 
 the B-trigger lets him rev up his chainsaw. Swinging the Wii Remote either vertically or horizontally 
 lets Jack perform a backfist or uppercut, and performing the gesture while holding the B-trigger 
 lets Jack tear up enemies with his chainsaw arm. The D-pad lets Jack switch weapons, pick up nearby 
 power-ups, or simply taunt an enemy. Moving and jumping is mapped to the Nunchuk, with centering 
 the camera being mapped to the C button. Obtaining a lock-on must be done by holding the C button, 
 making the overall camera control a bit of a hassle. You usually only need the lock-on during a 
 boss fight, but the inconsistency in the camera system can make things a little confusing at times. 
 Fortunately, the rest of the controls work very well.
  
  But it's during the battles that the controls really come together. During battles, the player 
 will be directed with context-sensitive sequences to execute an enemy. These insanely gruesome 
 actions range from a chainsaw decapitation to bending a guy's torso backwards till their spine 
 snaps like a twig. In case you don't know yet, this is not for the faint of heart. The whole thing 
 makes Gears of War look tame. The overall control setup is smooth and easy to use. Sure, you may 
 accidentally grab at the wrong time or swing in the wrong direction for a chainsaw kill, but a 
 vast majority of the confrontations feel tight and well implemented. This is hands-down the most 
 ambitious control setup seen on the Wii. Even better, it's a blast to use.
  
  Jack's adventure in Varrigan City is one giant competition, with the combatants killing off others 
 to earn the prize. The goal is to kill as many enemies as possible in as many different ways to 
 earn big points. Try the game's typical combo: pick up a tire and slam it around an enemy, pick 
 up a signpost and shove it into the enemy's skull, then pick up the guy and slam him into a spiked 
 wall. It's these unique combinations that really show the cleverness in the system. Throughout 
 the game's levels, there are more different environmental hazards like giant presses, meat hooks, 
 and electrical machinery, along with new weapons like spiked bats and daggers. MadWorld produces 
 a smooth variety of items and traps to take out enemies; once you get tired of one, try another. 
 What makes the gameplay really spectacular is the visceral strength behind each attack. Jack can 
 literally tear enemies apart, leaving their bloody corpses lying about the levels. While other 
 games may find the slaying of enemies rather serious, MadWorld's executions and assassinations 
 are so ridiculous that you'll probably burst out laughing after you cringe a little at their sheer 
 destructiveness. MadWorld doesn't take itself seriously at any point in the battles, and really, 
 we wouldn't have it any other way.
  
  Boss encounters are over-the-top and insanely fun to play. The enemies seen throughout the levels 
 could easily be considered point-fodder, but the bosses actually take some serious skill to defeat. 
 Pack a few extra lives, because they are remarkably tough. Many feature quick-time events to nail 
 extra damage, but the clever and diverse design of each boss fight is incredible. The finishing 
 moves are what really draw the whole thing together; not convinced? Try seeing a man get shot over 
 and over until he's nothing but a skeleton. Yeah, that's some serious finisher. MadWorld's remarkable 
 action and insanely unique boss fights are a highlight for the system, rivaling the bosses of other 
 Wii hits like Zelda: Twilight Princess and No More Heroes, all with a bloody chainsaw to boot.
 
  
  Aside from earning big points from extreme acts of diverse violence, there isn't a huge reason 
 to go through the game again, which is a shame, because its amazing control setup and strong action 
 work incredibly well together. Once the game is over, there are a few unlockable weapons and a 
 tough-as-nails Hard Mode. You also can participate in the single-player Bloodbath Challenge minigames 
 with a friend via split-screen, which is a cool inclusion. MadWorld's short single-player is a 
 bit of a disappointment, but returning to levels to see how high your score will climb after taking 
 out enemies is a decent incentive. It's so much fun you'll no doubt return to it just to shock 
 your friends.
  
  The sound design in MadWorld is simply second-to-none. The music is a nice collection of hip-hop 
 tracks, each one feeling upbeat while synching well with the action of the gameplay. To match the 
 music, the sound effects are stellar. The rev sound of the chainsaw emanating from the Wii Remote's 
 speaker is good, and the over-the-top actions produce an awesome blend of sound-offs from victims 
 and strong impacts as their bodies fly across the level. But the crown gem of the sound is the 
 commentary. Famed improv comic Greg Proops teams up with John DiMaggio (Bender from Futurama, Marcus 
 Fenix from Gears of War) to produce some of the most vulgar, ridiculous, and downright hilarious 
 commentary ever seen in a video game. You'll hear them insulting each other's ex-girlfriends, mindlessly 
 cursing, and providing random insight to Jack's actions as he progresses through Death Watch. Despite 
 how crazy their insults are, it's very difficult to not crack a smile at their quips and quarrels. 
 It's undeniably obscene and crass for sure, and some may not be drawn to its humor, but the commentary 
 compliments MadWorld's over-the-top gameplay better than anything else, resulting in a laughably 
 visceral game unlike anything else seen on the system.
  
  Pros
  + Visceral combat system is hard-hitting and undeniably over-the-top
  + Controls are accessible, 
 though progressive and unique
  + Graphics ooze style and gory substance
  + Hilarious commentary tops off the stellar sound design
  
  Cons
  - Camera isn't perfect
 
  - Not entirely lengthy
  - Mature content won't appeal to everyone
  
  MadWorld isn't afraid to shock you, but with the blatantly mature content comes one gem of an action-game. 
 The ridiculously elaborate kills and finishers would be great enough with a regular controller, 
 but the Wii Remote and Nunchuk's intuitive controls make taking out enemy after enemy a rewarding 
 and addictive experience. Add in a killer (pardon the pun) set of Bloodbath challenges and objectives 
 and you get a diverse game with plenty of depth. With an excellent control setup, addictive challenges, 
 beautifully-designed graphics, and a hilarious commentary throughout, MadWorld challenges the norm 
 in nearly every way possible. If you can forgive the imperfect camera and slightly short length, 
 you'll find one of the best Wii games to come out in years. Sure, it's violent. Sure, it's crass. 
 But MadWorld is the serious kick in the pants that the system needed. If you're of age (and aren't 
 afraid of a little gore in your games) , then MadWorld is what you've been waiting for on the Wii. 
 Refined, accessible, and mindlessly crazy, MadWorld is already an excellent contender for Game 
 of the Year 2009. Pick it up today.

Review:  I could not contain my anticipation for this game to come out, and quite frankly I have to say 
 the wait was definitely worth it. The game is not a mind blowing, leaving you blowing a load in 
 your pants experience, however, it remains incredibly fun, gruesome, and awesome. I do feel former 
 Clover Studios could have done a much better job, yet I still salute them for dishing out this 
 stylistic and unique beat-em up.
  
  First, the graphics. The black and white (and red) style is fantastic. Anyone who says it's hard 
 on the eyes or things blend together has some serious eye problems and needs to update their pair 
 of glasses. I have had more trouble distinguishing things in color games than in this one. I am 
 a huge fan of sound effects being written out, and it's done awesome here. And as far as style 
 goes, the game is approaching art form. Of course it's not as drastic and amazing in its stylization 
 as Okami, but then again what is? The only fuss I have with the graphics is when you are playing 
 you often don't have time to let it sink in just how badass they are. When you watch a friend play 
 is when you realize just what you weren't stunned by before.
  
  The game length is somewhat short if you go through as fast as possible (as soon as the Boss appears 
 you go and take care of it) . Beat-em ups should never be long, but I did honestly feel throwing 
 in just 1 or 2 more levels would have had it perfectly lengthed. Of course who would go for the 
 boss right away when there's still tons of killing to do and points to be earned? The replay value 
 is quit high though, unless there's something wrong with you and you don't appreciate gruesome 
 manslaughter you will be coming back again and again to stick some trumpets in a ninja's skull. 
 And the DW Challenges often are that, challenging. And don't get me started on them in Hard Mode. 
 Normal mode is quite a breeze, you shouldn't have much trouble if any. Now get ready for some fun 
 and possible frustration in Hard Mode!
  
  The control on this game is perfectly fine. Some complain about it misreading movements. To those 
 some, I just have to say you suck. I had no problems AT ALL with the motions.
  
  The sound is godly. Nice splatter and other sound affects, the music rocks even if you hate the 
 general genre, the VA is great, and the two announcers are stupendous and hilarious. "No means 
 yes and yes means anal!""-You know, those Happy Pills are amazing when you inject them into 
 the folds of your scrotum.
  -I'll give you a dollar if you can tell me one thing that isn't better when injected into the folds 
 of your scrotum." "-Looks like Jack got an extra life. -
  You know I had an extra life once. I came back as a cock roach. Did you know that cock roaches 
 could live a week without their heads?
  -I've been married 8 years without any head."
  
  The camera could be better, but it's NOWHERE near as big as issue as most make out to be. Not perfect, 
 but not annoying. Lock on system is only sucks when there is a large amount of enemies and the 
 game won't lock onto the one you want, who may be behind the others. In this case you don't even 
 want to lock on though. So basically lock on is only useful when you're going head to head with 
 one enemy or if you're trying to do it directly in front of them. Take that how you will, as a 
 flaw or game mechanic. Locking off is a bit annoying though, as you have to hold it for 1-2 seconds.
 
  
  I will not talk too much about what makes the game amazing or the combat. Watch videos, and there's 
 your visual description. Now I will go over why I rate this game somewhere between 8 and 8.5, and 
 what exactly the improvements I mentioned could have been. The game almost felt like it was cut 
 partway through development, so many things COULD have been added (some which I think were obvious) 
 to better the experience and easily raise the game up a whole point in my book (of course some 
 of these are opinions) :
  
  1.) Boss Rush (both on Normal and Hard)
  
  2.) An arena death match where you kill enemies until you finally go down to their infinite numbers.
 
  
  3.) Have 3 different ending sequences for boss fights. You have different finishers on the grunts, 
 so why not the higher ups? It would also add so much more incentive to play, to see what the other 
 ways to murder the boss was. An example would be on the Shaman, instead of driving out of the castle 
 with him tied to your bike, why not drive up the stairs and have his body get lodged on a tree, 
 the force of the bike pulling him eventually popping his head off. Just slight (or maybe not) alterations 
 with the final blows.
  
  4.) More difficult power struggles. You heard me right. Not many people have seen the failure scenes 
 when the boss overpowers you, and many are quite awesome. I don't want to loose on purpose to see 
 these. On my first unknowledgeable playthrough I want to be victim to them, and then after I know 
 more in detail what's to come I can will beat them (for Hard Mode) . This is the most unnecessary 
 addition I have mentioned, but it did come to mind.
  
  5.) A slightly more advanced combo system, yes it's a beat-em up but the amount of attacks you 
 can chain together is still a bit too small for my liking.
  
  Here's the BIGGEST ONE:
  
  6.) MORE ENVIRONMENTAL STUFF. I want to be able to throw a guy at a wooden stand, have that 
 stand break like it would in real life, and then use those broken pieces of wood to impale the 
 guy I just threw. I wanna be able to pick up some bricks from a wall I broke (like maybe 5 at a 
 time) and just chuck them at nearby enemies for fun. Kick a chair in the general direction of a 
 group. Little stuff like this, where virtually anything you can get your hands on in real life 
 that could be used to injure, can be used to injure within the game. MORE IMPALING CHOICES. What 
 if I wanna crucify the guy? Stick a signpost in every limb other than in the head over and over? 
 Stick that alcohol bottle into his CROTCH! Jam the trumpet up his ass! I want a choice of where 
 to impale, giving me more options for my killing and my madness. The system as is is still VERY 
 FUN and awesome, but I just feel with more time put into the game it could have been soo much more. 
 My BIGGEST BEEF with the game, I was expecting such cool environmental kills, and I found myself 
 being more awed by the weapon finishers.
  
  7.) More weapons, just 1 or 2 extra. There IS enough variation as is (especially after beating 
 the game) , but just a small amount would help the experience. Why don't we get the drill weapon, 
 though we got the double chainsaw?
  
  8.) I know I'll get shrugs with this, but most beat-em ups leave me feeling like I had enough fun 
 and murdered enough on my journey. Mad World fell a little bit short. Just 1 or 2 more levels I 
 believe would have fulfilled my desire for a slightly longer run through. Every area had 3 levels 
 except the last one which had 2 (and no Boss for one of them) . Why not have the last one have 3 
 levels like the others and bosses for each one? Or even better, have an extra area with just one 
 level which is the final boss. Then this game would hit "perfect length" for me.
  
  So there we go, things I felt could have been better. Still, this game is much too fun, and I would 
 consider it a must buy. And if you don't buy it, you have absolutely no excuse to not at least 
 rent it.
  
  I give the game an 8.25.

Review:  I don't own a Wii but this is the first game I have played that has made me want to purchase that 
 system. I rented this from the local video store and shared playing it with one of my friends who 
 has a Wii. Finally got him to pop that Wii Sports game out of the machine since he bought it. He 
 was pretty surprised after the mature rated game really got going. 
  
  First off I love the music and look of the game, black and white with the blood contrasting in 
 red really made me think of Frank Miller and the Sin City books. Second, the raunchy commentary 
 between the announcers John Di Maggio the voice of Futurama's Bender and Who's Line is it Anyway's 
 Greg Proops was very funny. Can't tell you how many times we just burst out laughing from what 
 was said or trying to make sure that is really what they said. 
  
  Finally, I just have to say the game is fun. Not for the kiddies mind you with all the swearing 
 and crazy violence but I think I could really play that game a couple times over trying to get 
 better scores and beat the boss's more quickly. This game could have easily become a boring beat 
 em up but with slightly different enemies, weapons and killing method I kept playing and playing. 
 
  
  Also the bloodbath challenges were some of the most interesting and funniest parts of the game. 
 Black Baron the narrator before each challenge is just wrong but if your interested you can check 
 out you tube for yourself.
  
  Definitely a rent and I think even a buy for some. Anyway made me rethink getting a Wii now, hmmmm.

Review:  It's been awhile since I was able to sit down and play a game for more than an hour. I bought quite 
 a few games in recent months on all three systems, and I never could find myself to finish them. 
 I guess you could say I get bored with games pretty quick these days, especially with so little 
 time and so mnay other games coming out. With Madworld -- the game has my undivided attention!
  
  Most reviews talk about how this game in relation to more hardcore content being placed on 
 the game, but I'm not. The Wii has plenty of core titles and I am not at all surprised with Madworld.
 
  
  People call this a brawler or beat 'em up title, and then I think ---'Well no wander why I like 
 this game so much'. I haven't played a good beat 'em game since the days of the SNES and Genesis, 
 and that's the genre I played the most back then.
  
  Madworld is very unique when it comes to video games. The artstyle, gameplay, visuals, and even 
 the story are very different for a game. I appreciate the black/white style and never wandered 
 how this game would look in color. Quite frankly, regardless of what console, I think Madworld 
 would look that great in color -- it just wouldn't convey the same feeling. This game has black/white 
 comic book/cartoony feel to it, and the developers intentionally played off this and it works.
 
  
  The gameplay is easy and fun to pick up. There is certainly variety in the ways you can take out 
 enemies and that's only part what will keep you hooked. The protaganist, Jack, has arsenal of killer 
 moves depending on the angle and circumstance. In addition to lethal moves, Jack can perform environmental 
 kills, some are unique to certain levels -- which always keep you wandering how the next level will 
 be.
  
  Since this is a beat 'em title, it can get repetitive, but that's not a big deal. It's a video 
 game -- repetition happens not matter what game you play. I think there is more variety in what Jack 
 can do than there is in most video games coming out today. However, the actions that you perform 
 with Jack are always rewarding to pull off no matter how many times you do it. 
  
  Also, there is indeed incentive for pulling special kills -- points. Yes I said 'points'. Points 
 have not been important to me since my days of playing Pacman on Atari. In Madworld, points will 
 get weapons, unlock challenges and boss battles. Each one I just listed is an awarding experience. 
 Every weapon whether it's the double swords, bats, and even a golf club allows Jack to perform 
 some devasting yet humorous kills. Also the Blood Bath challenges are insane mini games, that have 
 you performing kills that are unique to that challenge for points. Then there are the boss battles! 
 Absolutely amazing bosses to finish out each level. The gameplay involved in defeating each boss 
 is certainly a task at times, but very awesome experience. Sometimes I wish Madworld including 
 a mode where you can only fight the bosses after beating the whole game.
  
  Controls work great as well. Your basic actions will be performed with button presses, but the 
 special moves will be take advantage of gestures with the remote and nunchuck. This game is not 
 a waggle fest by any means. I think the gestures were well implemented. Also, the finishers are 
 so amazing that you won't mind pulling off the gesturees which add to the lethal experience.
  
  My only gripes with the game (and I think many other feel the same) are the camera and length 
 of the game. The camera can make the game even harder when things heat up and you're surrounded 
 by enemies. Luckily you can at least center the camera behind you by tapping the C button. However, 
 it would be nice if you have more control over the camera.
  
  The length of the game is about 5-6 hours. Trust me, this game gives you so much in such a short 
 period of time that you just simply want more. Indeed you have local multiplayer split screen to 
 challenge a friend to a some of the mingames, but it's kind of on the shallow side. It would nice 
 if this game had some sort of online functionality. Indeed you can go back and play different difficulties, 
 but with such a bogus camera... you'll be see the game over screen a number of frustrating times. 
 So the length, camera, and replayability are factors that I'm sure and hopeful will be implemented 
 in sequel -- which I hope one will happen!
  
  Madworld is fun ---which is what a game is supposed to be. It keeps you wanting more and it is certainly 
 a breath of fresh air!

Review:  No one would think that the Wii would get a ultra-violent, black and white, sin city Esq title 
 -- but what do you know, Platinum games delivered, and its one of the best experiences you'll have 
 on the Wii, even if it doesn't last long on its first play through. 
  
  Gameplay.
  
  The gameplay in MadWorld can be described in one word: Creativity.
  
  You have to be creative 
 with your kills. The game is a simple beat 'em up in nature. Your in a map (levels) and you have 
 to kill guys to gain points to move onto the boss fights. You can kill guys in whatever way you 
 like, simply press the A button a bunch of times to kill them -- or perhaps hold the B button and 
 take your chainsaw out and slice them in half -- Or, you can be creative, stick five caution signs 
 into their faces, put a barrel on them and then stab them into a spike four times.
  
  As you can tell, the more creative you are, the more stylish your kills are and thus the more points 
 you will gain.
  
  The controls are made simple and accessible -- and the motion controls are kept to a minimum, but 
 used appropriately. 
  
  Graphics.
  
  One of the best looking games, across any platform. Why? its unique and uses the consoles assets 
 in an affective way. Some people might not like the graphics, because, they are black and white 
 with three other colours in the game -- Yellow for text, red for blood, and light blue for alien 
 blood (yes, aliens) . 
  
  Sound.
  
  Awesome original music. Really, if they sold the soundtrack separately, I'd easily recommend it 
 to people. It really sets the mood and it works well with the game. 
  
  Another huge part of the game is the commentary, which is by far one of the best parts about the 
 game. Both the commentators are hilarious and have a bunch of personality, some of the best I've 
 seen in any video game. Its just ridiculous and you're always waiting to see what else they'll 
 end up saying.
  
  Lasting Appeal.
  
  This game won't last you long if you are only planning to play through it once -- its about 6-7 
 hours (on normal mode) to go through the story mode. It does have a harder difficulty after which 
 does present a lot more challenge for those up to it.
  
  The game also features a multiplayer mode, though its not a significant part of the game, its just 
 a fun add-on.
  
  Final thoughts.
  
  If you have the money and are looking for a fun game, where clearly the developer has put a lot 
 of effort and made a great title -- by all means, buy MadWorld.
  
  If you don't have a lot of money and want to buy games that will last you a while, it will probably 
 be best to rent MadWorld, or wait for a price drop if your looking to purchase it. 
  
  Either way, this is one Wii title that should not be missed by any. Those who complain about 'hardcore' 
 titles, this is one of them, go get it, rent it, and enjoy it -- its worth your time.

Review:  Remember the time when you first played an insane gore fest gave from Rock Star called Manhunt. 
 It was an game where you sneak up to enemies and just do whatever it takes to finish that adversary 
 off, and how much you feel that well I should not be playing this game. Well Mad World just put 
 that game to shame with the endless supply of blood, and endless weapons at your disposal. 
  
  
  I've really enjoyed the Sin City like graphics to the endless supply of traps to keep the 
 game more interesting. But there are flaws. Why on earth did they keep the camera so close to Jack 
 when he is fight enemies it is worse than Ninja Gaiden 2, but at least not everyone attacks you 
 at once, almost like a classic beat em up. 
  
  All I can say is if you are done playing RE5 give this game a try. It is a great guilty pleasure, 
 that I will guarantee will be censored on the next sequel. Oh and once more SEGA IS BACK!!!

Review:  It's odd. It's very odd. Here we have a system that is hated on relentlessly by the hardcore gaming 
 community. A system that has been severly lacking in hardcore titles for well over year now. But, 
 now, for the second time, the little white family-friendly waggle machine delievers one of the 
 most hardcore, brutually violent, and solid games on the market this generation.
  
  Last year, Suda 51 stunned gamers with the Kill Bill-esque super-violent action title No More Heroes. 
 It was a cyber-punk anime adventure that left Wii players in a daze. Now, one year later, SEGA 
 has come along and topped No More Heroes mind-numbing violence with MadWorld. In MadWorld, you 
 control a man named Jack, just Jack. As Jack it is your job to take down a terrorist threat that 
 has lockdown Jefferson Island and is holed up in Verrigan City. To take down the threat you must 
 compete in the ultimate bloodsport DeathWatch, and work your way to the top of the ladder. The 
 story is fun, and crazy. The only qualm I have is torwards the end of the game, the story all of 
 sudden starts getting very complex, and DeathWatch has a deep purpose now. MadWorld seems to be 
 a game that would benefit from a story being light on the details, and not one that would cause 
 you to think. It ends up hurting the story, and the fun, a bit for me.
  
  The gameplay, where MadWorld truly shines, more than makes up for the dull narrative. As a beat 
 'em title, you think you'd be limited to hack and slash and punching. Here, that is most certainly 
 not the case. Jack has a handy chainsaw attatched to his arm for gory results. You can also use 
 post signs, tires, fan blades, spikes, flames, and many more options to dispose of your enemies. 
 Not to mention, in most levels there is a DeathWatch Challenge where you get to play a little minigame 
 for more points which you need to unlock weapons, the boss battle, and even the challenge on each 
 stage. In these challenges you get to play things like Man Darts where you hit opponents with a 
 spiked bat onto a dart board. These challenges provide extra variety to a game that's already brimming 
 with it. After awhile, impaling enemies may get a little tiresome, but the campaign only lasts 
 5-7 hours, so it's over before you can really get bored.
  
  MadWorld's visual style is quite unique. It's presented in complete black and white except for 
 blood which retains its natural color. At times the graphics can get a little annoying, but for 
 the most part it holds up very well. The main problem with it though is that things in the game, 
 especially bosses, tend to lose their impact due to the presentation. Everything seems to get lost 
 and forgotten after completion.
  
  This bloody escapade also has a few more tricks up its sleeve in presentation. One thing is that 
 MadWorld has a very upbeat, and catchy hip-hop soundtrack for you to listen to while you're slicing 
 enemies from foot to head. And one of the most shining aspects of the game is a pair of foul-mouthed 
 announcers that narrate all the action throughout the tournament. They're unbelievably hilarious, 
 and never become bothersome. The game can be a little loud though with the chainsaw, which also 
 comes out of your Wiimote speaker, and the soundtrack making things hard to hear and just seem 
 mashed together. All in all though, MadWorld is a solid beat 'em up that revels in its satire of 
 bloodlust. A super-violent game that has a plethora of gameplay options that never leave you tired, 
 and a presentation that most games can only dream of. It's no No More Heroes, but it's the next 
 best thing, and it proves, just like Suda's game did in '08, that no one does hyper-violence better 
 than Wii.

Review:  This game is brutally satisfying, the beat em up style works very well.
  The soundtrack is brilliantly incorporated into the game as well.
  The humor is ridiculously 
 funny.
  The presentation is beautiful.
  
  This is the first wii game that many mature players will very well enjoy, theres only a few flaws 
 about the game.
  Which are:
  Game is rather short (5 hours at most)
  Multiplayer could of been better.
  Camera sucks at certain points and will fustrate you.
  Bosses 
 on later parts of the game can fustrate you a lot.
  
  Biggest Wins:
  Killing has never been so satisfying
  The music kicks ass
  Story can go rather deep for just 
 a beat em up.
  laughing ones ass off during gameplay is not uncommon.
  Very creative when it comes down to how you want to make a corpse out of somebody.
  The graphic 
 novel style fits it perfectly.
  Its a crude violent bloody beat em up for a family centered console.

Review:  Everyone knows it- there's a drought of hardcore games on the Wii. Yes, there have been spectacular 
 titles like Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Mario Galaxy and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess 
 on the cosole, but other than that, everything else on the Wii is nothing but unrequired shovelware. 
 Even though Nintendo brought installments of their revered series', third party developers have 
 abandonded the Wii. Sure, EA have been bringing a lot of titles to the console, but they haven't 
 done a very good job. 
  
  Sega too have been bringing a lot of games on the system- Sonic Unleashed for one. And I must say, 
 that game isn't what you would call a 'good' game. Then, they give us Sonic and the Black Knight. 
 Well, let's not even talk about that game. Sure, they gave us House of the Dead: Overkill, which 
 was a good title, but it wasn't what we expected it to be.
  
  So, in short, they haven't been doing a good job with the Wii. Or that was the matter until MadWorld 
 came out. One of the most crazily, hilariously, and violently made game- Madworld. 
  
  Now, where do I start. The game has everything that a gamer would dream of having in a game- it 
 has the violence, the blood, the gameplay, the sound... everything. 
  
  Ah! The blood! The Violence! This game is so violent that it makes GTA seem like Pokemon in front 
 of God of War. You can throw your enemy between two spiky rolling cyllinders and watch sadistically 
 as the unfortunate guy is ripped into pieces and the blood is spilled all over. Or you can force 
 a metal rod up a guy's ass and push it further up until it rips the head of the guy apart and starts 
 jutting out. You might have noticed by now that this game is not violent in the typical sense. 
 Okay, you DO tear apart your enemies, like in almost every other game these days, but what matters 
 is HOW you're gonna do it.
  
  Because there are so many ways you can kill an enemy.... about every time you strike, you discover 
 a new way to slaughter. Its just so fun! 
  
  The blood reminds me of the graphics. Even though the graphics may not be good in the sense many 
 people think. They are not Hi-Def. In fact, they are black and white. And red. And even though 
 the game has only three colours to show, it still manages to be 3-D. 
  
  And the outstanding red colour amplifies the gory feeling of the game even nore. In the supposed 
 dull black and white palette, you thrash your enemies and the screen is splattered by RED COLOUR!!! 
 YEAH!!! BLOOD!!!
  
  The pure unadulterated fun of the game is augmented by the classic 'POWs' and 'KA-BOOMs' and the 
 'CRRRRRUNCH's!' which are evenly matched by the perfectly sickening crunching and thumping sounds. 
 
  
  This comic book atyle and the graphics and the way the game is... its all so... different. There 
 is no other word for it. All of it is just different.
  
  The replay value of the game is overwhelming. Beating your own high scores and finding new and 
 innovative and utterly violent ways to kill your foes just adds to the fun. 
  
  The sound too is good. The perpetual F Bombs and the maddeningly hilarious commentary and the hip 
 hop rap music are way too cool. The F Bombs are the best though. They just send a fit of laughter 
 through me. When I first started playing the game, I didn't know of the F Bombs. I walked, and.... 
 you can guess what happened. A slew of four lettered words came out of the commentator's mouth. 
 
  
  The only problem with the game is that it's too short. It's about five hours long. Thats all. I 
 finished it in a day. But that is overshadowed by the other good qualities of the game.
  
  So ultimately, we come to the final point. MadWorld is the most insane, most violent and one of 
 the most fun games I've ever seen. Finally, the people who crave for hardcore games on the ''Wii" 
 can shut up. MadWorld is one of the most hardcore titles I've ever played. 
  
  MadWorld is gonna make the world mad.

Review:  Okay, so it's a fact that the Wii's been lacking in good hardcore titles a bit lately. It's missed 
 out on some of this generation's masterpieces, like Bioshock, and the only games you can find at 
 the Wii section at any store are the casual shovelware. How did it come to this? Nintendo did its 
 job with the console, and released the best instalments in all their age old revered franchises 
 long ago, but the thrid parties really don't seem to be taking the little white box seriously. 
 All except for one, that is.
  
  Sega has been providing a steady stream of titles to the Wii since last year. And while so far, 
 the quality of its games ranged from average to appaling (we've had games like Sonic and Mario 
 at the Olympic Games and Sonic Unleashed. Enough said) , this year, it seems to be on a roll. It 
 first gave the Wii owners The House of the Dead: Overkill, a great over the top spastic tribute 
 to the campy B grade horror movies of yore, that was also insanely violent and crude. And now it's 
 given us MadWorld.
  
  Where do I begin about this game? Well, the graphics would be the most obvious place to start, 
 I guess. And for good reason. In today's age of stunning Hi Def realism, the black and white cel 
 shaded comic book inspired graphics of MadWorld stand out. Coming from the developers of such works 
 of art as Okami and Viewtiful Joe, is it really any wonder that MadWorld simply looks stunning 
 in motion? The black and white pallete really stands out, and trust me, once you see this game, 
 it'll be really hard to pull your eyes away from it. 
  
  Adding to all the class of MadWorld are the frequent 'POWs' and 'KA-BOOMs' that appear right across 
 the screen, with the appropriate sound effects. These comic book 'blurbs' really reinforce the 
 bl; ack and white graphics of the game, and that, the graphics exist in this form because they were 
 meant to, and not because of the Wii's limitations.
  
  To be fair, the camera in MadWorld is far from perfect. It is, in fact, sloppily handled, and its 
 clumsy reorientation in the midst of a fierce boss fight really leaves a lot to be desired. Hopefully, 
 this issue will be addressed in the inevitable sequel, because this is the only thing that mars 
 an otherwise flawless experience.
  
  Speaking of the intense boss fights, it really is worth mentioning that the bosses in this game 
 are huge. And menacing. And to fight them is, to repeat a word I've already used quite a lot of 
 times in this review before, insane. And unlike what IGN has poisted in its review, I found the 
 final boss battle to be far from anti climactic. Rather, it was thrilling, it was terrifying, it 
 awoke all my primal instincts like nothing else in this game had, and it left me wanting more.
 
  
  Which was to be found easily. This game has incredible replay value. Though the length of the game 
 itself is quite short (it lasted me about 5 hours, I think) , finishing the game immediately unlocks 
 a Hard mode. Now, this Hard mode is really unlike anything seen in a Wii game before. Rivalling 
 the toughest of God of War's God mode at times (that's the really tough and sadistic difficulty 
 level in the God of War games) , the Hard mode might induce quite a few broken Wiimotes.
  
  The fun comes from trying to beat your own high scores. Imaginative kills, which can be triggered 
 using environment specific actions, are very high scoring, but they are not necessary to proceed 
 in the game. In fact, you might as well just use the basic kills available to you at the beginning 
 of the game, and finish the game with it. But the resultant score would be very low then, and you 
 really wouldn't have seen anything of the game. The fun is in replaying the levels, and finding 
 newer, and higher scoring ways to kill your enemies.
  
  There is also a co-op mode available, but I don't really know much about that, since I really haven't 
 tried it out yet. The co-op mode, from what I know from IGN's reviews, will only be used for the 
 great minigames that kept cropping up throughout the main quest of MadWorld.
  
  Which brings me to my next point: the story of the main quest in MadWorld. While it's not the epic 
 that you would find in, say, Zelda or Final Fantasy, the story is astonishingly deep, and really, 
 one of the best I've ever come across in a beat-em up. It beats the weak plot setting of Brawl's 
 Sub Space Emmisary mode for sure.
  
  The game seems to have a very crude and vulgar sense of humour, as is evidenced by the F-bombs 
 that the announcers keep dropping at the drop of a hat, as well as the misogynist comments they 
 keep making. It adds to the sense of humour that the game has, for sure, and in a wierd way. But 
 there will be many who'll be turned off by the entire thing, and you're really gonna have to make 
 sure you don't play this game around anybody who might take offense.
  
  But then again, the game was always bound to induce controversies. It's focus on sadistic means 
 of dismembering people, it's blatantly adult approach to everything it does- this game is meant 
 for those who can handle it, for those who can take it, but unfortunately, there will be many who 
 can't.
  
  Before I sign off, I must mention the game's soundtrack. I hate it. No, really, I do. Focussing 
 exclusively on rap music, it's too loud for my taste. While subtlety isn't really MadWorld's strong 
 suit, the songs they've picked really grind my nerves. Unfortunately, there's no way you can turn 
 it off, or you'll have to miss out on the excellent commentary too.
  
  Ultimately, MadWorld's the game the Wii has been waiting for. It's loud, it's crude, it's hilarious, 
 it's fun and engrossing, and it's refined. There are a couple of minor issues, like the camera, 
 and some people might not like the idea of spending $50 for a game that's essentially 5 hours. 
 But if they do get this anyway, then they will get not only a hardcore Wii title, but another great 
 game from the creators of masterpieces like Okami, and what is hands down, the most fun game of 
 this generation.

Review:  GRAPHICS:
  
  Truly spectacular, it may not be technically impressive, but it has an awsome style that surpasses 
 even that of No More Heroes. Blood comes gushing out of the baddies, limbs fly off. It could of 
 used just a little bit of gray though.
  
  GAMEPLAY:
  
  Pretty basic, but fun. You use the A button for puching and grabing, the B button brings out the 
 chainsaw, and you swing the remote to perform other attacks. There is nothing more satisfying than 
 impailing 5 ninja onto the same spear. Boss fights are epic, as one poses a unique challenge. Some 
 of the minigames are awsome, but an equal amount are lame.
  
  SOUND:
  
  The music at first seemed not to fit, but its all good. The chainsaw is music to my ears. There 
 is commentary during the whole game that is so halarious you just might wet yourself.
  
  
  REPLAYABILITY:
  
  Do yourself a favor, buy this game. It may be short but you can unlock 
 weapons to use to replay through the campain. You are not going to hear all the commentary the 
 first time through.
  
  VERDICT:
  
  Do yourself a favor, buy this game. You will not be dissapointed.
