More like Dave Mirra BMX  Challenged . 

  Living in the world of Dave Mirra BMX Challenge would be a blast. Bicycles are the only source 
 of transportation. Every place you go -- from schoolyards to shipyards -- seems specially designed 
 to make the most of your hobby. The laws of physics are enforced only on a case-by-case basis. 
 And women frequently ride BMX bikes while dressed as schoolgirls. Yep, living in this world sounds 
 like a hoot. Unfortunately,  playing  in it -- in Dave Mirra BMX Challenge for the Nintendo Wii -- is 
 anything but.  

           Shouldn't Dave Mirra have graduated to a 10-speed by now?      

  BMX Challenge is 
 based on the PSP game of the same name from 2006 and manages to incorporate many of the same qualities 
 from the handheld game, including that game's haphazard physics implementation, uninspiring course 
 design, and atrocious visuals. In fact, apart from having to wind your way around more pedestrians 
 who appear throughout the various courses in the game, it doesn't look as if much has been done 
 at all with BMX Challenge's visuals. Ugly, vaguely blurred textures can be found everywhere, and 
 pop-in seems to run rampant on certain levels. That's in addition to character models that are 
 just as hideous as they were on the PSP, as well as ho-hum trick and rider animations, and rag-doll 
 crashes that are wholly unconvincing at best. Throw in dull, repetitive audio (both musically and 
 otherwise) , and you end up with a game that has one of the poorest presentations of the year.  
 

  You control BMX Challenge with the Wii Remote only. To pedal, you press the 2 button, and you steer 
 your bike by holding the remote horizontally and tilting the controller left or right. It takes 
 a few moments to get used to but, to the game's credit, steering is pretty responsive once you've 
 been acclimated to it. To jump off a ledge, you simply flip the remote up quickly. Tricks are handled 
 with a combination of the directional pad and the 1 and 2 buttons. It's a shame that there aren't 
 more tricks that involve the Wii Remote's motion-sensing features but, at the very least, you'll 
 have a lot of tricks at your disposal with the system as it is.  

  The heart of the game's single-player experience is the career mode, where you compete in both 
 race and trick events. You start out by creating a rider based on archetypes so clichd they'd 
 make John Hughes proud ("nerd," "hip-hop," "punk," "urban," etc.) , and then continue on to the 
 events proper. During these career events, you earn stars based on where you place in the race, 
 as well as for any trick and style points you rack up. Your star total will unlock new events as 
 you progress. The star totals needed to open up many of the later courses in the game on "pro" 
 level require you to not only finish first, but also to finish in style by racking up tricks and 
 taking advantage of the often insane physics on display in the game.  

  Just as in the PSP game, grinding rails is one of the best bets for racking up trick points. It 
 helps that the game's grinding mechanic warps you to practically any edge with just a press of 
 the 1 button. It also helps that the balance meter is very forgiving, even when you're grinding 
 around 90-degree corners, which looks and feels amazingly stupid. A couple of other wonky physics 
 bonuses just to hit the point home: Periodically you can move in reverse at full speed, and at 
 other times, you will slow to a crawl while pedaling for no good reason. In all, you'll have an 
 easier time earning a real degree in physics than trying to parse its implementation in BMX Challenge. 

           Look out for the guy in the hard hat! And that one! And that one! And that one! And... oh 
 forget it.      

  BMX Challenge's courses run the gamut from fairly authentic (racing around a schoolyard) to the 
 utterly preposterous (grinding and tricking your way around the deck of an oil tanker) . However, 
 you're bound to be disappointed with the track designs, which feature often ill-placed jumps and 
 obstacles that will send you heading straight for a crash. Worse yet, despite the course path switching 
 up at the midway point of a race, the tracks are short, which means you'll be racing the same ugly 
 scenery as you turn multiple laps. Hidden jumps (edgily referred to here as "phat" gaps) are strewn 
 throughout the courses for you to discover, as well as unlockables such as new bikes and accessories 
 for your career-mode riders. The game also includes split-screen multiplayer for up to four players 
 across various trick and race events.  

  Our biggest complaint with the PSP game was its lack of difficulty. That's been addressed to an 
 extent in the Wii version of BMX Challenge -- the increased dependence on trick points during race 
 events adds some much-needed challenge to the game. Unfortunately, what's still missing is any 
 sense of inspiration, authenticity, or fun in the game's extreme-sports approach. "Do not attempt 
 the suicide flip at home," the game warns you on a loading-menu screen, referring to one of the 
 deadlier-looking tricks you can pull off. It's a good piece of advice, and one we'd like to extend 
 to include the entire game.

Review:  graphically it may lack in areas but in others its quite beautiful ... gs says it looks like a 
 psp game not true i played it ,,, it looks like a enhanced version of dave mira on the gc ,,, the 
 gameplay is great for the low selection of racing games i have come across with the exception of 
 cars and mariokart 64 vc there isnt much in the form of racing ,,, this title stands out cause 
 its also the only bike racing game at the moment the sound is not as solid as gameplay is ,, no 
 good music ,, another thing is i cant hear the bikes one of the mishaps this game has the value 
 well it offers a career mode unsure i have not yet played that portion i normally dont play career 
 mode on any sport games as they tend to be boring ,, overall this game is one of the least good 
 racers available on the wii the controls are similar to cars in almost every way if youve played 
 marioparty 8s go kart thats another good example ,, solid controls plus solid gameplay and good 
 graphics if you can accept them are a + 7.5 is my score

Review:  This is sad. Very sad. BMX games have been fighting an uphill battle against the Tony Hawk series 
 since... well since they first started following the Hawk formula w/ Mat Hoffman's 1. I'm just afraid 
 that this game is another nail in the coffin for BMX games.
  
  I'm not going to bother telling you how miserable this game is. Everyone will know, one run with 
 Mira will make it obvious, and no-one will buy. The sad thing is that the less-than-passionate 
 BMX game developers and publishers will see this as one more sign that BMX games don't sell.
  
  IT'S NOT THAT BMX GAMES DON'T SELL, IT'S THAT CRAP DOESN'T SELL. ... Unless it's a blockbuster 
 movie tie in or something... TRY MAKING A QUALITY BMX GAME AND SEE HOW THAT WORKS.
  
  Why do people have to keep shelling out for skateboard games? YOU ARE DENYING ME A NEW GOOD BMX 
 GAME, THERE ISN'T EVEN ANOTHER ONE IN THE WORKS THAT I CAN FIND. I'M GETTING IMPATIENT. What is 
 this crap you constantly deliver me in the name of Mira? Where is my full fledged, innovative, 
 enduring Hoffman's sequel?
  
  This game deserves not only a low score, but a punishing score - it must be punished for degrading 
 an already suffering genre. This game kicks BMX while it is down.
