:::Review:::
You'll have more fun laughing at this light-gun shooter than playing it. 

  Upon boot-up, Target: Terror appears to be a well-aged relic from the early '90s. Don't let the 
 visual clues fool you, though. Despite an endless brigade of terrorists donning skintight leather 
 pants and digitized graphics a notch below those of Lethal Enforcers, Target: Terror is actually 
 from this century. The arcade version was released in 2004, and the home port is a brand-new, nearly 
 full-priced Wii game. Though Target: Terror starts out firmly in so-bad-it's-good territory, some 
 debilitating control issues combined with extremely straightforward level design make the task 
 of exterminating terrorists more excruciating than it should be.  

           There are even Rubik's Cubes!      

  Harkening back to the days of simple light-gun 
 shooters, Target: Terror does not allow any freedom in how you traverse levels. Don't expect the 
 cover mechanics from Time Crisis to make an appearance or even the branching paths from House of 
 the Dead III. Each level is a simple A-to-B affair, with the same enemy placement and scenery every 
 time. Target: Terror doesn't even borrow the free-look feature from another Wii shooter, Resident 
 Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles. In that game, you could use the analog stick to nudge your view 
 slightly, making it possible to take down targets and enemies hiding just offscreen. Target: Terror 
 offers the same experience every time you play through, making it less likely you'll want to replay 
 the levels.  

  The visuals are both the biggest strength and the most glaring weakness in Target: Terror. It's 
 not often you see a game slap popular convention so blatantly in the face and offer a straight-up 
 B-movie-caliber experience. The actors portraying the terrorists will cause even the most jaded 
 gamer to crack a goofy grin. One recurring terrorist obviously doesnt have his heart in his cause, 
 since he just sits lazily in an office chair, spraying bullets to and fro while barely acknowledging 
 your presence. Another terrorist, wearing a gray hoodie that makes him look like football coach 
 Bill Belichick's evil clone, reaches wildly for whatever body part you happen to shoot, not realizing 
 multiple shots to the stomach would make such actions impossible. With a healthy assortment of 
 terrorists leaping out at you and innocents wandering into view, Target: Terror is funny and enjoyable 
 at first.  

  The biggest problem is that, despite the archaic graphics, Target: Terror slows down at seemingly 
 random times. In a genre that requires extreme precision, these hiccups make what should be a simple, 
 goofy game extremely frustrating. Though you can learn to work around the dropped frames whenever 
 a barrel explodes (which will be often) , other instances are not so easily predicted. For example, 
 whenever a terrorist armed with a melee weapon rises up directly in front of you, the game will 
 stutter just long enough to make a quick disposal more a matter of chance than skill.  

  Compounding the problems of an unpredictable frame rate is uneven collision detection around the 
 borders of the screen. Though the control is usually smooth enough to make dispatching the bad 
 guys quite painless when they are in the middle of your view, anytime they drop from ceilings or 
 pop in from your periphery, you have as good a chance of hitting them with your eyes closed as 
 you do carefully aiming at them. These control quirks not only make you an all-too-easy target 
 for the terrorists, but they lead to the accidental death of far too many innocents as well.  

 
           The news reporter who will be setting the stage for your imminent slaughter.      

  The one bit of diversity tossed in actually makes the experience even more painful. Once you 
 have completed certain tasks, such as destroying 50 panes of glass or 25 exploding barrels, you'll 
 get to take a quick break from the terrorist hunting to compete in a random minigame. One baffling 
 game stars a trio of terrorists who are standing in a field ripped from the code of Duck Hunt tossing 
 turkeys strapped with dynamite at you. Another is a poor clone of Missile Command, where you let 
 loose an unlimited stream of missiles to shoot down a rain of rockets over some presumably peaceful 
 town. These minigames serve as little more than a distraction. Once unlocked, they are accessible 
 at any time from the main menu, but they are so devoid of skill and fun, you won't find yourself 
 going back to them very often.  

  Target: Terror could have filled a niche as an amusing light-gun shooter, but there are just too 
 many flaws to overlook. Though it might be worth playing merely to laugh at the extreme overacting, 
 the imprecise controls and bland level design ensure you won't be able to stick with this game 
 for long. There are better -- and cheaper -- light-gun games on the Wii to spend your time on.

Review:  Wii introduced a new way to play! It's a console that doesn't have the best graphics but a lot 
 of fun with WiiRemote! But a crazy company (Konami and Leviathan) decided to make something terrible! 
 This game looks like the 80's shooter's arcades! I'm not overcoming... It's really bad! When I 
 first saw it, I thought it was like Ghost Squad (Which is short but pretty good) but I got disappointed 
 when I played the first level... It's really worse than any other Wii Games!!!
  
  I played other bad games... But this one is really terrible... If you like shooter, try Ghost Squad 
 it has 3 levels but a lot of variation of them...
  
  I don't know what else can I say to close this review, but maybe there will be someone who enjoyed 
 this game... Who knows? But I really don't recommend it.
  
  Don't buy it... It not worth a penny...
