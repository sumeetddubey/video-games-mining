:::Review:::
Improvements over the PSP game make the Wii version of Root of Evil a competent, stylish platformer. 
 

  Death Jr. has always been just shy of reaching his potential. As one of the first games to debut 
 for the PSP system, Death Jr.'s endearing character design and art style looked promising. Unfortunately, 
 frustrating controls and a pesky camera system made the pint-sized son of the Grim Reaper fall 
 short of expectations. The game's sequel improved on some of its predecessor's shortcomings by 
 offering better camera control and weapon combat. Death Jr.: Root of Evil for the Wii is a port 
 of the PSP sequel, and it, too, improves the formula. The new game suffers from a few poor design 
 choices but it's still an able, entertaining platformer.  

           DJ escapes murderous bears on a rampage in the scenic toy cemetery.      

  The game 
 opens as Death Jr. and his ragtag bunch of classmates are hunting for cocoons in the forest. In 
 their search for a biology project, they inadvertently unleash Furi, a maniacal villain who bears 
 a striking resemblance to the Hulk. While Furi escapes and goes after DJ's dad, DJ and his gal 
 pal, Pandora, set off to correct their mistake. It's an amusing premise that makes for some funny 
 moments, but the storyline is rarely in focus. Expository cutscenes are few and far between, and 
 most of the underdeveloped plot is revealed through in-game conversations with friends. DJ and 
 his pals have a great sense of humor, and their observations of the world around them are always 
 amusing, but great characters like Stigmartha (a girl who bleeds from her hands when she gets nervous) 
 and Dead Guppy are underused.  

  Although you'll have a scythe or whip for melee combat, ranged attacks are available through the 
 array of firearms at your disposal. DJ's creative weaponry showcases the game's twisted humor. 
 Whether it's a flaming-toilet-paper launcher or a hamster with C4 strapped to its back, the selection 
 is sure to give you a chuckle. Hidden throughout each of the 19 levels are spare parts that you 
 can use to upgrade weapons, as well as orbs to collect and trade in for new melee attacks. The 
 game sticks fairly close to the traditional action platforming conventions, so there's plenty of 
 swinging from ropes, clearing rooms of enemies to unlock doors, and collecting various doodads. 
 Though not particularly inventive, Root of Evil's time-tested formula is still fun.  

  You can play as either Death Jr. or Pandora, whose move sets are almost identical. Cooperative 
 play is also available through a split-screen mode, but you'll need a separate save file to play 
 with a buddy. The multiplayer mode is really no different than playing by yourself because the 
 story and gameplay are identical. The only advantage of playing with a friend is having an ally 
 to help mow down the hordes of enemies that the game throws at you.  

  The PSP version of Root of Evil was plagued with poor controls and a terrible camera system that 
 resulted in far too many cheap deaths from offscreen attacks or misjudged leaps. On the Wii, the 
 control scheme has been significantly improved by implementing subtle yet effective motion sensitivity. 
 Flicking the Wii Remote adds some occasional (and much-needed) variety to the melee combat, but 
 the real value of motion control is in ranged attacks. Holding the Z trigger engages sidestep mode, 
 in which aiming and camera control are relegated to the movement of the Wii Remote. The screen 
 automatically scrolls depending on where you aim, and you're still free to move your character 
 with the analog stick to avoid being attacked. Outside of sidestep mode, the camera can be centered 
 using the C button or rotated with the plus and minus buttons. Although you'll still fall victim 
 to the occasional offscreen enemy fire, frustration is much more limited.  

           Pandora's moves are almost identical to DJ's.      

  Style has always been a selling 
 point for the series. Environments are filled with personality, and enemy designs are varied and 
 imaginative. Whether you're tackling homicidal teddy bears in the cemetery for dead toys or doing 
 battle with Louie the Llama in his World of Waffles amusement park, the bright colors and unique 
 style help to set a playful tone. Unfortunately, graphics that were a technical marvel on the PSP 
 two years ago are not nearly as impressive on the Wii. Jagged edges and occasional screen tearing 
 mar an otherwise pleasant presentation. The soundtrack is an appropriate blend of spooky and whimsical 
 tunes, and the voice acting is on par with most cartoons. The sound effects are generally appropriate 
 and not intrusive, but weapon fire and annoying grunts from DJ or Pandora sometimes drown out the 
 music.  

  Despite some remaining issues, such as cheap deaths and unrelenting swarms of enemies that spawn 
 out of nowhere, Backbone has significantly improved upon the PSP version of Root of Evil. The Wii 
 game is a competent platformer that won't blow you away with innovative mechanics, but it's still 
 entertaining while it lasts. Fans of traditional platforming and unique art styles would do well 
 to give the game a try. Death Jr. has yet to fully realize his potential, but he's finally on the 
 right track in Root of Evil.

Review:  Death Jr. is a great concept for a game, because man, who don't wants to play as the son of the 
 death? But the series doesn't have a great game ( all of them are average) but it seems that is 
 in the right way by looking at this wii version of the game. Firstly, the game is a port from the 
 Psp, but it has a lot of improvements over it. For example the controls more comfortable, you move 
 DJ with the nunchuck and for using the guns you use the wii pointer that feels really great. There 
 are also no camera problems in the wii version, because now by pressing the c button you can recenter 
 it. The graphics are very nice and colourful and I think are some of the best graphics on Wii. The 
 gameplay is nice, but the levels sometimes feel repetitive and there are some levels that are very 
 short and in other levels you only have to collect things so it feels simplistic. The game is short 
 and it will lasts like 7 or maximum 8 hours, although it has some issues it feels like Death Jr. 
 is going in the right way and this wii version is a nice game, so give it a try.

Review:  I'm playing death jr root of evil... it's surprisingly good. 
  
  the camera is spot on... you can press C to re-center camera just like in super mario galaxy. the 
 only problem is targetting the enemy, there is no "target-lock" button in the game. if you got 
 used to no more heroes target locking then slashing, it'll be a bit of an adjustment.
  
  graphics are 7.5/10... a little more polish would've done it great. but it still looks great, compared 
 to most wii games. at least in this game you see they really made effort... just not super mario 
 galaxy kind of achievement, if you know what i mean.
  
  gameplay is 8.5/10... you learn a new attack move eventually along the way, which is great, so players 
 won't need to memorize what to swing for all moves at the start of the game.
  
  sound is 7.0/10... the voice actors are great! but the dialog writers are lame...
  
  i'd say 
 this game is a 7.5/10... not as good as super mario galaxy as a platformer, a little polish in graphics 
 and sound dialogs would've given it wonders. but definitely a title to pick up.
