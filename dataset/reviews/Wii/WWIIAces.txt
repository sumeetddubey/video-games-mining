:::Review:::
WWII Aces is a frustrating, ugly, flight combat game with antiquated design elements and unresponsive 
 motion controls. 

  One of the benefits of the Wii's unique design is the potential for innovative control schemes 
 to introduce new ways of playing games that belong to traditional genres. Unfortunately, for every 
 inventive Wii game, there are a number of shoddy, halfhearted efforts to shoehorn motion controls 
 into a game that doesnt benefit from them. WWII Aces is a flight combat game that loses any appeal 
 it may otherwise have had by forcing unresponsive motion controls onto an already maddeningly difficult 
 game.  

           Dogfights like this one would be a lot more fun if the controls weren't so bad.      

 
  In WWII Aces, you can choose to fly for the RAF, Soviet Air Force, or the Luftwaffe in three distinct 
 campaigns totaling more than 70 missions. Each campaign offers a significant variety of objectives, 
 ranging from simple checkpoint searches and dogfights to paratrooper drops and bombing runs. You'll 
 have your choice of 12 planes that each handle a bit differently and utilize different sets of 
 armaments. However, you won't know which plane is the best choice until you try a mission with 
 the wrong plane and fail. Although the game presents you with your objectives before the start 
 of each level, it's often unclear how to complete those objectives once you enter the mission. 
 For example, you may be tasked with destroying a fleet of ships before the enemy can fire its arsenal 
 of torpedoes, but these ships do not appear on your map until halfway through the mission. When 
 missions last upward of 10 minutes each, sitting through the first half of the level only to fail 
 shortly thereafter is frustrating. Each level can be tackled by yourself or cooperatively using 
 split-screen multiplayer. Playing with a friend makes completing the objectives a bit easier, if 
 only because your incredibly accurate enemies have one more target at which to fire. Dogfight mode 
 allows you to set up a quick air battle against several AI opponents, but these fights are only 
 fun when you can mess around with a second player.  

  The default control scheme uses only the Wii Remote. Holding the controller sideways, you move 
 the aiming reticle by tilting the remote. Quickly jerking the controller to the side performs a 
 barrel roll, while flicking it up performs a flip to evade pursuing enemies. Unfortunately, you'll 
 often oversteer during intense dogfights and miss your target, while your enemies do not seem to 
 have the same trouble. Adding to the frustration, barrel rolls and flips are rarely recognized 
 properly. This causes you to perform the wrong maneuver and get back into the line of fire quicker 
 than you anticipated. The second and third control schemes offer some reprieve by letting you use 
 the motion sensitivity of the Nunchuk to control your plane's movement. They also relegate such 
 actions as barrel rolls or firing weapons to the D pad and A button, respectively. None of the 
 control schemes feel entirely intuitive, and it's unfortunate that a more traditional arrangement 
 using the analog stick isn't available.  

           Playing with a friend makes WWII Aces easier, but only slightly more enjoyable.      

 
  WWII Aces also suffers from long load times, often making you wait more than 30 seconds to enter 
 a mission. These load times are curious because the game's graphics and presentation are downright 
 ugly. Its pixelated, barren landscapes could have been adequately rendered on the Nintendo 64 or 
 PlayStation. Distant enemy planes or tanks appear as nondescript red triangles that are impossible 
 to distinguish until you're dangerously within reach of their weapons. Oceans and forests are depicted 
 as static blue and green textures, while your plane is only slightly more colorful, full of jagged 
 edges. The game's soundtrack, which is appropriately dramatic, is the only commendable aspect of 
 the game's presentation. Sound effects for weapons fire and voice acting for mission introductions 
 are adequate, but they're not at all impressive.  

  Although WWII Aces offers sufficient content and variety, its frustrating difficulty, shoddy control 
 schemes, and terrible presentation do nothing to justify its full retail price. This game does 
 not meet the visual standards of its platform, and would have fared better with traditional controls. 
 If you're interested in a Wii game because the system offers the chance for a novel control method, 
 there are plenty of other games for you to try. Avoid this frustrating, halfhearted attempt.
