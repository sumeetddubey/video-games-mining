:::Review:::
TMNT has some legitimately neat platforming sequences, but it's more frustrating than a kid-oriented 
 game ought to be, and the combat is completely brain-dead. 

  Think of Ubisoft's first attempt at a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game as Prince of Persia for 
 the kiddie set. Based on the upcoming CG Turtles movie, TMNT earns this descriptor because it plays 
 a whole bunch like developer Ubisoft Montreal's most recent Prince of Persia games, relying heavily 
 on platforming over fighting. In this case, Montreal has lessened the difficulty of the various 
 jump puzzles that Price of Persia is so well known for (seemingly to make it playable for the younger 
 audience that's likely to latch onto the film) , yet the game is still far more frustrating than 
 it ought to be, due to a faulty camera system and sometimes unreasonable controls. Toss in that 
 the combat is only slightly more complex than the legal-aged TMNT arcade beat-'em-up Konami and 
 Ubi recently rereleased on the Xbox Live Arcade, and what you've got is a game that doesn't properly 
 suit any individual audience.  

          The platforming sections take up the bulk of the game, and they'd be pretty cool if it 
 weren't for that pesky camera.     

  Since the  TMNT  movie isn't out yet, it's impossible to gauge exactly how much the game has in 
 common with it. Suffice it to say, it features all the principal characters (though seemingly none 
 of the film's celebrity voice talent) and touches on some of the same basic themes as the film. 
 The whole game is told through a disjointed form of flashback narration, with the titular Turtles 
 each chiming in at random intervals to explain some chunk of the story in the past tense (usually 
 skipping over details that might actually make the whole thing make sense) . The dialogue and voice 
 acting is fine for what it is, but as far as providing a satisfying Turtles tale, you're out of 
 luck here.  

  If you're more accustomed to Konami's last few attempts at the Turtles license, you're in for an 
 awakening with TMNT. In some ways, it's a good awakening, in the sense that this game isn't altogether 
 terrible and actually has its fun moments. Those fun moments come from the hop-happy platforming 
 sequences that make up roughly two-thirds of the gameplay. Each stage is laid out in such a fashion 
 as to force you to jump, double jump, wall jump, wall run, flip, and monkey bar your way through. 
 Some of the stages are quite elaborate, relying on a lot of quickly timed movements and jumps that 
 are reminiscent of what the recent Prince of Persia games have been all about. Some areas are built 
 for specific Turtles to navigate, like walls that Raphael can climb using his sai and longer jumps 
 that require Michelangelo to use his nunchakus like helicopter blades to float over. All told, 
 there's a surprising amount of intricacy to the level designs in TMNT. Of course, the relative 
 difficulty of these levels has been scaled back significantly, and none of the stages take more 
 than 10 or 15 minutes to blow through.  

  It was good of the developers to scale the difficulty back, as this is clearly a game aimed at 
 a younger audience. The problem is that they didn't quite scale it back enough. The main frustrations 
 with the platforming sequences stem from the fixed camera the game uses. Because of the way it 
 angles shots, it sometimes makes it impossible to properly judge the distance of a jump, leaving 
 you to guesstimate and trial-and-error your way through certain sections. There are also times 
 where the controls can get away from you. You're jumping around so quickly and so often that you 
 may find yourself instinctively pressing the jump button too many times, ultimately overshooting 
 your goal. Frustrations like this are palpable enough to the standard gaming audience, let alone 
 younger players.  

  On the flip side, the combat mechanics have been scaled back to the point of making them incredibly 
 dull. You really only have one main attack button, as well as a jump-kick button that operates 
 independently of the primary combo system. Each Turtle only has one combo to speak of. It's typically 
 a lengthy combo, but it's the same combo again and again. There are special tag-team moves that 
 come into play from time to time, where by holding down a button, you can call in a fellow Turtle 
 to pull off some flip-happy, electrifying attack that takes out a bunch of bad guys at once. This 
 is basically the game's way of making up for the fact that there are no computer-controlled Turtles 
 onscreen with you while you play, and it's not an altogether bad methodology. The problem with 
 it mostly stems from the enemies you fight being so utterly inept. Throughout the game, you fight 
 wave after wave of pacifist thugs and ninjas who seem content to just swipe in your general direction 
 from time to time. All you've got to do is mash endlessly on the attack buttons and pull together 
 the occasional tag-team move, and you're pretty much never going to die.  

  TMNT has a slick look to it that translates better on some platforms than others. The graphics 
 aren't so much cel-shaded as they are modeled after the CG look of the Turtles in the movie. All 
 the characters animate nicely as they leap and fight through the various levels, and even the levels 
 themselves are relatively pleasing to look at as you play. The frame rate has a tendency to dip 
 in all versions of the game (the 360 version is the most erratic of the bunch) , and the aforementioned 
 camera issues are a real bummer, but otherwise, TMNT is a pretty solid-looking game.  

  As tends to be the case with movie-licensed games, TMNT is out on a lot of home gaming platforms, 
 including the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Wii, Xbox 360, and PC. The core game is identical between 
 all of them, though there are some subtle differences. The Wii version is probably the most drastically 
 different, simply because it includes motion controls. Unfortunately, these controls feel hopelessly 
 tacked on. All you do is wiggle the Wii Remote back and forth when you want to do a primary attack 
 and jerk the Nunchuk in one direction or another to kick. These mechanics get extremely tiresome 
 very quickly, and on top of that, there's a weird sensor issue with the Nunchuk. If you're just 
 playing the game and happen to tilt the Nunchuk too far in one direction or the other, your character 
 will crouch like he's readying an attack, and then stay like that until you hold the Nunchuk straight 
 again. Of course, there's nothing in the game to signify that this is what's causing the issue, 
 and you may find yourself initially confused as to what's causing this.  

          Conversely, there's nothing cool about TMNT's combat. It's just boring.     

  The Wii 
 version also happens to look identical to the GameCube version, blurriness and all. Despite support 
 for 480p and widescreen viewing, there don't seem to be any visual enhancements at all between 
 them, which is more than a touch disappointing, because the Wii should be capable of more. The 
 Xbox 360 version predictably looks the best of the bunch, though not to the degree that you might 
 be hoping. The 360 version is brighter, a bit crisper, and features more in the way of environmental 
 detail, such as added grass textures and foliage. The 360 version also supports more enemies onscreen 
 at once, though somehow the combat doesn't seem any more challenging with more enemies to dispatch. 
 There are also achievements to consider, but they also happen to be incredibly easy to acquire, 
 with many of them relegated to points for beating levels and pulling off individual special abilities. 
 Even still, the better graphics and achievements ultimately make the 360 version the best by default. 
 But if you'd rather not spend the extra $10, the PS2 version looks quite nice. The PC version is 
 solid, too, though you really need a dual-analog gamepad to play this game properly.  

  Between the overly simplistic combat and sometimes-obnoxious platforming sequences, TMNT is like 
 a man without a country. Younger audiences are likely to balk at some of the more frustrating elements 
 of the platforming, and older players are going to be bored to tears by the effortless fighting 
 mechanics. The moments when you actually do find yourself having fun with TMNT are just frequent 
 enough to prevent the game from being wholly unadvisable to fans of the film desperate to take 
 part in some interactive Turtle adventures, but for everyone else, TMNT is one you can safely pass 
 on.

Review:  I got this game from Blockbuster a logn time ago when it cost $50 and bnoy is that the largest 
 load of overpricing there is!
  
  The game can easily be beaten in about 5-6 hours of gameplay. The graphics are actualyl pretty 
 sweet for a Wii game and they actualyl took some time making the game fun to play and well thought 
 out in the environment department, but the repetetiveness of everything makes the game get old 
 quick.
  
  You will hear the same voiceacting over and over again that gets terribly annoying, you might as 
 well turn off the sound when you play this game! There were some very hard sequences in the game 
 that are definately hard for little kids to catch on and beat certain sections, so it definately 
 should not be "E for everyone". The Wii controls for the game also to not fit in well or match 
 as well as it should. And the fight sequences are thesame annoying crap over and over and over 
 again, it's like the foot soldiers NEVER seem to go away! You have to fight and fight and fight 
 so many times and your thumbs will bleed from mashing the damn "hit" button when you have to fight 
 all the soldiers. Then the checkpoint placement is after a good 20 foot soldier fight, so if you 
 are lucky enough to survive through a fight sequence then it's all good, but if you die, it's like 
 starting all over fighting over and over again!
  
  This game is a a decent rental as the game is somewhat fun and the graphics are nice as well. But 
 don't go spending the bank on buying this as there is NO replay value once you have played it through 
 once (5-6 hours)

Review:  Prologue --- I have to say I really enjoyed the TMNT movie. iMAGi did an awesome job with the CGI 
 in this movie. I'm a realist so I know that the graphics in the movie wouldn't be in the game but 
 I wanted the game. All the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle games (except for the nightmare Turtles 
 1) have been great Beat em' ups. Did this one deliver???
  
  Story --- This game Loosely follows the movie of the same name. The game begins with April O'Neil, 
 who goes to South America to bring Leo home. Leo returns home and reunites with his brothers. Each 
 Turtle has a mission before the return of Leo, well Raph is in his **** persona. After April gives 
 Max Winters his statues (which is his generals) . Well thats all of the story until the boss fights. 
 You do run into the Purple Dragons, and the Foot Clan. Graphics --- Very good. The game has a great 
 "Dark" feel, and the surrounding environments were well done. The cut scenes could've been better 
 if they added motion. Controls --- This is one of those games for the Wii that didn't need the 
 motion controls to play. This is a beat em'up game, button mashing not a Wii mote shaking. That 
 right you want to attack shake the Wii remote, this makes the game REAL REDUNDENT., and will wear 
 your wrist out quick and fast.
  
  Sound --- This game had a good soundtrack, but this doesn't make up for the HORRIBLE voice tracks. 
 Honestly each turtle has like 4 voice tracks and it's repeated over and over. You only play as 
 one turtle at a time but all of carry on conversations with each other. The sound effects were 
 ok to mediocre at best.
  
  Game Play --- Well have you played Prince of Persia? Yes it was great to see the turtles run on 
 walls and do triple flips up walls, this does put the NINJA in their name. On the other hand I 
 think that Ubi Soft could've done new mechanic for the turtles instead of "borrowing" form another 
 game. Each mission is timed, and to unlock everything you have to be the missions in a timely fashion. 
 
  
  In All: If you get this game and play it for 6-8 hours straight (I challenge you to try it !!!) 
 you can finish the game (few more hours if you want to unlock all features) and never see a GAME 
 OVER. You just can't die you play as one turtle and when you die another turtle takes it's place! 
 This does take the challenge away from the game. This trading out turtle does allow you to hit 
 all four special attacks back to back on the boss fights (this does take some time to perfect  
 this happens after replaying it) . With a broken controls, repeating voice tracks, and difficult 
 level this game is only good for a TMNT fan and not for anyone whose looking for a game.

Review:  TMNT is inspired from the new computer-animated feature film of the same name, and the new TMNT 
 computer-animated film is inspired from a classic kiddie fodder's franchise. This movie tie-in 
 is also on the PC, PlayStation 2, PSP, X-box 360, Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo DS and the Game Boy 
 Advance system. These sterotypically so-called "teen" turtles make thieir first debut, and boy, 
 is it Prince of Persia slapped with a poor kid's brand, lame movie, and, the biggest flaw of all, 
 this TMNT version is meant to be the WII. Is it? Man...
  
  TMNT, like most licensed children's video game products, usually flogs one name and steals the 
 gameplay from another popular series of games. For instance, The Simpsons Hit and Run is just The 
 Simpsons with Grand Theft Autoesque gameplay, and uses a kid's game cover as a disguise (but, there 
 is a striking difference to this TMNT game, Simpsons Hit and Run was great fun) , and Tim Burton's 
 The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge, is just a grand Disney/Tim Burton stop-motion 
 animation feature adapted with the help of the gameplay from Capcom's popular Devil May Cry Series 
 (mind you, Nightmare was awesome too) . But, TMNT is the classic sword-slicing from the Prince of 
 Persia series. Is it any different to Prince of Persia? Nope!
  
  What is really poor, useless and pointless about the whole WII product is the combat system in 
 this game. Your combat is just a constant waving of the WiiMote, thus Numbchuck, and constant button 
 mashing on the WiiMote. Because of the constant waving of the WiiMote Wand, and big button-mashing 
 do we care if we get ranked with a "D" at the end of the day? Oohhh, this combat just gives me 
 an urge of anger...
  
  What brings the entire game down like a ton of turtle-shell bricks, is the huge lack of use with 
 the WiiMote and Numbchuck whatsoever. The only thing you do as gameplay in the this game is the 
 button-mashing of the A, B, E, and D buttons, and to do a kick or punch, you just wave the WiiMote 
 and Numbchuck about like some person gone mad in an insane asylum.
  
  The only minor glee from this game is when you're playing as the Nightwatcher as Rapahel. Not that 
 there is any difference to the gameplay or any "change", it's just that the graphics of the tiny 
 Nightwatcher costume, look good from the WII's high-definition status of the graphics. The voice 
 talents of the game sound like the dud but nastolgic voice talents of a classic cartoon of TMNT.
 
  
  If you a hardcore fanatic of the TMNT franchise, then, by all means kill yourself with this game 
 today , but, if you want a WII game with actual genuine use of the WII mose practicality, then 
 this game is a Ebert and Roper definite thumbs down!

Review:  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) gives players the chance to relive their nostalgia for the 
 series. Going in, the game holds a lot of promise as it is developed by Ubisoft Montreal most notablely 
 known for their Prince of Persia series. The prospect of a POP-esque game in a TMNT world is very 
 tantalizing. Unfortunately the game does not live up to expectations. TMNT is a third person action 
 game that, like POP, gives players the ability of run along walls, do acrobatics, dodge traps and 
 adds new abilities like call in your turtle brothers to pull team combos. Despite these features 
 TMNT is no where close to the caliber POP Sands of time was. The blame can solely be put on a fact 
 that it feels dumbed down to appeal to a very young crowd to coincide with the demographic targeted 
 by the tie-in movie. What made POP great was (1) superb story (2) excellent game play elements 
 (3) topnotch pacing. All these are missing from TMNT. The story is tied to the animated film and 
 not explained as the game expects you to have seen the movie. Even if you have seen the movie it 
 is not compelling. Despite borrowing elements from POP, the game feels too easy. There is no satisfaction 
 from either completing environment puzzles or from the dumbed down repetitive combat that forces 
 to you fight bland generic enemies. How can you have a TMNT game and not have hoards of boss to 
 fight? Graphically and audibly the feels like a budget title. One can clearly tell the game was 
 developed for the PS2 and then ported to other platforms. Even worse, the graphics and sound are 
 that of an average PS2 game. In the end, TMNT is a budget title that should keep younger audiences 
 mildly interested.
  5.5/10

Review:  i got this game cheap and wasnt expecting much from it. but when i started playing i was really 
 suprised. thing of it as prince of persia junior. most of the game consists of fun platforming 
 that is fast paced and really good because of the fantastic level design. the turtles can do alot 
 of the stuff the prince can do e. g. wall run, bounce between walls etc. the combat is ok but gets 
 a little repetative. the wii waggle is similar to most games in that u shake the controller to 
 attack. this game is aimed at younger kids and is very easy to complete but is still good fun to 
 play.

Review:  I would advise not to even rent this. The reason is say this is because I did and well my hand/wrist 
 hurt and got tired because i was doing was shaking the wii-mote. The only KINDA SORTA fun thing 
 is the crazy jumps. I thought it would have been a lot better but man was i wrong. Save your money 
 and don't even think about renting. Just go pick up Zelda or Super Paper Mario because the Wii 
 is not having a good year with games so far. Or buy some VC games because this is not worth the 
 money. Hope my review helped.

Review:  I thought this game would help me relive the days when I was a child. who wasnt a turtles freak 
 back in the late 80's? But sadly this game does not hold up too well. the platforming sequences 
 are good, the voice acting is good as well, but the fighting is just lame. You get surrounded by 
 streets punks who pretty much just stand there and wait for you to wail on them. While the game 
 goes have its fun moments, there is almost no reason to play it again after completing it. I would 
 recommend renting it first to see if you like it.
  
  Gameplay 6- Fun platforming but really dumb combat
  Graphics 7- Decent graphics. Good looking 
 characters but bland looking environments.
  Sound 7- Good voice acting, but after a certain point, the Turtle's favorite line cliches will 
 become just an annoyance.
  Value 6

Review:  Story: I usally don't have a story section, but I need to make an exception. The story in this 
 game is suppose to be tied-in to the movie, but how come Ubisoft had to alter it so much? First, 
 the game starts with each turtle getting a level dedicated to themselves and what they did while 
 Leonardo was on his training journey. I was fine with this, but then once the story gets back to 
 when the 4 turtles are reunited it changes drastically. First, there is no April O'neal and/or 
 Casey Jones. At all. I guess Ubisoft decided to take out 2 really important characters. Even in 
 the clips and sneak peeks at the movie, there is no sign of either of them. In the movie, they 
 have a pretty major role. Also, the turtles go on adventures that seem to have no importants to 
 the story or even a semi-story. It's like Ubisoft was running out of ideas while designing the 
 game. So basically certain characters are given such minor roles from there movie counterpart. 
 Graphics: The graphics in this game may look like the Gamecube version, but that doesn't mean it 
 looks bad. The cutscenes are presented in a comic book format, which is unique. There is even clips 
 from the movie, but the quality of the clips is so laggy. The framerate seems to be really downsized. 
 While in gameplay the graphics are much cooler looking. The draw distance is impressive, the turtles 
 look great, and there are some pretty good particle effects. Although the enemies' models are repeated. 
 I have a problem though. When a turtle speaks during gameplay a comic book panel appears on the 
 side. My negative is that it comes up too often and the turtles have no pupils. If they have pupils 
 in the movie that the game is based on, then why don't they have pupils in the game!!!??
  
  Sound: The sounds in the game aren't much. Come to think of it, nothing really stands out. Many 
 sounds are just collisions of weapons hitting other weapons or an enemy. Only a few sound come 
 through the Wii Remote speaker.
  
  Voices: The voice acting is truly a high point of TMNT. Although after seeing the movie, it's obvious 
 not all of the voice actors came back. This is obvious in Raphael, Karai, Max Winters, and Splinter. 
 The actors get into the roles well and fit the situations perfectly. Although certain voice overs 
 are delayed. Also, the voices aren't nearly as annoying as past Turtles games, but they can still 
 repeat... alot.
  
  Music: I honestly don't think any of the music was connected to the movie. Ubisoft created a theme 
 song, that is interesting, but not very memorible. The music is much like the sound effects. There, 
 but no memorible.
  
  Gameplay: Now this gameplay is hard to score. I'll start with the acrobatics. These areas are very 
 fun. Jumping from rooftop to rooftop, scaling the sewers, climbing Winterscorp is super fun. Using 
 your brothers attacks, and throws can be fun as well. The negatives with the acrobatics is that 
 the coins are a dead give away to which way to go, leaving no room for thinking of which way to 
 go. Also, each of the 4 turtles have special abilities ... if you can call them that. Leonardo 
 can slip through bars, which is used only about 4 times. Raphael can scale walls using his sai. 
 This ability is used more than enough times, but it would be nice to use it in more than one set 
 area. Donatello can use his Bo Staff as a bo vault which is used about 4 times throughout the entire 
 game. Also it doesn't work in all areas. Michelangelo can use his nunchukus as helicopters to hover 
 over areas. This is actually a useful ability. Now to combat. The combat in this game isn't great. 
 Although it's better than the combat in more recent TMNT games. The game has areas that are set 
 for combat. Stupidly, you are stuck in that area until a certain number of enemies is killed. I 
 must say, while the Wii motion sensors aren't used well, the combat is more fun with it. I have 
 even played the PC version and I must say that motion sensor is much more fun than just repeating 
 button presses. Ubisoft has even included 9 Wii exclusive mini games. Each turtle has his own unique 
 minigame. Raphael has a game in which you use Z and swing the Wii Remote to jump from 2 sides of 
 a ledge down a hole. Leonardo has a game in which you use the Wii Remote to aim and the Nunchaku 
 to throw shurikens or ninja stars. Donatello has a game in which you repeatily move the Wii Remote 
 up and down and use A to jump, in a side scrolling mini game. Michelangelo has a game that has 
 you using the Wii Remote has a helicopter and Nunchaku as directing your weight. Each of these 
 minigames are unique, but only Donatello's is really entertaining.
  
  Overall: I say that TMNT is a good game, but not an excellent one. It's still entertaining and 
 the extra unlockables are pretty entertaining. So this game is a keeper for TMNT fans, but for 
 everyone else watch and love the movie.
  
  COWABUNGA, DUDE!

Review:  Wow, we finally have a bottom of the barrel for Wii games, and it didn't even take and entire year! 
 Behold the lameness that is TMNT!
  
  I am a TMNT fan. I loved the arcade game and have TMNT 1 through 4 on NES and SNES and those are 
 quality titles. I don't know what has happend since then, but TMNT (like most comic based games) 
 has been horrid. To mention comics I have been a fan of the more mature TMNT and the kid oriented 
 old school mid 90s TMNT. I don't like the new cartoons. I thought the new movie was fun, so I figured 
 that the game might be. Well I was really really really wrong.
  
  The graphics are nice. They are lush although not really all that well detailed and mimic the CG 
 movie fairly well. They also use some of the cartoon's animation in it as well. The graphics flow 
 well and the animation is pretty cool But after that the lack of detail and flatness of the graphics 
 kicks in. The sounds are ok. The music isn't the same as the movies, or that of any of the TMNT 
 properties so it was kind of lame. The turtles talk through the game and while the voices are the 
 actors, they repeat themselves all to often and it is really annoying. The controls are horrid. 
 Trying to get your turtle to block, attack, and dodge is like trying to herd cats. It just doesn't 
 happen easy. You swing the Wii mote to attack and the turtle often times stands there and gets 
 hit. You can't make a combo to save your life, and all the turtles play the same! The acrobatics 
 while kind of cool at first wears off really quickly as it's kind of like Prince of Persia, only 
 way easier. The levels are easy, the characters lame, the fighting and jumping boring. I don't 
 even think a child would enjoy this game. Bring back the original arcade games for TMNT and we'll 
 talk. Until then, let's not make anymore games. Their just embarissing. A renter, don't buy!

Review:  Movie-based games almost never turn out to be worth playing, and TMNT stays true to this by offering 
 up a useless title that does nothing but promote the series in a boring, repetitive way. For those 
 of you who don't know by now, TMNT stands for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and this game is exactly 
 about that. You will play as all four turtles and basically all four of them are exactly the same 
 as eachother, besides a few special moves .
  
  The story line is basically the same as the movie except for a few little details and it's told 
 through each different characters perspectives throughout this short story. Nothing special here, 
 and if you haven't seen the movie you will still need to see it after playing because alot of the 
 scenes are way different than they are in the movie. That's basically how all movie games are anyway 
 so theres no suprise here. Gameplay wise is the true reason why this game fails, and it's a shame 
 because when you play you will see that there is alot of potential left untouched. There are three 
 different things to do throughout the game and they come at almost the exact same order each time. 
 First off, you will have to run and jump to get to the next area of enemys. Suprisingly, this is 
 where the game truely shines. The platforming allows you to do some great ninja-esque moves, allows 
 you to be stealthy, lets you wall climb, wall-walk, jump from wall to wall sort of mario-esque 
 and it all feels fluent. It's pretty fun to perform all of the various runs and jumps and it's 
 really the best part of the game. IF the combat would have faired better, this game would have 
 scored alot higher. Once you finally get to the next set of enemys, the game becomes boring, down-right 
 stupid and very repetitive. There are only two ways to attack, to constantly swing the wii-mote 
 to watch your character attack for you, or to shake the nunchuck and perform a spinning kick. Other 
 than that all you can do is an occasional special or brother move and those barely last for more 
 than a few seconds. Your arm will get very tired and you will get frustrated and doing nothing 
 but swinging the wii-mote over and over again. I don't see how you can mess up a game ALL ABOUT 
 NINJA'S and give it horrible, brain-dead combat. The third thing you get to do in this game is 
 fight bosses and well, it's the exact same way as fighting regular enemys except for the fact that 
 the thing your fighting now has a health bar. Whatever challenge that might have been here was 
 stripped away because it's impossible to die and get a gameover because each time a turtle loses 
 all his health, guess what you have to do to revive him... you gotta SWING THE WII-MOTE! Imagine 
 that... Now that you know that you can't die unless you fall off an edge (which is rare) you might 
 be wondering if theres any difficulty at all. I'll answer this simply... no there isn't. You will 
 never get lost because if you need to climb a wall, it glows red. If you need to walk straight 
 and then turn, there is some indication of this in the ground. There is never a time you will get 
 stuck, or lost and you can't die in combat so all you have to do is put up with horrible combat 
 and it's difficult to actually sit through this. Graphically, the game sucks as well. It doesn't 
 even look as good as Gamecube games do and most of the objects, characters, enemys, weapons or 
 anything at all look blurry and down-right bad. This game is just a step-above playstation graphics 
 and that's just no acceptable these days. The Wii isn't built for graphics but we KNOW that it 
 can handle WAY better than this. Sound wise, it's just as bad as the rest of the game. 9/10'th 
 of the time, enemys don't make a sound when you hit them, which makes no sense one way or the other. 
 The same sound effects are used over and over and the characters all say the same lines over and 
 over as well. The voice-acting is alright considering they used the actors from the movie or people 
 that sounded REALLY close them. Mainly mindless-rock music is played in the background or just 
 nothing at all. There are a few extras you can unlock in the game by collecting the turtle-coins 
 that are NEVER hidden in any of the stages, such as artwork, scenes from the movie and so on. You 
 will also unlock minigames if you do well in the stages and you can also use the shells you collect 
 to purchase cheats . None of the cheats do anything major to the game but they can be comical sometimes. 
 The mini-games range from pointless to broken and you wont try them more than once unless you are 
 really, really bored.
  
  Overall, the TMNT game on the Wii is the worst game I've played on the system and is down right 
 a chore to play. I wouldn't even reccomend fans of the movie to play this, even little children 
 will have a hard time liking this game. If you have any respect for the turtles, stay far away 
 from this title... very far away...

Review:  I won't lie if you're not a Turtle fan you're not going to like this game, but with that said this 
 game is a good platformer not great but, good. The combat controls sometimes give a bit of trouble 
 but, not too much that you will dislike the controls alltogether. The team moves and team jumps 
 work well. The characters look good and the voiceovers are good. Each turtle has a special power 
 which you'll need to use to get through parts of the game. Mikey can temporally fly by using his 
 nunchucks as a helicopter, Raph can climb steep walls with his sais, Leo can past through certain 
 gates, and donny can use his bo as a pole vault. Which is good when you don't have room to make 
 the jump because of a low ceiling. The game also has an autosave feature which is good when you 
 reach a difficult part because you can leave the game, come back a few hours and be at that part, 
 instead of having to get back to that part of the mission. This is what of the best Teenage Mutant 
 Ninja Turtles games in recent years. So if you like the Turtles get this game.

Review:  Again, a game that I really disagree with the GS on. I really really love the TMNT and in the past 
 I have neglected to reveiw the games because my opinion would be rather biased. However, with the 
 new TMNT game for the Wii, I finally think that they almost got it right. First off, making the 
 game a platformer was a genius move. The previous Konami games have been very tired repetative 
 beat-em-ups that failed to successfully incorporate platform elements in them. This game is a great 
 platformer with simple/fun wii controls and very brain-dead enemies. This is the only game I have 
 played that you could probably run around during a fight sequence and not attack any one and never 
 actually get hit because of the slow response time of the enemies. That is really the only thing 
 inherently wrong with the game. The combat engine works well (though a few more combos would have 
 helped greatly) and the sound and voice acting is spot on and not too repetative. The platforming 
 is easy yet satisfying, and at no point gets frustrating (no matter what the other reveiwers say 
 **cough** Alex Navarro **cough**) The bosses are fun and challenging and the story fits the movie 
 well (even though it does deviate from the main story alot.) Again, its not amazing, but it is 
 certainly better than any TMNT game since the 16 era. Hopefully Ubisoft has a chance to make another 
 IE the movie's potential sequel. Most of the time I agree with you Gamespot, but I think you got 
 this one wrong.

Review:  This game has one thing involved and that is jumping. There is little to this game in the way of 
 7th Gen quality, and level of gameplay.
  
  TMNT is a average kids game with very little in range of style. You start of with Leonardo running 
 around some South American mountain range trying to get some medelion that Splinter left there 
 some years ago. After beating up the bad guys and becoming the newest Hero of the villiage you 
 find out that it has been years since the Turtles have been together and gone their own ways over 
 the last couple of years. After playing a narratored mission with every Turtle they all come back 
 together and form their new family bond, and that is in such the meaning of the game from now on 
 in. You complete missions using all four Turtles whilst getting aid from the other when it is needed.
 
  
  The game is full of little tiny bugs that just gets under your skin, ranging from luckluster graphics 
 to a control system that is going to cause carpal tunnel syndrome. The Wii Control gets extremely 
 annoying as you in sense are waving your arms like a mad man. The game is another Ubisoft rushed 
 game and one that is killing the Wii as a console.

Review:  you know i am all for innovation and fun gameplay. i put this game in and graphically -- its ok-nothing 
 to do cart wheels or back flips over -- then we get to the sound -- which also is just typical nothing 
 major.. then the game play -- within 15 minutes of playing this game your hands are tired and wrists 
 are aching for some bengay. i went through level 1 fast and it says i need to speed up -- got a b 
 score -- which scores in a game are so old school... and then you are waving your arems around like 
 a madman trying to get this guy hit him and then another and another and all of a sudden you see 
 yourself playing like an idiot trying to get through these levels -- i am greatful for game tental 
 places as i know there are several people that bought this game andwished they never chunked out 
 50 bucks for worthless pieces of crap like this.. the wii is a neat system-i played zelda and kind 
 of enjoyed it but other than that i never found any other games i like for this system

Review:  For me, I have a 7 year old girl, and two boys ages 5 and 3. My 5 year old boy was the most excited, 
 having played Turtles 2 and 3 Battle Nexus until we were blue in the face, even beating the 2nd 
 one as a family. While although the last two TMNT games weren't the greatest games of all time, 
 they at least had a few elements of fun for my kids which the new TMNT game lacks. 1) Battle Nexus 
 2 and 3 had multiplayer, one of the key features my kids love in a turtles game. My kids especially 
 love having my wife and I join in and we play as all four turtles on a quest to save the world. 
 Even though the first turtles game for the PS2, GC, and XBOX only had a two player co-op and not 
 a 4 player co-op mode, it still at least had a co-op mode. TMNT doesn't even have a 2 player mode, 
 which was VERY disappointing fo rmy kids.
  
  On a side note, the Prince of Persia style probably couldn't be done too well as a 2-4 player game, 
 but if you're going to do a one player game of TMNT you had better make it one hell of a game to 
 justify not being able to have up to 4 people playing all four turtles. The least they could have 
 done is given some multi-player modes or levels or SOMETHING so that my kids don't have to keep 
 switching off the controller.
  
  2) The Battle Nexus games had animated cutscenes to look forward to. My wife even enjoyed completing 
 episodes or sections so we could find out what happened next. In a sense, we were almost playing 
 the game more for the story at times. Plus, being a cartoon it really gave the kids something fun 
 to look forward to, even my 3 year old would sit and watch the cutscenes because it was like watching 
 a cartoon.
  
  With TMNT, my son was really excited in thinking that it would have clips from the movie like most 
 games based on a movie do. He's really excited to go to the movie on 3/24, so playing the game 
 for the cutscenes could have been something really worth while. As it is, my kids don't even car 
 to watch the cutscenes in TMNT because... well... it's just bland. There's no animation, there's 
 no CGI, it's just comic bookish images that aren't even real good. I mean heck, at least Battle 
 Nexus had animation. TMNT just looks like they were seriously lazy just to get a quick title out.
 
  
  3) We rented the game for the Wii, mostly because I had the four Wii Remotes and thought it would 
 have a multi-player mode. For me, I actually don't mind having to swing the remote to do the attacks 
 since if I had a controller, the combat would be dryer than the deserts of Arizona. But for my 
 kids, the combat with the Wii Remote and Nunchuck is cumbersome and difficult. They always pass 
 the controller to me when a fight scene happens because it's too frustrating.
  
  Give granted, the game says 10+, so maybe a kid that's a bit older might have an easier time, but 
 if you are like me and have kids under 10 that love the Ninja Turtles and want to play the games, 
 then the Wii version may not be the best one to get for them.
  
  Visually, the game looks great and the platforming parts are a step in a good direction. My kids 
 had fun doing the first level because there was a lot of aerobatic moves to get from one area to 
 another. It seems like that is their favorite part, and they really just dislike the combat (which 
 used to be their favorite part in the other games) . I think for kids under 10, they may have an 
 easier time with the PS2 or 360 version which is what I'm going to try next. In closing, the TMNT 
 game is a bit of a disappointment. If they're going to do a 1 player, they could have done a better 
 job with the style and given multi-player modes or something. My kids don't like playing it as 
 much because they have to keep switching out the controller, and the combat on the Wii is too difficult. 
 Again, they may be likely to enjoy a different console version of the game, but I would never fork 
 out more than $20 on this game, if even that. It's just not worth it.

Review:  gosh never seen such dumb fighting enemies. just boring dont know why game companies make such 
 games. dont know how they make money off from games like this. if the game was made right could 
 be a lot of fun. the graphics look like a ps1 title. sounds are weak. just a boring game. comes 
 to a point here the wii i only have a few titles for the system. makes me wonder if nintendo can 
 keep up pace. i have wii sports wii play madden football. mamma cook off game. i think the game 
 companies are in a rush to get games out but we suffer for it. with these half baked games. TMNT 
 game is just awful not even worth a rent in my view. and when the game frist starts off you are 
 climbing up this mountain to reach some temple. i did not think i could make it due to being so 
 bord with the game. so so sad thanks
