:::Review:::
Rebel Raiders takes dull, mindless air combat action into the danger zone. 

  When it was first released for the PlayStation 2 and PC in early 2006, Rebel Raiders: Operation 
 Nighthawk was already way behind the times -- a simple, unimpressive air combat game that did nothing 
 to stand out from the pack. The intervening years have not been kind, and the game is even less 
 impressive today. Its recent release on the Wii is best ignored.  

  The story, like everything about Rebel Raiders, is generic and disposable. In the near future, 
 a corrupt conglomeration of countries called the Union of World Nations is taking over the planet. 
 As the reckless Ghost Leader, a pilot for a band of rebels called the Alliance of Independent States, 
 you'll take on the UWN's fighters in battle and repeatedly disobey direct orders and endanger your 
 own safety to blow up more of the UWN's stuff.  

           This game is okay for the first few minutes. Then you remember you're not playing it in 
 an arcade circa 1989.      

  The action is mindlessly simple. You steer your plane with the Nunchuk, tilting it up or down to 
 climb or dive, twisting it left or right to turn, and using buttons on the Nunchuk and remote to 
 fire your weapons and switch between your three speeds: slow, fast, and very fast. This control 
 scheme works fine, providing all of the responsiveness that the gameplay requires. Most of the 
 time, your chief concern is shooting down enemy fighters. The dogfighting gets old very fast, given 
 that you're always the hunter and never the hunted. The enemy jets always seem to be flying away 
 from you. You just line them up in your sights, let loose with your machine guns or a barrage of 
 your unlimited missiles, and watch them burn. This kind of straightforward, arcade-style destruction 
 can be an entertaining diversion for a few minutes, but before long it becomes painfully repetitive. 
 And the enemy poses very little threat. Sure, once in a while a missile comes up on your tail, 
 but these can always be shaken off by performing a barrel roll with a quick flick of the thumbstick. 
 It's simple, easy, and dull.  

  There are other targets to take down in the game's missions, but they're equally simple and quickly 
 become as routine and boring as the enemy fighter jets. For instance, there are larger bombers 
 that fly around in lazy circular patterns, firing at you with a predictable, easily avoided rhythm. 
 And defeating the larger capital ships is a simple matter of destroying a number of small targets 
 on their hulls with your guns. There's disappointingly little to it.  

  Unfortunately, you're usually not sent into the fray alone. You'll wish you were, considering that 
 your squadmates are more of a liability than an asset. You have no way of issuing commands to them, 
 so they'll just fly around and do their thing, which typically isn't much of anything except occasionally 
 getting shot at, and even shot down. Apparently nobody bothered to tell them that they can evade 
 enemy missile attacks by doing a barrel roll. This is a problem because if all of your squadmates 
 are shot down, it's game over. Consequently, you might sometimes find yourself babysitting them, 
 which is even more boring than flying around and taking out the enemy at your leisure.  

  For a game about fighter jets, Rebel Raiders doesn't give you much freedom. There's an oddly low 
 artificial ceiling to the environments that keeps you from getting very far from the ground. As 
 a result, you'll often find yourself in danger of colliding with the side of a mountain. Not to 
 worry, though. This results only in you thudding off of the landscape in a cloud of dust, losing 
 just a few points off of your shield. It's almost comical. And even when you're going full throttle, 
 the action feels quite slow. Rather than delivering a sense of pulse-pounding combat at hundreds 
 of miles per hour, there's an almost lackadaisical feeling to bringing your plane looping around 
 to target and destroy yet another enemy fighter.  

           At least the water looks nice.      

  The campaign can easily be completed in about 
 five hours or so, and that's including a nasty trick that the game pulls to artificially extend 
 its duration. At times, you'll need to complete a special challenge mission to unlock the next 
 story mission. Challenges have you replaying missions that you've already completed, but with special 
 requirements tacked on, such as time limits or certain weapons being unavailable. The missions 
 aren't much fun to complete the first time around, so this requirement to complete some of them 
 a second time feels cheap.  

  Unsurprisingly, Rebel Raiders looks a few years old. There are a few eye-catching aspects to the 
 presentation, such as the deep blues of the ocean and the rich purples of the sky at dusk, but 
 the terrain is pretty featureless, the planes are unimpressive, and capital ships have a boxy, 
 uninspired design. However, the action does keep moving at a steady clip, even when the screen 
 is filled with aircraft. The sound is as unremarkable as the graphics. The music and sound effects 
 are generic, and the voice chatter between Ghost Leader and his squadmates is totally scripted, 
 repeating identically each time you play a level, so it doesn't lend any sense of life or spontaneity 
 to the action.  

  Rebel Raiders is a barebones package with no multiplayer or anything else to lend it any lasting 
 value. There are a decent number of unlockable planes, but they're all minor variations on four 
 basic types and have no significant impact on the gameplay. If you're looking for some air combat 
 on the Wii, you'll be better served by picking up one of the marginally superior games in the genre. 
 This one should have stayed in 2006.
