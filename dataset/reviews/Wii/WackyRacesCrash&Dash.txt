:::Review:::
Stripped-down controls with little punishment for crashing make Wacky Races an extremely boring 
 racer. 

  Performance-boosting items have been a staple in mascot racing games for some time, but these arcade 
 experiences usually encompass some sort of racing structure as well. This is not true with Wacky 
 Races. You won't find a button for acceleration or brakes here -- and don't even think about powersliding. 
 This game requires only slightly more interaction than the 40-year-old cartoon on which it's based. 
 The presentation will give a nostalgic glow to anyone who remembers the Hanna-Barbera series, but 
 the actual gameplay will only produce aching wrists and elaborate yawns.  

  Instead of using skill or savvy to make your way to the front of the pack, you need only tilt the 
 analog stick toward the finish line and watch your chosen hero cruise to victory. The majority 
 of races are displayed from a side view, though the camera shifts to a vertical orientation when 
 the track design demands it, and the camera is zoomed out just far enough to fit all 10 racers 
 in a tightly competitive ball. If you happen to run into a tree or fall off a bridge, you are placed 
 at the back. Because the screen scrolls regardless of your progress, this means you'll never be 
 more than a second out of first place.  

           Recruiting dragons to help you makes racing even easier.      

  Though the track is 
 littered with character-specific items, you won't even need to use them to win. It's certainly 
 more dramatic to call in help from a dragon or transform your vehicle into a rolling rock ball, 
 but because the track design is so easy to navigate, you'll find it's possible to snatch the victory 
 crown without ever getting help from the items. If you do choose to use items, your wrist will 
 start to throb in only a few races. Most of the items are activated by rapidly swinging the Wii 
 Remote, an action that proves tiring because results are measured simply by how fast you can flail 
 your arm.  

  If slowly navigating your way through poorly designed tracks doesn't excite you, you also have 
 to compete in minigames during certain segments of the race. Dick Dastardly sets up roadblocks 
 that can hinder your progress if you fall asleep midrace. These alternate between insultingly easy 
 and completely unresponsive. On the easy side, you have to dodge slowly falling boulders by tilting 
 the analog stick. On the unresponsive side, you have to paddle down a river using motion controls. 
 Oftentimes, the game will not recognize your downward thrust, which means you will invariably smash 
 into a large water boulder. The penalty for failing a minigame is slight, so there is almost no 
 reason to take part in these mindless diversions.  

  The only portion of Wacky Races that you'll have to actually pay attention to is the final sprint 
 to the finish line. Regardless of how well you performed leading up to this point, the racers are 
 all tightly packed as they head to the end of the race. Here, you'll have to frantically shake 
 the Wii Remote to outpace your competitors. This is an exceptionally awful game mechanic. Not only 
 does it make the proceeding portions completely irrelevant, but it's also tiring and mindless. 
 Races usually end in a virtual tie, so you'll need a snapshot to see which character was able to 
 win by a millimeter. It is nice being able to win a race even if you had some bad luck in the early 
 goings, but this design decision makes the vast majority of your racing experience worthless.  
 

           Another photo finish!      

  The visuals, at least, closely mirror the cartoons on which this game is based. The characters 
 aren't very detailed, but they are full of vibrant colors, and it's easy to identify your favorite 
 racer. The sound is true to the source material; the music is appropriately happy and the sound 
 effects do justice to the silly items. There is also a commentator who calls out all the important 
 developments in a race. He gets repetitive after a while, but he adds a bit of flair to the dreary 
 gameplay.  

  Wacky Races is just too simple for its own good. The dearth of skill needed to win races makes 
 this game tiresome, especially when you realize how little your input actually affects the outcome. 
 Even with friends, this becomes boring long before you finish the first track. An accurate representation 
 of the cartoon will only give you a short burst of happy nostalgia before the crushingly dull gameplay 
 squashes your fond memories. There is no reason to play this game.

Review:  Man, I loved Wacky Races when I was a child, and also I had a game of the Wacky Races on the Playstation, 
 it was a traditional racer, with good gameplay and very fun to play. Now, we have Wacky Races: 
 Crash and Dash for the Wii that doesnt have an accelerate or brake button and it's really boring 
 to play. Why didn't make this game like any other racing game? You know, in a third person perspective 
 and with an accelerate button. You only use the nunchuk to move the car and press A to use the 
 item and that's all, you don't even have to use the items because the game is really easy, because 
 the screen keeps scrolling so if you fall down or run into something you get back. During the race, 
 there are some minigames that really fell annoying where Dick Dastardly place some traps, these 
 minigames are also really easy. In the final part of the race you have to keep shaking the wiimote, 
 that it's really tiring and it's the only interesting part of the races. I keep me asking why didn't 
 they do the wii version like the psone version, that was a really fun racer. The graphics are nice 
 with lots of colors and keeps the essence of the cartoon, but that does'nt save Wacky Races from 
 being a really boring racing game that has no replay value.
