:::Review:::
Even though it suffers from technical flaws, The House of the Dead: Overkill offers tons of entertainment 
 with plenty of style. 

  From the moment you turn on The House of the Dead: Overkill, it's obvious that things are a little 
 bit different than they used to be. Developer Headstrong Games has crafted a grimier, grungier, 
 grainier game that from the ground up embraces its inherent cheesiness yet still pays homage to 
 its predecessors. Overkill reinvents the aging shooter series for the better with an over-the-top 
 grindhouse theme that resonates in its every aspect, from the hilarious story to the fantastic 
 vintage soundtrack.  

  When rookie AMS Special Agent G, who originally appeared in the first House of the Dead game of 
 which Overkill is a prequel to, is forced to team up with loudmouthed ladies' man Isaac Washington, 
 a Bayou City detective on a quest for revenge, blood, brains, and bodies fly. The two curse and 
 shoot their way through endless zombies -- we mean mutants -- as they chase after nefarious crime lord 
 Papa Caesar, the man responsible for the outbreak. Along the way, you'll encounter the aptly named 
 Varla Guns, an ex-stripper with her own vendetta against the sinister villain, and blast your way 
 through wave after wave of hilarious and terrifying mutants, including hobos, football players, 
 rednecks, backflipping clowns, nurses, and more.  

           Mutant clowns are pretty much the most frightening thing ever.      

  As is typical 
 with light-gun games, the action is entirely on rails, so you don't have any real control over 
 your path through the mutant-infested backwaters of Bayou City. You do, however, have some peripheral 
 vision if you move your crosshairs near the edge of the screen, which helps you to pick up power-ups 
 like grenades, health kits, golden brain collectibles, and the coveted "slow mo-fo mode," which 
 slows time down to a crawl for maximum carnage. Each of the linear missions takes place in a specific 
 set piece that has been cast in the grindhouse theme, from hospitals to carnivals to plantation 
 houses, and at the end of each you'll duke it out with a freakishly large supermutant in a battle 
 to the death. Throughout the game, you'll be treated to the hilarious hijinks of the at-odds duo 
 of mutant mutilators G and Washington in the intentionally poorly edited cutscenes that bookmark 
 each mission.  

  The degree of difficulty ranges from level to level but is more often than not ridiculously easy, 
 especially if you've got the help of a friend thanks to the two-player co-op mode, which is very 
 nicely set up so that a partner can join at any time. Most enemies fall to your firepower in only 
 a few shots, and even the bosses are huge pushovers once you learn their simple and predictable 
 patterns. Thankfully, there is plenty more to do than shoot mutants: You can purchase or upgrade 
 weapons for more firepower or variety by spending the hard-earned cash from your missions, you 
 can play three minigames that support up to four players, and you can earn a number of achievements 
 by performing feats such as completing a mission with an accuracy rating of over 70 percent to 
 unlock new bonuses like concept art. You can even unlock director's cut versions of all of the 
 levels, which are made longer by restoring "previously deleted scenes" and made more difficult 
 by including larger quantities of (slightly) more durable enemies and limiting the number of continues. 

  Overkill features one of the best game soundtracks in recent years, and each mission has fantastic 
 vintage-style themes, with guitar riffs that will stick with you long after you've set your Wii 
 Remote down. Even better special remixes of the in-game songs are unlocked by completing missions, 
 further endearing Overkill's tunes into your heart. The voice acting is equally top-notch, and 
 every character is fun and memorable, especially the overly dramatic narrator and Isaac Washington, 
 who drops an F-bomb almost every other word. Though the frequency of the swearing may be a potential 
 deal-breaker for some, it fits well into the overall theme of the game and adds more to the experience 
 than it detracts from it.  

           PROTIP: To defeat the boss, shoot at it in the red circle until it dies.      

  The 
 House of the Dead: Overkill shines as one of the best-looking games on the Wii thanks to its frequent 
 and expert use of motion blur and grainy filters and its stylistic color palette. Mutants can also 
 be shot to pieces and their limbs will fall or fly realistically, raising the gore factor and increasing 
 the fun. Unfortunately, its wildly inconsistent frame rate puts a serious damper on the action, 
 and less significant but still frustrating issues like mutant pop-in and clipping occur all the 
 time. There's also the occasional AI glitch to contend with as enemies sometimes get stuck on walls 
 or other terrain.  

  Ultimately, The House of the Dead: Overkill is a breath of fresh air in a well-trod genre. It's 
 incredibly fun and entertaining despite its shortcomings. With a hilarious cast of heroes and villains, 
 brilliant writing and voice acting, and some of the best visuals available on the system, Overkill 
 is one game that no hardcore Wii and a penchant for over-the-top amounts of gore and swearing should 
 miss.

Review:  Had to take over my friends Wii again for a night and we played thru HOD. Pretty short game and 
 most could finish it in about 3 hours, the other 4 days on the rental it just sat on my desk. 
 
  
  I always enjoyed the HOD arcade gun games in the past and think this was probably the best I played. 
 Only thing I didn't like is the game would glitch and no zombies would appear and the game would 
 just sorta stop. Then we would have to restart the level.
  
  I thought it was pretty over the top with the Grindhouse like story and the swearing. I think that 
 has to be the most swearing I have ever heard in a game and it's a Wii game, ha! Also the ending 
 is just wrong Me and my friend at the end just looked at each other and said what the f@#k?
  
  Great game for a rent and who knows maybe a game to pick up if cheap. Still considering buying 
 that Wii

Review:  House of the Dead OverKill is more of an 80's gross out film than a videogame. At least it trys 
 to be. The language, gore, and story are unbelievably over the top and graphic. To many gamers 
 this may be seen as a high point, but after awhile it actually becomes annoying.
  
  Before I go on, let me first say that I'm not a sensitive gamer that is affected by gore and language. 
 I've played them all, and I was a Marine for goodness sake! Still, this game goes so far as to 
 make it's graphic nature an irritation. Spoiler Warning next sentence! When some dude crawls inside 
 the vagina of his giant mother and snuggles up, you know it's gone too far. Anyway some gamers 
 will probably find that awesome.
  
  HOD: Overkill itself is an excellent lightgun when it comes down to the gameplay. It feels exactly 
 like you're playing in an arcade. It's far and away the best light gun on Wii. The only thing that 
 comes close is the Arcade mode in Medal of Honor: Heroes 2. 
  
  While the light gun aspect may be great, the game is too easy. If you die you can leave right where 
 you left off. The only punishment is that you lose points, which you won't care about anyway. This 
 makes the game beatable by anyone who plays it. I for one, am not a fan of that. 
  
  The other big downer for this game is the extremely short gameplay. You can beat the game in two 
 sittings. At a new price of $49.99, unless you have the money to blow, this is definitely a rental 
 and nothing more.
  
  There is some replay value. Once you beat the game you unlock a Director's Cut Mode. Unless you're 
 a huge light gun fan like myself, this won't pose any interest for you. You'll most likely beat 
 the game and then put it back on the shelf forever.
  
  In closing there is a lot that HOD: Overkill has got going for it. There's just not enough for 
 it to get a great rating. Still though if you're not offended easily and want a great light gun, 
 this is the perfect rental for you.

Review:  The Good: Super fun gory shooting, crude and rude dialog, fun loving characters, hilarious story, 
 excellent replay value, not frustrating, fun boss fights
  
  The Bad: Too few levels, may be too easy for some, everything an M rated game has except nudity, 
 no online play
  
  *claps* Yessss thank you THANK you Sega for making, one of the few, mature rated games for us adults 
 out there... THANK you. House of the Dead: Overkill plays more on the great HotD series that starting 
 back in the early 90's in the arcades. You play as Agent G with his foul mouthed partner Isaac 
 Washington (yes he's black!) as you figure out why zombies are plaguing the US. While the story 
 is hilarious, vulgar, rude, and completely dirty there's tons of funny voice acting and dialog 
 to enjoy. The characters are played out very well and you get pretty attached early on (there's 
 only about 8 levels or so) along with the major hottie Varla Gunns.
  
  The game plays like a typical on rails FPS where the game controls where you move and you just 
 worry about shooting. The game has many locales from jails, to hospitals, to swamps, to theme parks 
 so you won't get bored one little bit. There are many guns to buy and upgrade along with some great 
 unlockables for beating the game. While you wondering through levels there are a few temp upgrades 
 you can shoot (I wish there were more) , such as health, grenades, green blobs that slow down time 
 for a little while, and gold brains. Yes, collect all these brains and you unlock artwork, videos, 
 etc. Now upgrading your weapons is mandatory such as less recoil, clip size, damage, the whole 
 nine yards. You can have up to two weapons equipped and switching back and forth between these 
 two is a great strategy when you have too many zombies to deal with. You start off the game with 
 a pistol and if you save up your money (more on how later) you can buy more weapons. Buying a shotgun 
 first is great since you use all your rounds to clear most of the zombies out and then switch to 
 your pistol to finish off stubborn stragglers.
  
  One great thing about OK is that it NEVER gets too frustrating. When you die you start off right 
 where you were with no continues... of course you take a score hit, but people who don't care about 
 this won't break their Wiimotes in anger. The levels are just the right length taking about 10-15 
 minutes to complete with super fun boss fights. Each boss will have their weak point circled in 
 red and all you have to do is shoot whatever projectile they fire at you and keep on them. The 
 bosses are disgusting, grotesque, and very funny looking. You're probably all this is great, but 
 there's more!
  
  MULTIPLAYER MAN!! That's the best ever... while it's the same as single player having someone help 
 you can always be fun. Now, if you beat the game you get the director's cut (I won't say what it 
 is!!) along with being able to dual wield weapons... yes it's sweet, super fun, and adds lots of 
 replay value. Wouldn't that make the game too easy you say? Well use the "Extra Mutants" tweak 
 before each level and you have an extra challenge. Sadly, there is no online play, but hopefully 
 a future HotD will have it. I HIGHLY recommend this super fun game to any adult who has dust collecting 
 on their Wii.

Review:  This game is great. It is the first on rails shooter I have ever played to completion. It is also 
 the first on rails shooter I bought ... so the previous statement is not that surprising.
  
  Firstly, I have not had any of the framerate issues that are lamented in some reviews. I have 
 had the loading / jerking thing but it is barely noticeable. That said i have only recently unlocked 
 the directors cut so... it might still happen.
  
  So what is there to say. Well the graphics are decent... not great, but acceptable. Let's face 
 it, the enemies are there to be blown away, and because the game is simple it isn't likely they 
 are going to be on screen too long. Since i started playing this game i also played Umbrella Chronicles 
 and there is a world of difference there, with UC being much more brown while HotDOK is much more 
 lively in palette.
  
  The soundtrack is great. It is so good in fact i would buy it. More for the hilarity than for the 
 musical talent (although that should not be underestimated ... it just isn't my genre of preference) .
 
  
  Voice acting is fantastic. There is a lot of swearing and for the most part the Vincent and Jules 
 vibe from Pulp Fiction is just there. Art style is also great: the game has a filter which makes 
 the action look like an old B / C grade film, which 1 suites the premise and 2 is just classy. 
 Overall this is similar to MadWorld's Noir / Comic aim and just like it, HotDOK succeeds. Example: 
 first bossfight ... before Jasper becomes a mutant Papa Cesar slaps him, camera cuts to flying 
 glasses and cuts back to Jasper ... who's wearing glasses. There are a few other similar continuity 
 issues like that which just add to the feel that those movies evoke.
  
  Controls ... good, but to be honest the huge crosshairs can obscure the action. There are limitations 
 to what the Wiimote's can do but overall once it is calibrated, it is all good.
  
  Story ... out there, disturbing and ... wrong. Perfect for the game, perfect for what the game/movie 
 wants to emulate. Totally inappropriate for the in-laws :) . 
  
  Look, this game is not without flaws. It isn't GTA (which personally i don't like ... but ... it 
 doesn't break new ground) or Sims. It's a well executed shooter that's loads of fun and excellent 
 for playing two player or on your own. It is probably the most mature game i've played on the wii 
 (as in it features gore, not as in adults will like this) . That said, the swearing may get a bit 
 much. There are loads of extra's and enough to keep you going for a fair while.

Review:  Are you a Wii owner without any "grown-up" games to play? Well guess what, mother******? You've 
 got yourself a game, mother******. I've always loved House Of The Dead (and especially "Typing 
 Of The Dead"!) , so I knew I was expecting a rail shooter...
  
  So... Ermm... Yes, it's a rail shooter. BUT! HOTD : Overkill isn't your average shooter by any 
 means. For the record, it must be the first Wii game ever to feature swearing. And semi-sexual 
 content. And zombies. Oh man, are there some zombies or what. You're staring at the screen. Empty, 
 abandoned house. Suddenly the camera changes it's angle, and you're greeted by a handful of zombies. 
 Aim for the head! That's where they die the easiest.
  
  So the entire game is a rail shooter. What's new? I'll tell you : Most of it! HOTD : Overkill's 
 graphics are intentionally blurred and "oldschooled" to make it look like a cheesy 80's horror 
 flick, just like "Planet Terror" was. HOTD : Overkill actually has a plot that lasts longer than 
 10 seconds of sucky CGI! All that flickering and cheesy voiceovers.
  
  Agent G, our trustworthy companion throughout the series has a black partner this time, and I think 
 99,9% of you would compare him to Samuel Jackson (with his mother****ing language) . Yes, be prepared... 
 50% of the dialogue is filled with "f-words". Mother****er this and ****ing that. "But I thought 
 it was a Wii game?" - You bet your a** it is. It's the first Wii game to exploit such an innumerable 
 amount of filthy language and gore. All the cutscenes are filled with obscenities, and during the 
 latter parts of the game, also with some highly questionable plotlines almost completely stolen 
 from Peter Jackson's "Braindead". Or that's at least what I had in mind. Seriously, especially 
 the latter parts of the game, the cutscenes are DISTURBING.
  
  You've got your typical arsenal, as you start with a pistol, and the better you score in a stage, 
 the more money you have to spend on better firepower. Like I said, you start with the pistol, but 
 you can revisit the first stages with the final weapons of the game whenever you please, making 
 the stage damn easy to beat. But it's kinda cool, even if you're unbeatable with your maxed out 
 automatic shotgun and stuff.
  
  BUT! The game has several flaws to it, unfortunately. The framerate is almost constantly low, which 
 makes the aiming in sudden situations pretty hard. Also the game makes almost complete freezes 
 for a second or a half during some loading scenes... You'll surely miss some zombies there. And 
 I accidentally found a bug that seriously slows the game down... (Hint : Don't pause the game using 
 the "Home" button of your Wiimote or you could end up with black zombie blood and half the framerate.)
 
  
  Also, another complaint... The bosses. In my opinion, they're way too easy, if you're not counting 
 the last one. The game even shows you the "weak spots" of every boss, so there really isn't any 
 thinking to do.
  
  Despite the flaws and the sub-standard graphics (come on, if this was released on PS2, the cutscenes 
 would still look amazingly outdated) , HOTD : Overkill is definitely something different to all 
 Wii gamers in the world. Gore, guts, curses, black humour... Ain't that what you all were waiting 
 for? I'm loving it! Definitely the best in series.

Review:  Remember the old days where you would pump $10 or more in quarters into the local arcade's "House 
 of the Dead?" Well now you can pump $50 into the register of your nearest video game retailer and 
 have endless fun by yourself, or with a friend.
  
  From the side splitting cheesy jokes and the hilarious sound track, to the never ending vulgar 
 language of the characters, this game keeps your ears erupting with comedic confetti. Imagine your 
 drunk uncle Chuck writing the entire script, after 2 fifths of jack, It only gets old if you let 
 it. I give audio a 10.
  
  Game play can be a bit laggy at times, but it seems to fit in with the "grind house" type of on 
 screen presentation. You start off with a regular handgun, but with precision you can quickly rack 
 up the cash to buy yourself a fancy shotgun to a fully automatic assault riffle. The more you complete 
 in the game by completing different tasks, the more cash you earn, and the more you can unlock, 
 which provides for a very high replay value. The game even rewards you for going gangster on the 
 mutants (holding the gun side ways) which to me is worth the laughs. Game play gets a 10. Replay 
 value 10+
  
  It would be a shame not to pick this title up because it blows all of the other arcade style shooters 
 clear out of the water.

Review:  Let me start by saying HOTD: Overkill is a fun game for what it is, but its just waaaaay too short 
 and easy in my opinion. I really wish I would've rented it before I shelled out the dough. My girlfriend 
 and I beat it in about 2 hrs. Just prepare yourself for A LOT of F-bombs, and over-the-top scenarios 
 during the cutscenes. Dont get me wrong I love profanity and over-the-top zombie movies as much 
 as the next guy, and zombie games are my favorite. Thats why I bought it (well that and the fact 
 that my Wii was deperately thirsty for some blood) but even my love for zombies, profanity, and 
 gore didn't make this worth the 50 dollar pricetag. 
  
  The gameplay is classic arcade rail shooter. The levels are broke into 7 or 8 GrindHouse like "movies". 
 ( Sort of like Left 4 Dead, but not anywhere near as cool ) At the end of each short level there 
 is a lame boss character, all of which are very easy to beat. You earn money for completing various 
 challenges during each level that you can use to buy and upgrade different guns from the Gun Shop. 
 This part of the game is cool, im not going lie. But its kinda pointless. By the time you make enough 
 money to buy the really good guns, you've already beat the game. And if you do go back through 
 with upgraged guns there is NO challenge what so ever. After you beat the regular game you unlock 
 the "Director's Cut" which is just the same thing but with fewer continues and a bit tougher enemies. 
 If you make it that far without being bored to sleep you unlock dual-wield mode after beating the 
 Director's cut.
  
  Overall, Overkill is not that bad. Its kind of like a drunk midget hooker... short, easy, and not 
 worth 50 bucks. Its worth a rent... just dont buy.

Review:  So, I've only played the first three levels of House of the Dead: Overkill, but I'm pretty sure 
 I've got the basic idea of the game. The game drops you off right from the beginning, running through 
 a run-down plantation house while shooting a seemingly endless barrage of zombies. The aiming control 
 is pretty solid, which helps when there are four or five undead coming at you at once. I shot to 
 the head will cause a nasty explosion and an instant death, while it will take a few shots to the 
 torso if you want to get rid of a guy that way. You can also shoot their limbs off, Dead Space-style, 
 which can slow them down or keep them from smacking you. There are various pick-ups to collect 
 such as a slow-mo effect that makes it really easy to get head-shots and enjoy the bloody goodness 
 of your tactical kills. Health packs and money are also scattered throughout the levels, but since 
 you are on a track it is easy to miss them without lighting-fast reflexes. The game isn't really 
 SCARY, but sometimes a zombie will start running, not shuffling, RUNNING at you screaming and that 
 kinda got me going. This is what makes the game even more fun to play with friends, because you 
 can psych each other out which makes for more screams. The story is hilarious and the game play 
 is a solid track-shooter. Is it worth $50 though? I'd say no, since I'd only want to replay each 
 level a couple of times, and there aren't too many. Wait for the price to drop, or pick it up used 
 because you definitely don't want to miss this one!

Review:  Before we get started, I'd like to give a big kudos to Sega for realizing the Wii has a hardcore, 
 mature audience as well as a family one. With games like Overkill and the upcoming MadWorld and 
 The Conduit, it's pretty obvious Sega cares about Nintendo's little white box possibly more than 
 Nintendo does. 
  
  A round of applause, please.
  
  In the capable hands of Headstrong Games (formerly Kuju Entertainment, Battalion Wars) , House of 
 the Dead has undergone a complete reboot, and the changes are definitely for the better. Overkill 
 is loud, rude, crude, and it's unabashedly entertaining. It may not be something you'll play with 
 your mum around, but it's one of the best games on the market for mature Wii owners.
  
  The year is 1991. AMS rookie Agent G has been sent in to a small Louisiana town to investigate 
 a series of disappearances. Along the way he teams up with foul-mouthed Isaac Washington and stripper 
 Varla Guns, and the trio sets off to stop the mad experiments of Papa Caesar. Overkill is presented 
 in a style similar to Quentin Tarantino's; over-the-top violence, F-bombs, and disgusting sexual 
 references are the norm. Also like with Tarantino, Overkill will make you laugh. A lot. The dialogue 
 is fast and razor-sharp, and though the swearing gets to be a bit much (f$%^ed up f$%^, really?) 
 Overkill is easily the funniest, most quotable game in years.
  
  This grindhouse style makes for one of the best audio-visual presentations on the Wii. You'll be 
 blasting mutants to all sorts of great old-school riffs, which range from funk to country to an 
 awesome homage to the Pulp Fiction theme. Many of the songs have vocals, and they're all fittingly 
 hilarious. It's too bad the vocal songs only appear on the main menu, but nevertheless this is 
 one of the best soundtracks in recent memory. The voice acting is also top-notch, from Washington's 
 Samuel L. Jackson-esque delivery to Papa Caesar's almost nonsensical accent.
  
  Plentiful film grain and motion blur effects help make Overkill one of the best-looking games on 
 Wii, too. The fixed camera allows the developers to really focus on making the game look as good 
 as possible, and the effort shows. Environments look great, and enemy animations are pretty much 
 perfect. The frame rate stutters now and again, but it doesn't stop the game from always being 
 fun to look at.
  
  It's all the perfect vessel for the game's over-the-top action. Overkill plays pretty much identical 
 to other House of the Dead games. Either playing solo or with a buddy (go with a buddy) you'll 
 plow through seven linear levels, blasting limbs and heads off mutants left right and centre. All 
 your movements are scripted, leaving you to worry about ever-approaching hoards of enemies. It's 
 not very deep, but it sure as hell is fun. You'll need quick reflexes to rack up combos to beat 
 your hi-scores or snag collectible Golden Brains. 
  
  The new gameplay feature is Slo Mo-Fo Mode, which as the name implies brings the game into slow 
 motion. Slo Mo-Fo is activated by shooting targets hidden in levels, and brings all enemies to 
 a crawl for easy headshots. The music, effects and animations all look and sound great during the 
 transition.
  
  At the end of the level you'll face off against a boss, and while these look great and are very 
 funny they're way to easy to take down. The game will tell you where and when exactly they need 
 to be shot, taking out a lot of the challenge. In fact the entire game is far too easy. You have 
 tons more health than in the arcade games, and health pickups are plentiful. You have infinite 
 continues, as long as you're willing to sacrifice half of your score. Thankfully a tougher Director's 
 Cut mode is eventually unlocked, and you always have the option to turn on Extra Mutants, but even 
 still the game is a pushover.
  
  House of the Dead: Overkill definitely has its flaws. It's easy, it's short, and it may not have 
 enough content to warrant the fifty dollar asking price. Still, Overkill is absolutely gushing 
 with style, and it's a welcome break from the endless onslaught of party games and mini-game collections 
 Wii owners are used to. Is this the hardcore you've been waiting for? In a word, yes.

Review:  Finding a shooter on the Wii that isn't terrible is like finding a needle in a big pile of haystacks. 
 Praise the gaming deities because now we have House of the Dead: Overkill. It's a shooter that's 
 very much a throwback to the old arcade shooters where you played by pointing a plastic gun at 
 the screen and your movements were entirely out of your hands. 
  
  House of the Dead: Overkill is very easy to jump into. All you'll need is the Wii remote; pointing 
 it at the screen will adjust your aim and you'll occasionally need to shake the remote to shove 
 an enemy that has grabbed you. The default aiming sensitivity is fine but you can adjust it in 
 the options menu if you wish. What's unfortunate is that you can't re-map any of the button controls; 
 for example, pressing the '1' button will switch your weapon but it's really awkward to have to 
 reach so far down the controller for such a simple action. 
  
  The gameplay is just as simple as the controls. All you'll need to do is shoot enemies that are 
 running/walking/limping/flying towards you. You'll get to use weapons like a magnum, shotgun, submachine 
 gun and assault rifle on your journey. Because of the fact that you only need the Wii remote to 
 play, this leaves your character's movements out of your hands. On-rails movement can best be described 
 as riding a roller coaster. Your path is the same every time. 
  
  Mutants are the game's most common enemy and they come in a disappointing amount of different forms. 
 There simply isn't enough variety to them. Many times there will be groups of mutants where there'll 
 be three [or more] of them with the exact same character model. Seeing five identical nurses walking 
 towards you make the experience feel a bit artificial. There are a few cases where you'll see mutants 
 that are exclusive to a level but for the most part it's the same stuff that you're shooting over 
 and over again. You'll see clowns in the carnival stage, nurses in the hospital stage and birds 
 in the mansion stage. 
  
  You'll be shooting these mutants through seven stages that are quite different in terms of the 
 way they feel and look. You play as a cop named Agent G and you'll have the misfortune of being 
 alongside a guy named Isaac Washington in your quest to track down an evil scientist named Papa 
 Caesar. You'll also meet a woman named Varla who doesn't really have a purpose other than to show 
 off her huge breasts popping out of her top. Varla is unlikable in every way -- she's very much 
 the stereotypical female video game character. 
  
  The game takes many attempts at humor in its cutscenes with mixed results. Isaac Washington's lines 
 appear to have been thought up by a parrot that just learned how to say the f word. There are some 
 genuinely funny parts in the later portion of the game but going into detail would ruin it. 
  
  The cutscenes and environments all look pretty. The gore and death animations clearly steal 
 the show in terms of eye candy, though. Dismemberments happen all the time and they result in a 
 marvelous display of blood and severed body parts. Some of the gore is exaggerated such as a body 
 exploding as you shoot it at close range with a shotgun. It doesn't make sense for a mutant's arms 
 to fall off if you shoot it in the head but it sure as hell looks great. The exaggerated gore brought 
 many laughs and big grins to my face. Those grins faded away at times, though -- you can blame the 
 frame-rate for that. There are many noticeable frame rate drops throughout the experience but the 
 game always runs at a playable speed.
  
  The sound in House of the Dead: Overkill is kind of all over the place. The developers didn't record 
 their own sound effects. I noticed some sound effects that are recycled from Youtube videos or 
 other games. In total there are two reloading sounds, one punching sound, one slashing sound, a 
 monster's roar and the magnum's shooting sound that I recognized from the sources I mentioned. 
 This might've been acceptable if Overkill was an indie game but for a whole development studio 
 to do something that lazy is inexcusable. 
  
  The game has a funk themed soundtrack that works very well with it's theme of not taking itself 
 seriously. There are plenty of catchy bass lines and funny lyrics to compliment the menus and the 
 actual gameplay. 'One night in bayou' is an especially great song that had me laughing out loud 
 several times. 
  
  It'll take about four hours to make it through the story mode in House of the Dead: Overkill. You'll 
 unlock director's cut mode which will have you playing the same levels but with different paths 
 to take. It's good enough to warrant a second play-through but it would've been better if the developers 
 had put in brand new levels rather than just using the old ones. There's no online functionality 
 of any kind but there are three mini games that you can play with up to three others. The one that 
 has you rescuing hostages is cool but the other two are just glorified target practice. 
  
  House of the Dead overkill is a game that has a negative thing for every positive thing about it. 
 The shooting is satisfying and the humor has its moments but that's brought down by the short story 
 and lack of online functionality. Playing this game is a solid way to spend a weekend but it doesn't 
 have enough legs to push it above the rental status. I can't consider it that good of a game because 
 there's so much clear cut room for improvement. It's simply too short and too flawed to make a 
 recommendable purchase. Thanks for reading.

Review:  My biggest problem with this game and not to down it but it crashes my wii. Besides that rock on!
 
  
  If you are under the age of 18, House of the Dead: Overkill is not for you. In fact, you shouldn't 
 even be reading this review. Overkill is filled with things that would not appeal to adolescents 
 LMAO, such as strippers, zombies exploding in sprays of blood, and extensive use of the words "d*ck" 
 and "f*ck." I recommend a more wholesome, but still excellent, Wii title such as Super Mario Galaxy 
 or Zack And Wiki. Have fun! 
  OK, now that it's just us adults, I can talk freely. House of the Dead: Overkill is awesome! It 
 has strippers, zombies exploding in sprays of blood, and extensive use of the words "d*ck" and 
 "f*ck!" As a parody of/tribute to grindhouse cinema, Overkill is B-movie schlock at its best. But 
 as shiny as the presentation is, the execution still leaves quite a bit to be desired. The dialogue 
 tries way too hard at times to be funny, and the characters look and move like blocks of wood. 
 But if you enjoy the over-the-top style of films like Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror, you'll 
 like this game. 
  
  House of the Dead: Overkill 'Uncensored Story' trailer
  The game looks impressive for a Wii title, and not just in the stylish menus and deliberate film-grain 
 effect during the cut-scenes. The backgrounds are well-detailed, and the zombie hordes hunting 
 you down look suitably creepy. But an inconsistent framerate bogs down the experience, causing 
 you to miss both power-ups and headshots when the screen jerks unexpectedly. That's not helped 
 by the already-imprecise Wii remote -- it feels like your cursor is constantly half a second behind 
 your movements. But my biggest problem is that in multiplayer, you and your friend's crosshairs 
 are nearly indistinguishable: One is a white cirlce, and the other is two concentric white circles. 
 Why aren't they different colors, like every previous House of the Dead game? 
  
  On the other hand, I really enjoyed the game's weapon upgrade system. After each mission, you earn 
 money that you can put toward purchasing new firearms, or upgrading the damage, reload time, etc. 
 of what you already have. There aren't many guns to choose from, but the upgrading gives you a 
 reason to play through each stage more than once other than trying to unlock concept art and background 
 music. And when you run out of ammo durning the game, you don't have to shoot off-screen to reload 
 -- your gun automattically refills when you run out of bullets, though you can always reload manually 
 by hitting the A button. 
  
  Where Overkill will truly be divisive is in the narrative: some people will love the nonsensical, 
 fast-paced story. But, with its constant stream of expletives and toilet humor, it may turn just 
 as many people away. And as purposefully offensive as it is, I still enjoyed the game. The dialogue 
 is strained, and the barrage of f-bombs is played out by the second level, but there are several 
 genuinely funny moments. For a few quick rounds of cheesy, light gun-style action, this new House 
 is one worth visiting.

Review:  I mean seriously . Only seven levels. That last for 10 minutes each if that's not a rental I 
 wonder what is. Anyway as always let's see the pros cons
  
  Pros: 
  
  -humour: the game makes up for it's short lent with it's sense of humour, agent G getting bugged 
 about what the H*** g means the whole game, detective Washington being a satire of Samuel L. Jackson 
 always saying mother fu**** and the likes, and also the grindhouse feel the game has builds up 
 a great atmosphere
  
  -b movie feeling: it be annoying at 1st but even I who doesn't like those type of movie taught 
 I was fun because it makes you feel like if you where in a movie instead of playing a video game 
 (a unrealistic movie but a movie none the less)
  
  It's sad to say so but I guess this covers all the pros for this game I mean sure it's a shooter 
 with zombies but it's nothing that has never been seen before plus it's the third on rail shooter 
 with zombies on the wii (resident evil umbrella chronicles, house of the dead 2 & 3 return and 
 then this one) so we would had expected more. Sadly there isn't anything to unique about this 
 game although I have to say that the zombie dismemberment is well done for once (not like in umbrella 
 chronicles where you have to shoot the zombie square in the middle of the forehead for it to work.)
 
  
  -Cons:
  
  Enemies: aside from the bosses the enemies are all relatively the same sure there are clown, 
 doctor, redneck, nurse, etc zombies but in the end they're all the same there are the fatter zombies 
 that take a couple more shoots the fast zombies that can grab you and the puking zombies but aside 
 from that are only zombies throwing knifes or having shields to protect themselves.
  
  Obvious weak spot: make that way too obvious weak spot  when you fight the bosses, the game highlights 
 the zone where you should shoot at the moment the weak spot is exposed I mean what isn't the sheet 
 that shows us where the said weak spot is before the fight enough?
  
  Can't die: of course it's frustrating in 2&3 return that when you die you have the restart the 
 whole game from the start but at least it gives the game a little challenge while in this one 
 not only is the difficulty reduced, but you are more life and there are even health packs and power 
 ups around all stages and as if that wasn't enough you get more health and if you should ever 
 die well by sacrificing a bit of your score you can ressurrect at the exact same spot where you 
 died so what Sega? With you it's either too hard or plain too easy?
  
  Way to short: after you finish the story there isn't anything much you can do sure you can redo 
 the integral version of the levels but it's only the same levels with a bit more exploring other 
 than that you can play mini games that are still roughly the same as the real game or you can add 
 more zombies in the levels to add more challenge, but since you are virtually immortal what's the 
 point?
  
  I guess this covers up my review of house of the dead overkill while it's a good game it lacks 
 way too much in depts
  
  And for those of you who would want an answer to the question I asked at the beginning of the review 
 I guess the game is just to easy because if you would had to restart the levels every time you 
 die i would still be stuck at the 5th level

Review:  Other reviews have gone over the game in detail, so I'll keep this short.
  
  BOTTOM LINE: 
  I like this game, and I think it's important to purchase so devs and publishers 
 see that Wii owners are willing to pay for mature, well-made games. There are some issues, but 
 nothing that severely affects enjoyment of the game. 
  HotD: Overkill is a great game to play with friends (Even your dad! Trust me! His Veteran-skills 
 came out in full force...) .
  
  The style and feel of the game are great, and the second-to-last cut-scene contains one of the 
 most inspired uses of genre-stealing that I've ever seen in a game (I actually cried, I was laughing 
 so hard, so cheers to you, Headstrong Games!) . "Goregasm" is too funny.
  
  Though the language is completely over the top ("F*CK" is as common in this game as stink in an 
 outhouse) , it really fits, in an odd way. The opening screen (with the definition of "overkill") 
 prepares the gamer for what's to come. 
  
  * [Parents: If you have any sense of responsibility, you will NOT buy this game for young kids, 
 as the cut-scenes contain material that children really shouldn't be exposed to. Teens in the house? 
 My guess is that they probably know more about sex and drugs than you do, so it really doesn't 
 matter if they play this game.] *
  
  MORE:
  (Lead-up/background: I'm a married man in his late 20's, so that's the "demographic paradigm" I'm 
 working with...)
  
  As has been stated in official reviews and elsewhere, the lag issues with the frame-rate (especially 
 when using a fully modded auto-shotgun) are very much there. The lag isn't long, and doesn't cripple 
 the flow of the game, but it can/will cause you to lose combo (seems even more in-your-face with 
 two players using the fully-modded auto-shotguns) . This doesn't really take anything away from 
 the game, but the fact that this issue is right out there in the open --and it happens ALL the 
 time -- is a big red flag for me that the devs could have cleaned house just a little bit more. 
 
  
  The bosses are TOO easy. Really. I'm not that hard-core of a light-gun gamer, and I was put off 
 by the "red circle over the weak spot" hand-holding, as well as the difficulty of the bosses, overall. 
 These bosses (though unique and interesting) don't feel very epic or "boss-like" to me because 
 they didn't represent a challenge. Even considering the frame-rate issues that have been discussed, 
 my biggest gripe is the lack of difficult bosses.
  
  The "Director's Cut" is great, and even after memorizing the enemy patterns, playing with two players 
 is fresh and fun.
  
  FINAL WORD: 
  This is a must-have game for any Wii owner that likes light-gun games and over-the-top gore/violence. 
 A worthy --if too easy -- heir to the arcade classics.

Review:  Alright, I'll be honest, I beat the game in about an hour and a half, maybe not even, but the game 
 is very fun, and I have played it through a couple of times after that. The story line is hilarious, 
 the game play is solid and incredibly easy to pick up, and allthough you might think it is repetitive... 
 when your playing it is not at all. The two main characters are hilarious, Agent G and Isaac Washington. 
 They are great at ripping on each other constantly, and helps make the game more of a Horror/Comedy. 
 I respect SEGA for trying not to make a Wii shooter a scary one, because as we all know the Wii 
 graphics suck and it would be very hard to make a scary zombie killing game without people finding 
 it really cheesy. This game is great if you have friends or whoever over as it is incredibly easy 
 to pick up. I found the game almost better with two people rather than one. To shoot press the 
 B button, to reload shake the Wii-mote or press the A button and use 1 or 2 to change weapons... 
 its that simple. The only thing i didn't like about the multiplayer was the difficulty telling 
 the cross hairs apart. Another thing I thought might have been crappy about the game was that it 
 may be repetitive, which I found was not the case at all. Although yes you are just pointing the 
 controller at the screen and shooting through the whole game, the storyline, the characters, and 
 the different scenarios make it feel like each level is whole new experience. Overall I would defiantly 
 recommend getting this game if you want a game with the feel of a classic arcade shooter, with 
 a comical story line, that is great to play again and again whether your by yourself or with friends 
 or whatever.

Review:  House of Dead first came out in the arcade followed by a second and third sequel which is also 
 available on the Wii (House of Dead one is not available now on the Wii) . This game takes a crazy 
 turn trading modern settings to the 80's settings (I hope it's the 80's) with the grainy footage.
 
  
  The Wii's strongest genre would be the shooting genre and this game is a great example and since 
 Medal of Honor Heroes 2 using the Wii Zapper. The gameplay is well thought out and unlike the arcade 
 versions where you have to save civilians to go to another path, instead it's a straightforward 
 on rails shooting game. Also with two to four players, you might seriously need them if the game 
 gets too hard but the bosses aren't that difficult to beat. However the "uncut" version requires 
 you to be very fast with reflexes and both cut and uncut versions allows you to upgrade weapons 
 and buy new guns to add variety to this straightforward game.
  
  The graphics is nicely stylized to fit with the 80's (you won't find black guys with afro haircuts) 
 but with the horror element kicking in. Of course taking to account of unsteady frame rate. An 
 example of unsteady frame rate is the gamecube version of Need for Speed Underground 2. Anyway, 
 the zombies animates very well and the screen moves very smoothly. If you have a TV with widescreen 
 and progressice scan will add a nice level to the graphics.
  
  The sound fits in very well. The strongest would be the music. I mean if you like hip hop and funky 
 music, than take a break and go into the extras which I'll mention at the next paragraph. The voice 
 actors is pretty idiotic and approaches well for adults. The villains and Varla is voiced very 
 nicely but Agent G unfortunately sounds throughout the game is like an FBI robocop but totally 
 unlikable that he doesn't have enough charm to care for him. The saving grace and it will be a 
 shock. Keith is the best voiced out of the cast and really foul mouth his way through the game 
 if you can handle it. Anyone who owns a surround sound system would be disappointed there's no 
 Dolby support and this may sound ridiculous that there's no bleepers so rest assured and bare with 
 it.
  
  The value is pretty great. Normally, any shooting game would have just a story and that's about 
 it. This game expands it with an uncut version and also add lots of extras depending on how you 
 want to unlock it. Also having two to four players and having upgrades and types of guns can save 
 it from repetition and boredom.
  
  Well if there was girls playing this game, all they would think is "Oh my god". Mad guys like me 
 would enjoy this despite the unlikable Agent G and unstable frame rates. I would never doubt that 
 this game would be in your face and so cursed that it would put people off. So if you like this 
 kind of game, go for it. Don't think about cursing around kids like Seinfeld did in "The Non Fat 
 Yoghurt".

Review:  Blood, clowns, music, sex, zombies... What more can you ask for?! Really?! Some of the dialogue 
 and cut scenes are hilarious. The House of the Dead Overkill is must-buy for the Wii. The game 
 has a great 70s B-Horror movie/grindhouse type of feel to it. It departs somewhat from previous 
 series titles, but in a very good way... Graphics are much improved. Dialogue and voice acting 
 is also much better than its predecessors. The frame rate can be a little inconsistent at times. 
 It would also be great if there were some sort of online component (i. e. score boards, cooperative 
 play mode, online multiplayer mini-games) Technical issues aside, it's a great game and fun to 
 play. If anything, I would recommend adding the ability to interact or destroy objects in the environments 
 (similar to Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles) in future versions.

Review:  I love playing shoot-em up games. So I am grateful for the HOD series. This game is better the 
 the others. I could do without the tons of F bombs. But it makes you laugh. Grain graphics gives 
 it a Grind House look. Fans of Quentin Tarantino and light gun shooters shouldn't miss it. Mimics 
 the grainy film quality of the era, perfectly masking the Wii's visual deficiencies. The games 
 is easy with a lot of zombies ... excuse me I mean Mutants. Got to be P. C. I also love my game 
 heroines to be very sexy. To me she is a let down. could of been drwn a little better. The over 
 the top jokes and game story keeps you mused all in all the game is fun. The well-implemented gun 
 controls, however basic, match the best of its genre. I would like more choices of guns in the 
 game and better gun control during the game. The House of the dead Overkill charges you with mowing 
 down waves of infected, blood-thirsty zombies in a last-ditch effort to survive and uncover the 
 horrific truth behind the origins of the House of the Dead. Enjoy

Review:  The House of the Dead OVERKILL! is a 1970s B-movie style rail-gun shooter. By that I mean, you 
 will notice the scratches on the screen as if you're watching a movie projector from the 1970s. 
 It has 70s style music along with a 70s style movie narrative that has Don LaFontaine's touch (except 
 he doesn't say "In a world where" but that's a different story) .
  
  As Agent G, you and your foul-mouthed partner, Isaac Washington, are to track down and stop Papa 
 Cesar from creating an army of zombies, or as G likes to call them, mutants. ("How many times must 
 I tell you not to use the 'Z' word?", Agent G tells Washington) . After the first stage of the game, 
 you encounter a stripper, Varla Guns, who brings her own guns (literally) and joins you in her 
 own vendetta against Cesar. 
  
  The House of the Dead series has always been a rail-gun shooter, and Overkill is no different. 
 You use the Wii remote to aim at the screen with the cross-hair in it and you shoot to kill. There 
 are also medical kit boxes that you shoot to restore your health, and a green slime thingy in which 
 you shoot to slow down time to kill your enemies faster. Each end of the stage is a boss fight. 
 Since this is a rail-gun shooter game, you can't avoid the boss attacks, but only to shoot to slow 
 them down. 
  
  There are seven stages in the game overall. After you complete the game, you will unlock a Director's 
 Cut version of the movie, I mean, game, and you get to do the same stages again, except that these 
 are extended stages, i. e. you'll see some parts of the stage that you haven't seen the first time 
 around.
  
  If you kill 5 enemies in a row without missing a shot, you will earn an "Extreme Violence" achievement 
 in which you will earn more points for each enemy you kill until you miss. The highest you can 
 achieve is a "Goregasm". Each time you complete the stage you, earn cash based on your shot accuracy, 
 number of head shots, how many seconds you are in a goregasm, number of brains collected (by shooting 
 at them) , and how many civilians you saved. The cash can be used to purchase new weapons, or upgrade 
 the current ones. 
  
  This game is a lot of fun, and from the developers' standpoint, it shows. There's a lot of blood, 
 gore, and swearing in this game, so this game definitely deserved the M-rating. You can go back 
 to the stages you completed if you haven't satisfied your bloodlust yet. You can even select some 
 songs as unlockables, but again, not for saintly ears. 
  
  The only two problems with the game are the lack of challenge and the gratuitous swearing. The 
 game is TOO easy and the bosses aren't much of a challenge. You'll die a few times a first, but 
 it's never frustrating. Isaac Washington throws an F-bomb in almost every sentence. It's amusing 
 at first, but it just gets old quickly. 
  
  OVERKILL! is not a deep game, nor it is intended to be. It's just shooting zombies, uh mutants, 
 with blood, guts, gore, and a stripper. If you can overlook the F-bombs and the cakewalk, you'll 
 enjoy it.

Review:  House of the Dead: Overkill is one of the better 3rd party efforts for the Wii. 
  
  Since it is an arcade shooter, the main game itself isn't very long, or difficult, and can be finished 
 in about 2 hours, but completed levels can be replayed at anytime. After the story is completed 
 once, there are options to replay the story with more mutants, or play a Director's Cut mode in 
 which the mutants are more plentiful and more difficult to kill. A gun upgrade system is a nice 
 addition to the game, so the player can customize or buy a weapon to suit his/her preferences. 
 If 2 players take on mutants in the story mode, the game is noticeably easier. There are minigames, 
 but they don't have much depth and are best left to when 2-4 players are available.
  
  The game itself is presented very well. The textures are high resolution for the most part, but 
 some areas don't look very nice when the camera zooms in on them. The character models aren't the 
 best looking, and during some cutscenes, seem to bend in awkward positions. Overkill makes up for 
 the poor character models with some great special effects, including the amazingly gory mess that 
 results of a headshot, or even blowing off a mutant's arm, and some sweeping dust effects also 
 look impressive as well as blurred motion effects. Sometimes there can be a sudden drop in frame 
 rate, which doesn't hinder the gameplay but is a bit annoying when trying to aim.
  
  Where Overkill really stands out is the voice acting, and music. The characters deliver some of 
 the strangest and funniest dialogue in a video game. The over-the-top profanity approach is a bit 
 much at times, especially since almost every other word that Detective Washington says is an F-bomb. 
 The music in the game is comprised of original scores, and can be listened to in the extras section 
 after the game is completed once. During the game, the music seems out of place at times, but that 
 makes it stand out more, in a good way.
  
  Whether it be single player, or multiplayer, House of the Dead: Overkill has enough features to 
 keep most players coming back time and time again.

Review:  This game is for al those people that loves b-grade / grindhouse movies and the humor they bring. 
 I am one of these people and it won't be everyones taste. Still I've had some great fun playing 
 this.
  The positive thing that stands out is the terrible but engaging b-movie plot and dialogue. The 
 characters in this game are so typical and funny. The trailer-like narration, the stripper who's 
 kid brother was killed, the two cops trying to stop a madman and the evil and disturbed villains. 
 It all falls together perfectly.
  The gameplay is pretty fun too. It's as you would expect. You are on a rail blasting zombies. Simple 
 but emmersive. Too bad it's all a bit easy. Especially the bosses.
  It looks pretty good too yet it suffers from some framerate jitters and technical issues. The screen 
 constantly looks like an old movie so much can be "rationalised" during play. It did'nt bother 
 me that much. Textures and lighting are pretty impressive for a wii.
  The music and sounds are great too. They bring you right to place you need to be. The voice acting 
 is great and sounds a bit cheap like those movies do.
  It's adult theme, it's pure charm and great dialogue make this a great buy. 
  I bought the pack 
 with the handgun (your nunchuck can be connected but is not part of the gun) . Its big and works 
 great. I now prefer it over the wii zapper. You can play this game without the nunchuck so it's 
 especially good with this game.

Review:  This is by far the best House of the Dead ever made. It eclipses all other Zombie shooters by miles. 
 
  
  Graphically it is easily the best of series and in fact, some of the nicest graphics I have seen 
 on the wii period. Great zombies, excellent use of atmospheric sound effects, and some genuinely 
 scary moments. This is what House of the Dead should be about - zombie slayin', screamin' fun. 
 
  
  Great Bosses with some really neat new touches and graphical effects. Brilliant new features like 
 slo-mo (bullet time) bonuses to enable you to reel off a few tasty head shots and see the splatter 
 - it's a gore-fest people. 
  
  The game presents itself like a 70's B-movie schlock horror flick. There's plenty of hardcore swearing 
 to go along with the uber-violence and gore. It's just so FUN.
  
  This is all-new house of the Dead and it kicks serious zombie-ass. Get it, you wont be dissapointed.

Review:  Overly cheesy but not in a funny way, and lots of swearing that gives house of the dead a new look. 
 The old ones were still a lot more entertaining and cheesy in a different but more entertaining 
 way. Perhaps the problem was that the older ones weren't trying to be cheesy, but just was because 
 of japanese writters and the arcade atmosphere. This one just tries too hard.
  
  The game play is just bad since all zombies seem to die with 2 shots, unless you get a head shot. 
 I remember in the old arcade versions you often have to shoot zombies a few times unless you get 
 a clear head shot and they don't always staggered the same repetitive way. There's no new features 
 like the knife that was used in Resident evil: Umbrella Chronicles. Unless you count the lame gun 
 reloading sequence. Instead of shooting off the screen to reload, you shake your gun. When you 
 do that you also have to wait till it reloads with a gun flashing on the screen. Considering that 
 the wii mote's sensitivity sucks and this game isn't supposed to be realistic, that was a really 
 bad idea.
  
  Graphics are just some of the worst I've seen in a long time. The quality is not just bad in terms 
 of hardware, but in artistic value which there is no excuse for. Bland and hard to look at. It 
 might have passed as a good PS1 quality game.
  
  Music also sucked since it's just annoying. Voice acting was your stereotypical cheesy classic 
 b movie flick, which I would say is okay. The narrator was really annoying and unneccessary though.
 
  
  If you want a classic arcade style shooter with lots of zombies, either get Resident Evil Umbrella 
 Chronicles or the HOTD collection set. I recommend the former.

Review:  Before i get to the review, Im going to take a trip down memory lane. About,8 or 9 years ago i saw 
 the original house of the dead in an arcade. I asked my dad if we could play it and he was okay 
 with it. So we grabbed the light guns and started playing. It was so gory for that time and we had 
 a blast with it. I mean sure it was flawed, but its cheesiness made it entertaining. After my mom 
 discovered we were playing the game, she pulled me away from it and I never got to play it ever 
 since. Then in late 2008, i picked up THOTD 2 and 3 for the wii and felt mildly satisfied, but not 
 impressed with its port. I wanted some more extras and for it to be not as difficult as it was before. Alright, back 
 to the review. THIS is what I had dreamed of as an almost, near perfect light gun game for a console. Oh 
 and just if you are wondering, this game could never be put in arcades due to its extreme gore and 
 grindhouse esque language and humor. This game is full of humor, embraces cheesiness, has some of 
 the best graphics for ANY wii game and almost fully lives up to its potential. The bosses are sometimes 
 easy to kill, but one boss in particuluar is annoying and takes a while to beat. This game is full 
 of extras and minigames that are some of the nicest aspects of the game. But of course, there are 
 flaws and those include minor screen issues occasionally, some levels being too easy because of 
 the new points system which if you die, lets you revive by taking away some of your points. There 
 are only six or seven levels, but each feels different and full of funny lines and gore. This is 
 a bit off topic, but has anyone noticed that papa caesar looks like caesar milan and the bug boss 
 on the train level bares a resemblence to the cloverfield monster. So yeah, if you are looking for 
 a fun light gun game that is full of mature humor and violence, this is what you are looking for.

Review:  Some franchises do have the tendancy to get worse with age, one of those franchises is arguably 
 called House of the Dead. The series exploded into popularity in the early 90's of it's release, 
 but the series has waned, and has become the spawn of many console ports and to a gamers, a bit 
 of a joke. Regardless of what people may think, I've been a keen House of the Dead fan. House of 
 the Dead is a series that doesn't take itself seriously, and that's what I like most about the 
 series. It's clean, good old-fashioned fun, but sadly enough, HOTD has rapidly become it's own 
 mockery.
  
  House of the Dead: Overkill is a neat little game that sets out what it aims to do, and does it 
 with some new, refreshing ideas that truly makes the game feel inspired. But, Overkill does more 
 than that. It completely grabs the House of the Dead series by the neck, and adds a wonderfully 
 creepy atmopshere, and brings back the relevance to gamers, that the HOTD series really needed.
 
  
  The storyline of House of the Dead Overkill is set before the events of the first House of the 
 Dead game. The series' usual protagnist: G is given his first assignment, and sent down to a small 
 town in Louisana to investiage a series of dissaperances and hunt down the crime lord known as 
 Papa Ceaser. G then teams up with Dectective Issac Washington in order to save Louisanna from zombie 
 threat. Overkill's story plays pretty much like a classic B 1970s horror movie. The dialouge is 
 predictable, constant streams of cheesy toilet humor and expected groans and screams, and a fairly 
 typical bad-buddy cop story with G and Isaac Washington. However, like a 1970s B horror film, Overkill 
 adds enough over-the-top scenarios and authentic characters to make you engaged into the narrative. 
 Gone are the droning characters of the classic titles, and here is a more real G, that's balanced 
 with enough seriousness and humor to make him a affable and likeable young lead. Overkill does 
 just enough to make you feel in a real zombie crisis, so it's well done enough for the gamer to 
 invest in.
  
  The gameplay of Overkill is the joyous case of mixing the old with the new. Overkill still retains 
 the pacy and over-the-top haunted villiage feel of the orginial classics. New to the game is the 
 combo meter. The number of percise head-shots, shooting bonus pick ups (like in the classics) , 
 and more to give you more points. When you die, the amount of points you have in your combo meter 
 will allow you to play for a more sizeable time period. Overkill combines the original ideas of 
 head-shots, shooting pick-ups and more, with a new idea that instantly makes Overkill both nastolgic 
 and fresh. It's certainly a marked improvement over the awkward credit system using in HOTD 2&3 
 Return for the Wii. The Slow-Mo-Fo picks up can slow down the game to kill more zombies. These 
 ideas in Overkill reach a blanaced difficulty setting that both is welcoming for the newcomers, 
 and for the veterans, its own unique challenge. 
  
  Graphically, Overkill is wonderfully over the top and manages to capture the typical impression 
 of a haunted playground bueatifully. The hilarious, yet subtly haunting 1970s ghost songs used 
 in the background makes Overkill feel playful like the orginials, and uniquely scary.
  
  Overkill isn't without flaws. The toilet humor, whilst mostly funny, feels like a forced attempt 
 to make gamers feel like a classic HOTD experience, when really sometimes it serves as no other 
 purpose but novelty. Overkill's soundtrack, whilst great, tries too hard to spoof a old 1970s horror 
 film, and comes off as a little farcial.
  
  Regardless, if you're a HOTD fan, waiting for the series' revival, this game hits all the marks. 
 Overkill brings new life into this stagnating series, and has done it a world of good. If Sega 
 could only do the same for it's beloved blue hedgehog and some other franchises, it would be even 
 more impressive, but HOTD is back, and back with a bang. That's more than good enough for me.

Review:  This game is definitely one of the best zombie-shooters of all time. Heck, it's one of the best 
 shooters of all time!
  Doesn't have the best story, but the gameplay is great.
  I don't know about you, but I'm a huge zombie fan. Zombie movies, zombie games, yeah. That might 
 be why I enjoy this game so much.
  It would have been better if the whole game was in a mall, but that's not too important to me. 
 There are tons of cool weapons to smash zombie brains with. I haven't beat this game yet, as I 
 am only halfway through. This game is much better than CoD5, even if it doesn't have Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi 
 would've been good, and probably would've made it more popular. Even though it's a rail-shooter, 
 it's still about as good as any other shooter. It isn't a complete gore-game, and an appropriate 
 amount of blood is shed when a zombie is shot.

Review:  If there's one thing I know, its that Overkill is a game you wont regret buying. Whenever you get 
 mad all you want to do is chop up some zombie stew, this game will deliver your interest. Now, 
 I keep getting told that the game tends to freeze, but I have not ever seen that happen, maybe 
 its just the disk. Personally, my favorite zombie is the clown, I hate clowns so it feels good 
 to get revenge on them. If you could create a character in this game, you would have my dream game. 
 Its an instant classic zombie shooter, addictive to watch, and even better to play. to wrap up 
 this special review, let me give it my ratings. In my light gun game history of playing, this one 
 makes the top ten for me. In the game my favorite character is agent G, I say this because he looks 
 like a secret agent from 007 or the Matrix. Now for the bad aspect of the game, the reloading is 
 broken, because say your in the middle of a level where there are zombies coming from every corner 
 and you run out of bullets, it takes forever to reload! Well, maybe thats just the difficulty of 
 the game. Well, to wrap this review up, I give this game a... 4/5, thanks for reading my review, 
 and thank you gamespot for letting me do it.

Review:  OK, this is what we were waiting for... if HOTD: OK is totally worth it, guess what? IT IS!!! IT 
 IS!!! Unlike other HOTD games this one has some spice, that 70's low budget magical horror movies 
 with the badass characters is quite awesome. It has some hysterical moments when some F words are 
 used & you know that typical slang it's definitely funny. Also those "grindhouse" puns are enjoyable 
 giving you a different HOTD experience.
  
  The game has occasionally some frame rate problems but that's maybe due to the console limitations 
 but other than that it's still enjoyable. This is fun to play with friends, etc & the arcade style 
 mini games are good but it's something slow IMO also the reloading speed is different in the mini 
 games than story mode which it is a little bit faster in the mini games the reloading speed is 
 a little bit slower.
  
  But looking it on the bright side, it is entertaining & will make you laugh with both main characters.

Review:  Let's be honest, those of you who have played any of the arcade HOTD franchise games know exactly 
 what your getting into when you pick up this game. It's all about pairing up with a buddy, being 
 equipped with unlimited ammo, and having droves of undead come at you. Take aim with your cross-hairs 
 ... go for the head-shot ... and blam! The dialogue is very entertaining and had us saying "I can't 
 believe he just said that!". Agent G is paired with Isaac Washington, with outbursts reminiscent 
 of Samuel L. Jackson from Pulp Fiction (or pretty much any other SLJ flick) . IMHO, it's a good 
 game for parties, going co-op, or playing solo. Game length is several hours, which personally 
 is just fine for me ... I don't have time to get into a 30-40 hr time investment on a game these 
 days. More importantly, it has great replay value and quick mini-games for extra entertainment. 
 Control with the Wii remote is on par, as far as accuracy and response, with other Wii games I've 
 played (which is pretty good) . Nice addition to the Wii repertoire.

Review:  i got the game a few hours ago, and blasted right through it on my own, will play it later again 
 with some friends i guess ;)
  
  ok so about the game for a lightgun shooter, it deserves a 9, the game is great, it has a unique 
 style... well not that unique since its a rip-off from grindhouse :P 
  but it works for the game, its funny, entertaining, some pretty cool cutscenes, alltho i thought 
 some things were copied straight from grindhouse and the black guy uses curse words a little bit 
 TOO much, up untill a point where it isnt really funny anymore :P but whatever, lets talk about 
 the game..
  
  the game only takes like 3 hours to complete, the coolest thing is that u dont pickup weapons during 
 the level with a limited set of ammunition, nonono.. u get cash for how well u are doing and in 
 between levels u buy new weapons or upgrade the ones you have.. that is a nice addition to the 
 series.
  let me tell you, while i was playing this game it really put a smile on my face :D blasting zombies 
 while happy oldies music is playing, god i was blasting through this game with a smile on my face 
 like all the time ;)
  
  if you ask me... if you like lightgun shooters, GET THIS GAME, its the best in the series ( tho 
 i havent seen HOTD 4)
  
  alltho i loved the game, it had some flaws
  -Frame rate issues, this happened regularly : ( 
  -no crosshair mode is impossible to play with, 
 since the game doesnt shoot exactly where you're aiming at.
  -no Animated cutscenes, everything is in-game.. thus no cool movies, 
  alltho ive never seen 
 a lightgun game that actually has anything but in-game movies, i feel like we are in a time where 
 any game should have cool movies.
  
  but imo, you should still get this, its also one of the best games for the wii graphic wise, thats 
 problably what causes some of the frame-rate issues unfortunately.. it doesnt happen that often 
 that it starts to annoy you or anything tho and its usually only for 1 or 2 seconds, when alot 
 happens at the same time or an explosion happens.
  
  and believe me, i never write reviews, unless i really really enjoyed the game, so if you like 
 lightgun shooters, get this ;)

Review:  This is one fun game. Fast paced, loud, and in your face. Awesome weapons, excellent music, cool 
 cutscenes and dialogue, great zombie designs, great level designs, and cool unlockables. 
  
  Great graphics and a great over-the-top storyline. 
  
  Pretty short game, but not too short. 
 The game has great replay value in getting higher ranks per chapter, attaining a higher score than 
 before, getting more cash to buy new guns and upgrade them, and a whole lot of other stuff to shoot 
 for. 
  
  Gameplay is phenomenal. A lot can be going on at once. Didn't really experience any framerate isuues 
 that I have heard about. A lot of things to aim for besides zombies and for the most part you have 
 to be quick about it. Things like golden brains for cash and points, acquiring grenades, health, 
 and ..... slowmotion which for a short period of time helps out if you in a difficult situation 
 or just going for headshots and easy kills.
  
  Aiming is easy and efficient. Sound effects are awesome. Tons of blood and gore. 
  
  The music 
 in this game is excellent. Very entertaining. It makes playing the stages all the more worth it. 
 
  
  Dual wield and 2 players. Need to say more?
  
  To up the difficulty there is an option to add extra zombies, disable crosshairs and a director's 
 cut difficulty mode which is unlocked when you beat story mode once. There are several minigames 
 too that are up to 4 players and are quite fun to do. 
  
  Get this game and have fun.
