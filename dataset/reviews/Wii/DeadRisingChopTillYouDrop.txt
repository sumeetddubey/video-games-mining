:::Review:::
Dead Rising veterans might see a downsized port, but for newcomers this is an enjoyable horror-themed 
 action game. 

  Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop is like a film adaptation of a classic book. It resembles the original 
 in the most important ways, but a few drastic changes have made it something of its own. Fans of 
 the Xbox 360 original may balk at the changes and downgraded visuals, but those unfamiliar with 
 Dead Rising will find a pleasingly action-packed game here. The free-roaming zombie-slaying of 
 Dead Rising is unique on the Wii, and even though Chop Till You Drop has its fare shair of flaws, 
 it's a welcome addition to the console's increasingly mature library.  

           Guns and ammo are more plentiful on the Wii than they were in the original game.      
 

  The story follows freelance photojournalist Frank West as he investigates the zombie invasion at 
 the Willamette mall. Within minutes of arriving, Frank leverages his returning helicopter ride 
 to get information out of some secretive DHS agents. By his second day in the zombie-infested complex, 
 Frank is knee-deep in conspiracy theories, needy survivors, and of course, brain-hungry zombies. 
 The story tries to take itself seriously -- there's a commentary on America's war on terror in there 
 somewhere -- but the hammy voice acting and poor writing give it a campy vibe.  

  The campy silliness doesn't end with the story; the gameplay provides hours of laughs. Ever wonder 
 what kind of sound it would make if you hit a zombie with a parking cone? Ever have the desire 
 to dress in children's clothing while slaying undead? With hundreds of items to use as improvised 
 weapons, and several dozen bizarre clothing selections, Dead Rising: CTYD has plenty of options 
 to make your ridiculous horror fantasies come true as you bash your way through hordes of undead. 

  As a scaled-down port, CTYD seems like it has a one-step-forward, two-steps-back design. The developers 
 fixed a number of issues from the 360 version, but created some more in the process. One of the 
 most common complaints leveled at the original game was that its single-save system caused unnecessary 
 frustration. With only one save slot, rescuing every person and completing every mission took some 
 considerable time-management skills, and consequently multiple play-throughs were almost a must. 
 The Wii version gives you multiple save slots, but it also ditches the hectic seat-of-your-pants 
 flow for a more manageable, linear structure. The option to have multiple saves is still welcome, 
 but it's not really necessary, given that you'll tackle each mission one at time. It also highlights 
 the repetitive nature of the original missions. The fetch quests didn't seem as tedious on the 
 360 because you could juggle more than one at a time. Chop Till You Drop requires constant trips 
 to and from the security room to pick up new missions.  

  In addition to multiple save slots, the Wii version of Dead Rising comes packed with new zombie 
 enemies that are slowly introduced throughout your time in the mall. New foes, including giant 
 stun-gun wielding zombies and deadly accurate gun-toting zombies, spice up the action and keep 
 you on your toes. Unfortunately, the most common of the additions -- zombie poodles and grenade-dropping 
 parrots -- could be in the running for the most annoying enemies in game history.  

           Ever wondered what you should do if a clown comes at you with a chainsaw?      

  At 
 some point during his transition to the Wii, Frank has lost the ability to jump, which severely 
 hampers his zombie-evading skills. The developers use this to their advantage by creating roadblocks 
 in the form of stacked boxes and velvet ropes throughout the mall. In theory it's a great way to 
 work around system limitations because it funnels you through crowded paths that make it seem as 
 if there are more zombies shuffling the halls than there are. But in practice it can make navigating 
 the mall a pain, especially at night when you can't see the roadblocks until you're up against 
 them. Chop Till You Drop also removes the photography element from the 360 game. It's not a terrible 
 omission, but it is odd that Frank still runs around with his camera in his hands at all times. 

  Perhaps surprisingly given the game's title, using guns rather than melee weapons is often encouraged 
 in Chop Till You Drop. Unlike in the original, guns can be kept indefinitely after they've been 
 purchased from Cletus at the gun store. Zombies drop bullets and money when killed, so there's 
 lots of incentive to blast away. The over-the-shoulder aiming works beautifully here, and it makes 
 dispatching large groups of zombies easy. Melee weapons are not as useful as they once were because 
 you can carry only one, but having unlimited access to a room-clearing shotgun makes up for that. 

  Controls work excellent while shooting, but they can be a bit rigid elsewhere. Despite his quick 
 180-spin maneuver and the fact that he automatically swings in the direction of the closest zombie 
 when flailing a melee weapon, Frank still gets bitten in the neck more than he should. Mercifully, 
 the developers have made the motion controls for basic melee use optional, so you won't have to 
 flap your arms hundreds of times just to get down the hallway.  

  As expected, CTYD is a step down graphically from the original. The in-engine cutscenes from the 
 360 version appear here as prerendered scenes. It's nice to have them, but they are a bit blurry 
 and they create some inconsistencies where Frank's outfits and the zombie headcount are concerned. 
 The visuals are above average for the Wii and, aside from some frequent zombie pop-in and fuzzy 
 textures, the Willamette mall looks good. The frame rate generally does a good job of keeping up 
 with the action as well, so you don't get to blame slowdown if a zombie makes a meal of your gray 
 matter.  

           Frank can't jump anymore, but he can dress up like Bionic Commando.      

  The fantastic 
 sound design from the original made the transition to the Wii mostly intact. From the dull thud 
 of a pipe to the thwack of a golf club, most of the weapons have their own unique sound, though 
 they don't sound as powerful coming through the Wii Remote speaker. Like in the original, the voice 
 acting is horrible, though the frequent nonsensical strings of dialogue are funny in a seemingly 
 unintentional way.  

  It's easy to tell that the original Dead Rising wasn't built with the Wii in mind. As a port, Dead 
 Rising: CTYD is only a shadow of the original. However, on its own, it's a fun action game with 
 a few nagging problems. There's potential here for a great Wii franchise, but it's going to take 
 more than a shoehorned port for it to really shine.
