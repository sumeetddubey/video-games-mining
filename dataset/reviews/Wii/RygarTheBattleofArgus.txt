:::Review:::
Rygar feels every bit as old as you'd expect from a six-year-old game, but it still has some really 
 fun moments. 

  Rygar: The Battle of Argus feels like it belongs in a museum. It's a dusty-looking 3D action game 
 that was originally released more than 6 years ago for the PlayStation 2. In that time, Ninja Gaiden 
 and God of War, among other games, have elevated the genre to new heights. Compared to more recent 
 releases, many elements of Rygar feel outdated now. The combat is far too simplistic, relying more 
 on button mashing than strategic movement and defense, and the story is almost laughable, presenting 
 a predictable tale of good versus evil with overdramatic music and high-school-drama-club-caliber 
 voice acting. However, there is still a solid experience beneath the layers of sediment. The level 
 design is varied and exhilarating, quickly whisking you from Icarus' fortress in the sky to the 
 fiery bowels of Hades, and the bosses are truly nasty-looking. Rygar feels like a relic from a 
 forgotten era, but the joy of decapitating minotaurs is a pastime that never gets old.         
    Gladiator mode lets you tear down an army of insects.     

  The story in Rygar is convoluted and pointless. Rygar may be the one stricken with amnesia, but 
 you'll be the one who is hard pressed to remember the various plot points. It isn't really explained 
 how Cleopatra somehow got mixed up in this tale of Greek mythology, why you have to fight Icarus, 
 or why Harmonia spontaneously bursts into song. The characters are all bland archetypes, filling 
 their roles of hero, villain, or distressed damsel without personality. The story thankfully stays 
 in the background, popping onscreen only before big battles, and it can be skipped without missing 
 a thing. Nevertheless, slaying a cyclops would have been even more engaging if you were given worthwhile 
 motivation.  

  The level design makes up for the awful story segments. You'll travel all over the Mediterranean, 
 from the Colosseum to Tartarus and many other fantastical lands, so you don't have to worry about 
 slogging through the same bland environments over and over. The levels have some light platforming 
 and puzzle interludes, making you open locked doors with a specific type of element or shove large 
 blocks out of the way, but the relative ease of the puzzles means that you won't be stumped by 
 one section for long. There is some backtracking later in the game when you unlock new abilities, 
 but this is handled in a very streamlined manner. When you warp back to a previous land, you are 
 immediately presented with an obstacle that you couldn't get past previously, so instead of going 
 over the same ground repeatedly, you are able to explore new sections almost continually. The intelligently 
 laid-out levels keep the game moving at a brisk pace, letting you see a steady stream of new creatures 
 and environments.  

  Your main weapon in Rygar is the diskarmor, which is pretty much a spiked shield on a string. Combat 
 feels like a stripped-down version of God of War because of the similarities between the main weapons 
 in both games. Rygar's diskarmor feels an awful lot like Kratos' blades of chaos, letting you attack 
 enemies from both far away and up close, as well as toss them around caverns. You're given three 
 different types of diskarmors, of varying speed and power, and each have a bunch of different combos 
 to play around with. However, the focus is clearly on offense, and this makes the combat feel overly 
 simplistic. Your only two defensive moves are a block, which is ineffective against many attacks, 
 and a slide, which is used more for getting into small places than for battle evasion. Without 
 fancy acrobatic dodges or clever counters, the combat relies too heavily on barbaric button mashing. 
 Even though the combat is still fun, it lacks the weight of the better games in the genre.  

  The biggest addition in the Wii version is Gladiator mode. This strips away the cool bosses and 
 varied level design of the main campaign and simply places Rygar on a small platform against a 
 never-ending stream of enemies. What is interesting about this mode is how your attacks are handled. 
 In the main game, you rely mostly on traditional controls, using motion-based moves only for more 
 powerful combos that you unlock late in the game. In Gladiator mode, all of your attacks require 
 motion, which becomes tedious before long. Furthermore, the combat engine in Rygar isn't diverse 
 enough to warrant a separate gameplay mode. Mindlessly hacking away at giant centipedes and centaurs 
 is entertaining only for a few minutes before the bland repetition sets in.            That is 
 one hideous fish.     

  The visuals are the most glaring evidence that this game is virtually unchanged from the PlayStation 
 2 version released toward the beginning of the last generation of consoles. This game looks musty 
 and old. The enemies and even the main characters lack detail, and the cool environments are overrun 
 with poorly detailed textures and shoddy lighting. Even amid all of the lousy technology, though, 
 there are some truly memorable boss battles. These are creepy, repulsive monstrosities, and it 
 is a pleasure to pelt them with your diskarmor. It's a shame that the graphics are largely unchanged 
 from the original game, given that the disturbing bosses and moody environments are so well designed. 

  Make no mistake about it: Rygar: The Battle of Argus is a six-year-old game, and time has made 
 many of its components feel outdated. But even though the story is a joke and the combat focuses 
 too much on the offensive side of things, there is still a fun experience here. Dueling minotaurs 
 and other mythical beats is still fun, and the clever level design makes exploration engaging. 
 This game does belong in a museum, but it can still be fun to play around with the exhibits from 
 time to time.
