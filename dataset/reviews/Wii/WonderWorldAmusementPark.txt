:::Review:::
With its repetitive, pedestrian amusement-park games and nearly lifeless presentation, Wonder World 
 Amusement Park completely fails to amuse. 

  Going to the amusement park is a great way to spend time with your friends and family, but it's 
 quite the expensive trip. Majesco is now offering a way to bring the amusement-park fun to the 
 confines of your living room with Wonder World Amusement Park for the Wii, promising 30 minigames 
 and five unlockable "rides." However, once you partake in the dullness that this virtual amusement 
 park has to offer, you'll likely end up wanting to overspend on the real thing.  

  Wonder World Amusement Park is broken up into five different themed areas, each with six minigames. 
 As you play through these games, you earn tickets (which are good only for the area in which you 
 earned them) for prizes and passes that unlock the other areas. Buying every prize in an area unlocks 
 its ride, which is effectively another minigame that gives out more tickets for a good performance. 

           Too bad you don't get a prize just for figuring out how this game works.      

  The 
 assortment of minigames is dominated by Whack-a-Mole variants and different point-and-shoot activities. 
 Some games require that you pump the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in alternation to win some kind of 
 race, whereas others will have you pointing to fish, frogs, or piranhas out of water. There's even 
 a version of Memory buried in the sandy beaches of the Pirate-themed area. If all of this sounds 
 entirely mundane, that's because it is. To be fair, the control is mostly adequate, and there are 
 at least a few exceptions to the mostly unmemorable minigames. Bag-a-Bug has you maneuvering a 
 honey-covered stick with the Wii Remote to attract as many insects as possible while avoiding those 
 that will destroy your progress. Where the Heart Is requires you to throw a stake into a vampire 
 doll's heart in the dark, with only its glowing eyes to guide you. But by and large, you'll be 
 fed up with the deja vu that you get when you stumble across your third shooting-gallery variant. 

  Wonder World Amusement Park's rides, though they initially appear to offer something different, 
 don't do much to pull the whole experience out of the doldrums. In the majority of them you're 
 still either pointing and shooting at things or pumping your arms alternately. What's more irritating 
 is that you have to earn a significant amount of tickets to purchase every prize in an area first, 
 all to unlock something that ends up being as tedious as what you've just put yourself through. 

  The presentation could have at least brought some amusement and life to the repetitive proceedings. 
 Instead, you're given a deadly cocktail of muddy textures, sparse detail, and an intolerable cacophony 
 of sound effects. Characters have an aging, plastic air about them, and there's absolutely nothing 
 crisp about the colors or modeling. Your ears will suffer an even worse fate than your eyes. For 
 instance, Shut Your Trap, a Whack-a-Mole variant in which you zap angry Venus flytraps, gives way 
 to some of the most vile, ear-splitting screeching you'll ever hear for 60 straight seconds.  

 
  As if the shoddy presentation wasn't enough, there are bothersome little things that make the 
 experience lag on more than it needs to. In Story mode, every time you step up to a minigame, the 
 attendant takes a few seconds to do a jig and greet you with a pointless quip before you're allowed 
 to choose whether to see the instructions. Similar scenes play out after you finish your chosen 
 game.  

           These stripper mummies are probably the most entertaining thing about this amusement park. 

  After unlocking an area, you can play its games in Quickplay mode, where you can avoid all of that 
 nonsense. Alternately, you can choose to saddle up with a few friends and queue up several games 
 in Party mode. Other minigame collections can benefit greatly from being played with friends, but 
 that's just not the case here. The vast majority of the minigame catalog is so very uninspired, 
 especially compared to the Wii's other multiplayer offerings, that not even your pals can save 
 you from this boredom.  

  Even in the unlikely event that you're a Wii owner in need of yet another minigame collection, 
 and you're already tapped out on offerings such as Wario Ware, Rayman Raving Rabbids, and Wii Sports, 
 there's sadly nothing interesting -- or amusing -- about Wonder World Amusement Park.

Review:  This is one of the stupidest wii games ever. It's a copy of all the other stupid wii games like 
 carnival, playground, summer sports, winter sports, only this is the absolute worst. Don't even 
 waste your money renting it like I did. You hit moles, shoot bottles, catch frogs, put together 
 puzzles (very annoying) , and other equally annoying things. The instructions are semi-clear and 
 you can go back and review them. Your 8 year old niece or nephew might enjoy playing this, but 
 that's as far as it goes. An additional word of warning if you do decide to rent this. Some of 
 the games require a nun chuck, so if you want to play against others, make sure there's a nun chuck 
 for each controller. Don't say I didn't warn you. Games like Raving Rabbids I and II are much better 
 and even Mario Party 8 is. I know the wii was made for games like this, but let's try and think 
 up an original variation on this genre. Or else come out with more games like No More Heroes-one 
 of the best games ever for wii, or any system for that matter.
