:::Review:::
Superior animation, an engaging story, and clever puzzles make Broken Sword well worth investigating, 
 despite the occasional glitch. 

 Although the heyday of point-and-click adventure games may be long gone, Broken Sword: Shadows of 
 the Templars has stood the test of time. This Director's Cut is a carefully-wrought Wii version 
 that adds a host of new content to the original game and serves as an excellent demonstration of 
 how good the point-and-click genre can be.         

 The new animation work from Dave Gibbons -- best known for his work on comic classics Watchmen and 
 2000AD, as well as the original game -- bring the games diverse scenes and characters to life. Even 
 incidental characters have been drawn with care, from the expressions of a mute Syrian barman to 
 the detail lavished upon the Parisian skyline. The sound is of a similarly high standard, though 
 it can be a little jarring when voice acting from the original game meets the newly recorded content 
 that's of a higher quality technically. The music serves to build tension at the right moments, 
 the incidental sounds for each scene set the tone perfectly   

 Even with its fairly dark and involved plot, Broken Sword still manages to be funny. Some of the 
 laughs are played at the expense of  Les Americains , whereas others target one's own assumptions 
 about seemingly stereotypical characters, be it thanks to a quick-witted but lazy Gendarme, or 
 an aristocratic British lady with a mischievous streak. Despite the game's age, this character-based 
 humour ensures that the narrative never feels dated.           The new puzzles slot in well alongside 
 the old.     

 Unfortunately, the same can't really be said for the mechanics. The rigid linearity and inventory-based 
 problem solving take a little getting used to and have not aged particularly well -- but the strength 
 of every other aspect of the game makes this fairly easy to forgive. Very occasional enigmas have 
 deeper problems, based as they are on genre conventions that are not as familiar as they once were. 
 One such example involves a puzzle wherein the solution involves using an item on yourself, but 
 the only way to do this is to talk to the correct person, who then suggests using it, which opens 
 up a conversation option with another character further down the line that lets you progress.  
 

 That said, despite the occasional quirk, the vast majority of the puzzles play out in a pleasantly 
 logical -- if occasionally lateral -- manner. Of the new puzzles, a substitution cipher and a chess-based 
 puzzle are the most satisfying, and all of them integrate well with the more traditional point-and-click 
 conundrums. We encountered an issue with one of the new puzzles that caused the game to crash and 
 lost of all our progress since the last manual save, but it functioned perfectly well again after 
 restarting.  

 Another new addition is a tiered hint system, so if you do get stuck, help is but a wave of the 
 Wii remote away. These tips start with a general piece of advice on where to look next, and they 
 range all the way up to full instructions on how to progress. This system works well on the whole 
 because it lets you progress when stuck without resorting to being fully walked through, and it 
 carries no in-game penalty -- though the number of hints taken is listed along with the time played 
 for each save game.           The inset facial animations help to give the characters that little 
 bit more life.     

 The clever puzzles, when combined with the excellent story and new hint system makes for a game 
 that is as engaging and accessible as it is funny and visually appealing. While sequels may have 
 dulled the lustre of the Broken Sword franchise, for the ten hours or so that this directors cut 
 lasts, you will remember why the genre had such huge success.
