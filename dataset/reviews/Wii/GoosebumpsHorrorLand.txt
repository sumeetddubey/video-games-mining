:::Review:::
The controls in this horror-themed minigame collection are possessed by an evil spirit whose only 
 goal is to drive you mad. 

  The HorrorLand theme park has been a fixture of writer R. L. Stine's Goosebumps books since its 
 first appearance in 1994's  One Day at HorrorLand . Since then, "the scariest place on Earth" has 
 been featured in numerous Goosebumps books, as well as a board game and a 1996 PC game, but Goosebumps 
 HorrorLand on the Wii almost certainly represents the most bone-chilling, hair-raising, terrifying 
 depiction of the park to date. The controls in this horror-themed minigame collection are so bad, 
 it's scary!  

           The bumper cars of Shock N Roll are one of the few enjoyable attractions at HorrorLand. 

  HorrorLand starts by having you choose a young boy or girl as your character, and then kicks things 
 off with you and a friend mysteriously finding tickets to the park. Upon your arrival, your tickets 
 are torn into pieces by the green-skinned horror at the entrance, and you and your friend are quickly 
 separated. It soon becomes clear that the only way you'll escape from HorrorLand is by finding 
 all the pieces of your ticket, which are scattered across the park's five areas. And to do that, 
 you've unfortunately got to ride the rides and play the parlor games that make up HorrorLand's 
 attractions.  

  Each of the park's five themed areas has six attractions, for a total of 30 minigames, though most 
 of them are just slight variations on each other. To the game's credit, a few of them can be fun 
 for a little while. For instance, there are some bumper-car games in which your goal is to destroy 
 the other cars by ramming into them. You use the Wii Remote to steer, as well as to trigger bursts 
 of speed, and these control well and are entertaining for a few minutes. But you've got to take 
 the bad with the good in HorrorLand, and the bad is very, very bad.  

  It's not possible to get through the game playing only the more passable attractions, because getting 
 into each successive area requires you to have a certain number of frights. You earn frights based 
 on your performance in each game: a bronze-level performance nets you one, a silver two, and a 
 gold three. Getting into the last area of the park requires you to have 50 frights, so you'll need 
 to have earned at least a silver on most of the attractions to reach that point. It's surprisingly 
 difficult to earn silver in a fair number of the attractions, and by the time you do, you'll likely 
 have played even the more enjoyable minigames enough times that you'll be tired of them. But that's 
 far from the worst that HorrorLand has to offer.  

  The worst games of all are those that require any kind of back-and-forth swinging motion, such 
 as the minigolf games and the Skee-Ball-like parlor games in which you must roll balls into slots 
 using just the right amount of momentum. The problem is that controlling that momentum seems just 
 about impossible. You might swing the remote back and forth with tremendous speed, only to see 
 your character tap the golf ball ever so slightly or roll the ball gently up the incline. Likewise, 
 you might make the slightest movement with the remote and see the golf ball go flying forward or 
 speeding up the slope. The controls for these attractions feel completely broken. And, like some 
 kind of sick joke, the one game at which you absolutely must earn gold if you want to escape from 
 HorrorLand is Pharaoh's Fairways, one of the minigolf attractions. Even the most patient of players 
 will likely get frustrated with the controls while attempting to pull this off. It's almost as 
 if the game itself, like the horrors who run HorrorLand, want you to be stuck in the park forever. 

  In addition to the aforementioned game types, there are roller coasters that have you scanning 
 for targets to shoot, flume rides in which you must row left and right to avoid obstacles, shooting 
 galleries, and the like. Some of the rides have an elaborate design that makes them look like they'd 
 be fun to ride, but this doesn't translate into fun gameplay, and riding them a few times or more 
 to try to earn more frights quickly becomes tedious. Speaking of tedious, many of your ticket pieces 
 are found by aimlessly wandering all over various sections of the park with a young girl in tow, 
 waiting for her to tell you that a piece of your ticket is nearby. It's not fun.  

           Perhaps the controls for Putt Cemetery are the diabolical experiment of a mad scientist. 

  It's too bad that the game fails so tremendously in a few very important areas, given that it does 
 make HorrorLand seem like an interesting place, full of the kind of goofy, good-natured scares 
 that young Goosebumps fans would love. The graphics certainly aren't technically impressive, but 
 the five themed areas do have a certain style to them, from the B-movie sci-fi aesthetic of Mad 
 Labs to the mummy-infested Egyptian horror of Terror Tombs. The music is suitably spooky, and the 
 voice acting is decent throughout, with especially spirited introductions for each event and great 
 delivery of the pun-filled humor that you'll find at every corner of HorrorLand. (What's a vampire's 
 favorite holiday? Fangsgiving! Mwa-ha-ha!)  

  In addition to the single-player story mode, you can play any minigame you've previously played 
 in the game's Arcade mode. Furthermore, a dozen of the games can be played by two players, allowing 
 you to compete with a friend for a high score, which does make the shooting galleries a bit more 
 interesting. There are also 25 monster cards to collect by meeting various conditions, though it's 
 difficult to imagine anyone enjoying this game enough to find lasting value in this opportunity. 
 Even the most devoted of Goosebumps fans will find a frightful amount of frustration waiting for 
 them in HorrorLand.
