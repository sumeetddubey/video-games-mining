:::Review:::
Problematic controls rain on this whimsical, yet shallow, parade. 

  In Major Minor's Majestic March, you use a magical baton that houses the spirit of your great great 
 grandmother to lead a band of dogs, dolphins, flamingos, and flowers. By moving the Wii Remote 
 up and down to a steady tempo, you lead your marching menagerie through a variety of brightly colored 
 locales. The unique concept and whimsical art style are appealing, but alas, the game is hamstrung 
 by inconsistency and troublesome controls. Sometimes the tempo will drop completely even though 
 your steady motion hasn't changed, and at other times your gestures to recruit new members or pick 
 up items simply won't register. It's also entirely possible to make it through a level without 
 keeping tempo for the majority of the time. This makes the game accessible to less rhythmically 
 inclined players, but even they will easily complete the tutorials and all seven performances in 
 about an hour. With so little content and such problematic controls, Major Minor never lives up 
 to the majesty that its name promises.         

  When you lose the tempo, it's wisest to just plow ahead with your best guess. Sometimes things 
 will just sort themselves out, and occasionally one of the aforementioned cues might actually help. 
 Items offer a more reliable way to get back on track. Sun and cake immediately help straighten 
 things out, and tempo-steadying jellybeans can be stored away and deployed with the B button. To 
 collect items (and recruit new band members) , you wave the remote to the left or right side, depending 
 on where they are positioned. There are harmful items, but the helpful ones occur so often that, 
 once you set the initial tempo, it is possible to stop keeping time completely, move the remote 
 only to gather items and band members, and still complete the level. Of course, it's also possible 
 to lose the rhythm when you try to grab items, at which point you're completely derailed. If that 
 happens, you'll either rewind a short distance or have to restart the level entirely.  

           That hitchhiking cactus will lay down some mean xylophone riffs if you recruit him.   
    

  So what exactly is fun about Major Minor's Majestic March? Well, the novelty of leading a marching 
 band is entertaining for a bit. Stepping in place and governing the tempo with snappy up-and-down 
 movements makes you feel like a goofy pretend bandleader, and the vibrant environments that you 
 march through are littered with oddly amusing characters. Your band members themselves are also 
 oddly amusing, waiting patiently by the side of the road for you to come by and scoop them up. 
 Seeing a crocodile in a business suit jump excitedly when you recruit him is humorous, and the 
 more members you recruit, the richer your music will get. Watching rows and rows of wacky creatures 
 march in step behind you is funny and satisfying (despite the unhelpful icons floating over their 
 heads) , and it all works nicely when you get in the groove. It's just too bad that the groove is 
 so easy to lose.  

  There is some cooperative multiplayer action in which one player controls the tempo while the other 
 recruits and grabs items, as well as a competitive mode in which players swap duties on the fly 
 and try to get the most band members. The former is well suited for kids who might like the vibrant 
 art style but have trouble keeping a tempo, whereas the latter isn't very engaging at all. The 
 appeal of Major Minor's Majestic March is based almost completely on novelty, and it is pretty 
 fun for a short while. Unfortunately, there's barely an hour's worth of levels, and replaying them 
 for high scores isn't fun because of the imprecise controls. Major Minor might have a bit of replay 
 value for folks looking to play a cooperative game with young children, but for anyone else it's 
 just too shallow and flawed to justify purchase at even the slightly discounted price.
