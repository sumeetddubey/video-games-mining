:::Review:::
Octomania is a cute puzzle game, but that won't keep you coming back for more. 

  Octomania is a straightforward puzzler with a presentation that should seem instantly familiar 
 to Puyo Puyo fans, featuring similar cutesy anime-style graphics, character-specific attacks, and 
 somewhat humorous -- though shallow -- storylines. But unlike your average block buster, this game 
 has you combining octopuses on a grill. It's not as tasty as it sounds, however, because Octomania 
 dwells entirely in the shallows, and doesn't feature enough modes to keep you playing for long. 
 Unlike it's squishy mascot, this game lacks legs.  

           Flood your opponent with sea urchins to win the day.      

  The game opens in Lonronpia, 
 where Kari the magician apprentice has accidentally summoned waves of octopi in an attempt to create 
 her favorite snack. Octomania's 12 character choices consist of archetypes with a zany twist, such 
 as a samurai crab and a rainbow afro-headed rapping spirit tree. Each character begins a quest 
 to remove the octopi from Lonronpia by force, engaging in octo-battles en route to a demonic prince 
 who is somehow the key to this marine catastrophe.  

  While sporting multiple characters is a nice bonus for any puzzle game, the shallow storylines 
 and annoying voice-overs make Octomania's only redeeming quality its simplistic puzzle gameplay, 
 which centers on manipulating a four-block cursor clockwise or counterclockwise to maneuver the 
 colored octopi filling the screen onto numbered grills. Positioning the corresponding number of 
 same-colored octopi on a grill turns the adorable squids into matching colored bubbles. You can, 
 then, connect other octopi of that color to the bubbles to trigger a chain, which causes sea urchins 
 to clutter your opponent's screen. Winning the game is as simple as flooding your opponent with 
 sea urchins and octopi faster than he or she can chain them away, which is no small feat considering 
 the speed with which octopi rain down your screen.  

  Though the mechanics may seem incredibly simple -- even boring -- Compile Heart added three character-specific 
 features to enliven the experience, including specialty colors, combo attacks, and diamond effects. 
 Specialty colors increase the number of sea urchins sent over from a chain that is based on a character's 
 unique color. Combo attacks activate as your chaining progresses, and are followed by a short animation 
 of your character pummeling your foe with sea urchins. Diamonds trigger a character's special ability 
 once they're chained, such as Kari's urchin vanish, which turns all sea urchins and octopi on her 
 grills into the same color. Though most diamond effects result in a quick victory, you have to 
 earn a diamond by completing multiple chains, which keeps the gameplay from becoming too much of 
 a breeze.  

  Octomania's primary mode -- Original -- boasts varying degrees of difficulty. You should be able to 
 fly through both the easy and intermediate options in less than a half hour while incurring only 
 a few continues. Octo-puzzle allows you to race through the story with one or two players, experiencing 
 the weak plot from six different views as you work to unlock the other six characters. You can 
 face off against friends in Octo-battle's four-player option or head to Original's "endless" offering, 
 which is a basic survival mode that awards you a licensed rank for achieving so many points from 
 combos and chains. Unfortunately, very little is done to differentiate Arcade, the game's other 
 main mode, from Original. Like Original, Arcade includes a two-player mode, another bout of endless, 
 and a quick romp through Lonronpia -- except this time, you're unable to choose a character. Octomania 
 does attempt to make up for its lack of depth by including Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection battles, but 
 locating an opponent is probably the game's greatest challenge.  

           Position matching colored octopi next to bubbles to chain.       

  Adjusting to Octomania's 
 initial control scheme comes in at a close second, though, with the game offering two simple options 
 via the Wii Remote: pointer-style and sideways play. While pointer-style may appear the most natural 
 and fitting option at first glance due to the four-block cursor you're given, sideways is much 
 more precise and frees you from pointer-style's shaky, troublesome cursor. This is a great help 
 when your octopi are overflowing and you need to quickly and precisely reposition your squids. 

  Octomania is a cute puzzle game complete with anime-style characters, simple background stills, 
 and decent music, but these qualities fail to overshadow its severe lack of depth. Overall, Octomania 
 is a fishy dish that won't have you coming back for seconds.

Review:  the game is fun game it has so many fun and odd characters the goblin that insane with cleaning 
 or the crab that wants to be a samurai and even grew a top not the best is the narcissist kappa 
 he is to funny its nice that every character has a full voice over , the gameplay is squares with 
 number in it and you have to match same colour octopuses in it, then you have to try to match more 
 of the same colour around it to have combos for higher points everyone has a super move that can 
 be used for different effects the game starts as easy game but gets insane tough at the harder 
 difficulty there is online play but i don't have the internet for the wii so i haven't tried it, 
 and the price is only around 10$ now for the game its a great price it you like puzzle games then 
 pick it up
