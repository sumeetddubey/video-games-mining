:::Review:::
If you're itching to play a hidden-object game, The Vanishing Files will be like rubbing up against 
 a tree: it's not pretty, but it gets the job done. 

  In Cate West: The Vanishing Files, you play as the titular heroine who uses her mysterious psychic 
 mojo to help the local police with a strange criminal investigation. You do this by looking at 
 scenes that are immensely cluttered with a bizarre variety of junk and picking out a few select 
 items; it's a hidden-object game. There are some variations on the stare-and-point gameplay, but 
 for the most part you'll be searching, searching, remembering to blink, and then searching some 
 more. The plot is a bland mystery that takes a good amount of time to unravel, and though recycled 
 scenes and stingy story interludes make it feel artificially prolonged, there's still a hefty chunk 
 of game here. With a few multiplayer options and serviceable presentation, The Vanishing Files 
 offers adequate hidden-object fare for a reasonable price.         

  The actual gameplay is divided up into five different stages, each corresponding to a stage of 
 a criminal investigation. In the first stage, you visit a number of locations around the city and 
 search for clues. Each location presents you with a cluttered image and charges you to find items 
 from a list. The images are generally clear enough for you to find a good number of the items, 
 but you'll have to make use of the helpful magnifying glass for searching particularly dense areas 
 or finding small items. If you're really stuck, you can request a hint, which will place an illuminated 
 ring around an item's location. Getting a hint has no adverse effect on your time, though you will 
 earn fewer points. You can boost your points by finishing quickly or finding multiple items in 
 a row, but the only incentive to do so is your own desire for a bigger number.  

  The Vanishing Files does make a few stumbles in its basic gameplay, but they aren't too serious. 
 You'll occasionally run into odd or tricky item names. When we were asked to find "After Genesis," 
 the item on the screen ended up being the word "Exodus." Some British terms also make an entrance 
 (American audiences won't likely know that a "plaster" is an adhesive bandage) , but it's nothing 
 that a simple hint can't solve. Visual problems pop up as well, and sometimes you'll find yourself 
 clicking on random things that you  can't  identify because the items you  can  identify aren't 
 on the list. This desperate, random clicking is a hallmark of the second stage: finding evidence. 
 At this stage, Cate has identified two specific items that will help solve the case. These items 
 are then fragmented into a bunch of pieces, and Cate has to find these pieces amid a cluttered 
 image. Given that these pieces are merely fragments of recognizable objects, it is often quite 
 difficult to locate them. However, in some exceptions, the fragments are clearly visible, making 
 it all too easy to find them. These extremes are frustrating and boring, respectively.  

           The magnifying glass is a great help in tracking down those tricky hula girls.      

 
  Fortunately, the other diversions from the formula aren't as painful. Once you've found the evidence, 
 it's off to confirm the criminal's hideout by spotting the discrepancies between two nearly identical 
 images. This is an amusing change of pace, but it can sometimes be finicky about where exactly 
 you click. The next stage is reminiscent of the board game Guess Who. Here, you pick the criminal 
 out of a lineup by analyzing the various suspects' dossiers and using the clues that Cate gleans 
 from the evidence. It's not too tough, but it is certainly easier on your eyes than object finding. 
 The last stage is a somewhat clever inversion of the third stage that challenges you to place a 
 bunch of items back into two nearly identical images. This takes place during a courtroom scene, 
 and could easily be interpreted as a planting-evidence minigame. Legality aside, it's a nice way 
 to round out the chapter. After another brief plot progression, it's on to the next chapter to 
 do it all over again.  

  The Vanishing Files has 15 chapters in all, and repeating the five-stage investigation cycle 15 
 times takes a good amount of time. You can play the story cooperatively with another player, or 
 compete head-to-head to earn the most points in a single stage. With only a handful of different 
 activities, Cate West's investigations begin to feel repetitive before too long, especially when 
 you start visiting the same locations multiple times across different chapters. The plot doesn't 
 do much to keep things fresh because it progresses so slowly and sporadically, but it does add 
 some welcome structure to the game. The Vanishing Files is fairly bland and has a few noticeable 
 shortcomings, but it does offer plenty of satisfying opportunities to find hidden things at a discount 
 price.
