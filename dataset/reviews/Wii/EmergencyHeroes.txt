:::Review:::
Emergency Heroes is a lazy and repetitive open-world driving game that will bore even the younger 
 audience that it's aimed at. 

  Emergency Heroes is Ubisoft's attempt at an open-world game for young gamers. But with an incredibly 
 sterile city, repetitive missions, and an inconsequential plot, the game manages to make playing 
 as a police officer, a firefighter, and a medic no fun whatsoever. The single-player game is a 
 five-hour slog through dull missions, and the introduction of friends in multiplayer does little 
 to alleviate the boredom. In the end, it's a game that's so generic and devoid of fun that it actively 
 sucks the life out of you as you play it.  

           Emergency Heroes offers up a shocking vision of the future, in which humankind makes cities 
 entirely of highways. And tunnels.       

   

  You play as Zach Harper, an emergency hero in the city of San Alto. At the beginning of the game, 
 Zach is recovering from being forced out of the city's combined services after a training accident 
 killed one of his colleagues. Predictably, though, he's called back into action when a gang, led 
 by a mysterious figure, starts terrorising the city. You can probably guess the twist from that 
 description alone, but the story is so inconsequential that any spoilers are unlikely to impact 
 your enjoyment. Emergency Heroes features some of the most cliched plotting, one-dimensional characterisation, 
 and laughable dialogue ever to feature in a video game.  

  The gameplay itself is based entirely around driving, with no on-foot sections at all. You control 
 vehicles either by holding the Wii Remote on its side or by using one of the many Wii Wheel-style 
 peripherals, such as the one bundled with Mario Kart. The control method is functional, but the 
 vehicles suffer from poor turning circles, and it's a shame that there's no option to use a Nunchuk. 
 Even worse, all 12 vehicles handle the same, and even the smallest police car can smash a civilian 
 truck right off of the road. There's also no punishment for crashing into an endless amount of 
 innocent vehicles, which makes the game incredibly easy to play.  

  The story progresses through 40 preset missions, or "perils," as they're called in the game. However, 
 there are only a few different mission types, such as putting out fires, saving civilians, or inflicting 
 enough damage on an enemy car to knock it off of the road. This lack of variety quickly becomes 
 tiresome, and the city itself doesn't present any of the opportunities usually associated with 
 sandbox games. You might not earn a gold medal for every mission on your first try, but it's unlikely 
 that you'll actually fail one.  

  Given that this is an open-world game, you can spend some time driving around and taking in the 
 sights. The problem is that San Alto lacks the landmarks, pedestrians, and other points of interest 
 that might make you want to do so. All you have to look at is highway after tunnel after roundabout, 
 resulting in a city that's boring and sterile. Emergency Heroes is perhaps a more shocking dystopian 
 vision of the future than has been created by any number of science-fiction writers in the past. 
 There are also bugs and design issues in abundance. Your car bounces over other vehicles, the GPS 
 often points you in completely the wrong direction, and characters' heads pop up in the middle 
 of the screen and block your view of the road, for no other reason than to offer up another line 
 of meaningless dialogue.  

           Emergency Heroes is entirely devoid of artistic merit.       

   

  Although the 
 game itself is merely dull and repetitive, the overall presentation is on a whole different level 
 of bad. The futuristic comic-book style is reminiscent of Crackdown on the Xbox 360, but it doesn't 
 have that game's style or level of detail. The buildings all look the same, there are only a few 
 different vehicle types, and the character designs look cheaper and more generic than the lowest-budget 
 children's cartoon series. The music maintains a relentlessly fast tempo, but it fails to add drama 
 to the monotonous pace of the game. Furthermore, the voice work teeters on the so-bad-it's-good 
 level of amateurism. If you thought the House of the Dead series was laughably bad when it came 
 to acting in video games, then Emergency Heroes makes that series look like a Royal Shakespeare 
 Company production of Hamlet in comparison.  

  Though multiplayer modes help extend the longevity of the five-hour single-player game, they use 
 the same mission types and are unsurprisingly as repetitive with friends as they are alone. The 
 game supports two players via split-screen mode, and has seven multiplayer game modes in total 
 once you've unlocked them by playing through the single-player game. These games aren't improved 
 in any way by having another person involved, and there's no way to share your best times or play 
 with other people online.  

  Emergency Heroes is a bad game. It's lazy, boring, and repetitive, and won't even appeal to the 
 younger market that it's aimed at. The missions are dull, the driving is pedestrian, and the city 
 is restrictive. Although it's not fundamentally broken, Emergency Heroes is devoid of any artistic 
 merit and should be avoided at all costs.

Review:  Terrible terrible and double terrible the worst wii game i have. This game was supposed to be a 
 birthday gift for my little brother and i feel sorry for him now this game is soo bad that not 
 even chuck noris would be able to withstand thhe torture. Poor vioce graphics and sound makes it 
 a wanna be game which wanted to walk before it was even born!!! i say it should go to the electic 
 chair and then be shock 100 with a machine gun. The basics of the game is that you are was character 
 who ot fired and now you get your job back because the town needs saving. and you drive all these 
 different vehicles to save different people but they are all rigged to win so someone may say hurry 
 and you could leave it an hour and hear the person u are supposed to be saving plead the or it 
 is a figue 8 until you put out all the fires, the only mode you fail inis the car chases which 
 are one of the only 2 things that are actually kinda fun because you gotta bash the other cars 
 in their weeks spots like the ides or fron or back while in traffic. The other fun thing is multiplayer 
 which will only be fun until you and your uest find out that there is paint drying outside and 
 you would rather watch that than the game.
  
  This is a crummy game which can only be loved by half sighted moles on drugs and unless you are 
 a mole on drugs you may as well buy something like brain because if you are reading this reveiw 
 you are thinking off getting it and you do not want to buy this game if your life depended on it!!
