:::Review:::
SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 successfully returns to the fundamentals of intense, realistic WWE action 
 and impressive, easy-to-use creation tools. 

  In the WWE, it's not uncommon for upstart new wrestlers to suffer a few humiliating losses before 
 they earn their first victory. After a severely disappointing Wii debut last year, THQ's venerable 
 SmackDown vs. Raw series has returned to the ring, having spent the year bulking up and working 
 on the fundamentals. The work has paid off: There are more match types, the controls feel more 
 responsive, and there are two new single-player modes that complement the multiplayer fun nicely. 
 Though it's still hampered by a number of lingering issues, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 shows that 
 the series can be a contender on the Wii.  

           In this scene, your remote plays the part of Chavo's head.      

  The most notable 
 improvements are in the single-player realm. The lackluster Main Event mode has been ditched in 
 favor of a lengthy Career mode and the scripted Road to Wrestlemania. In the Career mode, you choose 
 a superstar (existing or created) and enter a bracket to make a bid for the title belt. Each bracket 
 has five opponents, including the current champion, and you'll have to earn stars by winning matches 
 to get a shot at the title. You win up to five stars for each match by earning points in three 
 areas: match results, technical, and excitement. These categories encourage you to get into the 
 WWE superstar mindset by rewarding you for both pummeling and mocking your opponent. At the end 
 of each match, your attributes will increase, and your health will replenish automatically based 
 on how the match went -- no micromanagement here. You'll also earn amusing awards for things such 
 as striking your opponent 35 times or breaking a barbed-wire-wrapped plank over his or her back. 
 It takes only a handful of successful matches to earn you a title shot, which is great because 
 it keeps your career moving along at a good clip. This action-packed Career mode is the perfect 
 complement to the Create a Superstar mode, and winning belt after belt as you bulk up your created 
 character is satisfying and fun.  

  The other single-player mode, Road to Wrestlemania, features six unique story arcs that let you 
 play as various WWE superstars (including The Undertaker and Triple H) and defeat numerous foes 
 (and a few nemeses) on your quest for Wrestlemania glory. Matches are interspersed with story scenes 
 packed with typical WWE action, so fans of outrageous melodrama will be pleased. In keeping with 
 traditional SmackDown vs. RAW strengths, the superstar models and entrances are impressive, but 
 these stand in stark contrast to the crowds that, though fine from a distance, look like Nintendo 
 64 rejects up close. Character animations are quite good, though they are prone to clipping and 
 still lack fluidity when maneuvering around the ring. The audio remains a weak point, dampening 
 the hard-hitting action, and though the dismal announcers from years past have been improved quite 
 a bit, the sound design is still in need of an upgrade.  

  Despite how it may sound, the action is indeed hard-hitting. Flicking the remote executes punches, 
 kicks, and the like, and doing so while holding A will trigger a simple grapple. Holding B and 
 flicking the remote results in a strong grapple, one that requires you to move the remote when 
 prompted to fully execute the move. Usually this can be accomplished by merely flailing the remote 
 briefly (or sometimes doing nothing at all) , but if you're more technically inclined, you can follow 
 the onscreen prompts to do specific moves. These prompts also crop up when you perform a signature 
 or finishing move. The camera adjusts to a cinematic angle and the action slows down as you grab, 
 punch, elbow, kick, or slam your opponent by swinging the remote. Giving your foe Triple H's Pedigree 
 is so much more satisfying when you can swing the remote up to lift him or her into the air, and 
 then swing it down to send him or her crashing to the floor. The motion-sensitive controls also 
 generate some extra excitement during character entrances, which are now interactive and let you 
 throw up your arms in triumph or gesture to the crowd. There is still some imprecision to deal 
 with, especially during uninterruptible animations, but overall the control scheme feels much improved 
 and the motion controls spice things up nicely.  

           Just because they're pretty doesn't mean they won't hurt people.      

  The wide variety 
 of new match types range from ladder and table contests to a 30-man Royal Rumble, and cover everything 
 in between. The under-the-mat arsenal is much improved, offering such implements as kendo sticks, 
 sledgehammers, and fire extinguishers. Larger matches can get a bit tricky because the camera sometimes 
 seems confused as to how to frame the action, and it's possible to walk off the screen in tag-team 
 battles. Regardless, these improvements are a welcome change from last year's barren offering. 

  In addition to the Career and Road to Wrestlemania modes, the competent AI and unique wrestler 
 abilities make playing single-player much more appealing in SmackDown vs. Raw 2009. No longer content 
 to stand around drooling, computer opponents will actively attack you, tag their partners (you 
 included) , and use environmental elements reasonably well. Though the Road to Wrestlemania and 
 early stages of the Career mode will seem easy to experienced players, it won't feel like you're 
 playing against brainless apes. There are also new, unique wrestler abilities that existing superstars 
 have and created superstars can earn. The effects range from attribute boosts (the ability to remove 
 the belt in a ladder match more quickly) to enhanced abilities (the ability to regenerate a small 
 amount of health) . Although these abilities aren't particularly powerful, they can come in handy 
 during tight matches.  

  You might not have tight matches against the computer, but you are sure to find tough competition 
 online. You can use SmackDown, Raw, ECW, or created superstars as you face off against friends 
 or strangers in any of the match types that support one to four players. (Six-man matches and Royal 
 Rumbles are available locally only.) Against tougher players, any miscues due to bad position or 
 odd animation are likely to cost you dearly, and once your opponent has you on the ropes, you'll 
 be hard-pressed to reverse your way out of them. You'll also find yourself frantically spinning 
 the analog stick a lot; it's the ill-conceived and thumb-fatiguing way to make you recover quickly. 
 Impressively, the matches are generally lag-free, though you might have trouble filling a four-man 
 match during odd hours.  

           Which one is uglier?      

  Of course, SmackDown vs. Raw wouldn't be itself without the still-impressive Create a Superstar 
 tool. Once again, with a little time and patience, you can create almost anyone you like, from 
 famous celebrities to hideous abominations. You can then customize your character's move set to 
 craft a fighting style and choreograph your ring entrance to truly strut your stuff.  

  WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 benefits greatly by increasing its scope. You can now participate in 
 almost any type of match your heart desires, and even pull a wider variety of weapons from under 
 the mat. The new single-player modes offer hours of entertainment, and online play further extends 
 replayability. The tweaked motion controls add an extra bit of excitement to the proceedings, and 
 though some elements still need improvement, SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 is ultimately successful because 
 it embraces the dramatic fights and outrageous showmanship that are the heart and soul of the WWE.

Review:  This time the wii version of the game has all the match types, but elimination chamber. There is 
 no Casket match in any version of the game. When you are entering the ring you can control your 
 superstar and choose which taunt to do in any given time. This part is highly addictive and each 
 set of taunts is individual to all characters.
  This time there is an online mode and it is pretty good. Nothing much to say on that.
  The bad 
 point on it is that there there is no create a finisher. Why advertise the game on create a finisher 
 when the wii version doesn't have it. The ds version doesn't have it either, as i also have that 
 version of the game.
  Also there is only one control scheme, what i say they should do is put up another control scheme 
 like in Super Smash Bros Brawl, where you can use the wii remote tilted and only press buttons 
 to play aswell as what they have now.
  Everyhting is good. They have the tagteam features from what i can see and they have road to wrestlemania. 
 For some stupid reason you can't run, thq/konami are pretty stupid.
  Overall this is a good game.

Review:  First thing is first if you were unlucky enough to pay good money for the previous attempt (Smack 
 down vs Raw 2008 on wii) then I'm sorry you wasted your money, but this game is a completely different 
 and enjoyable experience.
  
  SvsR 09 is a complete 180 on the previous trash that attempted for the wii. In this version the 
 movements has been tightened and the overall game has much more longevity and fun experiences to 
 be had. 
  
  You can start this with a little exhibition match to get the feel and the game gives you a general 
 tutorial of how to get around a ring and inflict harm on your opponent. There are a number of match 
 types to chose from ranging from old fashioned 1 on 1 fair play wrestling to 6 men money in the 
 bank with anything goes and everything in between. Basically any type of mach that in the WWE at 
 the moment is a playable match in this game. 
  
  Once you get the lay of the land you can go to create-a-wrestler (or CAW) (which if I remember 
 correctly was omitted from the previous 2008 version) CAW in this game has everything you would 
 come to expect as standard. You have pretty much complete control over every thickness, placement, 
 height, colour, shape... of every part of the body head and face. You have 100's of clothing options 
 to chose from when you think of adding shirts, tights, belts, shorts etc. With enough time and 
 effort you could possibly construct any person you liked, which goes a long way to describing the 
 character appearance in the game. Once you get your wrestler looking schmick you can go through 
 a ton of moves to assign and then fiddle with an entrance. 
  
  Once you return to the main menu you will find many crevices you can go for editing. You can change 
 titles as you see fit, move wrestlers between brands, turn them dirty or clean and partner members 
 up in tag or alliance teams. The career mode allows you to go through a traditional style career 
 were your CAW begins his journey to battle his way to the top whilst gaining experience and improving 
 stats. The other journey in the game is the "Road to Wrestlemania" where you choose from a selection 
 of wrestlers and go on a path with good storylines and real wrestler voice over's. Through a combination 
 of these 2 game modes there are a heap of unlockable's but you can find cheats on this site that 
 do the hard work for you.
  
  Graphically it is better than the first one. At times the wrestlers look as close to real as anything 
 you would see on the wii. The moves are put together in a much cleaner view and the entrances are 
 interactive and good to watch
  
  Gameplay. Simply put 1000 times better then the first one. You can actually control your wrestler 
 around the ring and interact with people and objects with minimal difficulty. There are still some 
 issues with the way some actions are carried out but overall the fun you have isn't held back by 
 controller issues. Having said that there still seems like a great deal of room for improvement 
 with some aspects of play. Running around isn't an easy thing since you can't run unless your attacking 
 or outside the ring with your opponent a fair bit away from you. You can't stand on the apron, 
 you just move in and out of the ring. there seems like space on the controller set up to get some 
 more variety in your moves list when it comes to corner, and special scenario type moves (I don't 
 know what I mean but I know it seems like in a situation I want to do something but I can't) . If 
 you think back to wrestlemania 2000 if you ever owned that on the N64 (great game) you would know 
 how much total control you felt over your wrestler in this it doesn't feel like you have total 
 control of what is going on.
  
  Sound is awesome. Good real commentary with all the crew especially good ol JR and Jerry 'the king" 
 Lawler. Good real wrestlers speaking in the story modes. The music is good with the entrances and 
 the sound FX are also great. 
  
  There is much more that could be mentioned about this game like huge weapon lists, slow motion 
 finishers being cool, post match ability to be celebrate or beat down on your fallen opponent but 
 this is long enough already
  
  Bottom line: if you like wrestling this game will satisfy your needs if all you have is a wii. 
 If the same amount of improvement is continued SvsR 2010 should be an instant classic in the wrestling 
 genre and might be worth the wait to buy if you can hold out till its probable release

Review:  So Smackdown Vs. Raw 2009 is overall a great game. I love the wifi, story mode, multiplayer mode, 
 create a superstar and entrance. Even though the Wii version is missing some features that the 
 PS3 and Xbox 360 it is still a great game. The wifi is a blast, I could play that forever if i 
 wanted to. Story mode (Road to Wrestlemania) is very interactive and has great stories even though 
 there are only a few. Multiplayer mode is very fun as well. My friends and family and I play all 
 they time. We make our own customized superstars and we fight. Create a superstar and entrance 
 mode is pretty great too. The only thing is that Create an entrance is limited. Another thing that 
 I did not like is that the graphics of the superstars and the audience could have been better (more 
 realistic) . One thing that makes me mad is when you are in a wifi match and if you are just about 
 to win, every 10 matches your opponent will disconnect so you do not get the win which is a drag. 
 Just look out for if they have a high disconnection rate. In conclusion this game is tons of fun 
 and will keep you busy till Smackdown Vs. Raw 2010 is released.

Review:  WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 was a huge dissapointment. I read reviews and rented the game to see 
 if it was true. Now 1 year later THQ turned what was bad game into a very good game.
  
  Graphics: The graphics are OK but I'd like too see better graphics rather than ported PS2 graphics. (Game 
 best displayed in 16:9)
  
  Gameplay: The gameplay is very fun. You control what your superstar does in Ultimate Control grapples 
 and some moves lead into others.
  
  Story: Road To Wrestlemania was Extremely fun to play especially the Mysterio/Batista Story. There 
 are 7 storys to complete which have their own bonuses and stories.
  
  New to the series is Online Mode aka Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Here you can get updates (supposedly) 
 and play against friends or random people in matches. There is a problem with online. The lag makes 
 the game read your motions a second later. If you learn how to time your moves you should have 
 no problem playing. Thanks for reading my brief review of WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2009 for the Wii

Review:  I bought this game the other day thinking I was going to be disappointed and already had plans 
 to get a refund like last year. So I start playing it and I'm amazing at the match types they put 
 in because I only thought there would be steel cage matches and ladder matches but know there's 
 TLC and hell in a cell and best of all ECW extreme rules including fire and thumbtacks under the 
 steel steps. The actual gameplay has slightly changed allowing better control and more moves although 
 you can't run unless your attacking and it's difficult to get in and out of the ring at times which 
 sucks if your playing tactically.
  
  So in general I'm glad that THQ actually decided to make a wrestling game this year unlike last 
 years demo, however being a Wii game its been stripped down a bit like no inferno match or create 
 a finisher which really annoys me, if the PSP can fit this onto a UMD why in the blue hell cant 
 the developers put it on a Wii disc???? But apart form the things I mentioned the Wii version is 
 basically the same game as the PS2 version i. e. road to wrestlemania, career and tournament modes, 
 and all the same superstars. Plus it has online play (which is good but lags a little) and interactive 
 entrances and victory scenes which are good but I could live with out them. Overall this is ten 
 times better than last years but it still can improve so I'm hoping downloadable content will become 
 available, if not hears looking forward to the next year's instalment!!!!!!!!

Review:  there no real story line to have fun with what the **** up with that. in carrier mode you should 
 at least be able to to more outside of the ring like backstage confrontations. road to wrestlemania 
 is OK but i would like to see you able to use any superstar instead of the ones they pick for you. 
 tournament mode is great is the same as 08 with was really good there. the part i have most is 
 that there is no Create a finisher on the wii version. they were hyping about it but were is it 
 on the wii version it's not there. if it was going to be one of there big things of the 2009 version 
 then why didn't they put it in the wii version. one big thing i hate about it is that they left 
 many of the legends out. like stone cold, piper, the rock, hulk hogan, but they manage to put rick 
 flair in it by unlocking him with a code.
